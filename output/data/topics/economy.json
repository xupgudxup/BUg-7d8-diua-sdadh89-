    "description": "Miami, Seattle, and Dallas are shaping the new creator economy landscape as influencers spread out from LA and NY.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood remains the world's entertainment nexus, but many next-gen creators have decided they don't need a Los Angeles address to make it big.\n\nMiami, Las Vegas, and Seattle all attract more top Instagram influencers per capita than LA, according to new research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm.\n\nThe top two by total creator count were LA (over 12,000) and New York (nearly 11,000), followed by Miami (about 6,000).\n\nOther major creator communities have formed in established film markets, such as Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas, which have emerged due to their lower cost of living and production tax incentives. But other top creator cities — Seattle, Las Vegas, Philadelphia — lie outside those secondary film markets.\n\nThe ability to create content for social platforms from anywhere means creators can build a livelihood from just about anywhere. Talent managers say that, apart from when they want a creator to attend an in-person event, brands rarely request a city-specific creator when seeking a partner.\n\n\"You do have people in LA and New York making the lion's share of the dollars. But now they're increasing everywhere else,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. \"Eventually, there will be a hot influencer in Idaho.\"\n\nLooking at cities by concentration of creators, Miami comes in No. 1, outranking LA and NYC.\n\nSome creators are drawn to places that already have a robust creative community, like Nashville or Las Vegas. Others want to be near fashion and retail, which fuels a lot of the creator economy. LTK, a major e-commerce platform that connects influencers to shoppers, is based in Dallas, as was Neiman Marcus for a long time. Dude Perfect, a superstar creator group known for sports-focused stunt videos, is based in nearby Frisco. Miami, where Alix Earle gained social media fame and often appears, experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes.\n\nCreators also move to be near family and for a lower cost of living. It makes sense for people building a brand based on themselves to work in areas that reflect their identity. The biggest YouTuber by subscriber count, Jimmy Donaldson, a.k.a. MrBeast, chose his hometown of Greenville, NC, as his base.\n\nDude Perfect has recently embarked on a major expansion in Texas. CEO Andrew Yaffe said there's no need to be in LA with access to top brands and talent there.\n\n\"We'll be here as far in the future as we can see,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"There's no shortage of opportunity for us here.\"\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.",

    "description": "ETH Zurich researchers have developed a process that can be used on site to render environmental toxins such as DDT and lindane harmless and convert them into valuable chemicals – a breakthrough for the remediation of contaminated sites and a sustainable circular economy.",
    "fullText": "Persistent organic pollutants such as DDT and lindane still pollute the environment and affect humans decades after their use.\n\nETH researchers have developed a new electrochemical process that completely dehalogenates these long-lived toxins and converts them into valuable industrial chemicals.\n\nThe method uses cheap equipment, prevents side reactions and could be used on contaminated landfills, soils or sludge.\n\nMobile systems could be used on site in the future – an important step towards the remediation of contaminated sites and the creation of a sustainable circular economy.\n\nThey were once considered miracle workers – insecticides such as lindane or DDT were produced and used millions of times during the 20th century. But what was hailed as progress led to a global environmental catastrophe: persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are so chemically stable that they remain in soil, water and organisms for decades. They accumulate in the fatty tissue of animals and thus enter the human food chain. Many of these substances were banned long ago, but their traces can still be found today – even in human blood.\n\nHow to remediate such contaminated sites, be they soils, bodies of water or landfills, is one of the major unresolved questions of environmental protection. How can highly stable poisons be rendered harmless without creating new problems? Researchers at ETH Zurich, led by Bill Morandi, Professor of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, have now found a promising approach. Using an innovative electrochemical method, they are not only able to break down these long-lived pollutants but also to convert them into valuable raw materials for the chemical industry.\n\nA key distinction between this and previous work is that the carbon skeleton of the pollutants is recycled and made reusable, while the halide component is sequestered as a harmless inorganic salt. “The previous methods were also energetically inefficient,” says Patrick Domke, a doctoral student in Morandi’s group. He explains: “The processes were expensive and still led to outcomes that were harmful to the environment.”\n\nTogether with electrochemistry specialist Alberto Garrido-Castro, a former postdoc in this group, Domke developed a process that renders the pollutants in question completely harmless. During this project, the two researchers were able to draw on the many years of experience of ETH professor Morandi, who has been working on the transformation of such compounds for years. “The key advance of this new technology is the use of alternating current to sequester the problematic halogen atoms as innocuous salts such as NaCl (table salt), while still generating valuable hydrocarbons,” says Morandi.\n\nElectrolysis enables almost complete dehalogenation of pollutants under mild, environmentally friendly and cost-effective conditions. It cleaves the stable carbon-halogen bonds, leaving behind only harmless salts such as table salt and useful hydrocarbons such as benzene, diphenylethane or cyclododecatriene. These are actually sought-after intermediates in the chemical industry, for example, for plastics, varnishes, coatings and pharmaceutical applications. In this way, the technology not only contributes to the remediation of contaminated sites but also to the sustainable circular economy.\n\n“What makes our process so special from a technical point of view is that we supply electricity using alternating current, similar to the electrical waveform delivered to households. It is one of the most cost-effective resources in chemistry,” explains Garrido-Castro. “Alternating current protects the electrodes from wear, which is why we can reuse them for many subsequent electrolysis cycles. In addition, the alternating current suppresses unwanted side reactions and the formation of poisonous chlorine gas, allowing the pollutant’s halogen atoms to be fully converted to inorganic salts.” The reactor used by the researchers consists of an undivided electrolysis cell in which dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used as a solvent – itself a by-product of the pulp process in paper production.\n\nThe process can be applied not only to pure substances but also to mixtures from contaminated soils. Soil or sludge can therefore be treated without pre-treatment or further separation processes. A prototype of the reactor has already been successfully tested on classic environmental toxins such as lindane and DDT. “Our system is mobile and can be assembled on site. This eliminates the need to transport these hazardous substances,” explains Domke.\n\nOn 27 November 2025 at ETH Zurich @ Open-i, ETH Zurich will award the Spark Award for the best invention of the year for the 14th time. The criteria for this award are originality, patent strength and market potential.\n\nSpark Award ceremony, Industry Day @ Open-i, Thursday, 27 November 2025, 1.30 p.m., Zurich Convention Center.

    "description": "FaZe Clan's influencer exodus exposes a key risk for creator-economy companies that rely directly on talent to make money.",
    "fullText": "The creator economy gives, and it can also take — suddenly. That's one lesson behind the abrupt exodus of talent from the esports and marketing company FaZe Clan last week.\n\nBuilding a business led by an influencer or celebrity can make you a boatload of money. Just ask the teams behind Kim Kardashian's Skims or George Clooney's Casamigos tequila, which both crossed $1 billion in value.\n\nBut starting a company where the product you're selling is the influencer — such that you make money primarily from their social-media reach, content, or ability to do brand deals — can be risky.\n\nIf a YouTuber or TikTok creator loses popularity due to a scandal or a sudden algorithm change, the revenue dries up. If they become burned out from posting or simply decide they no longer want to work with an intermediary company, then poof!\n\nThat's the situation FaZe Clan appears to have found itself in this week after all six creators its website listed as its talent roster announced they were leaving the company in separate posts on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nCompany investor Matt Kalish, who cofounded DraftKings, told Bloomberg that the current financial structure of FaZe Clan is \"unsustainable\" and he had offered talent the option to go independent or sign deals with his company, HardScope, which they declined.\n\nFaZe Clan acknowledged the departures in its own post on X, writing that \"this era of FaZe\" had \"come to a close.\" With its most famous talent gone and their millions of followers in tow, the company is leaning into its esports business that makes money from league participation, player transfer fees, and IP licensing.\n\nFounded in 2010, FaZe Clan started as a group of friends who enjoyed making gaming videos. The group amassed millions of fans and began making revenue through brand deals. FaZe Clan went public in 2022, sharing in investor filings that it pulled in tens of millions of dollars in revenue from brand sponsorships and other advertising tied to its content. Other business lines, such as consumer products or esports, represented a smaller piece of the pie.\n\nFaZe Clan, when it was still reporting its revenue sources as a public company in 2022 and 2023, relied heavily on brand deals and YouTube ads to make money.\n\nFaZe Clan's stock plummeted in value during its first year trading on the Nasdaq. After cutting about 20% of its staff in early 2023, the company sold itself to gaming and marketing firm GameSquare in March 2024. GameSquare later sold FaZe Clan's media business in multiple transactions to Kalish and others, while retaining the esports business.\n\nThe sudden departure of FaZe's creators — and its struggle in recent years — highlights a key risk that should keep any creator-economy CEO up at night. Being overly reliant on specific creators or revenue sources can be a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe solution: diversify, diversify, diversify.\n\nFaZe Clan, GameSquare, and HardScope did not respond to requests for comment.",

A car drops 20% to 30% in value the second you drive it off the lot, he explained, turning thousands of dollars into dust—for nothing but \"that new car smell.\" And leasing? \"Leasing is the absolute worst,\" he said. \"You're renting a depreciating asset… You gave the dealership thousands of dollars for the privilege of borrowing their car.\"\n\nHis advice is brutal but simple: \"Buy a three-year-old certified pre-owned car.

That's not a splurge. It's financial self-sabotage.\n\nThe average American spends nearly $4,000 a year eating out, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

    "description": "AI in the workplace may boost speed and efficiency, but risks eroding confidence and critical thinking, the CEO of a digital economy think tank said.",
    "fullText": "AI appears to be making workers faster, more efficient, and more productive on paper.\n\nHowever, according to Mehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, which advises companies and governments on building the data centers that power AI, it may also be quietly eroding workers' confidence in their job skills.\n\nParyavi told Buisness Insider that excessive and poorly designed AI use in workplaces is driving what he called a \"quiet cognitive erosion\" and \"down-skilling.\"\n\n\"There used to be a notion called 'thinking outside the box,'\" he said. \"That notion will soon cease to exist when everyone draws on all their creativity, analytics, and innovation from a single box called AI.\"\n\nParyavi believes the most immediate casualty of heavy AI reliance is self-belief.\n\n\"If you come to believe that AI writes better than you and thinks smarter than you, you will lose your own confidence in yourself,\" he said.\n\nParyavi said the loss of confidence compounds quickly as workers begin deferring writing, analysis, and judgment to AI systems, gradually relying less on the skills they have built through years of reading, writing, learning, and observation.\n\n\"All of a sudden, you realize you are not good enough without this new tool, and day by day, you rely less on yourself and more on AI,\" he said.\n\nResearch is beginning to reflect that pattern. A new report from the Work AI Institute, produced with researchers from universities including Notre Dame, Harvard, and UC Santa Barbara, found that AI is turning ordinary office workers into people who feel smarter and more productive while their underlying skills slowly erode.\n\nRebecca Hinds, head of the Work AI Institute, told Business Insider that AI creates an illusion of expertise, which is especially risky for early-career employees who still need to establish their foundations.\n\nMuch of the problem, Paryavi said, lies in how leaders define productivity.\n\nAI's biggest promise is speed — faster reports, faster launches, faster analysis. But faster doesn't always mean better, Paryavi said.\n\nWhile AI can generate professional-sounding output, Paryavi said it often lacks the depth that comes from years of hands-on expertise.\n\nThat loss of depth is already visible, according to Anastasia Berg, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has said that workers who rely heavily on AI risk rapid skill atrophy, especially junior employees who never fully learn how to think through problems independently.\n\nParyavi isn't opposed to AI. He said the risk comes from indiscriminate use.\n\nCompanies should tailor AI access by job function, he said, rather than rolling it out universally. Some roles may benefit heavily from AI support, while others should rely primarily on human judgment.\n\nHe also discussed the importance of human involvement at both ends of the workflow — leading creative thinking at the beginning and quality-checking AI output at the end.\n\n\"What's critical to note is that you, the human you, must quality check AI, not the other way around,\" he said.\n\nAI may not eliminate jobs outright. But without deliberate limits, Paryavi said, it could quietly erode the confidence and thinking skills that careers are built on.\n\n\"How much technology do we really need, and how far are we willing to push the envelope? How much is enough?\" he said.",

    "description": "Japan's aging workforce, labor shortages, and government policies show how the country has adapted as 30% of its population is over 65.",
    "fullText": "While traversing the narrow, winding roads outside the Japanese town of Fujikawaguchiko, I stopped by a farm with a view of Mount Fuji, where a few locals were picking fruit. Most were older, and one was walking with a cane as she bent down to put berries into a bag.\n\nAt an udon shop, drivers and construction workers — some of whom looked to be in their 60s — were slurping noodles. The server said she knew people who have owned nearby restaurants and shops for decades.\n\nAfter settling back at Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, I noticed that the older workers I had encountered in the city worked as crossing guards, cleaners, gift shop owners, taxi drivers, or wholesale workers. Only a handful of the older Tokyoites I observed were wearing the white-collar uniform of suits and ties.\n\nWhen I visited Japan in early December, I had just finished the capstone story of my 80 Over 80 series, the most in-depth look at America's older workers that I know of in modern press or academia. In the months prior, I interviewed nearly 200 Americans working past 80 in dozens of professions. I discovered that nearly 550,000 Americans in this demographic work, according to Census data, and the number is expected to continue increasing as the US workforce ages and the cost of living rises. In interviews, dozens of American researchers said government benefits fall short for millions of older Americans each year, adding that the US could look to countries like Japan for inspiration.\n\nJapan, like many of its neighbors, has experienced rapid aging over the last few decades. Nearly 30% of Japan's population is 65 and older, the highest of any country, according to government data. About one in four in this demographic works, meaning that about one in seven Japanese workers is 65 and older.\n\nComparatively, this demographic comprises about 18% of the US population, and roughly one in five works. The US has not aged as rapidly as East Asia, although increased longevity and lower birth rates have propelled aging enough that by 2030, the Census Bureau projects there will be more Americans 65 and older than under 18.\n\nJapan has adapted in many ways to its hyper-aging population. Its government has actively supported older worker employment, especially among older women. Seven researchers studying aging workforces in Japan and South Korea told Business Insider that keeping older workers employed at higher levels has helped both countries mitigate economic disaster and severe labor shortages.\n\nThe Japanese case is much different from the US, though, some researchers said. While the US will continue to experience lower growth rates, the workforce is unlikely to decline as much due to aging, assuming that comparatively higher fertility rates and immigration levels hold steady or rise. The desire to hire younger people is often stronger in the US than in Japan, though the US also has a younger population. The US also lacks a comprehensive healthcare system like Japan's, with worse general health metrics.\n\nResearchers agreed Japan still has a long way to go in supporting its aging workers and preparing mid-career workers for a stable retirement. For the US, Japan may offer a different glimpse into what an older workforce can look like.\n\nJapan is often the first country many think about when discussing aging. It boasts the world's highest number of centenarians per capita and advocates for active lifestyles, healthier diets, and reliable healthcare.\n\nMany older Japanese people work in manufacturing and retail, with an increasing number in service roles, construction, and medical-related services. America's oldest workers also frequently worked in these professions, particularly construction and education, according to Business Insider's analysis of Census Bureau data.\n\nJapan has mandated that companies provide more employment opportunities for workers aged 65 and above through its Act on Stabilization of Employment of Elderly Persons. Legislation has encouraged companies to offer work opportunities until the age of 70, while former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida committed one trillion yen over five years for reskilling efforts.\n\nJapan also has Silver Human Resource Centers, which provide part-time work and skills training for older people, as well as the government's Lifetime Employment Support Office.\n\nThe World Economic Forum notes that 80% of Japanese workers hope to continue working in some capacity after retirement. Some companies have implemented policies that enable workers to extend their retirement age and offer promotions and salary increases beyond 60. Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provides employers with subsidies if they can convert older contract workers to permanent jobs.\n\nJacob Funk Kierkegaard, a nonresident senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued in a paper from April that Japan has alleviated many potentially disastrous economic outcomes of hyper-aging. Kierkegaard told Business Insider that despite Japan's unique socioeconomic and aging circumstances, the country may be a model for its neighbors, as it raised female employment levels, expanded immigration pathways, and became more integrated with foreign economies.\n\n\"In many ways, the Japanese labor market was always much more receptive to the idea of employing workers at high ages because they tend to be healthy and motivated and do the type of service-sector jobs that you could do at a high age,\" Kierkegaard said.\n\nJapan isn't without its challenges, though.\n\n\"Even if Japan has done better than any other country, it doesn't mean that older workers in Japan have the same labor force participation or earnings potential as does prime-age workers,\" Kierkegaard said.\n\nMany older Japanese workers are employed in low-wage jobs, as many companies remain reluctant to hire older workers for higher-paid positions. Much like in the US, many Japanese companies assume older workers require more training and costs. Japan's hierarchical workplace structure also means it's often harder for an older worker to climb the ranks.\n\nPopulation aging contributes to critical labor shortages, according to Haruki Seitani, an economist at the International Monetary Fund and coauthor of a working paper on aging and AI in Japan. His research found that as Japan's labor force ages, productivity growth at work falls.\n\nMany older Japanese workers earn money out of necessity, said Yasuo Takao, a political scientist at Curtin University in Australia. Government survey data shows that over half of older Japanese workers were predominantly motivated by money, compared to under 16% who worked to feel fulfilled.\n\nJapan has struggled to expand employment among its older population, he said. Many companies are incentivized to \"retire\" their older workers, then rehire them at lower pay, which Takao said discourages them from \"remaining fully engaged.\"\n\n\"Japan's wage structure is harsh for older workers because it is built on an aging seniority system that inflates wages in mid-career and then resets them sharply at retirement age to control labour costs,\" Takao said.\n\nTakao said that older Japanese work at rising rates because labor shortages sometimes force firms to retain workers. Each year, more people leave the workforce than enter, and the working-age population has declined by over 10 million since 1995. Projections put the labor shortage at upwards of 6.4 million by 2030, and many companies have opted to automate tasks or give employees more work instead of hiring older workers.\n\nPension reforms have also made work more imperative for some older workers. Japan has a two-tier mandatory public pension system that relies on contributions, which is \"highly sensitive to population aging,\" Takao said.\n\nOlder Japanese workers tend to put in fewer hours compared to their younger peers, although this may be partly due to cuts in pension benefits that apply if they exceed a specific threshold.\n\n\"If Japan can transition from quantity-driven senior employment to quality-driven, skill-aligned senior employment, it stands to gain a powerful long-term demographic dividend: higher productivity, lower fiscal strain, stronger innovation capacity and a healthier, more engaged older population,\" Takao said. \"In this sense, treating older workers as a source of economic strength, not a cost to be managed, may be one of Japan's most important growth strategies in the decades ahead.\"\n\nJapan's approach to managing its aging workforce — and its shortcomings — can offer some valuable insights into what the US can do.\n\nTakao said the US can avoid the \"Japan trap\" of older workers needing to work by acting earlier to expand phased-retirement opportunities and protect older workers' earnings. Takao added that the US should invest earlier in training and job redesign so that older workers can secure jobs that match their skill sets.\n\nAbout 40% of female Japanese workers of all ages hold part-time jobs, compared to about a quarter of US female workers, and this rate increases with age. The US can learn from this discrepancy by providing more assistance to women who want to hold steady employment during their parenting and caregiving years.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Japan may be a cautionary tale. Japan has a relatively low exposure to AI, as determined by usage rate, compared to the US and China. Seitani said that AI could help aging-related labor shortages in occupations like transportation services, construction, and clerical work. Long-term, this could mean older workers may be less pressured to stay on the job or may have more flexible hours.\n\nAdditionally, the research suggests limited mobility between jobs with high and low AI exposure among Japanese occupations. The US can do more to promote technological education for older workers to improve their work outcomes.\n\nKierkegaard said many countries may have to adjust their lower retirement ages and more robust safety nets as they age, so older residents aren't as reliant on the social safety net, which might crumble if the demand exceeds the available resources.\n\n\"Ultimately, Japan's experience shows that aging societies require more than labor-supply fixes. They demand a broader redesign of pensions, work norms, care systems and urban infrastructure,\" Takao said. \"The United States still has time to adapt, but the window for proactive reform is narrowing.\"",

    "description": "Bankruptcies are suddenly everywhere, from billion-dollar giants to small businesses to individuals. Experts are stumped at the breadth of industries.",
    "fullText": "Bankruptcies aren't just rising — they're suddenly everywhere.\n\nFrom billion-dollar giants to mom-and-pop shops to everyday individuals, bankruptcies are piling up across the US this year, with large corporate bankruptcies already hitting their highest level in 15 years.\n\nThe surge in bankruptcies highlights the growing financial pressures facing consumers and companies as costs climb amid a tougher borrowing environment.\n\n\"Rising costs, tighter credit conditions, and ongoing geopolitical volatility continue to exert pressure on households and businesses already facing financial strain,\" Amy Quackenboss, the executive director at the American Bankruptcy Institute, said earlier this month.\n\nUnlike past downturns, this wave of bankruptcies appears to be hitting nearly every corner of the economy. It's sweeping across a range of sectors in what one veteran bankruptcy attorney described as a strikingly \"unusual\" pattern.\n\nTypically, corporate failures tend to be \"industry sticky,\" meaning they cluster within the same sectors, Robert Stark, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick and chair of its bankruptcy and corporate restructuring practice group, recently told Business Insider.\n\nIn 2022, for example, he said there was the \"big crypto winter\" culminating in a string of cryptocurrency firm bankruptcies, including Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX.\n\n\"That was a sticky event — a lot in the industry kind of went through bankruptcy at the same time,\" Stark said. \"What we have now, which is the thing that I find kind of interesting, is I don't see as much stickiness as I'm used to seeing.\"\n\n\"Bankruptcies seem to be kind of all over the place,\" added Stark, who represents creditor groups in the 2025 bankruptcies of auto parts company First Brands and fintech startup Linqto, as well as the equity committee in the Chapter 11 case of genetic testing company 23andMe.\n\nStark said that he can't pinpoint a clear cause for the \"broad smattering of industries\" now in bankruptcy, but he called it \"unusual\" in his 30 years of experience and \"shockingly so.\"\n\nMajor corporate bankruptcies this year have included hospitality company Sonder, Spirit Airlines, Del Monte Foods, retailer Claire's, and CVS Health subsidiary Omnicare. Each, in court filings, listed more than $1 billion in liabilities, placing them among the largest bankruptcies of 2025.\n\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, which tracks public and private companies of a certain size, bankruptcy filings climbed to 717 through November, topping last year's tally of 687.\n\nEven without December figures, 2025 has already logged the highest annual count for large corporate bankruptcies since 2010, when filings totaled 828, according to S&P Global.\n\nData from the intelligence firm shows that the industrials sector was the most distressed through November, with 110 companies filing for bankruptcy. The consumer discretionary sector followed with 85 bankruptcy filings, and healthcare was next up with 46 firms filing.\n\nThe spike in bankruptcies extends well beyond the corporate sphere, with an increasing number of small businesses also filing for bankruptcy, data shows.\n\nSmall businesses carrying $3,024,725 or less in secured and unsecured debt have the option to file for bankruptcy under Subchapter V of Chapter 11, which offers a more streamlined reorganization process.\n\nData from Epiq Bankruptcy Analytics shows Subchapter V filings, made by small firms and individuals, at more than 2,300 year-to-date through mid-December — a nearly 10% increase from the same period last year.\n\nIn November alone, Subchapter V bankruptcy filings totaled 223 — a 23% bump from the previous year, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, which cited data from Epiq.\n\nIn addition to big and small businesses, individual bankruptcies have also increased amid rising costs.\n\nIndividual bankruptcy filings saw an 8% jump to 40,973 in November 2025, up from the 37,814 filings in November 2024, the data cited by ABI shows.\n\nLast month, there were 25,329 individual filings for Chapter 7, known as \"clean slate\" or liquidation bankruptcy, up 11% from the 22,871 filings recorded in November 2024.\n\nIndividual filings for Chapter 13, also called a \"wage earner's plan\" to repay all or part of someone's debts, accounted for 15,558 in November 2025, a 5% jump over the 14,865 filings in November last year, according to the data cited by ABI.\n\n\"For debt-burdened families and companies, bankruptcy remains a critical pathway to restore stability and rebuild toward a stronger financial future,\" Quackenboss, the ABI executive director, said.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 27 (Reuters) - China passed a revised law that for the first time formally regulates unmanned aircraft, a move set to reshape the country's ​fast-growing drone and low-altitude economy sectors, according to state media on Saturday.\n\nThe Standing ‌Committee of the National People's Congress approved the changes under the Civil Aviation Law on December 27, adding provision ‌on airworthiness certification for drones that plugs a key regulatory gap.\n\nThe overhaul comes as China's low-altitude economy - a national strategic initiative focusing on commercial activities below 3,000 meters - is forecast to grow to more than 2 trillion yuan ($280 billion) by 2030, from a 1.5 trillion yuan ⁠in 2025, according to estimates from ‌the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University and China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC).\n\nUnder the new rules, effective on July 1 next year, all entities ‍involved in the design, production, import, maintenance and operation of drones must obtain airworthiness certification.\n\nDrone manufacturers will be required to assign a unique product identification code to each unit, in accordance with relevant ​national regulations.\n\nChina has implemented \"interim regulations\" for unmanned aircraft starting from 2024, which stipulate that ‌civil unmanned aircraft must be registered under real names. The regulations also specify that micro, light, and small civil unmanned aircraft do not require airworthiness certification, while medium and large ones must apply to CAAC for airworthiness certification.\n\nAs China's drone market has rapidly expanded, oversight has lagged. In recent years, several cities have reported flight delays caused by illegal drone ⁠operations, prompting fines and other penalties.\n\nThe tighter requirements will ​affect manufacturers such as DJI, the world's largest ​consumer drone maker, and EHang, which produces passenger drones.\n\nDrone logistics have become an important driver of China's low-altitude economy, with 2.7 million packages containing everything ‍from hamburger lunches to ⁠life-saving medicine delivered throughout 2024, according to transport ministry data.\n\nE-commerce and food delivery leaders like JD.com and Meituan have long talked about investing in drone logistics to ⁠improve supply chain efficiency.\n\nJD Logistics has tested drone delivery networks in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, and has said ‌drones can reduce shipping times for rural customers by up to 70%.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Sophie Yu, Casey HallEditing by Shri Navaratnam)",

    "title": "The Economy Avoided a Recession in 2025",
    "description": "A feared recession didn’t materialize, but unemployment rose, wage growth slowed and affordability challenges are mounting.",
    "fullText": "After a chaotic year filled with trade wars, market gyrations and the longest government shutdown in history, the U.S. economy has, once again, proved more resilient than many forecasters feared.\n\nBut “resilient” isn’t quite the same thing as “good.”\n\nMany Americans are entering 2026 worried about their jobs, stressed about their finances and unconvinced that things will improve in the new year.\n\nThe flow of official economic data resumed last week after a prolonged delay caused by the government shutdown. The reports were muddled by technical quirks related to the shutdown, but on balance they suggested the economy remained stuck in the same uneasy limbo it was in before the data blackout began.\n\nJob growth was decent in November, but unemployment rose. Retail sales were solid, but wage growth slowed. Inflation cooled, but remains elevated.\n\nThat mixed picture is far better than the dire forecasts of last spring, when many economists warned that President Trump’s tariffs would lead to runaway inflation, a recession — or both.\n\nInstead, data this week is expected to show that gross domestic product, which measures overall economic output, grew at a robust pace in the third quarter. Full-year data, when it becomes available early next year, is likely to show that output, adjusted for inflation, grew at about a 1.5 percent pace in 2025, a downshift from 2024 but far from a recession.\n\nA gradual deterioration, though, is still a deterioration. In surveys, Americans overwhelmingly say they are struggling with the cost of living and do not believe the economy is working for them — an impression borne out by data showing that consumer spending is being driven by a relative handful of rich households.\n\nMr. Trump tried to shift that narrative in a combative — and often misleading — prime-time speech last week in which he blamed his predecessor for economic problems and promised that a “Golden Age” was just around the corner.\n\nMany forecasters do expect a rosier backdrop next year. But the problem for Mr. Trump is that few of the larger economic problems that pushed voters away from the incumbent party in 2024 have improved, and some have gotten worse.\n\nTariffs haven’t caused a spike in inflation, but they have pushed up prices for some consumer products. Homeownership remains out of reach for many Americans. Child care is still broadly unaffordable, electricity bills are rising and health care premiums are set to rise for millions of families when insurance subsidies expire at the end of the year.\n\n“When individual Americans think about the economy, they are thinking about: ‘Can I afford the things I need and want? Do I have economic opportunities?’” said Heather Boushey, who served as an economic adviser to President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nWhen the answer to those questions is “no,” she said, it is hard to convince people that the economy is strong — a lesson she and her Biden administration colleagues learned the hard way.\n\n“You can’t tell people what their reality is,” Ms. Boushey said.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s claim that he “inherited a mess,” the economy when he returned to office was strong by most measures. Unemployment was low. Wages were rising. Inflation, though higher than normal, had fallen significantly from its peak in 2022.\n\nThe frenetic early months of the Trump administration threatened to derail that progress. The president’s on-again, off-again tariff threats, combined with Elon Musk’s efforts to eliminate programs and cut the federal work force, led to steep drops in consumer confidence and wild swings in the stock market.\n\nThen on April 2, Mr. Trump announced tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. Markets plunged, and economists warned of a recession or “stagflation,” the dreaded combination of high inflation and weak growth last seen in the United States in the 1970s.\n\nThe worst predictions never came to pass, partly because Mr. Trump reversed course, rolling back some tariffs and delaying others. That gave companies an opportunity to build up inventories and re-engineer supply chains. Companies also proved more reluctant to pass price increases on to consumers than many economists initially expected, perhaps because they doubted that customers would be willing or able to stomach the extra cost.\n\nThe U.S. economy also turned out to have unexpected sources of strength that helped offset the drag from the trade war. A surge in construction of data centers for artificial intelligence models helped prop up business investment, while a rising stock market — also tied primarily to optimism around A.I. — encouraged consumer spending.\n\n“If it weren’t for the A.I. spending boom, we would be in a different place,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank.\n\nBut the benefits have not been evenly distributed. Wealthy households have reaped most of the stock market gains, even as the softening labor market has led to slower wage growth, particularly for the lowest earners. As a result, consumer spending has become bifurcated, with high-income households spending and lower-income households increasingly falling behind on financial obligations. Car repossessions and other signs of financial stress have picked up this year.\n\n“Yes, there are people who are doing great, but I don’t think there’s this sense that the tide is really coming in and lifting all the boats,” said Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank.\n\nFor some groups, the cooling labor market has turned downright icy. Recent college graduates are having the hardest time finding jobs since the aftermath of the Great Recession more than a decade ago. The unemployment rate for Black workers jumped to 8.3 percent in November, up from 6.1 percent at the end of last year and double the rate for white workers.\n\n“That’s a level that would be considered an economic crisis if they were happening to Americans overall,” said Jessica Fulton, a senior fellow at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank focused on issues affecting Black Americans.\n\nCuts to the federal government have hit Black workers disproportionately, Ms. Fulton noted. But she warned that the problems affecting Black families today — a weakening labor market, cuts to federal safety net programs, rising electricity prices that are partly a result of the rapid growth of A.I. data centers — may soon be felt more widely.\n\n“People are being squeezed from all sides,” Ms. Fulton said. “We’re seeing that from Black workers now, which I think could foreshadow the same thing for everyone else.”\n\nDespite such concerns, many forecasters expect growth to pick back up next year, and for the labor market to improve rather than deteriorate further.\n\nThey point to several potential sources of strength. The tax cuts that Congress passed this year should lead to larger refunds for many Americans, which should provide a lift to consumers early in the year. The law also included provisions to encourage companies to invest.\n\nLower interest rates — the result of a series of cuts the Federal Reserve made this fall — should also help businesses and consumers. Policymakers are weighing whether to deliver more reductions in the coming year.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest lift could come from reduced uncertainty after a uniquely tumultuous year in which businesses and investors contended with seismic changes related to tariffs, immigration restrictions and government regulation.\n\n“2025 was hampered by all the policy-related uncertainty,” said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, a bank. “The policy landscape is going to allow businesses to re-engage, and when they do that, I think you’ll see a pickup in investment.”\n\nPolicymakers are similarly optimistic. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with CNBC on Friday that he was “feeling actually pretty good” about the economy.\n\n“We got through 2025,” he said. “This has been an uncertain year. A lot has happened, and the economy has come through this.”\n\nBut that rosy outlook could be upended if the A.I. boom fades and takes the stock market along with it, or if the calmer year many hope for from Mr. Trump does not come to fruition, either because of new tariffs or other policy changes.\n\nEven without a new shock to the system, there is a risk that the steady deterioration could continue. Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup, forecasts that sluggish monthly jobs growth and more muted wage gains will finally start to weigh on consumer spending next year. Higher unemployment will offset the benefits of larger tax refunds and other tailwinds, she predicts.\n\n“If the labor market is really weakening, then those other things almost don’t matter,” Ms. Clark said.",

    "description": "President Trump’s trade policy, inflation and climbing stock prices shaped business and the economy this year.",
    "fullText": "In recent years, macroeconomic tides have ebbed and flowed, but one thing has remained unchanged: Americans’ dim views of the economy.\n\nIn 2023, pundits warned of the “vibecession.” In 2024, concerns about the economy and inflation were top of mind for voters in the presidential race.\n\nThis year, economic pessimism has persisted, as President Trump’s sweeping economic proposals, from his wide-ranging tariffs to his plan to remake the Federal Reserve, have raised uncertainty to new highs. And the economic data is sending mixed, and muddled, signals.\n\nHere are 14 charts that illustrate how uncertainty has unfolded in the economy and markets over the last year, and how it might affect the next.\n\nPresident Trump’s trade war has been one of the biggest sources of economic uncertainty this year. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly cited tariffs as a way to spur American manufacturing, create new jobs and lower U.S. trade deficits.\n\nNearly every country has seen import duties rise.\n\nThe tariffs have made progress toward some of the administration’s stated goals: They have brought the trade deficit down, as exports grew more than imports.\n\nAnd they have made money: Tariff revenues are now at record highs.\n\nBut there is another kind of deficit on investors’ minds: the federal budget deficit. Tariff revenues remain a small share of total government revenues.\n\nHere’s another way in which the effects of tariffs are showing up: higher prices for goods.\n\nConsumer prices started to accelerate in June, and the prices of products most exposed to tariffs notched some of the highest gains.\n\nAnd in recent months, prices for goods continued to rise, contributing more to inflation.\n\nInflation unexpectedly slowed to 2.7 percent in November, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week. But economists have advised taking this data with a grain of salt, because of disruptions in the bureau’s data collection efforts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether tariffs will cause just a temporary increase in prices or if they will feed into more persistent inflation.\n\nAt this month’s DealBook Summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against the notion that tariffs had contributed to inflation, saying that they had caused a “one-time price adjustment,” not a “generalized price increase.”\n\nThe chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, has also said that the Fed expected tariffs to cause a “one-time shift in the price level.” But he has stressed that the increase could be drawn out over several quarters. And at a news conference after last week’s Fed meeting he acknowledged the risk of tariff inflation becoming “more and more persistent.”\n\nIn the first full jobs report since the federal shutdown, the B.L.S. reported that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent last month, a four-year high. Wage growth slowed to its lowest level since 2021. As with inflation, the shutdown affected the data collection for these measures, and the agency said ahead of the release that its estimates of the unemployment rate and other measures would be subject to more uncertainty than usual.\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThere was a silver lining: Employers added 64,000 jobs in November, driven largely by gains in the health care sector. But that only partly offset a decline in October.\n\nThe federal government shed 168,000 jobs in October and November, as workers who accepted the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” offer came off the payroll.\n\nAnd the jobs numbers do not reflect a big downward revision that is expected early next year.\n\n(Revisions to jobs figures are commonplace, but they dominated headlines earlier this year when downward adjustments led Trump to fire the commissioner of the B.L.S., Erika McEntarfer, claiming, without evidence, that the data was “rigged.”)\n\nThe lowest-paid workers have felt the strain of the cooling labor market the most. As the economy started to recover from the pandemic, demand for labor far outstripped supply in the lowest-paid industries, such as leisure and hospitality.\n\nToday, that is no longer the case, and hourly wages are rising most slowly for the lowest earners.\n\nLast year, voters consistently told pollsters that they trusted Donald Trump over Joe Biden and later, Kamala Harris, to do a better job on the economy.\n\nNow, Trump is the one feeling the pressure, as views of his handling of the economy have soured since the summer.\n\nThe risks posed by inflation and a softening labor market have also put the Fed in a tough position. Last week, the central bank decided to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for a third meeting in a row. But the decision was highly contentious, with three of 12 policymakers voting against it.\n\nPowell said he could have made the case either way for the Fed to cut interest rates or pause reductions, given the competing risks to unemployment and inflation.\n\n“You’ve got one tool,” he said. “You can’t do two things at once.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has made no secret of his desire for lower rates. Next year, he will select a new Fed chair.\n\nAfter a dip earlier this year, most notably amid the chaotic “Liberation Day” tariff rollout, the stock market has, on the whole, kept on going up. The S&P 500 reached a record high just last week, for the 37th time this year.\n\nArguably, company earnings, and their expectations for earnings are the most important factor driving the market movements.\n\nIn fact, earnings expectations have moved in tandem with the S&P 500 price index over the course of this year (again, with the exception of the early months of the year).\n\nOf course, the S&P 500 is driven in large part by big tech companies, which are intertwined with the A.I. boom.\n\nThat has been cause for concern for some investors, who see a parallel between this moment and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But unlike companies leading the stock rally during the dot-com bubble, the public companies with the steepest valuation gains today are earning more as the market goes up.\n\nThe outlook for earnings continues to be bullish in 2026, though there could be weak links in the A.I. chain.\n\nThe crypto boom that Trump’s re-election ushered in is on pause for now.\n\nAfter surging for most of the year, the price of Bitcoin and Ether, along with dozens of other coins, started to plummet on Oct. 10, following Trump’s announcement that he would impose a new tariff on China.\n\n(The stock market on that day also saw the biggest one-day plunge since April, though it has since rebounded and hit a record high.)\n\nFor some, the crypto sell-off has underscored the fact that crypto remains a volatile investment, even as it has entered a new level of mainstream acceptance. Amid a high-stakes lobbying campaign by the crypto industry, Trump ended a regulatory crackdown on crypto and signed legislation outlining the first federal rules for stablecoins, digital tokens tied to assets like the U.S. dollar.\n\nOthers worry that a crypto crash could bleed over to the wider market.\n\nAmid all this uncertainty, people might be looking to pop culture as a form of escape. They haven’t necessarily been finding it at the movies, if ticket sales are any indication.\n\nSummer is a crucial season for Hollywood, accounting for the lion’s share of annual box office revenue. This year, fantasies, science-fiction sequels and superhero flicks were on offer. But moviegoers, for the most part, didn’t bite: It was the worst summer for domestic ticket sales since 1981, after adjusting for inflation and excluding the pandemic years.\n\nThe fall was filled with star-studded flicks, but none of them constituted box office hits.\n\nCan the holiday season help Hollywood make a comeback? “Zootopia 2” and “Wicked: For Good” have gotten it off to a good start.\n\nBut broader concerns abound. Warner Bros. Discovery has struck a deal with Netflix for the Warner Bros. studio and its sibling streaming service, HBO Max, while it has fended off, for the time being, a hostile takeover offer from Paramount.\n\nRegardless of how it all ends, it feels like a moment of loss for cinephiles. Corporate consolidation, after all, is not likely to bode well for the future of the Silver Screen.",

    "description": "From live shopping startup Whatnot to AI music platform Suno, meet the creator economy startups that raised massive deals in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The creator economy is riding an AI-fueled high.\n\nIn 2025, eight startups building artificial intelligence tools to automate the content creation process each announced at least $50 million in funding — a combined $1.2 billion — from venture capital and private equity investors.\n\nSynthesia, a generative AI video startup based in London, confirmed its $180 million funding round in January, while ElevenLabs, a text-to-voice startup, closed a $180 million Series C round. Other AI startups, like Moonvalley, Krea, and Higgsfield, also announced sizable investments this year.\n\nWhile AI is dominating investor interest, the topic still carries friction within the creator economy. Some of these AI startups, which offer features such as human-like avatars, run the risk of posing a threat to content creators themselves. Influencer marketing, still the primary financial engine of the creator economy, has yet to reach a consensus on how and when AI should be utilized.\n\nTop creators aren't sitting by idly for AI to take over. YouTuber MrBeast and his team initially sought to raise $200 million earlier this year at a $5 billion valuation, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The MrBeast team declined to comment on the fundraise.\n\nIt's not just AI that's attracting giant checks from VCs.\n\nSocial commerce startups building live shopping and affiliate marketing platforms are also raking in funding. Whatnot, a platform where people sell on stream in categories like fashion and collectibles, such as Pokémon Cards or Labubus, raised a total of $490 million across two later-stage rounds this year. The social shopping platform was most recently valued at $11.5 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, ShopMy, an affiliate marketing platform, continues to gain market share in the influencer marketing space. The startup raised a total of $147.5 million in funding this year.\n\nUS social commerce sales are expected to cross $100 billion next year, according to estimates from EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. The category is gaining steam in the US, fueled in part by the growth of TikTok Shop.\n\nThis year's fundraising blitz for creator AI and social commerce startups follows similar buzz for the categories in 2024 when investors threw money at startups like Captions, Flip, and OpusClip. Several startups in those business areas, including ElevenLabs and ShopMy, raised money two years in a row.\n\nBusiness Insider analyzed 2025 fundraising data from PitchBook and other industry sources to highlight the biggest creator industry investment rounds from the year. We're highlighting 13 startups that raised $50 million or more in 2025; combined, their funding crossed $1.9 billion. We focused on companies whose products significantly impact the businesses and content creation processes of creators and their partners.\n\nHere are 13 creator economy startups that raised some of the largest rounds in 2025, in alphabetical order:",

It's because Japan offers a different and more comforting take on what a modern society can be. You touch on this at the end, but let me go into a little more detail.\n\nConsider that Japan missed many major consumer-facing tech trends of the 21st century -- it failed to lead in the social media, freemium gaming, alogrithmic curation, or AI spaces. In many ways, it feels like a place time stopped. Yet it doesn't feel backwards. Quite the contrary: it feels in many ways a sane, calm alternative to the West, and America in particular, where \"disruption\" might as well be on the dollar bill at this point. I write about this at more length here: https://blog.pureinventionbook.com/p/super-galapagos\n\nGreat article. One more thing for me personally -- Japan is also extremely affordable, especially for the quality of goods or services received. This is of course major function of the depreciation of the Japanese yen, but it still has the effect of making Japan accessible to a huge swathe of the global population in a way that New York, London etc is not (especially in terms of the quality of amenities received -- just compare a $300/night hotel in New York with a hotel half the price in Tokyo)",

    "fullText": "Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has overturned decades of U.S. trade policy — building a wall of tariffs around what used to be a wide open economy.\n\nHis double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country have disrupted global commerce and strained the budgets of consumers and businesses worldwide. They have also raised tens of billions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury.\n\nTrump has argued that his steep new import taxes are necessary to bring back wealth that was “stolen” from the U.S. He says they will narrow America's decades-old trade deficit and bring manufacturing back to the country. But upending the global supply chain has proven costly for households facing rising prices. The taxes are paid by importers who typically attempt to pass along the higher costs to their customers. That includes businesses and ultimately, U.S. households.\n\nAnd the erratic way the president rolled out his tariffs — announcing them, then suspending or altering them before conjuring up new ones — made 2025 one of the most turbulent economic years in recent memory.\n\nHere's a look at the impact of Trump's tariffs over the last year, in four charts.\n\nA key number for the overall impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers and businesses is the “effective” tariff rate — which, unlike headline figures imposed by Trump for specific trade actions, provides an average based on the actual imports coming into the country.\n\nIn 2025, per data from the Yale Budget Lab, the effective U.S. tariff rate peaked in April. But it's still far higher than the average seen at the start of the year. Before finalizing shifts in consumption, November's effective tariff rate was nearly 17% — seven times greater than January's average and the highest seen since 1935.\n\nTariff revenue vs America's trade deficit\n\nAmong selling points to justify his tariffs, Trump has repeatedly said they would reduce America's longstanding trade deficit and bring revenue into the Treasury.\n\nTrump's higher tariffs are certainly raising money. They've raked in more than $236 billion this year through November — much more than in years past. But they still account for just a fraction of the federal government's total revenue. And they haven't raised nearly enough to justify the president's claim that tariff revenue could replace federal income taxes — or allow for windfall dividend checks for Americans.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit, meanwhile, has fallen significantly since the start of the year. The trade gap peaked to a monthly record of $136.4 billion in March, as consumers and businesses hurried to import foreign products before Trump could impose his tariffs on them. The trade gap narrowed to $52.8 billion in September, the latest month for which data is available. But the year-to-date deficit was still running 17% ahead of January-September 2024.",

    "description": "Can't find a job, but keep hearing that the economy is strong? That might be the economic story of 2026.",
    "fullText": "The US economy continues to surprise on the upside — except when it comes to jobs.\n\nHot growth, as seen in this week's GDP report, typically corresponds to stronger hiring and personal earnings, which then enable consumers to continue spending. However, this year, the trend has been the opposite. Spending is driving the economy, but the job market is stuck in a \"Great Freeze.\"\n\nAs KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk wrote on Tuesday, \"Growth and labor market outcomes have decoupled.\"\n\nIt's shaping up to be the story of 2026. The US has found itself in what some are calling a \"jobless boom.\" Money is flowing in and out of the economy at a healthy clip, but it's not going toward creating a new job for you.\n\nInstead, all eyes are on artificial intelligence, investment in which drove much of the year's economic growth, along with still-strong consumer spending. The big AI investors were larger companies, including those that have led white-collar job cuts. In some cases, their profits have skyrocketed, and \"do more with less\" has been the mantra of the year.\n\n\"Firms are doing more with fewer workers,\" Swonk wrote. \"Many overshot on staffing during the hiring frenzy and are now using attrition or layoffs to bring staffing levels \n\nEconomists are still grappling with how the US ended up in this rare scenario. This year, although overall layoffs have crept up, they remain relatively low. Corporate America and Big Tech were the exceptions, with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla announcing big cuts.\n\nBusiness Insider has heard from dozens of white-collar job seekers who said that finding a new role has felt \"impossible,\" and those with jobs have, in many cases, held onto them for dear life.\n\nIn addition to a tough job market, consumers had no income growth last quarter. However, spending held strong — despite tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. A large percentage of this spending uptick was in healthcare and medical services, as costs for hospital and nursing services climbed. This year marks the most Americans have spent on healthcare services since 2022, when the Omicron wave of COVID-19 spread.\n\nThis suggests that, despite strong spending by affluent households, much of this rise in consumer spending wasn't necessarily powered by confidence. In fact, consumer sentiment levels are among the lowest they have ever been, and many Americans have been cautious about spending because of tariff uncertainty.\n\nThe tough job market isn't helping. Unemployment is at 4.6%, the highest since 2021. Total job growth has stayed slow.\n\nDozens of job seekers across generations told Business Insider this year that they were frustrated about suspected ageism, cumbersome hiring processes, competition with hundreds of others for a single role, and the suspected role of AI in screening out their applications. Some told reporters they've applied for thousands of roles with no interviews, while others said it took well over a year to get a single offer, often at a lower pay than their previous job.\n\nIn his 2026 wish list for the business world, Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco asked for \"ROI for AI.\"\n\n\"I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects,\" he wrote, referring to the eye-popping AI spending from Big Tech — and their plans for even more next year.\n\nIf that does come, the jobless boom may only grow. Companies want to use AI to boost productivity without hiring more people, which would only exacerbate a sluggish job market.\n\nAlthough it's difficult to determine if this year's investments in AI have yielded results, the GDP's spike to 4.3% in the third quarter is an encouraging sign overall. The largest growth since the third quarter of 2023 prompted President Donald Trump to say that the \"Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead.\"\n\nStill, many Americans may worry about what this means for their jobs. Some companies have cited the need to be efficient in an AI-driven future as justification for layoffs. The US already operates with fewer jobs than it had pre-COVID, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has recently said that the grim jobs data may be overstating this year's deflated gains.",

    "fullText": "The creator economy has bred a generation of startups — from influencer-marketing companies to new social-media experiences.\n\nThese startups have captured the attention and wallets of influential venture capitalists and angel investors over the last several years, giving rise to several unicorn valuations in the space.\n\nCheck out 16 VC firms investing in creator economy startups\n\nEven as the economy has weathered changing tides and investments have cooled across industries, some startups in this sector are still raising money.\n\nIn 2024, three trends drove some of the largest deals in the creator economy: AI, social commerce, and newsletters. Several startups raised at least $10 million in new funding last year, such as AI startup Captions or newsletter platform Beehiiv.\n\nHere are 17 creator-economy startups that raised more than $10 million in 2024\n\nAI is continuing to fuel investor interest in the creator economy in 2025, too. For instance, Hedra, a generative AI startup used by some creators to make viral content, announced a $32 million Series A led by A16z in May.\n\nCreators themselves, like Emma Chamberlain and MrBeast, are also raising venture capital for their businesses.\n\nSee the leaked pitch deck Chamberlain Coffee used\n\nSo, how do creator-economy startups land those investments? Often, it starts with a pitch deck.\n\nLumanu, a creator-focused financial startup, uses a simple pitch deck that's more of a \"conversation guider,\" its cofounder and CEO, Tony Tran, told Business Insider.\n\n\"My pitch is always why, what, how, and why now?\" Tran said. (Read the full pitch deck here.)\n\nSkye, a career-coaching startup, had different pitch decks depending on the type of investor or fund they pitched to.\n\n\"I had two different versions, depending on the fund,\" said Jessica Wolf, Skye's CEO and one of its cofounders. \"If I knew a fund was more into pre-seed, all about the founder, I had one deck. But if I knew that they were a numbers person, I would use another one.\"\n\nEvery startup has a different approach.\n\nSome, such as Throne, even ditch the pitch deck altogether and opt for an email or Notion document.\n\nRead the email template creator-economy startup Throne used to secure its seed investment.\n\nWe talked with founders who've pitched their startups to investors about their process. They broke down the pitch decks they used to secure millions of dollars in funding.\n\nNote: Pitch decks are sorted by investment stage and size of round.",

    "description": "A state polls showed that 55% of Russians believe what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine will end next year.",
    "fullText": "The majority of Russians expect the war with Ukraine to end in 2026, according to a poll released Wednesday.\n\nThe survey of 1,600 Russians aged 18 and above found that 55% believe what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" is nearing its end. The poll was conducted in mid-December by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center.\n\nMikhail Mamonov, the deputy head of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, said as he presented the results at a roundtable discussion: \"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president.\"\n\nIn previous years, when revealing the results of its annual poll, the organization did not provide data on the share of Russians expecting the war to end. It is hard to assess public sentiment about sensitive subjects like the war in Russia due to the country's tightly controlled public discourse.\n\nThe result came as Russia's economic boom, driven by wartime spending and subsidies, cooled.\n\nIn November, Russia's industrial output fell 0.7% from a year ago, following a 3.1% increase in October, Rosstat, Russia's official statistics agency, said Wednesday. Reuters reported that day that analysts expected a 1.2% increase in output.\n\nThe profits of Russian companies declined nearly 10% to 21.6 trillion rubles, or $273.4 billion, from January through October.\n\nHigh — but moderating — inflation, weaker energy revenues, a strong ruble, and tight credit have weighed on consumer demand and real incomes, squeezing private-sector activity.\n\nA separate, independent poll of 1,608 Russians aged 18 and above showed that the economy and the war with Ukraine were their top concerns. The survey conducted between November 18 and 27 by the Levada Center was published December 16.\n\nIn a tightly choreographed phone-in event Friday with ordinary Russian citizens and journalists, known as the \"Direct Line,\" Putin acknowledged a sharp slowdown in economic growth — to 1% this year from 4.3% in 2024. He attributed it to government measures aimed at improving inflation.\n\nWhile Ukraine dominated the discussion, the broadcast was punctuated by flashes of public frustration, as text messages from viewers were displayed on a large screen in the hall, Reuters reported.\n\nThere were complaints about internet outages, poor water quality, and the rising cost of living — a reminder of how economic pressures affect the lives of Russians.",

    "title": "Copper prices are soaring. Here's what that often signals for the economy.",
    "description": "Copper prices have rallied over 35% so far this year amid supply shortages, surging global demand, and tariff uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMetals have had a record year with recent surges in gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) prices, but there’s a third metal hitting its own record highs. Copper prices have rallied by more than 35% this year, poised for the biggest annual gain since 2009, driven higher by rising tech demand, supply constraints, and tariff uncertainty.\n\nGlobal copper (HG=F) prices officially surpassed $12,000 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday for the first time ever and continued to march higher on Wednesday.\n\nEach type of metal reacts slightly differently to economic conditions, and copper is no exception. However, unlike gold and silver, copper isn’t so directly influenced by investor sentiment or economic expectations. Its price movements can typically be attributed to physical growth and expansion.\n\nCopper is often viewed as a barometer for the economy. It plays a central role in power grids, construction, industrial machinery, and more. When there’s a demand for those types of goods or services, it’s typically a good sign that the economy has a clean bill of health — giving copper its nickname: Doctor Copper.\n\nRising copper prices often signal strong industrial demand and a rapidly growing economy, while falling prices may indicate an economic slowdown, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Copper is “a major beneficiary of investments in grid and power infrastructure globally, as AI and defence heighten the need for robust and secure energy networks,” wrote Goldman Sachs Research analyst Eoin Dinsmore in a note.\n\nGold is seen as more of a “safe-haven” asset and a hedge against inflation. Silver straddles the line between gold and copper and has both investment and industrial purposes. Copper, however, is predominantly industrial. It’s not typically purchased to be stored like gold or silver but meant to be used, which is why it’s usually the strongest indicator, of the three metals, that the economy is moving in the right direction.\n\nThere are a few key reasons that copper is experiencing a surge right now. Major copper-producing regions such as Chile and Indonesia have faced supply challenges and environmental disasters that have contributed to a global copper shortage and a tighter market.\n\n“After essentially flat mine supply growth expected this year, our 2026 mine supply growth estimates have fallen to only around +1.4%, or about 500 kmt lower than our estimates at the beginning of the year,” said Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, in a statement.\n\nA dip in supply isn’t the only factor that’s pushing prices higher. In July, the Trump administration issued tariffs on several categories of copper imports, putting additional pressure on the market. At the same time, heavy investment in the AI sector is significantly boosting demand because of its reliance on copper for data centers.\n\nOne source estimates that hyperscale AI data centers can use up to 50,000 tons of copper per facility.\n\nAs far as where prices are headed, JPMorgan Global Research expects copper prices to reach $12,500 a ton in the second quarter of 2026, ultimately averaging around $12,075 a ton for the full year.\n\nWhile researchers are optimistic that copper prices will continue on an upward trend, experts say the long-term implications of recent price surges remain uncertain.\n\n“The intersection of tariffs and copper prices in July 2025 highlights the complex dynamics of global trade and commodity markets,” said David Koch, CFP and director of portfolio management at Halbert Hargrove. “While the immediate effect has been a sharp rise in copper prices, the long-term consequences will depend on how markets, governments, and industries adapt to this new trade environment.”\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nGold and silver prices have been on a tear, with silver prices increasing by more than 100% year to date.

    "description": "Morgan Stanley's top economist wrote this week that as long as prices can remain elevated, companies might be able to avoid having to slash headcount.",
    "fullText": "The job market is brutal right now, and there's growing concern that 2026 could see more layoffs. However, Morgan Stanley says that many companies may be able to avoid having to slash head count.\n\nThe bank's chief US economist, Michael T. Gapen, and his team wrote on Tuesday that the US economy may be able to avoid widespread layoffs in 2026 but only if companies continue hiking prices, after already raising them throughout 2025.\n\nRising layoffs and sticky inflation were two of the big macro themes that defined 2025. According to Gapen and his team, companies opted to decrease hiring and reduce staffing to avoid raising prices earlier in the year as tariff pressures kicked in.\n\nNow, Morgan Stanley says that this may be the key to avoiding widespread layoffs in the coming year.\n\n\"We think the majority of the tariff pass-through to final consumer prices will have been completed at that point, assuming the administration does not push tariff policy further,\" Gapen said. \"On net, our outlook assumes inflation firms, profitability is largely restored, and the economy avoids layoffs.\"\n\nThe economist added that his team doesn't expect the Trump administration to implement new tariffs as the 2026 midterm elections approach. Yet, the analysts also emphasize that they don't think companies are done raising prices.\n\nThe bank maintains its baseline view that the existing tariffs will push core inflation to 3% early in 2026, with signs already being seen in the cost of consumer goods.\n\n\"Monthly rates of consumer price inflation in June through September have come with observable increases in components of CPI and PCE that have high direct exposure to tariffs,\" Gapen wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley's analysis also found that companies have started to recoup some of the money they lost in early 2025 after being impacted by tariffs. That's a promising development, particularly as the bank predicts that many firms can raise prices while still maintaining the bulk of their customer base.\n\nHowever, the thesis that higher prices can help prevent layoffs in 2026 only applies so long as customers continue to stomach higher costs.\n\nConsumers have a limit to how much more they'll pay for goods, particularly as economic uncertainty remains high. It is unclear just how high prices can go before shoppers balk.\n\n\"If firms found they could not push output prices higher on account of consumer resistance and loss of market share, then we think they would turn to reducing labor costs further, triggering layoffs,\" Morgan Stanley added.",

    "fullText": "Managing a business is challenging, even in the best circumstances. In today's uncertain economy, marked by slowing consumer spending and shifting retail habits, it becomes even tougher.\n\nFor one retail chain, the difficulty has been compounded by years of financial strain, two Chapter 11 bankruptcies, and hundreds of store closures nationwide.\n\nOnce an iconic mall staple known for its affordable jewelry, colorful hair accessories, and quirky novelties, Claire's is again facing serious financial setbacks. A new revelation has raised doubts about the long-term survival of the 64-year-old brand, which once played a significant role in the lives of countless teens and tweens.\n\nAs it works to emerge from its second bankruptcy under new ownership by the private equity firm Ames Watson, Claire's is confronting additional pressures from its supply chain. Several Asian suppliers allege they are owed millions of dollars in unpaid debts, according to claims filed in Hong Kong and reported by CNBC.\n\nThe disputed orders were for holiday merchandise placed before Claire's second bankruptcy filing, when Elliott Management still owned the company. Suppliers were reportedly aware of the retailer's financial instability at the time the orders were made. However, by the time production was completed, Claire's had already filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAfter Ames Watson acquired the brand, some suppliers claimed they were still owed payment, but agreed to continue doing business with Claire's. Others chose to pursue legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office, RSI International.\n\nAs a major American retail chain, Claire's is a prominent customer for many of these Asian suppliers. This is why, despite outstanding balances, several vendors continued to fulfill orders out of fear that refusing to do so could jeopardize their business relationship with the retailer.\n\nDuring its latest acquisition process, RSI International notified creditors that they had 30 days to file claims to recover unpaid debts, liabilities that under Hong Kong Law do not transfer to new owners.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson emphasized it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\"\n\n\"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" said Ames Watson. \"We are excited about the company’s direction in 2026.\"\n\nClaire's first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, emerging later that year under the new ownership of Elliott Management Corp. and Monarch Alternative Capital.",

    "fullText": "The third-quarter GDP report was a blowout, but don't expect that to change Mark Zandi's mind about how the economy is faring.\n\nAfter a long delay due to the government shutdown, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the latest economic growth data, and it was a lot more upbeat than economists were predicting.\n\nAccording to the Q3 report, the US economy is estimated to have expanded at a 4.3% growth rate during the three-month period, driven by robust consumer and federal spending.\n\nYet, Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, tells Business Insider that he's still harboring reservations about how things are going under the surface.\n\nZandi has been ringing the alarm on the economy all year, recently stating that he saw the US on the edge of a recession.\n\nThe most recent GDP report doesn't seem to have restored his confidence that better days are ahead.\n\n\"Despite the big gain in real GDP growth in the quarter, underlying real GDP growth — abstracting from the quarterly vagaries of the data — is closer to 2%,\" he told Business Insider. \"OK, but not great, and not strong enough to create enough jobs, as unemployment is steadily moving higher.\"\n\nZandi was predicting a 3.8% increase in real GDP growth, higher than most economists' estimates of 3.3%. As such, he isn't surprised by the numbers, although he also speculated that the big upside surprise may have been driven by technical quirks as opposed to actual momentum.\n\n\"The biggest difference with my forecast is the more substantial narrowing of the trade deficit, but this is due to the swings caused by the tariffs. Government spending was also stronger, but this is likely due to a measurement issue,\" he said.\n\nZandi believes that the government shutdown also increases the risk of revision for the Q3 report, with growth potentially being revised downward in the coming months.\n\n\"I can't explicitly connect the dots from the government shutdown, its impact on the government data, and on the GDP estimate,\" Zandi said, \"But it wouldn't be surprising if this data is ultimately revised to a significant degree.\"",

    "fullText": "The US economy defied expectations in the third quarter of a year marked by uncertainty.\n\nUS real gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, exceeding the 3.3% expected and more than the 3.8% growth in the second quarter.\n\n\"The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, and government spending that were partly offset by a decrease in investment,\" the Bureau of Economic Analysis said.\n\nHeather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote on X that \"AI investment wasn't a big factor\" in the third quarter and instead consumption is a \"key driver,\" particularly due to spending from wealthier Americans.\n\nReal personal consumer spending rose 3.5% in the third quarter, more than the 2.5% rise in the second quarter. Imports again fell, but not by as much as in the second quarter, declining 4.7% in the third quarter and falling 29.3% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, exports rose 8.8% in the third quarter, after a 1.8% drop in the previous one.\n\nThe report was a surprise on the upside because the economy in 2025 has faced some headwinds. The effects of tariff announcements were reflected in imports, particularly in the first quarter, when real GDP declined. The fourth-quarter estimates may also be affected by the recent record-long government shutdown. The Congressional Budget Office said in late October that the shutdown likely lowered real GDP while it was ongoing and that growth \"will be temporarily higher than it would have been otherwise\" as the economy rebounds post-shutdown.\n\nThe new Bureau of Economic Analysis report follows other recent data releases that show a mixed view of the US economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently published inflation and labor market reports that showed unemployment at its highest rate since September 2021 and inflation unexpectedly cooling.\n\nMark Hamrick, Bankrate's senior economic analyst, said in an email that Americans will have to wait until next year to get more clarity on the economy's performance. He added that there will also be some benefits for Americans from what President Donald Trump called his \"one big beautiful\" bill, including federal income tax refunds.\n\n\"The good news is that the outlook for growth is improving as we enter 2026, as noted also recently by the Federal Reserve,\" he said. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a December press conference that the \"baseline would be solid growth next year\" due to factors like AI and consumer spending.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish an updated GDP estimate for the third quarter on January 22.\n\n\"A key question for consumers, who power the U.S. economy, is whether the job market stabilizes or even improves modestly in the months ahead,\" Hamrick said. \"If not, their resilience and the resilience of the economy will be put to the test.\"",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "description": "Tuesday's flurry of delayed data releases could fill in gaps in Wall Street's picture of the economy.",
    "fullText": "US stocks tipped higher on Tuesday after fresh data showed surprisingly strong growth in the US economy over the summer, leading investors to trim bets on near-term interest-rate cuts.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both rose around 0.4%, with the benchmark index vying for a fresh record close. The blue-chip benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.2%. The turn higher came after the major gauges on Monday notched their third win in a row.\n\nGold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) continued to pick up steam through Tuesday morning, adding to a stunning rally that has the precious metals on pace for their best year in more than four decades. At the same time, copper (HG=F) crested a fresh record above $12,000 per ton.\n\nTuesday brought a last gasp of data ahead of the Christmas holiday. Wall Street got a first look at third quarter GDP, which showed the US economy grew at a 4.3% annualized rate in the quarter. That was much higher than the 3.3% expected, a potential sign of continued economic resilience. The shutdown-delayed report also found that consumer spending remained strong over the summer.\n\nAfter the release, traders pared bets on a rate cut in January. Markets now price in over 85% odds of the Federal Reserve standing pat, up from 80% a day ago and 75% last week. That said, a plurality of wagers remain on two cuts by the end of next year.\n\nBut Tuesday morning's read on December consumer confidence from the Conference Board showed the measure declining for a fifth consecutive month, as consumers' poor economic vibes persist.\n\nWall Street stocks have rallied back in recent days, after last week's data — including a surprise drop in inflation and lukewarm look at labor market — left bets on 2026 interest-rate cuts mostly intact.\n\nOn the corporate front, Novo Nordisk's (NVO) US-listed stock jumped in premarket after the Danish drugmaker got official US approval to market its Wegovy weight-loss pill.\n\nLooking ahead, US stock markets will wrap up trading early on Wednesday and be closed all day Thursday for the Christmas holiday.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that he sees room to revise the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target and move to a range-based system instead.\n\nSpeaking on the \"All-In Podcast\" on Monday, Bessent said, “Once we are back to [2%] — which I think will be in sight — then we can have a discussion: Is it much smarter to have a range?”\n\nThe US inflation target, set in 2012 at 2%, constitutes one-half of the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, driven by maintaining a long-term stable inflation mark.\n\n10-year Treasurys (^TNX) ticked up by roughly 0.2% through the first half of Tuesday, while the Intercontinental Exchange's US Dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) moved down by the same amount.\n\nBessent's comments come after a delayed release of the November Consumer Price Index showed that prices increased by 2.7% over the year prior, compared to consensus estimates of 3.1%. So-called core\" CPI — which strips out the more volatile food and energy categories — rose by 2.6% against economist estimates of 3%.\n\nShares in US mining companies with copper (HG=F) operations are rising after the metal crested $12,000 per ton for the first time ever on Tuesday morning, setting an all-time high as President Trump's tariff policies and a string of mine accidents have roiled supply chains.\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia was taken nearly completely offline earlier in the year after a deadly mudslide that left several workers dead, traded up by 1.4% in the first minutes after the opening bell. Fellow mining giants BHP Group (BHP) and Teck Resources (TECK) gained 0.4% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nShares in Southern Copper (SCCO), one of the US's major copper operators, moved in the opposite direction, falling by roughly 0.4%.\n\nThe year has been strong for metals across the board. Prices on copper itself are up more than 37% year to date, while hot-rolled coil steel (HRC=F) and aluminum (ALI=F) have climbed by 32% and 17%, respectively, according to data from Trading Economics.\n\nWhile geopolitics have played a role, Trump's tariff regime has also sent copper and other metals prices soaring, dragging mining stocks along with it.\n\nWhen Trump announced plans in July to impose tariffs on copper, traders rushed to move physical copper stores out of warehouses overseas and back into the US to avoid these duties, which sent prices soaring. When the administration clarified that these tariffs would not apply to raw copper ore, prices came back down.\n\nUnder current policy, semi-finished products and copper-intensive goods, such as wiring or tubes, are covered under an identical 50% tariff, although raw copper ores are excluded. Imports of both steel and aluminum are currently subject to a 50% tariff.\n\nUS consumers remained pessimistic about the current state of the economy at the start of December, according to data from the Conference Board.\n\nThe Conference Board's consumer confidence reading dropped 3.8 points to 89.1 in December from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9, marking the fifth month in a row that consumer confidence weakened.\n\nConsumers' views on current business conditions were negative for the first time since September 2024, the report said. Survey respondents cited ongoing concerns, such as inflation, tariffs, and politics, although other topics, including immigration, war, and personal finance, also became more salient.\n\nAt the same time, consumers' expectations for inflation 12 months from now retreated after increasing in November. Consumers also had the most positive view of where stock prices are headed a year from now since January.\n\nOverall, households reported feeling mildly negative about their family's current financial situation, but turned slightly more optimistic about future conditions. Many reported putting off big-ticket purchases, as Americans reported spending more on necessities and cheap thrills than on expensive discretionary items.\n\nCloud software maker ServiceNow (NOW) has reached an agreement to acquire the cybersecurity company Armis in a $7.75 billion deal, the company announced Tuesday morning.\n\nThe transaction, an all-cash deal that ServiceNow said it will finance with both cash on hand and debt, will be ServiceNow's largest acquisition to date, according to Bloomberg. Shares in ServiceNow fell by roughly 2.6% after the announcement.\n\nThe acquisition is intended to broaden ServiceNow's cybersecurity offerings in its cloud products, the company said in its press release. Armis' security offerings will allow enterprise customers in industries with \"cyber-physical\" assets, such as healthcare and manufacturing, to get a more real-time assessment of potential threats, ServiceNow said.\n\n\"In the agentic AI era, intelligent trust and governance that span any cloud, any asset, any AI system, and any device are non-negotiable if companies want to scale AI for the long-term,\" ServiceNow president, COO, and chief product officer Amit Zavery said.\n\n\"Together with Armis, we will deliver an industry-defining strategic cybersecurity shield for real-time, end-to-end proactive protection across all technology estates.\"\n\nUS stocks opened Tuesday's trading on unstable footing after GDP data showed stronger-than-expected growth in the US economy through the summer, leading investors to pull back from bets on near-term cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by roughly 0.2% in the most volatile move of the morning, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by less than 0.1% each following the third win in a row for US stocks to start the week.\n\nCopper (HG=F) set a fresh record on Tuesday morning, crossing $12,000 per ton for the first time, while gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) continued to pick up steam, adding onto a stunning rally that has the precious metals on pace for their best year in more than four decades.\n\nBefore the opening bell on Tuesday, investors got a reading on third quarter GDP, which showed the US economy grew at a 4.3% annualized rate in the quarter, above the expected 3.3% growth. Predictions of a rate cut at the January Federal Reserve meeting fell in the aftermath, with traders pricing in only a 13% chance.\n\nUS gross domestic product (GDP) unexpectedly accelerated in the third quarter, coming in at an annualized pace of 4.3%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Tuesday.\n\nEconomists had expected the initial reading of annualized growth to slow to a 3% pace from last quarter's 3.8% reading, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe reading showed resilience in consumer spending and exports, though investments decreased, the BEA said. Imports, which are subtracted from the calculation of GDP, also declined.\n\nEconomists have noted that the economy has looked increasingly K-shaped, with higher-income households propping up spending while lower-income households become more financially stressed.\n\nThe advance GDP reading was originally scheduled to be released on Oct. 30, with a second estimate scheduled for Nov. 26, but the data was delayed due to the government shutdown.\n\nTom Hale, the CEO of Oura, which makes the popular health tracking ring, doesn't think a new hardware device from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) will make the Apple (AAPL) iPhone obsolete, he told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. Hale said it would have a long way to go to drive mass appeal.\n\n\"We've all had [Amazon] Alexa devices in our lives, and they're fascinating, ... but it's also kind of latent in the sort of bandwidth for information,\" Hale said in a new episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast. \"I'm fascinated by conversations that you have with OpenAI or any of the models like Gemini. ... At the same time, it's not the perfect user interface for every kind of computing activity you might consult.\"\n\nHale added that he doesn't think the iPhone will go away, just as the iPhone didn't fully replace laptops or desktops.\n\n\"It's just another form factor for computing,\" he said. \"I think that's where the device goes, and I think that we'll have a cloud of wearables that'll be tuned to whatever your use case is.\"\n\nThe US dollar is on track to hit its weakest annual performance since 2017, according to the Bloomberg Dollar Index.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) stock fell 3% before the bell on Tuesday, following a surge on Monday. The Starlink rival's stock closed 14% up on Monday. AST's gains follow President Trump's signing of an executive order last week to secure America's \"space superiority.\"\n\nCACI (CACI) stock edged higher on Tuesday, rising 1% during premarket trading, following the announcement on Monday that the US defense contractor will acquire space technology provider ​ARKA Group from funds managed by ‌Blackstone Tactical Opportunities for $2.6 billion.\n\nCarnival Corporation (CCL) stock rose 1% before the bell on Tuesday, following the cruise liner posting positive Q4 earnings results on Friday, beating Wall Street expectations and resuming dividend payments.\n\nMilitary shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) saw its stock rise 4% during premarket trading on Tuesday and closed 5% up in the prior day's trading after the US Navy announced it had selected Huntington to design and build a new class of warship.\n\n“We look forward to supporting the Navy on this critical program,” said Chris Kastner, HII president and CEO.\n\nPresident Trump also said on Monday that he had approved a plan for the US Navy to construct new \"Trump-class\" warships to serve as flagships for the nation's naval fleet.\n\nRivals to Huntington saw their stock close higher yesterday, such as General Dynamics (GD), which saw its shares rise almost 2% on Monday, and Australian company Austal (ASB.AX), which has a major presence in the US, saw its shares close 6% higher on Tuesday.\n\nShares of Novo Nordisk jumped before the bell on Tuesday after the FDA approved its weight-loss pill on Monday.\n\nThe green light for oral Wegovy gives the Danish drugmaker a boost as looks to claw back ground lost to US rival Eli Lilly (LLY). Novo has seen a rocky 2025 of sliding shares, profit warnings, and slowing sales of its injectable Wegovy amid intensifying competition, including from compounded versions.",

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "description": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.",
    "fullText": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.\n\nSpeaking to Xi across a vast display of orchids in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, the Russian president claimed their ties were “at an unprecedentedly high level”.\n\nCertainly on the surface it appears China’s alliance with Russia has only grown stronger since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nNowhere has this been more evident than when looking at trade between the two countries, which has boomed ever since the West slapped Putin with massive sanctions.\n\nLast year, the value of trade between Russia and China hit a record $245bn (£182bn), fuelled by Xi becoming the world’s largest buyer of Putin’s oil and gas. Overall, China also became Russia’s biggest supplier of goods.\n\nHowever, closer ties with China have come at a cost.\n\nIn particular, Russian businesses have grown increasingly frustrated at a flood of cheap Chinese goods.\n\nVladimir Milov, who worked in the Russian government from 1997 to 2002 before becoming a vocal Putin critic, says the economic alliance is backfiring badly for Russia.\n\n“It is deeply disadvantageous,” he says. “China is taking advantage because it knows that Russia has nowhere to go.”\n\nSuch warnings could signal that the economic ties between the two countries are beginning to fray.\n\nWhile mutual trade hit a record high in 2024, it has fallen by nearly a tenth so far this year.\n\nOne key area of tension is cars.\n\nAfter Western manufacturers cut ties with Russia in 2022, Chinese competitors duly stepped in.\n\nIn the two years to 2024, Chinese car exports to Russia have increased sevenfold, prompting a growing number of complaints from domestic manufacturers.\n\nMaxim Sokolov, the chief executive of Russian carmaker AvtoVAZ, has accused the Chinese of “unprecedented dumping”, which he said in December has crossed “all imaginable boundaries”.\n\nSales of his company’s signature Lada car have plunged, pushing the company to slash production by nearly half and move to a four-day work week at the end of September.\n\nRussia’s largest truck manufacturer, Kamaz, also trimmed its working week in August after demand for its vehicles plunged by 60pc. At the time it blamed “excessive” imports.\n\nTo alleviate some of the criticism, the Kremlin has responded by significantly raising import fees on vehicles.\n\nSince October 2024, Russia has more than doubled the “recycling fee” that it charges on imported cars.\n\nThis charge, which is supposedly to cover the future disposal of the vehicle but functions largely as a tariff, was 667,000 roubles (£6,275) per vehicle as of January this year.\n\nThis led to Chinese car exports to Russia halving in the first six months of 2025.\n\nIn July, Russian regulators also banned truck imports from a fleet of major Chinese brands – Dongfeng, Foton, FAW and Sitrak – which they branded a “direct threat” to public safety.\n\n“These trade-related tensions will start to occur more and more as the market gets saturated with Chinese goods and uncompetitive Russian industries are not able to make their sales,” says John Kennedy, a research leader at Rand.\n\nThere are signs that Russia’s steel sector is also hurting.\n\nAndrey Gartung, chief executive of the Chelyabinsk Forging and Press Plant, warned last year: “Russian enterprises competing with Chinese ones are holding on by the skin of their teeth.”\n\nNot one to shy away, China has hit back with trade restrictions of its own.\n\nMost notably, Xi reintroduced tariffs on Russian coal in January 2024, two years after the restrictions were first lifted.\n\nThis has already hit exports to China, with Milov claiming that the levies are adding to what is the worst crisis for Russia’s coal industry since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe sector’s revenues are expected to plummet by 12pc this year alone.\n\nElsewhere, China has so far refused to lift a longstanding ban on imports of Russia’s largest agricultural exports – winter wheat and barley. Instead, it buys from Ukraine and Kazakhstan.\n\nWhat China does import from Russia, it gets incredibly cheaply because it has a monopoly as one of Russia’s only buyers, says Milov.\n\nRussia’s biggest exports to China are oil and gas, which combined make up two thirds of its trade.\n\nIgor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive, said that between January 2022 and June 2024, China’s savings from purchasing Russian oil compared to Middle Eastern exports amounted to as much as $18bn.\n\n“Taking the sanctions away, Russia is what Beijing would want every trading partner to look like,” says Gregor Sebastian, of Rhodium’s China Corporate Advisory team.\n\n“China is importing raw materials that it produces into manufactured goods that it can then resell at much higher profit margins back to Russia. That is the main bulk of the relationship.”\n\nHowever, more than anything, Russia wants new technology and investment from China. And it is not getting it.\n\nThe average annual flow of Chinese investment into Russia has plummeted from an average of $1.2bn from 2011 to $400m, says Milov.\n\nIn 2022, China dropped Russia from its Belt and Road financing programme, while in July, China’s commerce ministry “strongly advised” carmakers against investing in Russia.\n\nMany major projects that were previously announced with Chinese backing have now been scrapped or are on hold.\n\nRussia quietly disappeared from what was supposed to be a joint development of a long-haul aircraft with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.\n\nWork had already begun on the project, initially called the CR929, which stood for “China Russia”. However, the R has now been dropped, with the aircraft renamed as the C929.\n\nPlans for Chinese CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles to build a high-speed rail line between Moscow and Kazan in south-west Russia have also been paused.\n\nSeparately, there has been no progress on the development of the Tianjin oil refinery, a joint venture between Rosneft and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which was approved in 2014.\n\nAfter the meeting between Putin and Xi in September, Gazprom announced that the two countries had signed a deal to build a “Power of Siberia 2” gas pipeline to China.\n\nBut while this would no doubt prove to be a huge victory for Russia, China has yet to confirm the project.\n\nThis may be a sign that, for all the pomp and ceremony, the countries’ authoritarian alliance may be weaker than it appears.\n\n“Despite all these hugs and kisses at summits, China and Russia are very much far apart,” says Milov.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - A revamp of China's electricity market is boosting the economics of storing power just as international demand surges, sparking a boom for the Chinese energy storage manufacturers that already dominate globally.\n\nChinese firms are on track for a 75% jump this year in global shipments of lithium-ion battery cells for energy storage, ​according to one estimate.\n\nThey have exported more than $65 billion worth of storage and electric-vehicle batteries this year, cementing their dominance in a sector vital to backing up wind and solar ‌and keeping power coursing through artificial-intelligence data centres.\n\nThe surge in sales is driven by data centres and renewables domestically, as well as by Chinese reforms and subsidies that are boosting general demand for energy storage. International demand is rising in tandem with the ‌surging growth in data centres, a need to back up Europe's ageing grid and China's burgeoning renewable energy business in the Middle East, analysts say.\n\n\"These leading energy storage cell makers, they have full orders. Many of them are basically working double shifts now to try and meet demand,\" said analyst Cosimo Ries at policy research firm Trivium China. The boom \"is one of the biggest surprises of the year, I think, in China's energy space.\"\n\nUBS last month raised its 2026 forecast for global battery-energy storage installations by 25%.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts global investment in battery storage facilities will rise 16% this year to $66 billion. Much of that is ⁠set to be captured by Chinese firms because while Tesla is number ‌one in energy storage systems, China dominates production of the tiny cells inside them.\n\nAll of the six top global cell suppliers - Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), HiTHIUM, EVE Energy, BYD, CALB and REPT BATTERO - are Chinese, according to a January-to-September ranking by consultancy Infolink. Of the top 10, only Japan's AESC is not from China.\n\nEVE's ‍energy storage sales volumes rose 35.51% in the first three quarters from the same period last year. REPT BATTERO's third-quarter shipments of all batteries set a record high. Top EV players CATL and BYD did not break out energy storage shipments through the third quarter. Storage has historically made up less of their revenue than automotive batteries and EVs, although the proportion is growing.\n\n\"Pairing solar with storage has effectively become the only solution for meeting U.S. AI ​data-centre power needs,\" UBS analyst Yishu Yan told a media briefing. \"U.S. AI data centre power demand is very robust, but power is the biggest bottleneck, and U.S. baseload power - gas, nuclear, thermal - they ‌won't grow much in the next five years.\"",

    "title": "Trump talks about neuroses, selecting chairs and his wife’s underwear drawer in latest affordability speech",
    "description": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.\n\nHe ended up explaining how his wife organizes her lingerie drawer.\n\n“I think she steams them,” he offered at one point, hoping to underscore the violation Melania Trump felt when, in his telling, FBI agents rummaged through the pristine undergarments — “sometimes referred to as panties” — during their 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn the realm of Trump tangents, it wasn’t the wildest, or angriest, or most bizarre.\n\nYet as the president hopes to refocus the nation’s attention on his economic record ahead of next year’s critical midterm elections, it was another reminder that his own focus often remains somewhat adrift.\n\nTrump did periodically discuss the economy in his 90-minute speech, which he called a “quick little stop” in Rocky Mount on the way to Mar-a-Lago for the holidays. He trumpeted a report this week that showed inflation unexpectedly cooling. He recounted an announcement he made earlier in the day on lowering some drug prices. He framed an uptick in the unemployment rate as a success since he’d fired so many government workers.\n\nSupporters behind him held signs reading “Lower Prices” and “Bigger Paychecks.” But even the visual cues couldn’t keep the president from veering well off-piste — often to the delight of his crowd.\n\nAs he was explaining the negotiations that went into the drug pricing scheme, attendees listened politely, if quietly, as he assumed a French accent to mimic President Emmanuel Macron during their pharmaceutical negotiations.\n\nThe audience really came alive when he reminisced about his opponent from nearly a decade ago.\n\n“I don’t know, beating Hillary was fun,” he said to roars. “Remember, she was a nasty person. I was going to use a B word. I said, ‘my wife would not be happy.’”\n\nThere are plenty of Trump advisers who would prefer the president focus more on the here-and-now, or — even better — the what’s-to-come. As he loses his political edge on the economy, many of his allies worry he’s lost touch with voter concerns and anxieties that propelled him into office in the first place.\n\nFriday’s rally was the latest in a roadshow of sorts that White House advisers have planned for Trump to hone his message on bringing down prices. He also delivered a primetime address to the nation this week meant to drive the message.\n\nMuch of his argument rests on having inherited what he says was an economic disaster from Joe Biden, though inflation was at 3% when he took office and is now only slightly lower. (And economists cautioned that last month’s inflation dip had a lot to do with shutdown-related distortions of economic data.)\n\nYet as is so often the case, the intended content of Trump’s speech was a target that didn’t always find an arrow.\n\nAs he hit the hour mark, his grievance list grew, encompassing the news media and Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the onetime loyalist who has dramatically broken with him and whom Trump now calls “Marjorie Traitor Brown.”\n\nHis aside about Melania’s unmentionables came amid a diatribe over the investigations that plagued him during his time out of office. He mused about awarding himself a massive sum in connection with complaints he filed against the Justice Department.\n\n“I am suing and I’m the one that’s supposed to settle. So maybe I’ll give myself $1 billion and give it all to charity,” he said.\n\nTrump found ample distractions in the crowd, including a group of glamorous women from the western part of the state who volunteer at his events. When he spotted a hat he liked, he explained how he could gauge its value.\n\n“I want gold thread, not mustard color. You know?” he said. “When you have a mustard-colored thread, don’t accept it.”\n\nRecalling the times he came to purchase furniture in North Carolina as a hotelier, he explained the exacting nature of the task.\n\n“The arm of a chair was very important to me. I said, ‘I like that chair, but this arm has to be a different shape,’” he said. He kept going: “I’m a very aesthetic person, believe me, except with women, I don’t care what a woman looks like. I used to say beautiful. Now I don’t care.”\n\nHe spent several minutes discussing his physical health amid questions about his stamina after appearing to doze off during multiple on-camera events recently. He pointed to the string of cognitive tests he claims to have aced. And he pledged to alert the nation should he find himself in decline.\n\n“When that time comes, I will let you know about it. In fact, you’ll probably find out about it just by watching,” he said. “But that time is not now, because I feel the same that I felt for 50 years.”\n\nIt was, in the end, the same type of speech Trump has been delivering now for more than 10 years, the “weave” in which he takes great pride. It has less to do with a calculated political message than free-association of whatever’s on his mind — which is often the people or entities he thinks have done him wrong.\n\nIf some of his fixations cause heartburn among his allies, though, Trump has a different view.\n\n“I think I’m probably very neurotic,” he said in Rocky Mount. “I always say controlled neuroses is good. Being neurotic, no good. But if it’s controlled, that’s okay. It gives you some energy.”",

    "description": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.",
    "fullText": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.\n\nYesterday’s CPI report, showing inflation of 2.7 percent — well below the expected 3.1 percent — was bad political news for Democrats. Since “Liberation Day” in April, when President Trump rolled out tariffs aimed at resetting global trade in favor of U.S. companies, the left and their media allies have warned voters that the White House’s actions would clobber our economy and set inflation soaring.\n\nIt hasn’t happened. The tariffs have only modestly boosted prices. Instead, the Trump agenda of higher energy production, lower budget deficits and lighter regulation has brought inflation down. While inflation averaged 5 percent annually under former President Joe Biden, and in four years jumped by nearly 22 percent, as of November it is rising at 2.7 percent.\n\nWould you remind me again who created the “affordability crisis?”\n\nAs inflation continues to recede from the lofty 9 percent level recorded under Biden, voters may realize just how much damage was done by Joe’s budget-busting big government spending.\n\nAnother narrative that is under fire is that Trump-backed AI is a gift to billionaires but is going to destroy U.S. employment, much like the trade pacts of the 1990s that sent jobs overseas. But two new studies counter that claim. As it turns out, AI is actually creating jobs for Americans.\n\nIn its year-end note to investors, investment firm Vanguard writes that AI is not responsible for slowing job growth. They point to data showing that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”\n\nAccompanying graphs show hiring in AI-affected occupations growing at 1.7 percent during the two years mid-2023 to mid-2025, compared to only 1.0 percent pre-COVID, and compared to 0.8 percent for other kinds of jobs. Similarly, real wage growth for AI-involved hires is advancing at 3.8 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for other occupations.\n\nThe authors of the study suggest that “current AI systems are generally enhancing worker productivity and shifting workers’ tasks toward higher-value activities.”",

    "description": "Bank of America was among the first to flag a \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy, defined by robust growth and above-target inflation.",
    "fullText": "The US economy will keep burning hot in 2026, extending a yearslong run of dodging a recession.\n\nThat's a view that is increasingly being woven into consensus forecasts on Wall Street, where top researchers have generally brushed off the risks of a near-term recession and are anticipating another year of stable economic growth and hot inflation.\n\nBank of America dubbed this the \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy back in September, and others have since adopted the phrase.\n\nIn its year-ahead economic outlook, BofA said it believes growth will remain strong and inflation will stay above target next year, pointing to tailwinds such as the Fed's rate cuts, AI investment, more supportive trade policy, and stimulus in President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill.\n\n\"Tariff cuts, tax cuts, rate cuts…'run-it-hot' US policy, implicit guarantee economy & stocks 'too big to fail,'\" a team of analysts led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a separate client note this fall.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategists also unveiled their \"run it hot\" investment thesis heading into 2026, pointing to the Fed's rate-cutting cycle and the central bank's recent announcement that it would begin reserve management purchases.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it also saw economic growth remaining robust in 2026, thanks to the Fed cutting rates in a non-recessionary macro environment.\n\n\"Despite stagnant job growth, we expect policy rate cuts to limit labour market weakness and help extend the economic cycle further,\" Goldman said, though it noted that valuations in the stock market are already \"hot.\"\n\nHere's how the forecasters think investors should position themselves in a \"run it hot\" market.\n\nCommodities are the top run-it-hot trade heading into next year, Bank of America strategists wrote in a note in December.\n\nOil and energy are also favorable investments under the run-it-hot regime, they added.\n\n\"Trump runs it hot, oil bounces post Russia-Ukraine fix, China keeps yuan cheap, soon all the commodity charts will look like gold,\" strategists wrote. \"We say long commodities the best 'run it hot' trade in '26, and long despised oil/energy without question the best 'run-it-hot' contrarian trade.\"\n\nCyclical assets — which, by definition, tend to do well when the economy is expanding — are likely to benefit from the macro picture next year, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe bank pointed to areas like housing and consumer-facing sides of the market, which include consumer discretionary and retail stocks.\n\n\"After a patch of worry in November, cyclical assets—including cyclical equities and copper—have been rallying again. But even after these recent moves, we think our more optimistic growth views are not fully reflected in markets,\" the bank wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley thinks consumer discretionary goods investments fall into the \"run it hot\" investing playbook. The bank noted that firms generally have higher pricing power today, which should boost revenue growth.\n\nThat dynamic is already playing out in the discretionary goods sector, strategists said. The rate for top-line earnings beats in the sector for the third quarter clocked in at 6%, above the 2% rate for the overall S&P 500, per Morgan Stanley's analysis.\n\nSmall-cap stocks also look attractive, with earnings and pricing power in the sector poised to accelerate heading into next year, Morgan Stanley added.\n\n\"On the earnings front, the two most important aspects of our constructive call are the return of (1) positive operating leverage and (2) pricing power. This combination is especially impactful for the small cap earnings recovery we foresee into 2026,\" the bank's strategists added.\n\nForecasters at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have also issued bullish calls on small-cap stocks heading into 2026, largely because valuations in the sector are more attractive than in areas such as mega-cap tech stocks.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 18 (Reuters) - China on Thursday split off a Belgium-sized island with an economy comparable to a mid-sized country from the mainland for customs processing, part of a bid to join a major trans-Pacific trade deal and establish ​a new Hong Kong-style commercial hub.\n\nOfficials hope that turning the southern province of Hainan into a duty-free zone will spur foreign investment, ‌with goods that achieve at least 30% local value add able to move on into the world's second-largest economy tariff-free. Foreign firms will also be able to operate in service ‌sectors that are restricted on the mainland.\n\nChina is also seeking to boost its free-trade credentials to convince members of one of the world's largest free-trade deals, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), that it can meet the bloc's high standards for trade and investment openness through pilot projects such as the Hainan Free Trade Port.\n\n\"China aims to build the Hainan Free Trade Port into an important gateway that leads the country's opening-up into a new era,\" ⁠an editorial by the state news agency Xinhua said.\n\n\"It ‌is also expected to provide a huge boost for free trade that has been impacted by rising protectionism and unilateralism in recent years,\" the article added, in a veiled swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have pushed ‍policymakers to diversify China's $19 trillion economy from the world's top consumer market and take steps to further consolidate the manufacturing juggernaut's role in global supply chains.\n\nChina's leaders have made reversing a drop in investment a priority for next year, seeking to shift the economy from its current reliance on stimulus toward a dual focus on ​consumption and investment to stabilise growth in the near-term, while officials evaluate undertaking painful structural reforms needed to rebalance the economy long-term.\n\nForeign direct ‌investment into China fell 10.4% year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2025, official data shows.\n\nIf liberalisation succeeds in Hainan, economists say policymakers may feel emboldened to expose more of China's economy to market forces.\n\n\"The benchmark is something similar to Hong Kong,\" said Ran Guo, director for Consumer Economy at the China-Britain Business Council, who has been tracking the plan's developments for the past five years.\n\n\"In addition to boosting Hainan's tourism sector, the plan should also encourage more foreign investment and manufacturing,\" she added.",

    "fullText": "As SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) eyes going public via an IPO in 2026, what would such a move mean for the space economy, which for the longest time has been dominated by private companies?\n\nSpace Capital founder and CEO Chad Anderson comes on Market Catalysts to elaborate on the spark this could give the space industry and how it could influence more private operators to go public.\n\nAnderson is also the author of The Space Economy: Capitalize on the Greatest Business Opportunity of Our Lifetime.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nFor more on what a potential SpaceX IPO means for other space companies looking to go public, as well as just a general landscape for next year, I'm joined here on set by Chad Anderson, Space Capital founder and CEO. He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

    "fullText": "Growth in the US economy – and the president’s political survival – rest on AI. The EU must use its leverage and stand up to him\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars is waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models, often sold at big discounts, catering to their taste for fancy electronics and comfort.\n\nThat is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.\n\nA slowing economy hits the luxury market\n\nA prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.\n\nMany car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.\n\n“Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,” said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.\n\nThat trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.\n\nChinese automakers take a bigger bite\n\nWhile luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.\n\n“Their (Chinese carmakers’) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,” Yuan said. “That’s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.”\n\nThe Chinese brands’ share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.\n\nBYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for “new energy vehicles,” which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.",

    "title": "We Built Another Object Storage (and Why It's Different)",
    "description": "High-performance object storage exists, but the economics make it unusable at scale. FractalBits breaks out of the high-performance trap.",
    "fullText": "Object storage is the backbone of modern data infrastructure. AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO, Ceph, newer players like Tigris Data—the market is saturated. So why build another one?\n\nBecause the fundamental assumptions behind these systems are shifting. High performance is no longer optional—but having high performance available isn’t the same as being able to afford using it.\n\nTraditional object storage had a clear priority order: cost first, performance later. This worked fine for archiving backups and storing large, rarely accessed files.\n\nBut today, object storage is increasingly the primary data layer for AI, analytics, and cloud-native applications. Latency directly translates to compute costs—stalled GPUs waiting on I/O are expensive GPUs doing nothing.\n\nHigh-performance object storage exists now. S3 Express One Zone, for example, delivers single-digit millisecond latency. But there’s a catch: the per-request pricing makes it prohibitively expensive to actually use at high IOPS. As one analysis put it, it’s “the right technology, at the right time with the wrong price” [1]. You have the performance on paper, but you can’t afford to run your workload at full speed. That’s the high-performance trap.\n\nModern workloads, especially in AI, impose demands that strain traditional designs:\n\nSmall Objects at Scale: AI training datasets often consist of millions of small files (images, text snippets, feature vectors). A study of typical AI training workloads found over 60% of objects are 512KB or smaller [2]. This shifts the bottleneck from bandwidth to metadata performance.\n\nLatency Sensitivity: Training loops and inference pipelines are bottlenecked by I/O. When fetching thousands of small objects per batch, per-object latency compounds quickly, stalling expensive GPUs.\n\nThe Need for Directories: S3’s flat namespace is a mismatch for many workflows. Data scientists expect atomic renames and efficient directory listings—operations that are either slow or missing in classic object stores.\n\nA reasonable question: if you want directories and atomic rename, why not just use a filesystem like AWS EFS? Object stores and filesystems are different concepts—why blur the line?\n\nThe answer is that the line is already blurring, driven by real workload demands. AWS themselves recognized this when they introduced S3 Express One Zone with explicit “directory bucket” semantics and atomic rename support (currently single-object) [3]. Google Cloud has made similar moves toward hierarchical namespace support [4]. The industry is converging on this because the clean separation between “object storage for scale” and “filesystem for semantics” doesn’t match how modern applications actually work.\n\nWe’re not trying to build a POSIX filesystem. But the subset of filesystem semantics that matter for data workflows—efficient directory listings, atomic rename for safe data handoffs—these belong in object storage. The alternative is forcing every application to build fragile workarounds on top of a flat namespace.\n\nExisting systems struggle with these patterns in predictable ways:\n\nThe High-Performance Trap: High-performance tiers like S3 Express One Zone solve the latency problem, but the per-request cost means you can’t actually use that performance at scale. At 10K PUT/s, you’re looking at ~$29K/month in request fees alone. The performance is there; the economics aren’t.\n\nThe Small Object Tax: With cloud object storage, you pay per request. Storing billions of 4KB objects means your API request costs can exceed your storage costs. The more objects you have, the worse it gets.\n\nMissing Directory Semantics: The lack of atomic rename forces complex workarounds in applications, limiting what you can build directly on object storage. Most systems with rename support rely on inode-like structures that struggle with scalability and performance—adding to the per-IOPS cost burden.\n\nWe built FractalBits to break out of the high-performance trap: delivering performance you can actually afford to use at scale. In our benchmarks, we achieved nearly 1M GET/s on 4KB objects with a cluster totaling 64 cores across all data and metadata nodes.\n\nHere’s what the gap looks like for a small-object intensive workload (4KB objects, 10K IOPS):\n\nS3 costs based on public pricing ($0.00113/1K PUTs, $0.00003/1K GETs, $0.11/GB/Month). FractalBits estimated using 1-year reserved instance pricing for required compute (e.g., i8g.2xlarge for data, m7g.4xlarge for metadata). Your savings will vary based on workload, but the magnitude is indicative.\n\nAt our core is a metadata engine built on an on-disk radix tree, optimized for path-like keys.\n\nMost object stores use LSM-trees (good for writes, variable read latency) or B+ trees (predictable reads, write amplification). We chose a radix tree because it naturally mirrors a filesystem hierarchy:\n\nPrefix Sharing: Common path segments (e.g., /datasets/cifar10/) are stored once, saving memory and speeding up traversal.\n\nEfficient Directory Operations: Listing a directory becomes a subtree scan. Atomic rename is essentially updating a pointer at the branch point, not copying data.\n\nCrash Consistency: We use physiological logging to ensure metadata integrity and fast recovery.\n\nUnlike most systems that use inode-based (or inode-like) structures to support directory features, we use a full-path approach for better scalability and performance.\n\nWhy Zig?\n\nOur S3-compatible API server, built in Rust, manages the data path:\n\nSafety & Concurrency: Rust’s ownership model gives us thread safety without a garbage collector—important for high-concurrency request handling.\n\nAsync I/O: Built on Tokio for handling thousands of concurrent connections.\n\nProduction-Ready Frameworks: We support both axum and actix-web, defaulting to actix-web. Its thread-per-core architecture aligns with our design for maximum performance.\n\nFractalBits deploys as a managed software layer within your own cloud account (currently AWS only).\n\nFor us: We leverage the cloud’s proven infrastructure instead of building it from scratch, letting us focus on the storage engine itself.\n\nThe object storage market has high-performance options, but the economics often make that performance unusable at scale. And systems that do offer directory semantics often struggle with performance or scalability. Getting both at a reasonable cost is still rare. We think there’s room for a different approach.\n\nFractalBits is our answer. We’re early in this journey and learning from users who are pushing these limits.\n\nHitting the performance or cost wall with your current object storage? We’d be interested to hear about your use case.\n\n[1].

    "fullText": "The world is getting hotter, and if you think that means more sunbathing and beach days, think again. There are serious consequences to such a major shift in the climate, and ordinary people all around the world are starting to feel the effects. A new report released in early November in Belgium detailed the expected effect on the country's economy and people, and that report revealed that disaster is looming, Belga News Agency reported.\n\nThe Belgian Climate Risk Assessment came from the climate institute Cerac and is meant to advise the leaders of the country in the defense of its national security. Unfortunately, the findings of this study were bleak.\n\n\"The question is no longer if climate disasters will happen, but when and how we will respond,\" the report said, per Belga News Agency. \"This demands a shift in mindset in which climate change is considered a fundamental and society-wide threat for national security.\"\n\nCerac found that the changing climate threatens Belgium's economy, food supply, water, public health, mortality rate, and even tourism.\n\nWhile a few degrees' difference in temperature might not sound that significant, a shift in the average temperature leads to significant increases in extreme weather events, not to mention changes in agricultural conditions. These lead to economic losses through both natural disasters and the impact on farmers.\n\nMeanwhile, heat leads to a greater number of deaths, both directly through heatwaves and indirectly through the spread of mosquitoes that carry diseases. There are also subtler effects on public health, such as more severe allergy cases due to more pollen in the air and a greater strain on mental health in general.\n\nAll of these effects lead to economic strain, which could also lead to financial institutions and reinsurers leaving the market, causing greater costs for everyday Belgian citizens and business owners. The result is an expected uptick of about 15% in public debt in 2050.\n\nAll in all, ordinary people throughout the country will suffer as the world gets hotter.\n\nHaving the consequences of the changing climate spelled out so clearly can help policymakers prepare to meet these challenges head-on. For example, knowing that more expensive natural disasters are only a matter of time means that they can set money aside for disaster aid.\n\nHowever, the best possible outcome from this study would be a reduction in the air pollution that is driving the changes to the climate in the first place, in order to halt the planet's overheating.\n\nShould the government provide incentives to buy EVs?\n\nDepends on if it's federal or states\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "After years of wartime splurging, Russian shoppers are tightening their grip on their wallets — a shift that hints at growing stress in the country's economy.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending has weakened across most regions, the Central Bank of Russia said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nIn October and November, demand softened even as unemployment remained near historic lows and inflation expectations ticked higher.\n\n\"According to retailers across the country, an increasing share of products are being purchased during promotions, sales, and discounts. Household behavior has become more frugal,\" according to the central bank report.\n\nRetailers in many regions report weakening demand for big-ticket and nonessential goods, marking a clear cooling after the post-2022 consumer boom.\n\n\"More subdued consumption may indicate a gradual reduction in labor market overheating and more moderate expectations for future income dynamics,\" wrote Russia's central bank.\n\nIt's a notable shift for an economy that witnessed a boom in consumer spending after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, even amid sweeping sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThat boom was fueled by surging defense spending and intense competition for scarce workers. Wages jumped, and many households went on spending sprees.\n\nNow, that momentum appears to be fading.\n\nWage growth has slowed, and firms across multiple regions report reduced manpower demand and less urgency to hire, reflecting a cooling labor market, according to the central bank report.\n\nMany firms told the central bank they expect even more modest wage increases in 2026, suggesting that households may be bracing for leaner times.\n\nThe central bank's latest report arrives as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, and the limits of wartime economic stimulus become more apparent.\n\nOil and gas revenues — the backbone of Russia's budget — dropped 34% year-over-year in November.\n\nEven before this, analysts had warned that Russia's economy was being sustained largely by defense spending, subsidies, and emergency policy interventions.\n\nTop officials had sounded alarms. In December 2023, Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's central bank governor, warned that the economy was at risk of overheating.\n\nLast June, the head of Russia's largest bank said the economy was \"definitely and strongly overheated.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a deepening demographic crisis and ongoing competition for labor between the military and industry continue to weigh on Russia's growth prospects, both now and in the years ahead.",

    "description": "There are plenty of ominous signals out there that suggest we're late in the economic cycle. But Morgan Stanley says the worst is already behind us.",
    "fullText": "There are some ominous signals out there that suggest we're in the late stages of the economic cycle, but Morgan Stanley says investors should tune out the noise and brace for more growth ahead.\n\nADP private payrolls were negative in November. Challenger data shows layoffs at the highest levels in two decades. The unemployment rate is on the rise.\n\nBut as Morgan Stanley's equity research department sees things, the worst is already behind us.\n\nAndrew Pauker, a US equity strategist at the bank, laid out four reasons the economy — and therefore corporate earnings and the stock market — are in an \"early cycle\" environment.\n\nFirst, there has been a significant rebound in earnings revisions.\n\n\"Earnings revisions breadth for the S&P 500 troughed at negative 25% in April, it's now around positive 15%,\" Pauker told Business Insider. \"We typically only see these types of rebounds in early cycle environments. This is a clear sign to us that business confidence is improving.\"\n\nSecond, wage growth has slowed, giving profit margins room to expand. Here's the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker, showing a three-month moving average of wage growth at 4.1% year-over year. That's down from 6.7% in July 2022. Typically, this kind of decline happens during recessionary periods, Pauken said.\n\nThird, Pauker said consumer demand appears poised to accelerate. One signal for this is that companies are starting to exhibit higher pricing power, meaning they can increase prices without significantly impacting demand.\n\nAnd fourth, the Fed is cutting rates, a move intended to stimulate economic activity. After the Fed's December rate cut, Pauker and his team expect two cuts in 2026. He said the labor market will continue to show enough moderate weakness to continue to spur these cuts, but not enough weakness to throw the economy into a recessionary spiral.\n\nThe bank expects the S&P 500 to rise 14% in 2026, to 7,800, and Pauker also listed a few specific areas of the market he expects to outperform.\n\nPauker's highest conviction — and most out of consensus — call is \"overweight\" on consumer discretionary stocks after having rated them \"underweight\" for the last four years. The sector is historically cyclical, performing well during economic recoveries. It includes stocks that benefit from consumers spending on non-necessities — you might think of apparel companies like Nike or hotel firms like Marriott.\n\nSecond, and hand-in-hand with this call, is Pauker's expectations for small-caps to do well. Small-caps tend to be cyclical and benefit from falling interest rates, which they're more sensitive to than larger companies. Their margins should also get a boost from falling wage growth, Pauker said.\n\nHe pointed to rising earnings growth for the median stock in the Russell 2000, an index that tracks small-caps.\n\nThird, Pauker is bullish on the financials sector.\n\n\"The Senior Loan Officer Survey indicates that C&I loan growth is likely to improve next year, so that should benefit the banks,\" Pauker said. \"On top of that, earnings revisions, valuation and positioning are attractive for Financials.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley joins banks like HSBC, Bank of America, and JPMorgan in calling for the outperformance of cyclical stocks.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to these three areas of the market through funds like the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR), the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), and the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF).",

    "description": "The latest JOLTS report shows hiring stuck at 3.2% and quits falling again as the Fed prepares to cut rates.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zandi is worried that the labor market no longer has a buffer.\n\nSo many Americans are “already living on the financial edge,” the chief economist for Moody’s Analytics told Fortune. If they start to pull back, that’s “fodder for a recession.”\n\nThe stark assessment comes as hiring has stalled, unemployment is rising—especially for the most vulnerable workers—and layoff announcements are piling up. To Zandi, the next stage is already visible: “If we actually do see layoffs pick up,” he told Fortune, “then it certainly would be a jobs recession.”\n\nZandi reached that assessment before the government released its long-delayed JOLTS report Tuesday, but the official numbers largely confirm the pullback he has been tracking through private data. Since the summer, job openings have risen by only a few hundred thousand and remain far below the highs seen in the frenzy of the pandemic. Layoffs upticked slightly, while quit rates fell, a sign that workers are increasingly hesitant to leave their current positions. Hiring, meanwhile, has held at 3.2%, a level consistent with employers who are not actively slashing staff but are no longer expanding their workforces either: a “low hire, low fire” market.\n\nIf the cooling in the official data looks slow, the private indicators tell a sharper story. ADP’s November report found that private employers cut 32,000 jobs, the steepest decline in more than two years. Nearly all of those losses came from small businesses, which eliminated 120,000 positions. Larger employers moved in the opposite direction and kept hiring.\n\nFor Zandi, the pattern is not random. He sees it as the continuation of a break that appeared earlier in the year, when the administration escalated reciprocal tariffs.\n\n“If you look at when job growth really came to a standstill, it is back soon after Liberation Day,” he said.\n\nBecause these firms often lack the financial cushions that larger corporations can draw upon, payroll becomes the most immediate and often the only mechanism through which they can respond to rising input costs. The result, Zandi argues, is a labor market in which the earliest fractures appear among precisely the kinds of employers most sensitive to policy and price shifts. Those fractures then begin to ripple outward, first through hiring freezes and only later, if conditions worsen, through broader layoffs.\n\nSo for Zandi, if ADP offers a snapshot of the present, the data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas hints at what may lie ahead. Employers have announced 1.1 million layoffs this year, a figure surpassed only during the pandemic shock of 2020 and the depths of the Great Recession. These announcements are global, and not all will materialize as U.S. cuts, Zandi advised, yet he considers their scale meaningful because they reflect decisions made months in advance of actual separations.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump is touring swing states to defend his tariffs and sell the message that the economy is booming.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is standing by his tariffs, at least in theory.\n\nUnder the banner \"Lower Prices, Bigger Paychecks,\" Trump kicked off the first of a series of speeches to promote his economic message in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, as polls indicate the country is increasingly concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\n\"They always have a hoax,\" Trump told the crowd, referring to criticism from Democrats that his policies drove up prices. \"The new word is 'affordability.'\"\n\n\"Democrats are like, 'prices are too high.' Yeah, they're too high because they cause them to be too high,\" Trump added. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nLater, he said, \"I can't say affordability is a hoax because I agree the prices were too high. So I can't go to call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"\n\nTrump, during the 90-minute speech, also reiterated that his favorite word is \"tariff\" and credited his policies for bringing in \"hundreds of billions of dollars,\" presumably for the government in tariff revenue.\n\n\"You can give up certain products,\" Trump said at one point. \"You could give up pencils. Because under the China policy, you know, every child can get 37 pencils. They only need one or two, you know. They don't need that many.\"\n\nDespite standing by his tariff policies, Trump has, in reality, rolled back many of his earlier tariffs, especially ones enacted on April 2.\n\nTariffs are still higher than they have been in many decades, but the original 25% tariff on every import from Mexico and Canada was walked back to exclude all items covered in the USMCA trade agreement, which includes most imports from the two neighbors. Tariffs on imports from China, once more than 100%, have been reduced to a baseline tariff of 10%, which applies to all other countries.\n\nOn top of that, in an attempt to address the price of groceries, Trump also modified and removed tariffs on a range of food products in November, such as beef, coffee, bananas, and tomatoes.\n\nOf the remaining tariffs, evidence points to an impact on the price of consumer goods.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" according to a report published in October by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis that looked at data from January to August of this year. \"The rise in prices beginning in early 2025 coincides closely with tariff developments, and our model-based regressions confirm that these effects are statistically and economically significant.\"\n\n\"At the same time, the pass-through remains partial; only a portion of the model-predicted effect has materialized so far,\" the report added. \"This could reflect delays in price adjustments, competitive pressure limiting firms' ability to raise prices, or expectations that the tariffs may prove temporary.\"\n\nTrump's speech comes as consumer sentiment remains low. According to the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, sentiment dropped to 51 points in November, which is the second-lowest score the index has ever recorded since 1952, narrowly topped by a score of 50 in June 2022.\n\nEarlier on Monday, in an interview with Politico, Trump said that he would give his economy a grade of \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"\n\nSome Democrats have centered their pre-2026 midterm messaging on affordability, and several have explicitly blamed rising costs on Trump's tariff and trade policies. Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, with whom Trump had a meeting, also won while running primarily on making the city more affordable.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Each city earned a score out of 100 possible points.\n\nLeander stood out, the analysis said, for its safety ranking — No. 1 statewide — and it also secured the No. 2 spot for its booming economy.\n\nHowever, the city’s rankings were more modest in other areas. The report ranked Leader No. 12 for health care and education, No. 32 for affordability and No. 40 for quality of life.\n\n“Leander’s origin dates back to the 1880s, when a rail line was constructed to connect Austin to Abilene,” the report said. “Nowhere among Texas’ largest cities is violent crime less common, and over the past five years, no metro area has experienced faster job growth.”\n\nThe suburb, which has a population of around 78,000, was also ranked as one of the top ten places to live by U.S. News and World Reports for 2025-2026.\n\nThe top four cities on the ConsumerAffairs list were all in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, followed by Leander and then Round Rock at No. 9.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.\n\nThe trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThe president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.\n\n“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”\n\nThe president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nAs home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.\n\nIt's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.\n\nWiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”\n\nThe challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.\n\nAsked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nTrump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.\n\nThe U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.\n\nSince the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
