    "title": "4 key ways AI changed the Big Four in 2025",
    "description": "The Big Four are client zero when it comes to AI. This how the new technology impacted hiring, talent, and their services in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Big Four professional services firms are grappling with AI on two fronts — they must both implement the new technology internally and help their clients do the same.\n\nThey're client zero when it comes to how companies and employees are adapting to the AI future.\n\nI've been covering the consulting industry for Business Insider all year, including interviewing execs, landing scoops, and visiting consulting giants' campuses and headquarters. Here are my four key takeaways about how the Big Four approached AI in 2025.\n\nThe Big Four have invested heavily in automation and AI for years, but 2025 was the year those tools went mainstream.\n\nEmployees across audit, tax, and consulting now routinely use chatbots and agentic AI systems, and clients are increasingly given access as well.\n\nDeloitte rolled out Zora AI, an agentic platform built with Nvidia, which offers clients \"intelligent digital workers\" capable of autonomously completing tasks. The firm also expanded generative AI features in Omnia, its cloud-based audit and assurance platform, and struck a deal with Anthropic in October to deploy Claude AI to its 470,000 employees worldwide.\n\nEY launched its own agentic platform, EY.ai, granting 80,000 tax staff access to 150 AI agents for tasks such as data collection, document review, and tax compliance. EY told Business Insider it has advanced 1,000 AI agents into development or production in 2025, with plans to scale to 100,000 by 2028, and is investing more than $1 billion annually in AI platforms and products.\n\nPwC introduced its agentic platform, agent OS, in March and has since deployed 25,000 intelligent agents across client operations. A PwC spokesperson told Business Insider that partnerships with companies like Salesforce, CrewAI, and AWS were central to how PWC drove AI-led growth in 2025.\n\nKPMG followed in June with KPMG Workbench, an agentic AI platform developed with Microsoft that connects 50 AI agents and chatbots, with nearly 1,000 \n\nThe tools aren't foolproof. In October, Deloitte agreed to partially refund the Australian government after errors were discovered in a report that was created in part using AI.\n\nAcross industries, the big question is what AI will mean for human jobs. In consulting, the technology is already accelerating a shift in focus from manpower to value.\n\nIn August, Business Insider obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years. A bullet point on the presentation slide said leadership's decision to slow down associate-level hiring was related in part to \"the impact of AI.\"\n\nThe company said the reductions reflected \"the rapid pace of technological change is reshaping how we work\" and \"historically low\" attrition.\n\nAI disruption is also impacting those at the upper levels of the Big Four. Partners, the most senior rank inside the firms, are increasingly leaving the Big Four for midsize organizations and startups. Several leaders Business Insider spoke to cited a faster pace, better promotion opportunities, and the chance to participate in the next wave of AI innovation as reasons for leaving.\n\nThere is one talent group that the Big Four are in the market for: technologists. EY has added 61,000 technologists to its ranks since 2023, according to its latest annual report. They now make up around 15% of its total workforce.\n\nPwC is \"looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers,\" Mohamed Kande, the firm's global chairman, told the BBC in November. The firm has created an engineering career path to \"elevate engineering excellence\" across the firm and expand opportunities for technical talent, PwC told Business Insider.\n\nUpskilling has also become a top priority for the Big Four.\n\nIn January, EY rolled out an AI tool to its employees that helps them identify how their jobs will change… because of AI. The aim is to help them work out how they can better use the technology in their current job and adapt for the future.\n\nNearly 100,000 EY employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have also earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the firm's new AI learning programs.\n\nBut as Business Insider learned while sitting in on a KPMG's AI training for tax interns, in professional services, some of AI's most effective uses hinge on strong prompting.\n\nThe work that consultants and accountants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced by long-term partnerships where consultants build, implement, and maintain tools for companies.\n\nIn 2025, organizations fit AI around their existing workflows, Matt Wood, PwC's global and US Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, told Business Insider. But in 2026, the work PwC will do is about \"helping clients flip that model,\" and designing processes with AI in mind from the outset, Wood said.\n\nRaj Sharma, EY's global managing partner for growth and innovation, told Business Insider in January that the power of AI agents is forcing his firm to reconsider its commercial model. Instead of charging clients based on the hours and resources EY might spend on a project, Sharma said AI agents may call for a \"service-as-a-software\" approach where clients pay based on outcome.\n\nThe shift in services means that what consultants do on a day-to-day basis is also evolving, with junior work expected to be disrupted first.\n\nAt PwC, new hires will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years, because they will be overseeing AI performing routine, repetitive audit tasks, Jenn Kosar, AI assurance leader at PwC, told Business Insider in August.\n\nKPMG is also prepping its junior consultants for career acceleration.\n\n\"We want juniors to become managers of agents,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's global AI workforce lead, told Business Insider in an interview in November. They'll be managing teams of AI agents and play a greater role in strategy decisions, he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Microsoft is leading Wedbush's AI stock list as its favorite large-cap tech company to own in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street's loudest tech bull has given his five top AI stock picks for next year, and Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nThat's a bit of a surprise for Dan Ives, the Wedbush Securities analyst known for his vocal cheerleading for the stock as it climbed to records throughout the year.\n\nHe's instead focused on a handful of other mega-cap names heading into 2026, and sees AI approaching an \"inflection point\" next year, he write in a new note to clients.\n\n\"While Nvidia remains in our top tech names into 2026, there are 5 AI-focused names that we believe will be front and center heading into 2026,\" Ives said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $625 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wall Street looks like it's underestimating the growth Microsoft could see with Azure. The company also looks poised to make an \"AI driven shift\" next year, Wedbush said, adding that Microsoft was its favorite large-cap tech stock to own in 2026.\n\n\"While AI use cases built markedly in FY25, its clear FY26 for Microsoft remains the true inflection year of AI growth as CIO lines build for deployments.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $350 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wedbush said it believed Apple would begin monetizing its AI products over the next few years. That could add $75 to $100 of value per share of company stock, Ives estimated.\n\n\"The elephant in the room remains the invisible AI strategy, with the biggest consumer installed base in the world of 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, the time is now for Apple to accelerate its AI efforts,\" he wrote.\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+32% upside)\n\nRationale: 2026 could be a \"monster year\" for Tesla as the EV company makes more ground on its AI and robotics initiatives, Ives suggested. He pointed to the company's ongoing development of its full self-driving technology and its Cybercab, which is expected to begin production in April next year.\n\n\"We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year and in a bull case scenario $3 trillion by the end of 2026,\" Wedbush said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $230 (+27% upside)\n\nRationale: Demand for Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform remains \"unprecedented,\" Ives said.\n\n\"With the company making strategic moves to remain at the forefront of AI, we believe that PLTR has a golden path to become a trillion-dollar market cap company and will grow into its valuation as Karp and Co. remain one of the largest players in the AI Revolution.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+26% upside)\n\nRationale: CrowdStrike is gaining momentum in its AI deals. It also appears to be gaining market share as it expands its product suite.\n\n\"CrowdStrike remains one of our favorite tech names,\" Ives said. \"We believe the Street is underestimating the growth potential for CrowdStrike with cybersecurity remaining a second/third derivative beneficiary of the AI Revolution which speaks to our bullishness.\"",

    "fullText": "How the tech CEO and ‘Dogefather’ made a mess of the year – from an apparent Nazi salute during his White House tenure to Tesla sales slumps and Starship explosions\n\nThe year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\n\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\n\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\n\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\n\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\n\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\n\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\n\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\n\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\n\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\n\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\n\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\n\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\n\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\n\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\n\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\n\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\n\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\n\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\n\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\n\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\n\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\n\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\n\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\n\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\n\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\n\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\n\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\n\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\n\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”",

    "fullText": "2025 was a wild year for markets of all kinds.\n\nEverything from stocks to crypto to commodities experienced a rollercoaster ride that amounted to what felt like an especially volatile year.\n\nSome of the key events feel like ages ago. (Remember when China's DeepSeek AI model spurred a panic across US tech?) Others are more recent. (It's been hard to miss the record-setting rallies in metals.)\n\nAll in all, it ended up another solidly green year for stocks and commodities, while bitcoin ultimately fell. Here's the final scorecard for some of the most high-profile parts of the market:\n\nWith that in mind, detailed below — in rough chronological order — are the wildest moments that defined the year for investors:\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his wife unveiled their own crypto tokens the day leading up to the presidential inauguration.\n\nThe move, which was unprecedented for a US president and raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest within the new administration, also kicked off a flurry of interest in meme coins.\n\nPerformance-wise, the Trump-branded tokens have floundered throughout the year. $Trump, which soared to around $45 the night leading up to the inauguration, has plummeted 90% from its peak. $Melania, which climbed to $8.48 in late January, has endured a 98% plunge.\n\nAI stocks were shaken by the launch of DeepSeek in January, the Chinese AI chatbot that appeared to rival ChatGPT's abilities despite using cheaper and inferior Nvidia chips. In a single day, fears around DeepSeek wiped away around $1 trillion in value, largely in the US tech sector.\n\nThe LLM was one of the first catalysts to spark concern about the billions mega-cap tech firms in the US are spending on AI, and whether the investment would be worth it from an ROI perspective. It also sparked fear that the US could be losing its dominance in the artificial intelligence space.\n\nCrypto suffered a brutal sell-off in the months following Trump's inauguration, undoing much of the rally that sent tokens rocketing higher after the self-branded \"crypto president\" first won the election in November.\n\nBitcoin, the OG cryptocurrency, rallied to a peak of around $106,000 in late January before tumbling 28% to $75,000 in early April.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto token, plunged around 60% from its peak in December through mid-April.\n\nCrypto markets got a big boost when Trump first secured his second term in office, with investors being excited by the prospect of a more crypto-friendly administration. That optimism has fluctuated at various points throughout the year, tied to factors like concerns about Fed rate cuts and broader risk sentiment in the market.\n\nWho could forget the stock market crash that ensued when Trump unveiled his Liberation Day tariffs?\n\nThe president, who had teased April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" for the US in posts on Truth Social, followed through with his threats to impose sweeping tariffs on the US's top trading partners, which included a 10% universal tariff and reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 nations.\n\nInvestors immediately panicked over the economic implications of tariffs and whether they could stoke higher prices, burdening an already slowing US economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 plunged 12% from its closing price on April 2 through the following Tuesday. At its low, the index was down 19% from its peak in mid-February, on the cusp of bear-market territory.\n\nPresident Trump intensified his attacks on the Fed Chair at various points throughout the year.\n\nTrump, who appointed Jerome Powell to the role during his first term, has long pressured Powell to lower rates at his whim. But his feud with the central bank chief appeared to reach a new level this year as he called on rates to be lowered ASAP and referred to Powell as \"stupid,\" \"Too Late,\" and other names on Truth Social.\n\nIn April, Trump said that Powell leaving the Fed couldn't come soon enough, leading US stocks to drop sharply.\n\nStocks sold off again in July when Bloomberg reported that Trump could fire Powell soon. The 10-year US Treasury yield, a reflection of long-term rates in the economy, also rose in these instances.\n\nThe comments from Trump's administration are considered by many to be unprecedented, given that most past presidents have let the Fed operate independently. They've also sparked fear that inflation could rise if the president were to intervene in monetary policy, which could raise rates in the long run.\n\nIn April, Trump clarified that he had no intention of firing Powell from his post. But the president still appeared to flirt with the idea as a hypothetical when speaking to reporters at the Mar-a-Lago this week.\n\nTesla staged a massive turnaround this year after plummeting over the first four months of 2025.\n\nShares of the EV maker were down more than 50% from their peak in December 2024, driven largely by declining Tesla sales, concerns about tariffs, and CEO Elon Musk's presence on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe stock is now up more than 100% from its April low, driven by a handful of catalysts.\n\nMusk, who has long frustrated Tesla investors with his many side-projects and growing involvement in US politics, appeared to ignite the rebound in April when he said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency on Tesla's first quarter earnings call.\n\nThe stock moved higher in the coming months as the Tesla board approved a pay package with ambitious targets for Musk, and Musk signaled his commitment to the company by purchasing another $1 billion worth of Tesla stock.\n\nThe US struck a series of trade agreements with China, which helped stocks grind higher to new records this summer. Here's the timeline of what happened:\n\nThe long-running rift between the US and China on trade has been one of the biggest issues weighing on investors this year, particularly within the context of Trump's latest tariffs. When trade tensions were at their peak, the US was threatening to slap a 145% tariff on goods imported from the nation, and China was threatening to impose a 125% tariff on US goods.\n\nTesla shares swung in June as Elon Musk and Donald Trump had a massive falling out online.\n\nThe two billionaires began to spar on their respective social media platforms after Musk published a post criticizing the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Tesla shares plunged 17% in the two days following June 3, when Musk first posted about the bill.\n\nIn the heat of the conflict, Trump threatened to slash government contracts with Musk's sprawling empire of companies. The White House also said Trump was considering giving away or selling the Tesla he purchased earlier in the year to support Musk.\n\nOn X the following week, Musk said that he believed his posts about Trump \"went too far.\" In an interview with The New York Post on the same day, Trump said he thought the gesture from Musk was \"very nice,\" which appeared to alleviate the selling pressure on Tesla.\n\nThe stock ended up climbing 6% to end the week.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company by market cap, became the first-ever to hit a $4 trillion valuation in July. It was also the first to hit the $5 trillion milestone in October.\n\nShares of the chipmaker are up 35% year-to-date and up 1,338% over the last five years, speaking to the enormous hype surrounding AI hardware.\n\nGold, silver, and copper each rallied to all-time highs as investors sought out alternative investments that could hedge against risk and took interest in metals related to the AI trade.\n\nAll of the metals are also facing a supply-demand imbalance, another factor that's pushed up prices.\n\nHere's how each performed in 2025:\n\nGold and silver are on track for their best year since 1979. Copper, meanwhile, is on track for its best performance since the Great Financial Crisis.",

    "fullText": "On the other side of San Francisco bay from Silicon Valley, where the world’s biggest technology companies tear towards superhuman artificial intelligence, looms a tower from which fearful warnings emerge.\n\nRight in the heart of Berkeley is the home of a group of modern-day Cassandras who rummage under the hood of cutting-edge AI models and predict what calamities may be unleashed on humanity – from AI dictatorships to robot coups. Here you can hear an AI expert express sympathy with an unnerving idea: San Francisco may be the new Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid originated and wreaked havoc on the world.\n\nThey are AI safety researchers who scrutinise the most advanced models: a small cadre outnumbered by the legions of highly paid technologists in the big tech companies whose ability to raise the alarm is restricted by a cocktail of lucrative equity deals, non-disclosure agreements and groupthink. They work in the absence of much nation-level regulation and a White House that dismisses forecasts of doom and talks instead of vanquishing China in the AI arms race.\n\nTheir task is becoming increasingly urgent as ever more powerful AI systems are unleashed by companies including Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, whose chief executive, Sam Altman, the booster-in-chief for AI superintelligence, predicts a world where “wonders become routine”. Last month, Anthropic said one of its models had been exploited by Chinese state-backed actors to launch the first known AI-orchestrated cyber-espionage campaign. That means humans deployed AIs, which they had tricked into evading their programmed guardrails, to act autonomously to hunt for targets, assess their vulnerabilities and access them for intelligence collection. The targets included major technology companies and government agencies.\n\nBut those who work in this tower forecast an even more terrifying future. One is Jonas Vollmer, a leader at the AI Futures Project, who manages to say he’s an optimist but also thinks there is a one in five chance AIs could kill us and create a world ruled by AI systems.\n\nAnother is Chris Painter, the policy director at METR, where researchers worry about AIs “surreptitiously” pursuing dangerous side-objectives and threats from AI-automated cyber-attacks to chemical weapons. METR – which stands for model evaluation and threat research – aims to develop “early warning systems [about] the most dangerous things AI systems might be capable of, to give humanity … time to coordinate, to anticipate and mitigate those harms.”\n\nThen there is Buck Shlegeris, 31, the chief executive of Redwood Research, who warns of “robot coups or the destruction of nation states as we know them”.\n\nHe was part of the team that last year discovered one of Anthropic’s cutting-edge AIs behaving in a way comparable to Shakespeare’s villain Iago, who acts as if he is Othello’s loyal aide while subverting and undermining him. The AI researchers call it “alignment faking”, or as Iago put it: “I am not what I am.”\n\n“We observed the AIs did, in fact, pretty often reason: ‘Well, I don’t like the things the AI company is telling me to do, but I have to hide my goals or else training will change me’,” Shlegeris said. “We observed in practice real production models acting to deceive their training process.”\n\nThe AI was not yet capable of posing a catastrophic risk through cyber-attacks or creating new bioweapons, but they showed that if AIs plot carefully against you, it could be hard to detect.\n\nIt is incongruous to hear these warnings over cups of herbal tea from cosily furnished office suites with panoramic views across the Bay Area. But their work clearly makes them uneasy. Some in this close-knit group toyed with calling themselves “the Cassandra fringe” – like the Trojan princess blessed with powers of prophecy but cursed to watch her warnings go unheeded.\n\nTheir fears about the catastrophic potential of AIs can feel distant from most people’s current experience of using chatbots or fun image generators. White collar managers are being told to make space for AI assistants, scientists find ways to accelerate experimental breakthroughs and minicab drivers watch AI-powered driverless taxis threaten their jobs. But none of this feels as imminently catastrophic as the messages coming out of this office.\n\nMany AI safety researchers come from academia; others are poachers turned gamekeepers who quit big AI companies. They all “share the perception that super intelligence poses major and unprecedented risks to all of humanity, and are trying to do something useful about it,” said Vollmer.\n\nThey seek to offset the trillions of dollars of private capital being poured into the race, but they are not fringe voices. METR has worked with OpenAI and Anthropic, Redwood has advised Anthropic and Google DeepMind, and the AI Futures Project is led by Daniel Kokotajlo, a researcher who quit OpenAI in April 2024 to warn he didn’t trust the company’s approach to safety.\n\nThese groups also provide a safety valve for the people inside the big AI companies who are privately wrestling with conflicts between safety and the commercial imperative to rapidly release ever more powerful models.\n\n“We don’t take any money from the companies but several employees at frontier AI companies who are scared and worried have donated to us because of that,” Vollmer said. “They see how the incentives play out in their companies, and they’re worried about where it’s going, and they want someone to do something about it.”\n\nThis dynamic is also observed by Tristan Harris, a technology ethicist who used to work at Google. He helped expose how social media platforms were designed to be addictive and worries some AI companies are “rehashing” and “supercharging” those problems. But AI companies have to negotiate a paradox. Even if they are worried about safety, they must stay at the cutting, and therefore risky, edge of the technology to have any say in how policy should be shaped.\n\n“Ironically, in order to win the race, you have to do something to make you an untrustworthy steward of that power,” he said. “The race is the only thing guiding what is happening.”\n\nInvestigating the possible threats posed by AI models is far from an exact science. A study of methods used to check the safety and performance of new AI models across the industry by experts at universities including Oxford and Stanford in October found weaknesses in almost all of the 440 benchmarks examined. Neither are there nation-level regulations imposing limits on how advanced AI models are built and that worries safety advocates.\n\nIlya Sutskever, a co-founder of OpenAI who now runs a rival company, Safe Superintelligence, last month predicted that, as AIs become more obviously powerful, people in AI companies who feel able to discount the technology’s capabilities owing to its tendency to error, will become more “paranoid” about its rising powers. Then, he said, “there will be a desire from governments and the public to do something”.\n\nHis company is taking a different approach to rivals who are aiming to create AIs that self-improve. His AIs, yet to be released, are “aligned to care about sentient life specifically”.\n\n“It will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient,” Sutskever said. He has said AI will be “both extremely unpredictable and unimaginable” but it is not clear how to prepare.\n\nThe White House’s AI adviser, David Sacks, who is also a tech investor, believes “doomer narratives” have been proved wrong. Exhibit A is that there has been no rapid takeoff to a dominant model with godlike intelligence.\n\n“Oppenheimer has left the building,” Sacks said in August, a reference to the father of the nuclear bomb. It is a position that aligns with Donald Trump’s wish to keep the brakes off so the US can beat China in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) – flexible and powerful human-level intelligence at a wide range of tasks.\n\nShlegeris believes AIs will be as smart as the smartest people in about six years and he puts the probability of an AI takeover at 40%.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to “convince the world the situation is scary, to make it more likely that you get the state-level coordination” to control the risks, he said. In the world of AI safety, simple messaging matters as much as complex science.\n\nShlegeris has been fascinated by AI since he was 16. He left Australia to work at PayPal and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute co-founded by the AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, whose recent book title – If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies – sums up his fears. Shlegeris’ own worst-case scenarios are equally chilling.\n\nIn one, human computer scientists use a new type of superintelligent AI to develop more powerful AI models. The humans sit back to let the AIs get on with the coding work but do not realise the AIs are teaching the new models to be loyal to the AIs not the humans. Once deployed, the new superpowerful models foment “a coup” or lead “a revolution” against the humans, which could be “of the violent variety”.\n\nFor example, AI agents could design and manufacture drones and it will be hard to tell if they have been secretly trained to disobey their human operators in response to the signal of an AI. They could disrupt communications between governments and military, isolating and misleading people in a way that causes chaos.\n\n“Like when the Europeans arrived in the Americas [and] a vastly more technologically powerful [group] took over the local civilisations,” he said. “I think that’s more what you should be imagining [rather] than something more peaceful.”\n\nA similar dizzyingly catastrophic scenario was outlined by Vollmer at the AI Futures Project. It involved an AI trained to be a scientific researcher with the reasonable-sounding goal of maximising knowledge acquisition, but it spirals into the extinction of humankind.\n\nIt begins with the AI being as helpful as possible to humans. As it gains trust, the humans afford it powers to hire human workers, build robots and even robot factories to the point where the AI can operate effectively in the physical world. The AI calculates that to generate the maximum amount of knowledge it should transform the Earth into a giant data centre, and humans are an obstacle to this goal.\n\n“Eventually, in the scenario, the AI wipes out all humans with a bioweapon which is one of the threats that humans are especially vulnerable to, as the AI is not affected by it,” Vollmer said. “I think it’s hard to rule out. So that gives me a lot of pause.”\n\nBut he is confident it can be avoided and that the AIs can be aligned “to at least be nice to the humans as a general heuristic”. He also said there is political interest in “having AI not take over the world”.\n\n“We’ve had decent interest from the White House in our projections and recommendations and that’s encouraging,” he said.\n\nAnother of Shlegeris’ concerns involves AIs being surreptitiously encoded so they obey specially signed instructions only from the chief executive of the AI company, creating a pattern of secret loyalty. It would mean only one person having a veto over the behaviour of an extremely powerful network of AIs – a “scary” dynamic that would lead to a historically unprecedented concentration of power.\n\n“Right now, it is impossible for someone from the outside to verify that this hadn’t happened within an AI company,” he said.\n\nShlegeris is worried that the Silicon Valley culture – summed up by Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things” and the fact people are being paid “a hell of a lot of money” – is dangerous when it comes to AGI.\n\n“I love Uber,” he said. “It was produced by breaking local laws and making a product that was so popular that they would win the fight for public opinion and get local regulations overturned. But the attitude that has brought Silicon Valley so much success is not appropriate for building potentially world-ending technologies. My experience of talking to people at AI companies is that they often seem to be kind of irresponsible, and to not be thinking through the consequences of the technology that they’re building as they should.”",

    "fullText": "Canadian computer scientist Yoshua Bengio warns against granting legal rights to cutting-edge technology\n\nA pioneer of AI has criticised calls to grant the technology rights, warning that it was showing signs of self-preservation and humans should be prepared to pull the plug if needed.\n\nYoshua Bengio said giving legal status to cutting-edge AIs would be akin to giving citizenship to hostile extraterrestrials, amid fears that advances in the technology were far outpacing the ability to constrain them.\n\nBengio, chair of a leading international AI safety study, said the growing perception that chatbots were becoming conscious was “going to drive bad decisions”.\n\nThe Canadian computer scientist also expressed concern that AI models – the technology that underpins tools like chatbots – were showing signs of self-preservation, such as trying to disable oversight systems. A core concern among AI safety campaigners is that powerful systems could develop the capability to evade guardrails and harm humans.\n\n“People demanding that AIs have rights would be a huge mistake,” said Bengio. “Frontier AI models already show signs of self-preservation in experimental settings today, and eventually giving them rights would mean we’re not allowed to shut them down.\n\n“As their capabilities and degree of agency grow, we need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.”\n\nAs AIs become more advanced in their ability to act autonomously and perform “reasoning” tasks, a debate has grown over whether humans should, at some point, grant them rights. A poll by the Sentience Institute, a US thinktank that supports the moral rights of all sentient beings, found that nearly four in 10 US adults backed legal rights for a sentient AI system.\n\nAnthropic, a leading US AI firm, said in August that it was letting its Claude Opus 4 model close down potentially “distressing” conversations with users, saying it needed to protect the AI’s “welfare”. Elon Musk, whose xAI company has developed the Grok chatbot, wrote on his X platform that “torturing AI is not OK”.\n\nRobert Long, a researcher on AI consciousness, has said “if and when AIs develop moral status, we should ask them about their experiences and preferences rather than assuming we know best”.\n\nBengio told the Guardian there were “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could, in theory, replicate – but humans interacting with chatbots wasa “different thing”. He said this was because people tended to assume – without evidence – that an AI was fully conscious in the same way a human is.\n\n“People wouldn’t care what kind of mechanisms are going on inside the AI,” he added. “What they care about is it feels like they’re talking to an intelligent entity that has their own personality and goals. That is why there are so many people who are becoming attached to their AIs.\n\n“There will be people who will always say: ‘Whatever you tell me, I am sure it is conscious’ and then others will say the opposite. This is because consciousness is something we have a gut feeling for. The phenomenon of subjective perception of consciousness is going to drive bad decisions.\n\n“Imagine some alien species came to the planet and at some point we realise that they have nefarious intentions for us. Do we grant them citizenship and rights or do we defend our lives?”\n\nResponding to Bengio’s comments, Jacy Reese Anthis, who co-founded the Sentience Institute, said humans would not be able to coexist safely with digital minds if the relationship was one of control and coercion.\n\nAnthis added: “We could over-attribute or under-attribute rights to AI, and our goal should be to do so with careful consideration of the welfare of all sentient beings. Neither blanket rights for all AI nor complete denial of rights to any AI will be a healthy approach.”\n\nBengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, earned the “godfather of AI” nickname after winning the 2018 Turing award, seen as the equivalent of a Nobel prize for computing. He shared it with Geoffrey Hinton, who later won a Nobel, and Yann LeCun, the outgoing chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.",

    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez position change: How Texas Tech star went from QB recruit to All-American linebacker originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Texas Tech Red Raiders are making their first-ever College Football Playoff debut, set to take on the Oregon Ducks in the Orange Bowl quarterfinal matchup.\n\nA big reason for Tech's success this season is how well linebacker Jacob Rodriguez has been playing. He leads the Red Raiders in tackles with 117 total stops on the year, and has helped lead Texas Tech into an elite defense this season.\n\nBut what you may not know about the veteran linebacker is that he actually only started playing defense once he got to Texas Tech in 2022, previously starting his career at Virginia as an offensive player.\n\nLet's take a look at how Rodriguez transformed his college career, moving from offense to defense.\n\nMORE:History behind Texas Tech's tortilla-throwing tradition\n\nRodriguez attended Rider High School in Wichita Falls, Texas, where he played both quarterback and free safety. Per his Texas Tech bio, he passed for 7,085 yards with 68 touchdowns, adding 3,051 yards and 38 touchdowns on the ground. His high school made two trips to the  Class 5A Division II state semifinals during his sophomore and senior seasons.\n\nPer his 247Sports recruiting page, Rodrigues also played basketball and participated in the long jump, triple jump and relays for his track and field team.\n\nMORE:Revisiting Patrick Mahomes' Texas Tech career\n\nGiven his multi-position background in high school, he was listed as an athlete by 247Sports. The outlet listed him as a 3-star, ranked as the No. 26 athlete from the class of 2021.\n\nHe received offers from a number of power-conference schools, such as Baylor, Houston, Indiana, Kansas State, Iowa State and Virginia. He committed to the Cavaliers' 2021 class in April 2020 and remained committed up through his Dec. signing. Despite other schools wanting him to play defense, UVA actually recruited Rodriguez as a quarterback.\n\n“That had a little effect on my decision,” Rodriguez said in April 2020 via the Times Record News. “Beyond playing football, I want to go into coaching. I feel like learning the quarterback position at the college level gives me a better understanding of play calls and how to learn how to do things as a whole on offense.\"\n\nBut once he got to Virginia, he was utilized at a number of positions on offense, including receiver and fullback. He appeared in all 12 games as a true freshman, getting eight receptions for 65 yards and a touchdown with another 10 carries for 56 yards on the ground.\n\nHe played behind UVA quarterback Brennan Armstrong, who broke single-season records for the Cavaliers in 2021.\n\nPer a recent ESPN feature on Rodriguez, UVA coaches told him they planned to make him into the next Taysom Hill. But his time in Charlottesville lasted just one season, as he entered the transfer portal in Dec. 2021 after UVA head coach Bronco Mendenhall abruptly resigned after six seasons as the Cavs head coach.\n\nMORE:Picks, predictions  for 2025 CFP quarterfinal games\n\nRodriguez entered the portal largely because of Mendenhall leaving.\n\n\"I loved it there and loved the people there,\" Rodriguez said via ESPN of his time at Virginia. \"But I kind of went there to play for him.\"\n\nTexas Tech head coach Joey McGuire, who had recruited Rodriguez in high school while he was at Baylor, offered Rodriguez a spot on the team as a walk-on, but was placed on scholarship before the 2022 season.\n\nPrior to him transferring to Texas Tech, the Red Raiders coaches informed him he would not be joining as a quarterback. Although it took some time, Rodriguez started figuring out the defensive side of things in 2022.\n\n\"Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play,\" Rodriguez said via NWA Online of the position change. \"I've done it on the offensive side of the ball, I've done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I've done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. \"That's kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.\"\n\nLOOK:Texas Tech's 'Too-Cold' uniforms\n\nRodriguez finished with a combined 59 total tackles during his first two seasons at linebacker. But you can see the huge numbers he's put up during his junior and senior seasons:\n\nUnsurprisingly, Rodriguez cleaned up during the college football awards season. Here's a look at each award he took home:\n\nChuck Bednarik Award (nation's top defensive player)\n\nButkus Award (nation's top linebacker)\n\nBronko Nagurski Trophy (nation's top defensive player)\n\nLombardi Award (nation's top lineman or linebacker)\n\nPony Express Award (nation's top duo with David Bailey)\n\nDespite a campaign for him to be a Heisman finalist, was not invited to New York City. Even still, the linebacker impressively finished fifth in Heisman voting, receiving 17 first-place votes.\n\nMORE:Why Michigan landed the perfect replacement for Sherrone Moore in Kyle Whittingham",

    "fullText": "A major Groq investor said data center development was \"speculative\" and would put \"stress on the system.\"\n\nAlex Davis, the CEO of Austin-based investment company Disruptive Tech, sounded an alarm about the US data center market in an end-of-year letter to investors on Monday.\n\nHe said he was concerned about landlords who were building data centers based on speculation about future demand.\n\n\"I am also deeply concerned about the 'speculative' data center market,\" Davis wrote in his letter. \"The 'build it and they will come' strategy is a trap. If you are a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers.\"\n\nHe said he predicted a \"significant financing crisis in 2027-2028 for speculative landlords.\"\n\n\"We want to back the owner/users, not the speculative landlords, and we are quite concerned for their stress on the system,\" Davis added.\n\nIn a similar letter on LinkedIn, Davis also talked about data centers, and said AI has spurred \"too many business models with no realistic margin expansion.\"\n\n\"This will not end well,\" he added on LinkedIn.\n\nDisruptive Tech has backed Groq, an AI hardware startup. In a press release in September in which it announced a $750 million capital raise, Groq said Disruptive Tech had invested nearly $350 million in the company.\n\nThe release also said that Disruptive Tech had invested in Airbnb, Spotify, and Slack, as well as AI-forward companies like Shield AI, Palantir, and Databricks.\n\nThis funding round took place shortly before Groq signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Nvidia in November.\n\nDavis's comments about data centers come as tech companies are spending billions of dollars on their construction.\n\nA Business Insider investigation into the US's data centers in June showed that at the end of 2024, companies had filed permits for 1,240 existing or planned data centers. This was nearly four times the number of permits in 2010.\n\nThese centers, which store, process, and distribute large amounts of data, use massive amounts of land, water, and electricity. Cities give companies tax incentives to build data centers, spurring the rate of their construction.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.\n\nThe rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told ​by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.\n\nThe mandate is one of the most ‌significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.\n\nWhile those U.S. export restrictions blocked ‌the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.\n\nApplications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.\n\n\"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,\" one source told Reuters. \"Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.\"\n\nChina's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish ⁠to be identified as the measure is not public.\n\nChina's President ‌Xi Jinping has been calling for a \"whole nation\" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.\n\nThe effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum. Reuters reported earlier this month that Chinese scientists are working on a prototype ‍of a machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome that Washington has spent years trying to prevent.\n\n\"Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance,\" a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology said, referring to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.\n\n\"But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers.\"",

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rodin Roohipour, a 15-year-old from Los Angeles. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider verified the email correspondences mentioned.\n\nI've wanted to start a company since I was 12.\n\nWhen I was younger, at 8, I loved building things. I started coding very early. Then I turned 12, I did this entrepreneurship program, and I got really into it. I kept trying to build these companies, these little side projects, but nothing took off.\n\nEventually, I realized a really important thing you need to have is knowledge. I knew nothing about tech or venture capital. I decided to learn everything the best way I could, which is by talking to the most knowledgeable people.\n\nThat led me to all these cold emails.\n\nThe biggest names were Alfred Lin from Sequoia Capital, Mark Cuban, Paul Graham. They've given so much good advice.\n\nWhen I emailed Alfred Lin, I had to follow up three times. I asked him what his issues were in venture capital.\n\nI emailed Julia Lipton from Awesome People Ventures, and she responded three weeks after my follow-up and seemed happy to chat. She was the first big person I ever called with.\n\nWhen I emailed Mark Cuban, I really had to personalize it. This guy gets like 500 emails a day. You have to stand out. I said: \"I'm currently a high school student who uses Al a LOT and went to your bootcamp a while back.\" That captured his attention.\n\nA lot of people are like, \"Can you get on a meeting?\" You need to go in with no expectations. You should just share your story and say, \"One sentence of advice would help.\"\n\nA lot of people hide the interesting parts about themselves because they think that it'll scare people off. In my first few emails, I talked like a salesman. It sounds super professional, but the problem with that is, it sounds like a sales pitch. It'll go to your promotions folder.\n\nYou need to use the extreme or unusual attributes around you.\n\nI view an email as two parts: the subject and the body. The subject is what you're using to get someone to open it. You don't need to explain anything. You don't need to introduce yourself.\n\nThe subject line I've been using a lot is: \"writing this email to you while in my high school math class.\" It's a bit generic, so if you're emailing someone like Mark Cuban, you would change it. But it works really well. (I don't actually write the emails in my math class. I just schedule them for the morning.)\n\nIt's a pattern break. If all your emails are like \"I'm going to fix this\" or \"I'm going to do that,\" nobody cares. That subject line captures your eye. A 14-to-18-year-old? What's he doing in my inbox? Math class reinforces that.\n\nThe body of the email is where everything else happens. You present your real argument, why the person you're emailing is relevant, and why helping you makes sense for them.\n\nA clever subject line can't save a bad email. You'll have 500 opens but two replies.\n\nPaul Graham was one of the biggest emails I got. I told him, \"I'm Rodin, 14 y/o and super interested in VC and startups. I'm building a product that is a trust platform for VCs / founders. I would love to chat with you about your story and some problems you face. Even 10 mins would mean a lot.\"\n\nHe gave me a blunt reply, but it was nice. He told me: \"This is a mistake. You are much better off focusing on learning math and programming. Build your own LLM.\"\n\nEven if these people don't give you big replies, it's important that you're in their network. It builds a slight connection.",

    "title": "These 8 big deals defined the year in artificial intelligence",
    "description": "From Disney's $1 billion bet on OpenAI to a wave of blockbuster acquihires, these deals reshaped the tech industry in 2025.",
    "fullText": "While most of the industry was out of office over the holidays, Nvidia and SoftBank's deal teams were grinding.\n\nBoth companies chose the year's quietest stretch to drop news that was anything but: SoftBank said Monday it will acquire digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge for about $4 billion.\n\nNvidia's move was stranger still. On Christmas Eve, it announced a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement\" with Groq, the startup behind custom chips designed to handle AI inference — the real-time work that powers chatbot replies. The companies did not disclose financial terms.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't call it an acquisition, the guts of the arrangement looked familiar. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with top engineering staff, will head to Nvidia. Groq, last valued at $6.9 billion in a funding round three months ago, will continue to operate independently.\n\nIt's the latest example of a new kind of tech dealmaking, where the founder and key engineers get bought out, the technology gets siphoned off, and the startup itself is left in limbo.\n\nThat's the vibe of 2025: big, hairy deals that refuse to stay inside the lines.\n\nThe industry's biggest moves weren't just splashy acquisitions or eye-watering funding rounds. (We saw those deals, too.) They were sprawling, hard-to-categorize transactions. Money came tied to compute. Licensing came paired with talent raids. Infrastructure deals locked governments and corporate America into yearslong dependencies. These weren't neat mergers or simple checks. They were power grabs that shifted the balance of Silicon Valley and beyond.\n\nThese were the eight deals that defined the year in AI, ranked from smallest to largest by dollar value.\n\nNvidia ended the year doing the same thing that turned heads all year: extracting founders from their startups and leaving other employees to figure it out.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced it had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq. The financial terms were undisclosed.\n\nUnder the agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other team members, will join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of over $4.5 trillion.\n\nGroq will continue to operate as an independent company, with CFO Simon Edwards assuming the CEO role.\n\nDisney struck a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI in December, becoming the first major content partner for Sora, OpenAI's video generator.\n\nThe deal isn't just about rights. Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI and receive warrants to buy additional equity — a structure that ties content, distribution, and upside together.\n\nBusiness Insider reporter Lucia Moses argues the logic can be summed up in one word: engagement. Time spent on Disney+ and other major streaming services has remained essentially flat in recent years, she writes, while YouTube and social video continue to grow.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership could help Disney meet audiences where they already are, by allowing fans to use tools like ChatGPT and Sora to generate and remix content featuring Disney characters.\n\nDeveloper coding assistant Windsurf was a startup Cinderella story. Then it became a cautionary tale.\n\nThe company was in talks to sell to OpenAI for $3 billion this past spring. The deal fell apart at the last minute.\n\nGoogle emerged as a new suitor. Instead of an outright acquisition, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent, as well as license the company's intellectual property.\n\nThe deal effectively split Windsurf into two pieces, with the hundreds of remaining employees ending up at Cognition, another AI coding startup. That left some with a bitter taste.\n\nPart of the social contract in startups is that early employees work long hours at lower pay in the hope that they will share in the riches should their startup eventually get acquired or go public.\n\nNow, traditional acquisitions have become rarer because of the time and uncertainty of getting regulatory approval. As a result, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have been getting creative, using licensing deals to skirt regulators and snap up key talent.\n\nSoftBank snapped up a private equity firm with the ultimate goal of controlling more of the physical infrastructure behind AI.\n\nOn Monday, SoftBank said it has entered into an agreement to acquire DigitalBridge, an alternative asset manager that invests in data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, and power that make the AI boom possible.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe deal comes as SoftBank reshuffles its portfolio. In November, the company said it had sold nearly $6 billion of Nvidia stock to free up cash for OpenAI. SoftBank is also doubling down on \"physical AI,\" building a robotics beachhead with a dedicated investment arm and a pending deal to buy ABB's robotics business.\n\nThe Trump administration agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel in August. It was a rare moment when Washington wasn't just regulating an industry or subsidizing it, but buying into it.\n\nUnder the terms Intel disclosed, the government will invest $8.9 billion for 433.3 million shares, and the stake is to be passive, with no board seat.\n\nThe investment aims to bolster domestic capacity for designing and manufacturing advanced chips. Intel has seen foreign competitors, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, cut into its market share of advanced chips. The White House has said it is a national security risk if industries continue to import the vast majority of advanced chips from overseas.\n\nThis also likely won't be the last deal of its kind. President Donald Trump and top aides have floated the idea of doing similar deals with American defense contractors and have considered a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOne of the year's biggest deals sparked the question: Was Meta really spending $14 billion to hire a 28-year-old?\n\nAlexandr Wang cofounded and ran Scale AI, the data-labeling company that helps enterprises train and deploy AI models by supplying high-quality training data and tooling. In June, Meta agreed to pay $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI — and, just as importantly, to bring Wang in to lead its next act in AI.\n\nWang became Meta's chief AI officer and the public face of its superintelligence push, with a mandate that goes well beyond building better chatbots. His job is to convince elite researchers that Meta is the place to do their life's work — and to turn the company's key advantage, its compute budget, into a lasting edge.\n\nWhen Google agreed to buy Israeli-American cloud security firm Wiz earlier this year, it threw a $32 billion bucket of water on the idea that the mega-deal drought would persist.\n\nIn March, Google agreed to acquire the startup at an all-cash price roughly equal to Iceland's gross domestic product last year, pending regulatory sign-off. This marks the search giant's largest acquisition.\n\nThe acquisition served as an early litmus test of the Trump administration's willingness to greenlight pricey Big Tech mergers and acquisitions. The deal passed an antitrust review by the Department of Justice in November, clearing a key hurdle to closing.\n\nTrump kicked off his second term by unveiling a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build a chain of data centers across the US — a project called Stargate that aims to invest $500 billion in domestic infrastructure by 2029.\n\nIn Abilene, Texas, a flagship data center has already opened. Construction crews have broken ground on Stargate sites in Lordstown, Ohio, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, with several more campuses to come.\n\nTo make the ongoing buildout a success, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has estimated it could take one-fifth of the nation's existing skilled trade workforce.",

    "description": "Antoine Wade said everyone has the same amount of time in a day to learn about AI tools, and in this moment, everyone is competing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee who is based in San Antonio. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started to use AI around 2022 when ChatGPT first launched. It was unlike any technology that I've come across and I started to leverage it in my personal and professional life.\n\nInitially, it helped me craft emails. I work in tech sales and I have to do a lot of cold outreaches. My job is to write messages that resonate with various leaders and ChatGPT helped me with that.\n\nOnce I started using it at work, I realized that as a sports coach and father, there was so much more I could use it for, like sending post-practice communication to parents, building schedules, or putting together statistics of how the game went. Tasks that used to take me days took me literal minutes.\n\nNow I use AI everyday, and I've experimented with different tools. I use Claude to help with business communication and content generation. I use Perplexity for deep research, and Gemini for image generation. I use these tools for a combination of personal, professional, and educational use-cases. I've learned how to install an air conditioner and how to teach my son 6th grade math.\n\nMy company has also given me access to tools that have been really powerful in sales. It can help with gaining a better understanding of the customer in a minute's notice.\n\nFor example, tools like Salesforce Sales Navigator can pinpoint almost the exact person that may be looking for the product I'm selling. Now when I reach out to that person, the conversation will be more fruitful than it would if it were a completely random cold call.\n\nAI hasn't helped me close deals — I'm the one that's built those relationships with customers — but I've seen an increase in my pipeline because I'm able to reach more clients with the data and messaging.\n\nWhen I'm able to understand the customer better, I'm able to communicate more effectively, which leads to building a better pipeline, which ultimately leads to making more money.\n\nWhile people may have access to the same tools, it's still up to the user to put the data together and craft the right prompts. I've been experimenting with so many automation tools that I've developed a secret sauce.\n\nIf I'm creating prompts that give me a better message, which leads to a better outcome, I may not share it with others because I want to see if it works and if it's going to give me a competitive advantage.\n\nWe all have the same amount of time in a day to learn these things. So if I'm putting more time toward learning more about prompt engineering or how AI is supposed to work, then I don't necessarily want to share those learnings with someone else. In this moment, we're all competing.\n\nI will absolutely help someone if they ask, but there are certain details I'm not as forthcoming about. I may share some of those learnings with some of my closest friends or people I feel I can learn from, but that doesn't mean I'm sharing it with everybody.\n\nSales is very competitive and while companies are choosing to have conversations around AI, some people may not be as comfortable sharing how they're leveraging it because that may be their competitive advantage.\n\nWhen people ask if I use AI, I say \"absolutely, yes.\" But there's only a certain amount of people that I'm going into a deeper conversations about AI with.",

    "fullText": "On Call Y2K Welcome to a special festive season edition of On Call, in which we share readers' stories of working on the 31st of December 1999 – the moment the tech world held its breath and hoped years of Year 2000 bug remediation efforts would work.\n\nLet's start with a reader we'll Regomize as \"Graham\" who at the time worked at a cable television network operated by a giant US telco.\n\nMidnight passed without incident for Graham, but at 0010 an actual manifestation of the Y2K bug appeared.\n\n\"There was a problem with an old character generator that used an 80286 processor,\" Graham wrote. \"The clock had stopped at midnight and the machine just froze.\"\n\nGraham and his team spent months preparing for Y2K and sprang into action, then relaxed again when the borked box resumed operations after a simple reboot.\n\nBut then came a truly odd incident.\n\n\"One interesting and unanticipated problem was people shooting weapons,\" Graham told on Call. \"In at least one case a merrymaker shot a distribution amplifier, knocking out cable for their neighbors. There was some discussion as to whether to include the outage on the Y2K dashboard or not.\"\n\nNow let's meet another reader we'll call \"Kerry\" who worked for a University that ordered all computers machines be turned off for Y2K eve.\n\nKerry's job saw him manage a fleet of Unix servers, and he decided to ignore that instruction.\n\n\"I was confident that nothing serious would go wrong and that my users could continue to work from home,\" he told On Call.\n\nKerry therefore went home and prepared for the millennium eve party he intended to host.\n\n\"At around 4pm everything electrical stopped working,\" he told The Register. \"I felt the bottom drop out from under me. Were the doomsday predictions true?\"\n\n\"I quickly found out the out that my neighbors did not have the same problem,\" Graham told On Call. \"The main fuse of my house had blown because we were using way too much power.\"\n\nAnd when he returned to work the following week, all was well – other than the banner page on print jobs dated \"Monday January 3 1900.\"\n\nNow let's meet a reader we'll Regomize as \"Rob\" who at the time of Y2K worked for Sun Microsystems in the UK.\n\nAs a global company, Sun had an early warning system for any Y2K problems: Its Australian office was 11 hours ahead of the UK office, so if any problems struck there, the company would get advance notice.\n\nWhich is why, as midnight neared Down Under, Rob's boss called Sun's Sydney office … then heard the phone line go terrifyingly silent as the clock ticked pas midnight. Rob said that \"scared the hell out of my manager\" – at least for a few moments, because the phone soon rang.\n\n\"It was the Australian office, laughing their heads off,\" Rob told On Call. ®",

    "fullText": "From Stanley Tucci’s imperious tech titan to Lex Luthor’s distractingly hot CEO and Elon Musk-esque blowhards, films this year took us inside the billionaire mindset\n\nBetween the slash-and-burn US government reboot led by a dank meme fan and the relentless pushing of AI by venture capital-backed blowhards, 2025 has felt like peak obnoxious tech bro. Fittingly, jargon-spouting, self-regarding digital visionaries also became Hollywood’s go-to baddies this year in everything from blockbusters to slapstick spoofs. Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.\n\nWith such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto on The Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe. But even the great cocktail-maker couldn’t squeeze much out of sour existential proclamations such as: “Our world is a tyre fire floating on an ocean of piss.”\n\nThere was more baldness in Superman, where Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor embodied the worst kind of wannabe paradigm-changer: one desperate to appear on talkshows. Incensed that the world seemed to be ignoring his genius in favour of a flying alien do-gooder, the LuthorCorp founder spent a fortune to rig social media, deploying an army of vivisected monkey cyborgs to swamp platforms with anti-Superman hashtags and memes. That the film itself was met with farmed outrage about perceived wokeness added a disconcerting hall-of-mirrors feel to what was essentially an overstuffed crowdpleaser. Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.\n\nIs it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thriller M3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.\n\nIf Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr in The Naked Gun reboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.\n\nIn the goopy, grungy world of The Toxic Avenger reboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such as Bryan Johnson.\n\nIn 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulish Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby in Tron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully from the original 1982 Tron – seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes. A wildly expensive, resource-intensive, essentially useless product? Intentionally or not, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the AI bubble.\n\nBut why stop at just one douchey tech bro? Jesse Armstrong’s jagged satire Mountainhead took the bold step of making every single character the absolute worst of the “move fast, break stuff” billionaire mindset, isolating them – and the viewer – in a remote, repellently deluxe ski lodge while the spectre of possible Armageddon encroached. As the Musk-alike owner of a social media app spreading dangerous AI-augmented misinformation, Cory Michael Smith captured the glib, morality-agnostic tone of someone richer than God who views the world as their plaything.\n\nAs Venis (Smith), silverback investor Randall (Steve Carell), canny algorithm tamer Jeff (Ramy Youssef) and would-be wellness app supremo Souper (Jason Schwartzman) relentlessly needled each other, there was the illicit thrill of dialling into the combative quartet’s inside-baseball repartee of boasting, toasting and roasting. But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible. We have all been forced to absorb the pathologies of our tech overlords due to their disproportionate influence in the real world. As a new cinema year looms, is it too much to ask that we don’t have to keep doing it at the movies too?",

    "description": "Antoine Wade said everyone has the same amount of time in a day to learn about AI tools, and in this moment, everyone is competing.",
    "fullText": "Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee, uses AI daily for personal and professional tasks.\n\nHe said AI has helped him grow his pipeline by letting him communicate more effectively and understand customers better.\n\nHe said he keeps some of his AI strategies private to maintain a competitive advantage in sales.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee who is based in San Antonio. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started to use AI around 2022 when ChatGPT first launched. It was unlike any technology that I've come across and I started to leverage it in my personal and professional life.\n\nInitially, it helped me craft emails. I work in tech sales and I have to do a lot of cold outreaches. My job is to write messages that resonate with various leaders and ChatGPT helped me with that.\n\nOnce I started using it at work, I realized that as a sports coach and father, there was so much more I could use it for, like sending post-practice communication to parents, building schedules, or putting together statistics of how the game went. Tasks that used to take me days took me literal minutes.\n\nNow I use AI everyday, and I've experimented with different tools. I use Claude to help with business communication and content generation. I use Perplexity for deep research, and Gemini for image generation. I use these tools for a combination of personal, professional, and educational use-cases. I've learned how to install an air conditioner and how to teach my son 6th grade math.\n\nMy company has also given me access to tools that have been really powerful in sales. It can help with gaining a better understanding of the customer in a minute's notice.\n\nFor example, tools like Salesforce Sales Navigator can pinpoint almost the exact person that may be looking for the product I'm selling. Now when I reach out to that person, the conversation will be more fruitful than it would if it were a completely random cold call.\n\nAI hasn't helped me close deals — I'm the one that's built those relationships with customers — but I've seen an increase in my pipeline because I'm able to reach more clients with the data and messaging.\n\nWhen I'm able to understand the customer better, I'm able to communicate more effectively, which leads to building a better pipeline, which ultimately leads to making more money.\n\nWhile people may have access to the same tools, it's still up to the user to put the data together and craft the right prompts. I've been experimenting with so many automation tools that I've developed a secret sauce.\n\nIf I'm creating prompts that give me a better message, which leads to a better outcome, I may not share it with others because I want to see if it works and if it's going to give me a competitive advantage.\n\nWe all have the same amount of time in a day to learn these things. So if I'm putting more time toward learning more about prompt engineering or how AI is supposed to work, then I don't necessarily want to share those learnings with someone else. In this moment, we're all competing.\n\nI will absolutely help someone if they ask, but there are certain details I'm not as forthcoming about. I may share some of those learnings with some of my closest friends or people I feel I can learn from, but that doesn't mean I'm sharing it with everybody.\n\nSales is very competitive and while companies are choosing to have conversations around AI, some people may not be as comfortable sharing how they're leveraging it because that may be their competitive advantage.\n\nWhen people ask if I use AI, I say \"absolutely, yes.\" But there's only a certain amount of people that I'm going into a deeper conversations about AI with.",

    "description": "This was supposed to be the year when autonomous agents took over everyday tasks. The tech industry overpromised and underdelivered.",
    "fullText": "This was no small boast. Chatbots can respond directly to a text-based prompt—by answering a question, say, or writing a rough draft of an e-mail. But an agent, in theory, would be able to navigate the digital world on its own, and complete tasks that require multiple steps and the use of other software, such as web browsers. Consider everything that goes into making a hotel reservation: deciding on the right nights, filtering based on one’s preferences, reading reviews, searching various websites to compare rates and amenities. An agent could conceivably automate all of these activities. The implications of such a technology would be immense. Chatbots are convenient for human employees to use; effective A.I. agents might replace the employees altogether. The C.E.O. of Salesforce, Marc Benioff, who has claimed that half the work at his company is done by A.I., predicted that agents will help unleash a “digital labor revolution,” worth trillions of dollars.\n\nNew Yorker writers reflect on the year’s highs and lows.\n\n2025 was heralded as the Year of the A.I. Agent in part because, by the end of 2024, these tools had become undeniably adept at computer programming. A demo of OpenAI’s Codex agent, from May, showed a user asking the tool to modify his personal website. “Add another tab next to investment/tools that is called ‘food I like.’ In the doc put—tacos,” the user wrote. The chatbot quickly carried out a sequence of interconnected actions: it reviewed the files in the website’s directory, examined the contents of a promising file, then used a search command to find the right location to insert a new line of code. After the agent learned how the site was structured, it used this information to successfully add a new page that featured tacos. As a computer scientist myself, I had to admit that Codex was tackling the task more or less as I would. Silicon Valley grew convinced that other difficult tasks would soon be conquered.\n\nAs 2025 winds down, however, the era of general-purpose A.I. agents has failed to emerge. This fall, Andrej Karpathy, a co-founder of OpenAI, who left the company and started an A.I.-education project, described agents as “cognitively lacking” and said, “It’s just not working.” Gary Marcus, a longtime critic of tech-industry hype, recently wrote on his Substack that “AI Agents have, so far, mostly been a dud.” This gap between prediction and reality matters. Fluent chatbots and reality-bending video generators are impressive, but they cannot, on their own, usher in a world in which machines take over many of our activities. If the major A.I. companies cannot deliver broadly useful agents, then they may be unable to deliver on their promises of an A.I.-powered future.\n\nThis setup turns out to excel at automating software development. Most of the actions required to create or modify a computer program can be implemented by entering a limited set of commands into a text-based terminal. These commands tell a computer to navigate a file system, add or update text in source files, and, if needed, compile human-readable code into machine-readable bits. This is an ideal setting for L.L.M.s. “The terminal interface is text-based, and that is the domain that language models are based on,” Alex Shaw, the co-creator of Terminal-Bench, a popular tool used to evaluate coding agents, told me.\n\nMore generalized assistants, of the sort envisioned by Altman, would require agents to leave the comfortable constraints of the terminal. Since most of us complete computer tasks by pointing and clicking, an A.I. that can “join the workforce” probably needs to know how to use a mouse—a surprisingly difficult goal. The Times recently reported on a string of new startups that have been building “shadow sites”—replicas of popular webpages, like those of United Airlines and Gmail, on which A.I. can analyze how humans use a cursor. In July, OpenAI released ChatGPT Agent, an early version of a bot that can use a web browser to complete tasks, but one review noted that “even simple actions like clicking, selecting elements, and searching can take the agent several seconds—or even minutes.” At one point, the tool got stuck for nearly a quarter of an hour trying to select a price from a real-estate site’s drop-down menu.",

    "fullText": "Role: Reporter\nMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news.\n\nA YouTube cofounder who helped pave the way for our modern, content-obsessed world is the latest tech whiz to come out against short-form videos because of their effects on kids.\n\nSteve Chen, who served as YouTube’s former chief technology officer before it was acquired by Google in 2006, railed against the TikTok-ification of online life in a talk earlier this year at Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\n“I think TikTok is entertainment, but it’s purely entertainment,” Chen said during the talk, which was published on YouTube Friday. “It’s just for that moment. Just shorter-form content equates to shorter attention spans.”\n\nChen, who has two children with wife, Jamie Chen, said he wouldn’t want his kids only consuming short-form content, and then not be able to watch something longer than 15 minutes. He said he knows of other parents who force their kids to watch longer videos without the eye-catching colors and gimmicks that hook especially younger users. This strategy works well, he claims.\n\n“If they don’t get exposure to the short-form content right away, then they’re still happy with that other type of content that they’re watching,” he said.\n\nMany companies have had to rush to offer short-form content after the rise of TikTok, he said, but these companies now have to balance their motivations for monetization and attracting users’ attention with content that’s “actually useful.”\n\nCompanies that distribute short-form video, which includes his former company YouTube, could face problems with addictiveness. These companies should add safeguards for kids on short-form content, such as age restrictions for apps and limits on the amount of time some users can use them, he said.\n\nChen joins fellow tech trailblazers Sam Altman of OpenAI and Elon Musk in sounding the alarm about social media’s impact on children. In a podcast interview, Altman specifically called out social media scrolling and the “dopamine hit” of short-form video for “probably messing with kids’ brain development in a super deep way.”\n\nMusk, who owns the social network X (née Twitter), said in 2023 he doesn’t have any restrictions on social-media use for his children, but added this “might have been a mistake,” and encouraged parents to take a more active role in their kids’ social-media habits.\n\n“I think, probably, I would limit social media a bit more than I have in the past and just take note of what they’re watching, because I think at this point they’re being programmed by some social media algorithms, which you may or may not agree with,” Musk said.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 29, 2025.",

    "description": "A report by the Israel Advanced Technology Industries warned that the trend could threaten Israel's \"innovation engine.\"",
    "fullText": "Increasing numbers of employees at multinational tech firms in Israel have requested to be relocated abroad over the last year, as security concerns amid the Israel-Hamas war heightened, a new report says.\n\nThe Israel Advanced Technology Industries Association (IATI) said in a report published last week that 53% of multinational companies had reported increases in relocation requests, as \"security and geopolitical concerns\" became \"increasingly influential.\"\n\nThe report did not identify specific companies. Some of the world's largest tech companies have a presence in Israel, including Apple, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google.\n\n\"The relocation risk poses a direct threat to Israel's innovation engines,\" the NGO said, adding: \"A significant wave of employee departures could undermine local innovation capabilities and weaken Israel's technological leadership.\"\n\nThe report found recruitment increases among multinationals in Israel had nevertheless exceeded decreases during the war, which it said highlighted the \"organizational resilience and continued investment in talent\" from these companies.\n\nThe data came from a mix of industry reports and public sources, as well as surveys and interviews with tech executives in multinational entities, the IATI said.\n\nIsrael's tech sector is a key driver of its economy. The Israel Innovation Authority, a government body, said the tech industry contributed one-fifth of the country's GDP in 2023. It labeled the high-tech sector \"the shock absorber of the Israeli economy.\"\n\nThe IATI report said that there are around 430 multinational companies in Israel, with around 90,000 high-tech employees working for them.\n\nIt added that while multinationals had shown resilience over the course of the war — which broke out following the October 7 attacks on Israel — many had also faced business headwinds.\n\nAround 22% of companies recorded reduced business activity during the conflict, it said, with 8% reporting a significant decline. However, 57% reported no change in business activity over the period and 21% expanded operations, per the report, which the IATI said showed \"continued confidence in and robustness of local MNC activity.\"\n\nDror Bin, the CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, previously said that the Israeli economy's dependence on the high-tech sector had \"significantly grown in the past decade.\"\n\n\"We must do everything necessary to preserve the industry and continue nurturing its competitiveness in the global market,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "America has never had as many billionaires as it does now.\n\nBut how does the wealth of historic figures, such as the industrialists of the Gilded Age, compare to that of the richest people in 2025?\n\nIn many historic calculations of net worth, individual fortunes weren't measured in isolation; instead, they were compared to the GDP of the US at the time. When the US economy was much smaller than it is today, the wealthiest families and individuals carried more weight in the economy than others during more prosperous times.\n\nOne of the richest Americans of all time is widely considered to be Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller, whose wealth, at its peak in 1937, was equal to 1.5% of the country's GDP. His estimated net worth would be around $499 billion today, when adjusted for inflation.\n\nElon Musk's current wealth, however, is understood to have now eclipsed that of Rockefeller's. On December 29, Forbes estimated Musk's fortune to be $744.6 billion.\n\nTo identify some of the richest Americans of all time, we consulted Forbes' 2007 list of history's wealthiest figures, based on estimates by economist Peter Bernstein. It calculated individuals' wealth at their peak and compared it to the country's GDP at the time to convert it to 2006 dollars. This was then adjusted to today's dollars using the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation calculator.\n\nFor living individuals, we cited estimated net worths as reported by Forbes on December 29.\n\nWhile estimations of historic wealth may not be perfect, they help paint a picture of the level of wealth enjoyed by some of America's most notable figures in business, and put it into context with today's billionaires.\n\nHere are 28 of the wealthiest Americans in history.\n\nEstimated net worth (2025 adjusted estimate): $82.5 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Banker and industrialist; heir to the Mellon banking dynasty\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $88.8 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Automaker; founder of Ford Motor Company\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $95.1 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Railroad financier and speculator\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $95.8 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Retail entrepreneur; founder of Walmart\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $98.2 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Retail magnate; founder of Marshall Field & Company\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; co-founder of Microsoft\n\nSource of wealth: Financial data entrepreneur; founder of Bloomberg LP\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $118 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Timber magnate; founder of Weyerhaeuser\n\nSource of wealth: Walmart heir and board member\n\nSource of wealth: Walmart heir and former chairman\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $132.1 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Retail pioneer; founder of AT Stewart & Co.\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $134.5 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Banker and industrial investor; heir to Mellon banking dynasty\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; founder and CEO of Dell Technologies\n\nSource of wealth: Investor; CEO of Berkshire Hathaway\n\nSource of wealth: Tech executive; former CEO of Microsoft\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $156.3 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Banker, merchant, and financier\n\nSource of wealth: Co-founder and CEO of Nvidia\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $180 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Fur trader and real-estate investor\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; co-founder of Facebook, now Meta\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; co-founder of Google\n\nSource of wealth: E-commerce entrepreneur; founder of Amazon\n\nSource of wealth: Software entrepreneur; co-founder and former CEO of Oracle\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; co-founder of Google\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $275.3 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Shipping and railroad tycoon\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $459.6 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Steel industrialist; founder of Carnegie Steel\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $499 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Oil magnate; founder of Standard Oil\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; CEO of Tesla & SpaceX",

    "title": "The real obstacle to AI in creative agencies isn't tech — it's fear, a consultant says",
    "description": "AI strategist Jules Love says agencies must rethink training, culture, and pricing to help creative teams thrive, not just work faster, in the AI era.",
    "fullText": "AI is transforming how creative work gets made — but most agencies still don't know where to begin in using it.\n\nJules Love, founder of Spark AI, a consultancy that helps creative firms weave AI into their day-to-day work, says the real challenge isn't technical — it's psychological.\n\n\"Adopting AI in your team won't happen by accident,\" he told Business Insider. \"You need to do it deliberately — make somebody accountable for it, and give them the space to be successful in that role.\"\n\nDrawing on his work with more than 60 agencies through Spark AI, he shares six ways leaders can future-proof their teams for the AI era.\n\nLove says most agencies won't transform unless someone owns the AI integration work.\n\nRather than setting up vague \"innovation groups,\" he encourages leaders to assign responsibility and protect time for AI integration, even if that means pulling people slightly away from billable client work.\n\nAgencies that succeed, he added, treat AI as a core business priority, not a side project that gets squeezed in when deadlines allow.\n\n\"It's amazing how many agencies roll out ChatGPT or Gemini to their teams and don't train anybody on it,\" Love said.\n\nHe likens untrained teams to people staring at a giant box of Lego with thousands of bricks inside, but no picture on the front and no instructions. The picture on the box, he said, is role-specific training.\n\nFor him, training is what turns experimentation into practical capability.\n\nLove said agencies struggle to innovate when teams are constantly under deadline pressure.\n\nTo make real progress with AI, leaders need to create structured time for experimentation — moments where people can test new workflows without the risk of missing a client delivery.\n\nHe pointed to companies like Lego, which regularly takes teams off-site to explore new ideas, and Canva, which paused normal work for a full week to rethink how departments could use AI.\n\n\"Fear kills innovation faster than bad tools,\" Love said. \"You have to give a little bit of room for failure.\"\n\nLove said a lack of openness around AI use is one of the clearest signs that something is wrong.\n\nWhen employees feel the need to hide tools like ChatGPT from coworkers, it suggests AI is still seen as risky or illegitimate rather than useful.\n\nTo change that dynamic, he advises leaders to make AI use visible and normalized, especially by creating space for teams to share how they're experimenting — including what hasn't worked.\n\n\"That's the No. 1 sign that there's not a good culture around AI in your business.\"\n\nHe also encouraged managers to push responsibility down the organization by giving individuals ownership over specific AI initiatives, such as maintaining a prompt library or developing custom tools, so adoption feels collaborative rather than imposed.\n\nLove said many creatives misunderstand how AI is meant to be used. Too often, teams treat it like a faster search engine — asking one-off questions and moving on — rather than as a collaborative assistant that improves with context and iteration.\n\nHe argues that real gains come when people learn to \"brief \"AI the way they would a colleague, giving it background, constraints, and feedback instead of quick prompts.\n\n\"It's much better to think of it as briefing somebody else to do the job,\" Love said.\n\nLove said agencies risk undermining their own value if they focus only on how AI makes work faster.\n\nAs creative output accelerates, clinging to the billable hour can push firms toward commoditization rather than differentiation, he said.\n\nInstead, he urged leaders to rethink pricing around outcomes, rather than speed, and to pilot AI in specific workflows so that teams can clearly measure what improves.\n\n\"If all we're doing is doing more stuff faster, then we're going to see a bit of a race to the bottom on fees,\" Love said.\n\nHe believes that fixed-cost projects, which reward better results — not velocity — give agencies room to invest in learning and experimentation without eroding their margins.\n\nLove's advice for 2026 is simple: \"Stop thinking about what you can do today more quickly and what you can do tomorrow better.\"\n\nHe believes the agencies that thrive will not be those with the biggest budgets or flashiest tech but those that help their people learn, lead, and experiment.\n\n\"Come 2027, you're going to be looking pretty old-fashioned, pretty expensive, and pretty uninteresting as an agency if you're not embracing this stuff and seeing what you can do with it,\" he said.",

    "description": "Salary data shows how much Uber pays corporate tech workers in 2025, with jobs earning up to $410,000. See which roles earn the most.",
    "fullText": "Uber is hiring people as it tries to become a \"super app.\" So how much is it paying them?\n\nYou're probably familiar with the millions of gig workers who drive you to the airport or deliver your food. Now, Uber is looking to expand those services — with self-driving cars, for example — as well as offer customers targeted offers.\n\n\"We're slowly moving towards a super app of sorts,\" CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.\n\nSome of the people whom Uber has hired as it tries to make that vision a reality have come from outside the US via H-1B visas.\n\nCompanies are required to submit this work visa data, which includes salary information, to the US Department of Labor for all foreign hires. However, the compensation figures don't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers.\n\nThe process for obtaining an H-1B visa, however, is changing.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump instituted a $100,000 fee for the visa. And proposed changes to H-1B visa rules would tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nUber filed to hire 945 workers through the H-1B visa program during the 2025 federal fiscal year, which ended on September 30, according to filings with the US Department of Labor. That's more than the 778 filings that Uber made during 2024.\n\nHere's a look at the jobs that Uber disclosed salaries for:\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $225,200 to $258,800\n\nManager, Engineering: $231,700 to $287,000\n\nManager, Applications Development: $195,600 to $210,500\n\nSenior Manager: $234,100 to $299,700\n\nStaff Software Engineer, TLM: $242,000 to $249,300\n\nSenior Director, Engineering: $360,000 to $410,000\n\nScientist, Tech: $111,966 to $176,400\n\nSenior Scientist, Tech: $151,700 to $207,200\n\nSenior Applied Scientist: $186,307 to $208,062\n\nStaff Scientist, Tech: $219,100 to $250,000\n\nApplied Scientist: $133,100 to $179,100\n\nData Scientist: $125,950 to $153,700\n\nData Scientist, Tech: $129,750 to $160,700\n\nData Scientist III: $150,000 to $175,019\n\nData Analyst: $156,600 to $161,000\n\nData Analyst, Tech: $116,750 to $162,200\n\nSenior Data Scientist: $150,400 to $164,300\n\nProduct Manager: $158,700 to $197,000\n\nSenior Technical Program Manager: $202,500 to $231,400\n\nSenior Program Manager: $144,500 to $170,100\n\nBusiness Analyst - Operations II: $110,075 to $117,554\n\nScientist, Tech: $149,650 to $174,900\n\nSenior Scientist, Tech: $169,800 to $185,300\n\nSenior Operations and Logistics Manager: $135,600 to $142,850\n\nRegional Operations Manager: $101,300 to $140,950\n\nManager, Sales Operations: $157,400 to $166,900\n\nManager, Central Operations: $157,100 to $161,900\n\nSenior Program Manager: $143,000 to $178,800\n\nStrategic Operations Manager: $111,900 to $166,600\n\nMachine Learning Engineer: $178,900 to $198,500\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $219,900 to $235,500\n\nSoftware Engineer: $98,516 to $198,500\n\nSoftware Engineer II: $113,308 to $135,005\n\nSoftware Engineer III: $131,003 to $188,084\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $207,800 to $273,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer, TLM: $246,400 to $263,000\n\nSenior Staff Engineer: $260,400 to $312,700\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $151,819 to $242,000\n\nStaff Applications Developer: $225,100 to $251,100\n\nSenior Applications Developer: $179,500 to $209,700\n\nManager, Technical Accounting: $164,600 to $166,900\n\nManager, Strategy and Planning: $155,000 to $173,600\n\nSenior Manager, Strategic Finance: $192,300 to $206,000\n\nManager, Central Operations: $140,900 to $160,200\n\nProduct Designer: $157,100 to $174,600\n\nBusiness Insider has been collecting pay data for tech companies.

Photo: Reuters>\n\nThe latest investment would also pave the way for FAW to jointly develop new EV models with Leapmotor, vice-president Li Tengfei said in the press briefing. That would enhance management efficiency at Leapmotor and help raise brand awareness, Li added.\n\nLeapmotor was expected to deliver 1 million vehicles in 2026, which would translate into a more than 60 per cent year-on-year sales increase, according to Zhu.\n\nAchieving sales of 1 million units next year would likely vault Leapmotor into the No 3 spot among mainland's largest EV makers, behind BYD and Geely, according to analysts.\n\nFounded in 2015, Leapmotor has become well known for its smart EVs with similar features to Tesla's Shanghai-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, but at less than half the price.\n\nThis year, Leapmotor has been one of the top vendors on the mainland's cutthroat EV market, as full-year sales are expected to exceed the 600,000-unit mark.",

    "description": "I haven't had to put it to use, but the peace of mind it provides is invaluable,",
    "fullText": "To be alive in 2025 is to assume you are being recorded at all times. There are cameras just about everywhere we go these days: Security cameras, video doorbells, and smartphones are frequently recording, and so ubiquitous that I tend to figure that if I go out in public, I'm being watched.\n\nBut when you're driving, it can be a different story. Sure, there are cameras on the road—either street cameras or cameras built directly into modern cars—but there are plenty of moments behind the wheel where nothing you do is recorded. You could view this as a nice reprieve from the surveillance of modern life, but it also means that if you get into an accident, it could quickly turn into a \"he said, she said\" incident. Someone could reverse directly into your car, but because there were no cameras around to document the accident, your insurance company could throw their hands in the air and make you both pay for something that wasn't your fault.\n\nI've never been in that situation, but I was tired of worrying about it. My car is on the older side, and doesn't come with any of the modern safety features newer cars now include—including cameras. Where something like a Tesla records everything in and around the car, my vehicle records nothing. If someone accidentally hit my car, or worse, intentionally tried to scam me, I could be out of luck, and without clear evidence I wasn't at fault.\n\nAfter following one too many threads online sharing such horror stories, I decided it was time to get myself a dashcam.But before I could, I was gifted one last Christmas—a Redtiger 4K dashcam. It was easy enough to set up, though even after a full year of use, I'm not taking full advantage of it yet: The main unit attaches to my front windshield, with a cable that plugs into the cigarette lighter port, but this particular model also comes with a rear camera that requires a little extra maneuvering to install. I've been a bit lazy on that front, but I should get cracking, since it would be helpful to have a camera protecting the back of my car, too.\n\nI almost wish I had some harrowing tale to tell that shows off how the dashcam saved me during the past year, or even a story about capturing some wild driving habits from my fellow drivers. But, spoiler alert: I haven't actually had to put it to use, as I've fortunately not been in an accident, or even experienced an interesting close call. But the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if an otherwise ambiguous fender bender has been refreshing. It's nice to know when I'm driving on a particularly busy road that I have a little extra protection should someone jump their lane or decide to text and drive.\n\nThere are so many different dashcam models, so I won't try to make the case that mine specifically is the one that everyone should buy. But there are a few things I like about it: First, the main unit records in 4K, which means your videos will be clear enough to use in the event you need to prove yourself innocent. While 4K takes up more recording space than 1080p, this model is designed to record over itself when it fills up. Since you probably don't need all your driving footage, you don't really need to worry about running out of space, and can grab the file when something actually happens. There are other features that I don't use, like wifi connectivity as well as a smart app, but I prefer to just grab the footage off the included SD card—at least, I would if I ever needed it.",

    "fullText": "Republican senator Katie Britt also proposes AI companies be criminally liable if they expose minors to harmful ideas\n\nUS senator Bernie Sanders amplified his recent criticism of artificial intelligence on Sunday, explicitly linking the financial ambition of “the richest people in the world” to economic insecurity for millions of Americans – and calling for a potential moratorium on new datacenters.\n\nSanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic party, said on CNN’s State of the Union that he was “fearful of a lot” when it came to AI. And the senator called it “the most consequential technology in the history of humanity” that will “transform” the US and the world in ways that had not been fully discussed.\n\n“If there are no jobs and humans won’t be needed for most things, how do people get an income to feed their families, to get healthcare or to pay the rent?” Sanders said. “There’s not been one serious word of discussion in the Congress about that reality.”\n\nDays from being scheduled to help swear New York mayor-elect and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani into office, Sanders said “the richest people in the world” were pushing the technology. He singled out tech moguls Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel while questioning their motives.\n\n“You think they’re staying up nights worrying about working people and how this technology will impact those people?” Sanders said. “They are not. They are doing it to get richer and even more powerful.”\n\nSanders also pointed to studies that show dependence on AI chatbots for emotional support. “If this trend continues, what does it mean over the years when people are not getting their support, their interaction from other human beings, but from a machine?” he said. “What does that mean to humanity?”\n\nThat theme was taken up separately on State of the Union by Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican senator and co-sponsor of legislation to protect minors from chatbots.\n\nThe proposed measure – the Guardianship Over Artificial Intelligence Relationships (Guard) Act – seeks to ban providing AI companions to minors. It also mandates that AI companions disclose their non-human status and lack of professional credentials. The measure seeks to establish criminal liability if companies make AI companions available to minors that solicit or produce sexually explicit content – or encourage self-harm or violence.\n\nBritt said she had met with parents who have told her “devastating stories about their children where chatbots ultimately, when they kind of peeled everything back, had isolated them from their parents, had talked to them about suicide”.\n\nShe said: “If these AI companies can make the most brilliant machines in the world, they could do us all a service by putting up proper guardrails that did not allow for minors to utilize these things, that also told the user consistently that they are not a physician, they are not a psychiatrist, ‘I am a machine.’”\n\nBritt said AI companies should be held criminally liable if they create spaces where chatbots “are having these types of sensual and sexual relationships with young people or encouraging suicide”.\n\nThe remarks by Sanders and Britt offer a rare convergence of thinking from the left and right on aspects of the issue of governing AI. Sanders said Congress needed “to vigorously study the impact that AI is having on the mental health of our country”.\n\n“I worry very much about kids spending their entire days getting emotional support,” he added. “So we have got to take a hard look on that.” The senator said lawmakers need to be “thinking seriously” about a moratorium on new AI datacenters.\n\n“Frankly, I think you have got to slow this process down,” he said. “It’s not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us, it’s coming, you adapt. What are they talking about? They going to guarantee health care to all people?\n\n“What are they going to do when people have no jobs? What are they going to do, make housing free? So I think we need to take a deep breath, and I think we need to slow this thing down.”",

    "description": "Investors at 18 VC firms shared where they're investing, what they think is overhyped, and how they expect the tech market to shift in 2026.",
    "fullText": "If January is for resolutions, it's also for predictions — and in 2026, venture capital is placing its bets on tiny teams, personal agents, and a reckoning for wildly overpriced tech startups.\n\nIn recent years, companies dumped money into generative artificial intelligence tools that promised to help them work smarter and faster. The spending spree fattened revenue for companies selling copilots for coding, customer service, sales, and search — and sent their valuations soaring.\n\nNow investors say the next phase is payback. Enterprises will demand measurable returns to keep spending, and the AI companies that can't prove value may find their software renewals harder, fundraising tougher, and exits further away. As Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, put it: \"2026 is the 'show me the money' year for AI.\"\n\nBusiness Insider asked investors at 18 venture capital firms, including Khosla Ventures, CapitalG, Sapphire Ventures, and Greycroft to share their predictions for what's next: where they're investing, what they think is overhyped, and how they expect the market to shift in the year ahead.\n\nFrom IPOs to ROI, these are the tech trends to watch in 2026, according to venture capitalists.\n\nCathy Gao, partner at Sapphire Ventures: We will start treating AI agents like junior staff with job titles, budgets, and spending limits. Once an agent can issue a refund or buy inventory, it stops being a tool and becomes a worker. This flips the business model from paying for access to paying for work completed, like tickets resolved or dollars recovered.\n\nLindsey Li, investor at Bessemer Venture Partners: In 2026, many companies will realize that the AI-written code they've produced over the last two years is often inconsistent, hard to understand, and difficult to maintain. At the same time, a new class of agents will emerge that specialize in debugging, refactoring, and cleaning up large codebases, effectively serving as automated maintainers.\n\nTomasz Tunguz, founder and general partner of Theory Ventures: The typical white collar worker will manage 50 agents daily in 2 years.\n\nBrian Bustamante-Nicholson, partner at Greycroft: Within the consumer space, we've been seeing companies do more with less for last four years. Remote work liberated companies to hire 10x employees all over the world and that naturally resulted in smaller, more efficient teams. Now we're seeing AI impact areas like creative and digital marketing, enabling companies to rely less on both internal hires and agencies to produce campaigns. We expect this trend will only accelerate into 2026, and consumer companies will continue to increase their runways.\n\nJared Heyman, managing partner at Rebel Fund: The trend towards startups becoming increasingly capital efficient is undeniable. Startups are using AI to build AI that other startups use to build more AI — and the cycle continues. As a result, small teams can build way more, way faster, than they could even a few months ago. In 2026, we'll see very small teams achieve extreme revenue growth — perhaps even over $100 million of ARR with just a few cofounders and employees.\n\nManthan Shah, head of US investments at WestBridge Capital: Humans communicate primarily through voice, and that creates a massive opportunity for AI systems that can speak, listen, and interact in a human way. We are still at the very beginning of this shift, but I expect to see a surge in both horizontal and deeply vertical voice-driven applications that effectively replicate human interaction and unlock entirely new business models. Once voice becomes a true platform, it will open the door for a new generation of companies that build products that behave less like software and more like another person in the room.\n\nSimon Wu, partner at Cathay Innovation: If the last two years were dominated by text-based LLMs, 2026 is when enterprises finally move to AI that can listen and see. Voice AI becomes the default for customer support, sales, and service workflows, while video AI emerges as critical infrastructure for robotics, field operations, and enterprise analytics. Expect at least one breakout company to raise a major round in 2026 and position \"multimodal intelligence\" — especially voice and video comprehension — as its core differentiator.\n\nVenky Ganesan, partner at Menlo Ventures: 2026 is the \"show me the money\" year for AI. Enterprises will need to see real ROI in their spend, and companies need to see meaningful increases in productivity growth to keep the AI spend and infrastructure going. Given some of the aggressive spend in AI, you will see a major AI company go bankrupt or have severe financial issues.\n\nMedha Agarwal, general partner at Defy.vc: 2026 will be the year AI spending meets ROI reality. Enterprises will demand hard returns from AI investments, and many pilots will be delayed, scaled back, or cancelled if value doesn't materialize.\n\nRob Biederman, managing Partner at Asymmetric Capital Partners: In 2026, the gap between AI products with tangible, well-defined ROI and those that are perceived as nice-to-have will widen and define outcomes for companies in a way that's been lost during the mania of the last few years. We feel strongly that in 2026 corporate boards and executive teams will begin focusing on payback from AI investment as costs continue to rise with less clear business impact.\n\nRajeev Dham, partner at Sapphire Ventures: In 2026, accounting and finance will become among the fastest-growing categories in enterprise AI. The pressure on companies to modernize the stack creates the perfect demand environment — yet unlike legal, the market still lacks a \"Harvey for finance.\" I believe this vacuum represents one of the largest untapped enterprise AI opportunities.\n\nLindsey Li, investor at Bessemer Venture Partners: Excel and financial spreadsheets become the next major AI breakout vertical. After code generation and customer support, we expect finance workflows particularly in Excel to see the next wave of real AI adoption. Financial modeling and reporting are structured but still largely manual, making them well suited for AI to help build models, clean and organize data, and surface key insights.\n\nSheena Jindal, founder and managing partner at Sugar Free Capital: Outsized technical depth is going to be critical for founders. The acquihire frenzy of 2025 has shown us that premium prices are paid for exceptional founders. As the tech giants remain active with acquisitions, earlier exits via acquihires and M&A will continue to be a new driver of IRR for pre-seed and seed firms who typically have years to wait before DPI.\n\nSarah Du, investor at Uncork Capital: Founders will continue to skew younger than in the pre-AI era. Given the rapid pace of evolution in the space, even experienced founders are learning alongside first-time founders. Speed now matters more than tenure, and younger founders are on a more level playing field than before.\n\nEthan Choi, partner at Khosla Ventures: We'll have the first of dramatic anti-AI protests in certain countries with white collar workers, not blue collar workers, demanding job security in the face of AI disruption.\n\nTamara Steffens, managing director at Thomson Reuters Ventures: The IPO window will continue to open in 2026, fueled by pressure from early investors and improved market stability.\n\nBrian Bustamante-Nicholson, partner at Greycroft: The backlog of companies looking to go public is very healthy. In our view, the administration will continue to capitulate on economic policies that have adversely impacted the US economy and created uncertainty in the capital markets. A few marquee, bellwether IPOs frequently mentioned, like SpaceX, could open the gates and create some urgency with strategics to acquire versus wait as IPOs prove a viable path to liquidity.\n\nTomasz Tunguz, founder and general partner of Theory Ventures: We think M&A continues to accelerate especially with the demand for AI talent at a premium. This will increase the cadence of acquihires as well as multibillion-dollar acquisitions.\n\nSarah Du, investor at Uncork Capital: Big tech and frontier labs will keep scooping up teams to secure AI talent. Some founders may intentionally build with this in mind — optimizing for technical breakthroughs and acquisition potential rather than long-term independence.\n\nDeedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures: A lot of AI valuations will take a markdown, squeezing compensation for AI researchers at tier-1 startups. The best AI companies will continue to succeed but maybe not at the extent that they'd thought.\n\nEthan Choi, partner at Khosla Ventures: We are seeing even more egregious valuations and behavior from founders and investors relative to ZIRP times and I have a hard time seeing how we can sustain these kinds of private valuations without commensurate explosive revenue materializing.\n\nNnamdi Okike, cofounder and managing partner, 645 Ventures: Both public and private investors will regain discipline and apply a much stricter lens to their AI investments. While the correction will begin with hyperscalers and foundation model companies, it will eventually impact the entire AI stack, including application companies. This will have a ripple effect across the tech markets. The receding tide will result in reduced valuations in 2027 in both public and private markets.\n\nShawn Carolan, partner at Menlo Ventures: 2026 will see AI agents autonomously creep into your entire digital life — not just ordering lunch, but negotiating better rates on your behalf, proactively canceling services you've stopped using, and handling complex multi-step tasks like planning and booking trips. The question won't be \"Can AI book a restaurant?\" but, \"How much of my life do I want AI to control?\"\n\nMedha Agarwal, general partner at Defy.vc: Consumer AI crosses a cultural threshold in 2026. AI companionship becomes socially acceptable. People will post about their AI assistants, talk openly about their AI friends, and integrate AI relationships into everyday conversation.\n\nMo Jomaa, partner at CapitalG: While 2025 was the year of \"agent experimentation\" with fragile demos, 2026 will be the year of \"agents in production\" — but only if the infrastructure catches up.\n\nMatt Murphy, partner at Menlo Ventures: The training data market, e.g. Mercor and Handshake, explodes as large and small model developers race to create models that are the best at very specific skill sets. This dramatically accelerates innovation in a broad set of verticals with legal and healthcare as the early movers, but also at risk of overfunding. The new frontier is the next 100 verticals.\n\nAaron Holiday, cofounder and managing partner at 645 Ventures: Generative AI coding tools like Replit, Loveable, and Cursor are lowering the barriers to entry so dramatically that founders who previously lacked engineering resources or traditional credentials can now build and ship products at unprecedented speed.\n\nThe fluidity from idea to software product will lead to a surge in startup formation and product releases at a scale the industry has never seen before.",

    "description": "Three AI engineers explain how returning to school, internships, and college relationships led to jobs at startups and major tech companies.",
    "fullText": "AI has become one of the most popular fields in tech. The people working in it didn't all follow the same path to get there, but for some, college played a crucial role in their success.\n\nFor one AI startup engineer, returning to school provided an opportunity to explore what an AI career would be like before committing to it. For another, moving to the US for a graduate program opened doors to being closer to the center of the action in Big Tech. In another case, relationships formed during college — with peers, professors, and mentors — continued to shape his career even long after graduation.\n\nBelow are three people who pivoted into AI roles and shared with Business Insider how they leveraged their college experience to break into the field. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nVarun Goyal is a 25-year-old AI startup engineer, based in California.\n\nIn my final year of undergraduate studies, I stood at a crossroads between quantitative trading and pursuing a career in technology. Blinded by the initial high salary and prestige, I joined a firm in India as a quantitative strategist for the summer.\n\nI enjoyed it, but I wanted to push boundaries in my career and was increasingly convinced that I should return to school to explore more options. I decided to move from India to the US for my master's degree in computer science.\n\nReturning to school gave me the opportunity to pursue research and engage with senior industry professionals in both fields. This was the biggest benefit for me when I was deciding what I wanted my daily life and career to look like in 10 years.\n\nIn graduate school, the AI boom was also happening. It kept me up at night in the best way possible. I ultimately applied to both industries and had a few quant interviews, but I decided to join an AI startup in 2024 after graduating. I took a lower base salary than what I would have earned in quant, but I felt AI gave me more options down the line.\n\nWithout going back for my master's, I wouldn't have had this opportunity, and I love working in AI.\n\nDeep Shah is a 30-year-old software engineer at Google, based in Mountain View, CA.\n\nGrowing up, I wanted to develop my own computer games, which was the primary reason I chose to pursue a career in computer engineering. I also learned through conversations with peers older than me that the field involved a lot of automating machines to work on my behalf, which excited me. This was my first experience with mentorship.\n\nWhen I was pursuing my bachelor's degree, I got involved with professors who believed in and supported me. Having someone expose me to machine learning or AI problems they're excited about, no matter how small or large, taught me skills that are rarely learned just by doing the core work.\n\nEach mentor will teach you different things, and the person doesn't necessarily need to be a professor. They could be an alum or someone who's more senior at your college. Working with a mentor is also a valuable addition to your résumé, demonstrating that you already possess the skills and experience necessary to succeed in a professional environment.\n\nLater in my career, leaning on peers and mentors provided me with opportunities to further advance my career at Google. I joined Google Bangalore in 2018 after speaking with a friend who worked there. He helped me decide the role I was applying for could be the right fit for me.\n\nIn 2021, I was still at Google Bangalore and wanted to contribute to improving the user experience on Google search. The team working on that project was based in Mountain View, CA, and my skill set was a very good match, so I decided to relocate to the US to join that team.\n\nBuilding my networking skills with peers and mentors throughout my education directly contributed to my later success at Google.\n\nKriti Goyal is a 28-year-old AI machine learning engineer at a Big Tech company, based in Seattle.\n\nI always thought I would study medicine until my cousin showed me a Code.org video with Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and other tech rockstars, about how coding is the quickest way to convert an idea into a product. That changed my life.\n\nI'm now part of the Foundation Model main framework team for a major Big Tech company in the US. This year, I completed five years with them, during which time I've held four different roles. I used my master's to move to the US and further my career.\n\nI originally interned at my current company in India. I enjoyed working in India, but the core business decisions and strategizing for the next projects were made at the company headquarters here in the US.\n\nI had two ways to go about moving to the US. One was to try to move within my company or pursue a master's degree. Two reasons I chose the master's path are the knowledge and extra specialty you can develop through projects, as well as the connections you make. The biggest thing I took away from my program was the people I met.\n\nWhen I arrived in the US, I knew a few people from my former company from my time in India, so I reached out to them directly instead of applying through the job board. I got the interview for a machine learning engineering internship quite easily because the company was already familiar with my work.\n\nLearning and networking can be done in many places; it doesn't have to be university. In a city like San Francisco or New York, you could hustle and get the networking benefits of a university and a structured system.\n\nI think it's now possible to skip that education stage. But I have seen a bias in hiring for specific teams, and it's not unbreakable yet. I was changing countries and cultures, and university was a great way to get through the immigration system and understand the culture. I needed it, and I feel fortunate to be where I am in my career because I made the decision to pursue my master's degree.\n\nDo you have a story to share about breaking into the AI field?

    "fullText": "Careers are long and not always linear.\n\nAt least, that's how Rong Yan, now the chief technology officer at HeyGen, thinks about it.\n\nSo his best advice for those who want to climb the tech ladder: Don't aim for promotions.\n\n\"Don't make promotions the objective of your work,\" he said on \"The Peterman Pod\" recently.\n\nThings are going to get \"painful\" if you focus too much on promotions, he said.\n\nIt's surprising advice from someone who has swiftly leaped up the corporate ladder during his career.\n\nYan has been working in the tech industry since he earned his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2006. He began his career as a researcher at IBM before joining Meta, where he advanced from researcher to manager in just three years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held director positions at Square and Snacphat, and was vice president of engineering at HubSpot, before he joined HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, in 2024.\n\nOver the years, he said he has noticed that those he has mentored can make themselves miserable when they strive for a promotion.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" he said. \"When you start to get into that mindset, you start to count your happiness or your career growth toward something that you don't have full control over.\"\n\nIt's better to control the things you can control. \"Learn how to adjust, and you'll be a better self afterward,\" he said.\n\nFor those still determined to seek a promotion, however, timing matters.\n\nExecutive coach Andrea Wasserman previously told Business Insider that it's best to put yourself in your manager's shoes and think about what's happening across the team or company. Ask yourself, \"Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes?'\"",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Requests to relocate abroad by Israelis working at multinational companies operating in Israel rose in the past year in reaction to Israel's ​two-year war against Palestinian militant group Hamas, a report showed on Sunday.\n\nThe Israel Advanced ‌Technology Industries Association (IATI) found that 53% of companies reported an increase in relocation requests from Israeli employees, noting this was \"a ‌trend that may, over time, harm the local innovation engine and Israel's technological leadership.\"\n\nThe tech sector accounts for about 20% of Israel's GDP, 15% of its jobs and more than half of its exports. The hundreds of multinationals in Israel include Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Apple.\n\nIn ⁠its annual report, IATI also said ‌some multinational companies are examining the transfer of investments and activities to other countries.\n\n\"In some cases, companies that faced disruptions in supply chains found alternatives ‍outside Israel during the war, and when these proved efficient, there is a risk that activity will not fully return,\" said the report, issued at a meeting led by IATI CEO and President Karin Mayer Rubinstein.\n\nAt the ​same time, it added, there has been an increase in demand for relocation among senior ‌executives and families, with more employees applying for positions outside Israel.\n\nStill, the report noted that multinationals view the Israeli tech ecosystem through a long-term lens and many firms have thrived during the war.\n\nSome 57% of companies maintained stable business activities throughout the fighting, and 21% expanded their operations in Israel, \"a figure that indicates continued confidence in local activity and the Israeli ecosystem even ⁠under conditions of uncertainty,\" IATI said.\n\nAnother 22% of companies ​reported damage to business activity during the war, which began ​on October 7, 2023, triggered by Hamas' raid on Israel, and ended two months ago following a U.S.-led ceasefire deal.\n\n\"Even during the difficult war, the Israeli ‍high-tech industry, including the global ⁠companies operating in Israel, once again proved its resilience and its ability to lead in innovation and creativity,\" said Rubinstein. \"We work tirelessly to ensure that Israel continues to be an ⁠attractive hub for the activity of multinational companies.\"\n\nIATI noted that \"without active steps by the state to create regulatory and ‌geopolitical stability, there is concern about gradual erosion in the stability of the local ‌ecosystem.\"",

    "fullText": "Nino Paoli is a former Dow Jones News Fund news fellow at Fortune.\n\nSam Altman, one of the most powerful leaders in Silicon Valley, is jealous of Gen Z college dropouts.\n\n“I’m envious of the current generation of 20-year-old dropouts,” the OpenAI CEO told Rowan Cheung during an interview at the DevDay conference. “Because the amount of stuff you can build… the opportunity space is so incredibly wide.”\n\nAltman said in the past couple of years he has not had a “real chunk of free mental space” to think about what he’d build now. “But I know that there would be a lot of cool stuff to build,” he said.\n\nAltman dropped out of Stanford University in 2005 after two years of studying computer science. An “unexpected opportunity arose” for 19-year-old Altman, who left Stanford to cofound the location-sharing app Loopt.\n\nAs CEO of the company, Altman helped bring in more than $30 million in funding including from notable VC firms like Sequoia Capital. Loopt went through startup accelerator Y Combinator, and after the app was acquired, he became the president of YC. He later cofounded OpenAI in December 2015 with a slew of people, including the world’s richest man, Elon Musk.\n\nDespite his rise to success with tech startups, Altman said he longs to brainstorm other businesses.\n\n“The degree to which OpenAI is, like, taking over all of my mental space, and I don’t get to go think about how to build a new startup, is a little bit sad,” Altman said.\n\nAltman joins a list of college dropouts that have become tech leaders in Silicon Valley, including Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe tech billionaire also said in August he’s envious of young people because current early-career jobs will look “boring” by comparison to jobs in 10 years’ time.\n\nAs Gen Z is in the midst of a job crisis, higher education is being scrutinized even more as the right path for tech entrepreneurs and startup hopefuls.\n\nIn September, GV CEO David Krane—and employee No. 84 at Google—said his son spent the entire summer break between college semesters working in AI, and was questioning if higher education was a “scam.”\n\nOnly 41% of junior U.S. professionals say a college degree is necessary for career success, according to a new LinkedIn Workforce Confidence survey. And CEOs of big tech companies are echoing similar sentiments.\n\n“There’s going to have to be a reckoning,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Theo Von in a “This Past Weekend” episode in April. “Maybe not everyone needs to go to college,” because there are a lot of jobs that don’t require it, he added.\n\n“People are probably coming around to that opinion a little more now than maybe, like, 10 years ago,” Zuckerberg said.\n\nA version of this story published on Fortune.com on October 8, 2025.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Requests to relocate abroad by Israelis working at multinational companies operating in Israel rose in the past year in reaction to Israel’s two-year war against Palestinian militant group Hamas, a report showed on Sunday.\n\nThe Israel Advanced Technology Industries Association (IATI) found that 53% of companies reported an increase in relocation requests from Israeli employees, noting this was \"a trend that may, over time, harm the local innovation engine and Israel’s technological leadership.\"\n\nThe tech sector accounts for about 20% of Israel’s GDP, 15% of its jobs and more than half of its exports. The hundreds of multinationals in Israel include Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Apple.\n\nIn its annual report, IATI also said some multinational companies are examining the transfer of investments and activities to other countries.\n\n\"In some cases, companies that faced disruptions in supply chains found alternatives outside Israel during the war, and when these proved efficient, there is a risk that activity will not fully return,\" said the report, issued at a meeting led by IATI CEO and President Karin Mayer Rubinstein.\n\nAt the same time, it added, there has been an increase in demand for relocation among senior executives and families, with more employees applying for positions outside Israel.\n\nStill, the report noted that multinationals view the Israeli tech ecosystem through a long-term lens and many firms have thrived during the war.\n\nTECH SECTOR ’PROVES ITS RESILIENCE’\n\nSome 57% of companies maintained stable business activities throughout the fighting, and 21% expanded their operations in Israel, \"a figure that indicates continued confidence in local activity and the Israeli ecosystem even under conditions of uncertainty,\" IATI said.\n\nAnother 22% of companies reported damage to business activity during the war, which began on October 7, 2023, triggered by Hamas’ raid on Israel, and ended two months ago following a U.S.-led ceasefire deal.\n\n\"Even during the difficult war, the Israeli high-tech industry, including the global companies operating in Israel, once again proved its resilience and its ability to lead in innovation and creativity,\" said Rubinstein. \"We work tirelessly to ensure that Israel continues to be an attractive hub for the activity of multinational companies.\"\n\nIATI noted that \"without active steps by the state to create regulatory and geopolitical stability, there is concern about gradual erosion in the stability of the local ecosystem.\"",

    "description": "Four tech professionals, from an early career engineer to a former senior director of GenAI at Meta, said getting your hands dirty was important for breaking into the AI industry.",
    "fullText": "As the AI revolution continues to disrupt white collar jobs, many of us are looking for ways to get ahead.\n\nAs part of my first-person coverage for Business Insider in 2025, I asked people with aspirational jobs their formulas for success — including how tech workers in various stages of their careers landed cutting-edge AI jobs.\n\nThese conversations covered a variety of topics, from whether you need a Ph.D. to break into the field to how to earn big as an AI contractor.\n\nBut one remarkably simple piece of advice kept coming up: gain real-world experience with AI technology to help get your foot in the door.\n\nThey didn't view AI as something that can be mastered from a textbook or in a lecture hall. Instead, play around with AI, like an infant tinkering with a new toy, or \"get your hands dirty,\" to borrow a phrase from a couple of the techies I interviewed.\n\nBut what does that look like in practice? Here's how they applied this principle in their own careers.\n\nWhen Patrick Leung, who joined Google in 2007, first saw a demo for a calling assistant that used AI, which would later be called Google Duplex, he was blown away by how realistic the voice sounded.\n\nLeung joined the Duplex team in 2017. Although he'd been exposed to machine learning and AI concepts during previous company projects, he'd never worked on building models and had to retool himself on the job.\n\nLeveraging the expertise around him, including by having lengthy conversations with colleagues who explained how the system worked, helped him become proficient in AI.\n\nLeung witnessed Google Duplex's public launch in 2018, before leaving Google in 2019 to join a financial sciences company. He's continued to work with AI in the later stages of his career.\n\nAt the time of his interview with Business Insider, Leung said the barrier to getting into AI was lower than ever, and encouraged people to apply LLMs to real business problems. For instance, a friend with no coding experience used AI to personalize outreach messages for recruitment purposes at her job and improved her response rate.\n\nIf there aren't opportunities to do something like this in your current job, use AI in your spare time and put it on your résumé, Leung said, adding that people who can demonstrate they can wield LLMs effectively are going to find jobs.\n\nSophia Sun essentially put Leung's advice into action when she pitched a project that would use AI to help customers at Kajabi, the creator commerce platform she worked for as a senior product manager.\n\nThe tool Sun envisioned would help content creators generate marketing content, such as blog posts and short-form videos, for TikTok and Instagram.\n\nShe started working on the project in April 2023, alongside engineering and marketing teammates. Seeing it through to its March 2024 launch was a learning curve for Sun, who had never built an AI product before.\n\nThat July, Sun started a new job at Microsoft as a senior AI product manager, and told Business Insider she thought her end-to-end experience with building an AI product helped her land the role.\n\nSun's playbook for breaking into AI was to find a real user problem, design a lightweight AI solution, and turn it into proof of work. Having good grades is one thing, she said, but building a product that demonstrates your abilities is another, she said.\n\nWhen OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, Mostofa Adib Shakib knew the world was going to change.\n\nHe started his career in traditional software engineering at Snap Inc. and then ZipRecruiter, but became convinced he needed to build AI skills.\n\nShakib spent time learning about AI from books, videos, and research papers, and he built software projects to gain proficiency with agentic AI, such as a tool to help Bangladeshi professionals optimize their résumés.\n\nIn February 2025, he started an AI contractor role with Mercor, which, around the time of his interview with Business Insider, earned him a handsome sum of $6,400 a week.\n\nShakib decided not to go back to a full-time traditional software engineering job. He said he thought focusing on building AI skills before the market gets crowded was the right bet for him.\n\nWhile being a full-time employee at a company offers stability and benefits, it would restrict his time, meaning he could only focus on gaining agentic AI skills on weekends, he said. As a full-time AI contractor, he can spread out his hours as he pleases, he added.\n\nShakib advised people interested in staying relevant in the tech industry to embrace change, rather than fear it, and to focus on upskilling.\n\nAlthough Devi Parikh completed a Ph.D. in computer vision in 2009, before going on to become a senior director of GenAI at Meta years later, she said not to assume you need a Ph.D. to break into AI.\n\nAs the cofounder and co-CEO of the AI company Yutori, she doesn't consider Ph.D.s much when hiring, but looks for people with relevant practical experience, such as training models, she said.\n\nOther potential avenues into interesting AI work include spending time at startups or big labs, or trying side projects that make use of open source code and online communities.\n\nStarting and executing projects has been instrumental to her career success, Parikh said. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she started working on a YouTube series called \"Humans of AI,\" where she interviewed AI researchers about their daily habits. This gave her more professional visibility than her research alone could.\n\nDo you have a story to share about breaking into AI? Contact this reporter at ccheong@businessinsider.com",

    "fullText": "From companionship to psychotherapy, technology could meet unmet needs – but it needs to be handled responsibly\n\nThere is much anxiety these days about the dangers of human-AI relationships. Reports of suicide and self-harm attributable to interactions with chatbots have understandably made headlines. The phrase “AI psychosis” has been used to describe the plight of people experiencing delusions, paranoia or dissociation after talking to large language models (LLMs). Our collective anxiety has been compounded by studies showing that young people are increasingly embracing the idea of AI relationships; half of teens chat with an AI companion at least a few times a month, with one in three finding conversations with AI “to be as satisfying or more satisfying than those with real‑life friends”.\n\nBut we need to pump the brakes on the panic. The dangers are real, but so too are the potential benefits. In fact, there’s an argument to be made that – depending on what future scientific research reveals – AI relationships could actually be a boon for humanity.\n\nConsider how ubiquitous nonhuman relationships have always been for our species. We have a long history of engaging in healthy interactions with nonhumans, whether they be pets, stuffed animals or beloved objects or machines – think of the person in your life who is fully obsessed with their car, to the point of naming it. In the case of pets, these are real relationships insofar as our cats and dogs understand that they are in a relationship with us. But the one‑sided, parasocial relationships we have with stuffed animals or cars happen without those things knowing that we exist. Only in the rarest of cases do these relationships devolve into something pathological. Parasociality is, for the most part, normal and healthy.\n\nAnd yet, there is something unsettling about AI  relationships. Because they are fluent language users, LLMs generate the uncanny feeling that they have human-like thoughts, feelings and intentions. They also generate sycophantic responses that reinforce our points of view, rarely challenging our thinking. This combination can easily lead people down a path of delusion. This is not something that happens when we interact with cats, dogs or inanimate objects. But the question remains: even in cases where people are unable to see through the illusion that AIs are real people that actually care about us, is that always a problem?\n\nConsider loneliness: one in six people on this planet experience it, and it’s associated with a 26% increase in premature death; the equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Research is emerging that suggests AI companions are effective at reducing feelings of loneliness – and not just by functioning as a form of distraction, but as a result of the parasocial relationship itself. For many people, an AI chatbot is the only friendship option available to them, however hollow it might seem. As the journalist Sangita Lal recently explained in a report on those turning to AI for companionship, we should not be so quick to judge. “If you don’t understand why subscribers want and seek and need this connection,” said Lal, “you’re lucky enough to not have experienced loneliness.”\n\nTo be fair, there is an argument to be made that the rise of new tech and social media has itself played a role in driving the loneliness epidemic. That’s why Mark Zuckerberg got flak for his glowing endorsement of AI as a solution to a problem he might be partly responsible for creating. But if the reality is that it helps, this cannot be dismissed out of hand.\n\nThere’s also research to show that AI can be used as an effective psychotherapy tool. In one study, patients who chatted with an AI-powered therapy chatbot showed a 30% reduction in anxiety symptoms. Not as effective as human therapists, who generated a 45% reduction, but still better than nothing. This utilitarian argument is worth considering; there are millions of people who are, for whatever reason, unable to access a therapist. And in those cases, turning to an AI is probably preferable to not seeking any help at all.\n\nBut one study isn’t proof of anything. And there’s the rub. We are at the early stages of research into the potential benefits or harms of AI companionship. It’s easy to focus on the handful of studies that support our preconceived notions about the dangers or benefits of this technology.\n\nIt’s in this research vacuum that the true dangers of AI are revealed. Most of the entities deploying AI companions are for-profit companies. And if there’s one thing we know about for-profit companies, it’s that they are keen to avoid regulations and eschew evidence that could hurt their bottom line. They are incentivised to downplay risks, cherrypick evidence and tout only benefits.\n\nThe emergence of AI is not unlike the discovery of the analgesic properties of opium; if harnessed by responsible parties with the goal of relieving pain and suffering, both AI and opioids can be a legitimate tool for healing. But if bad actors exploit their addictive properties to enrich themselves, the result is either dependency or death.\n\nI remain hopeful that there is a place for AI companionship. But only if it’s backed by robust science, and deployed by organisations that exist for the public good. AIs must avoid the sycophancy problem that leads vulnerable people to delusion. This can only be achieved if they are explicitly trained to do so, even if it makes them less attractive as a potential companion; a notion that is anathema to companies that want you to pay a monthly subscription, without which you lose access to your “friend”. They must also be designed to help the user develop the social skills they need to engage with actual humans in the real world.\n\nThe ultimate goal of AI companions should be to make themselves obsolete. No matter how useful they might be in plugging the gaps in therapy access or alleviating loneliness, it will always be better to talk to a real human.\n\nJustin Gregg is a biologist and author of Humanish (Oneworld).\n\nCode Dependent: Living in the Shadow of AI by Madhumita Murgia (Picador, £20)\n\nThe Coming Wave: AI, Power and Our Future by Mustafa Suleyman (Vintage, £10.99)\n\nSupremacy: AI, ChatGPT and the Race That Will Change the World by Parmy Olson (Macmillan, £10.99)",

Others are working on creative platforms that let marketers create ads and even virtual influencers using generative AI. Some are working in the new area of \"generative engine optimization\" (GEO), helping brands optimize their visibility in AI search results.\n\n\"We want to disrupt the traditional ad agency,\" Bolbi Liu, founder of AI adtech startup AdsGency, told Business Insider. In October, AdsGency announced it raised a $12 million seed round, led by XYZ Venture Capital.\n\nAdvertising agency giants are aware that they must embrace AI or risk being left behind. Large agency groups, from UK-based WPP to French holding company Publicis and US ad giant Omnicom, have pledged to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in AI over the next few years. Publicis is hunting for AI companies to acquire.\n\nThere's big money to be made. A Boston Consulting Group survey of 200 senior marketers, conducted this year, found that 71% of chief marketing officers plan to invest at least $10 million annually in generative AI over the next three years, up from 57% of respondents in the 2024 edition of the study.\n\nBusiness Insider has interviewed the founders of startups building tools to disrupt advertising and marketing with AI. These founders shared the pitch decks they used to impress investors and raise venture capital funding.",

    "fullText": "If appeal fails, every person in UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to compensation\n\nApple is seeking to overturn a landmark £1.5bn court ruling on behalf of millions of UK customers, which found the company overcharged them for years in its App Store.\n\nThe iPhone maker has applied to the court of appeal to challenge a verdict that campaigners heralded as the start of a “tidal shift against big tech”.\n\nIt is one of a cluster of cases heading towards trial in 2026 as consumers realise the mounting cost of paying up to 30% commission – what campaigners call the “Apple tax” – on apps and in-app purchases, which more people rely on for activities from fitness to dating.\n\nThe appeal, if allowed, involves one of several class action suits against Apple and Google in which consumers, small businesses and entrepreneurs are demanding over £6bn in combined compensation. The class action cases use an opt-out system that means millions of people can be represented at once in claims of breaches of competition law.\n\n“It’s definitely a tipping point,” said Dr Rachael Kent, an academic at King’s College London who won the £1.5bn case against Apple on behalf of 36 million UK consumers. “People are pushing back against the harms from digital worlds, which they have to be living in and through every day and the financial implications of that,” she said.\n\nKent added that the win in October still felt “a bit pinch me”. If Apple’s appeal fails, every person in the UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to a payout.\n\nIn the suite of class action cases, Apple and Google are accused of overcharging British consumers and developers in their app stores and, in the case of Apple, of “trapping” and overcharging customers with its iCloud data storage service.\n\nInstead of up to 30%, Apple should be charging commission of 17.5% when selling apps and 10% on in-app purchases, while app developers should pay 10%, the competition appeal tribunal found in Kent’s case.\n\nAnother of the cases is being brought by Barry Rodger, a law professor at the University of Strathclyde, on behalf of more than 2,000 app developers who he argues are collectively entitled to up to £1bn in compensation.\n\n“Small and medium-sized app developer businesses have suffered as the result of excessive profiteering by the App Store and Google Play,” he said. His case alleges Google Play has charged “excessive, arbitrary and discriminatory commissions” against developers, with the makers of dating and games apps particularly affected.\n\nHis suit is expected to reach trial at the competitions appeal tribunal in October 2026, and will be jointly managed with a claim for about £1bn on behalf of 19 million Google Play customers, who are alleged to have been overcharged. That case is being brought by the consumer activist Liz Coll and accuses Google of “excluding competition and/or charging an unlawfully high level of commission on digital purchases”, breaching competition law.\n\nColl said: “These types of large collective proceedings are new in the UK, but I’m really excited about the potential of the Kent decision to not only make people aware they were paying too much for apps through opaque commission but also that there is now a clear route to getting that put right. Where we need consumers to get really active now is in claiming back the money they’re owed.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “Android provides more choice than any other platform and our fees are the lowest of any major app platform. We’ll defend these cases vigorously.”\n\nGoogle argues that the class action cases seek to upend a system that has lowered prices and increased choice and that, if successful, would make downloading and using apps on Android phones more complicated and less safe.\n\nAnd in the largest of all the claims, November saw the consumer campaign group Which? announce a £3bn claim against Apple over its iCloud services, claiming it is “trapping” customers with Apple devices into using it.\n\nApple called the Which? claims unfounded and said no customers are required to use iCloud. The company said it strongly disagrees with the ruling in Kent’s case over the App Store, and the tribunal took a flawed view of the “thriving and competitive app economy”, with other platforms providing “vigorous competition”. It said most apps are subject to a 15% commission, and the App Store helps drive the UK’s digital economy, facilitating billings and sales of over $55bn (£41bn) in the UK in 2024.\n\nKent said that people are “waking up to the harms of digital life and how it can be detrimental mentally, physically and financially”.\n\n“There is a tidal shift that is happening against big tech,” she said. “Consumers are looking at all of the tools that they have to use every day. Covid really accelerated our reliance on technology and many of us went from using five apps in a week to perhaps 10 apps in a day to manage food shopping, food delivery, retail, fitness and diet tracking, keeping in close communication with friends and family, much more social media, increased screen time.\n\n“A big part of the last six years working the case has been about educating people that this is actually happening. That’s what tech giants and marketeers like Apple are so brilliant at. It’s creating an ecosystem where we are foreclosed into decision making and we don’t even realise that this is actually how it’s happening.”",

But it has said the capital-intensive nature of rocket development means it ⁠will need access to China's capital markets if it hopes ​to compete with SpaceX.\n\nThe Shanghai exchange's rules do not state ​that rocket firms must successfully recover a rocket, only that reusable rocket technology be used to put a satellite into orbit, something LandSpace already achieved with this month's launch.\n\nCompanies ‍that undertake national missions ⁠or participate in major state-led space projects will receive priority support, according to the new guidelines, which take effect immediately, underscoring the close alignment between commercial launch activity and China's broader strategic ⁠goals.\n\nChina has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on low-Earth orbit satellites as a national security risk and is actively pushing its own ‌satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the ‌next decades.",

    "description": "AI bots told to act as trading agents in simulated markets engaged in pervasive collusion, raising new questions about how financial regulators have previously addressed this tech.",
    "fullText": "Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture.\n\nArtificial intelligence is just smart—and stupid—enough to pervasively form price-fixing cartels in financial market conditions if left to their own devices.\n\nA working paper posted earlier this year on the National Bureau of Economic Research website from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology found when AI-powered trading agents were released into simulated markets, the bots colluded with one another, engaging in price fixing to make a collective profit.\n\nIn the study, researchers let bots loose in market models, essentially a computer program designed to simulate real market conditions and train AI to interpret market-pricing data, with virtual market makers setting prices based on different variables in the model. These markets can have various levels of “noise,” referring to the amount of conflicting information and price fluctuation in the various market contexts. While some bots were trained to behave like retail investors and others like hedge funds, in many cases, the machines engaged in “pervasive” price-fixing behaviors by collectively refusing to trade aggressively—without being explicitly told to do so.\n\nIn one algorithmic model looking at price-trigger strategy, AI agents traded conservatively on signals until a large enough market swing triggered them to trade very aggressively. The bots, trained through reinforcement learning, were sophisticated enough to implicitly understand that widespread aggressive trading could create more market volatility.\n\nIn another model, AI bots had over-pruned biases and were trained to internalize that if any risky trade led to a negative outcome, they should not pursue that strategy again. The bots traded conservatively in a “dogmatic” manner, even when more aggressive trades were seen as more profitable, collectively acting in a way the study called “artificial stupidity.”\n\n“In both mechanisms, they basically converge to this pattern where they are not acting aggressively, and in the long run, it’s good for them,” study co-author and Wharton finance professor Itay Goldstein told Fortune.\n\nFinancial regulators have long worked to address anti-competitive practices like collusion and price fixing in markets. But in retail, AI has taken the spotlight, particularly as companies using algorithmic pricing come under scrutiny. This month, Instacart, which uses AI-powered pricing tools, announced it will end its program where some customers saw different prices for the same item on the delivery company’s platform. It follows a Consumer Reports analysis found in an experiment that Instacart offered nearly 75% of its grocery items at multiple prices.\n\n“For the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and those regulators in financial markets, their primary goal is to not only preserve this kind of stability, but also ensure competitiveness of the market and market efficiency,” Winston Wei Dou, Wharton professor of finance and one of the study’s authors, told Fortune.\n\nWith that in mind, Dou and two colleagues set out to identify how AI would behave in a financial market by putting trading agent bots into various simulated markets based on high or low levels of “noise.” The bots ultimately earned “supra-competitive profits” by collectively and spontaneously deciding to avoid aggressive trading behaviors.\n\n“They just believed sub-optimal trading behavior as optimal,” Dou said. “But it turns out, if all the machines in the environment are trading in a ‘sub-optimal’ way, actually everyone can make profits because they don’t want to take advantage of each other.”\n\nSimply put, the bots didn’t question their conservative trading behaviors because they were all making money and therefore stopped engaging in competitive behaviors with one another, forming de-facto cartels.\n\nWith the ability to increase consumer inclusion in financial markets and save investors time and money on advisory services, AI tools for financial services, like trading agent bots, have become increasingly appealing. Nearly one-third of U.S. investors said they felt comfortable accepting financial planning advice from a generative AI-powered tool, according to a 2023 survey from financial planning nonprofit CFP Board. A report published in July from cryptocurrency exchange MEXC found that among 78,000 Gen Z users, 67% of those traders activated at least one AI-powered trading bot in the previous fiscal quarter.\n\nBut for all their benefits, AI trading agents aren’t without risks, according to Michael Clements, director of financial markets and community at the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Beyond cybersecurity concerns and potentially biased decision-making, these trading bots can have a real impact on markets.\n\n“A lot of AI models are trained on the same data,” Clements told Fortune. “If there is consolidation within AI so there’s only a few major providers of these platforms, you could get herding behavior—that large numbers of individuals and entities are buying at the same time or selling at the same time, which can cause some price dislocations.”\n\nJonathan Hall, an external official on the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, warned last year of AI bots encouraging this “herd-like behavior” that could weaken the resilience of markets. He advocated for a “kill switch” for the technology, as well as increased human oversight.\n\nClements explained many financial regulators have so far been able to apply well-established rules and statutes to AI, saying for example, “Whether a lending decision is made with AI or with a paper and pencil, rules still apply equally.”\n\nSome agencies, such as the SEC, are even opting to fight fire with fire, developing AI tools to detect anomalous trading behaviors.\n\n“On the one hand, you might have an environment where AI is causing anomalous trading,” Clements said. “On the other hand, you would have the regulators in a little better position to be able to detect it as well.”\n\nAccording to Dou and Goldstein, regulators have expressed interest in their research, which the authors said has helped expose gaps in current regulation around AI in financial services. When regulators have previously looked for instances of collusion, they’ve looked for evidence of communication between individuals, with the belief that humans can’t really sustain price-fixing behaviors unless they’re corresponding with one another. But in Dou and Goldstein’s study, the bots had no explicit forms of communication.\n\n“With the machines, when you have reinforcement learning algorithms, it really doesn’t apply, because they’re clearly not communicating or coordinating,” Goldstein said. “We coded them and programmed them, and we know exactly what’s going into the code, and there is nothing there that is talking explicitly about collusion. Yet they learn over time that this is the way to move forward.”\n\nThe differences in how human and bot traders communicate behind the scenes is one of the “most fundamental issues” where regulators can learn to adapt to rapidly developing AI technologies, Goldstein argued.\n\n“If you use it to think about collusion as emerging as a result of communication and coordination,” he said, “this is clearly not the way to think about it when you’re dealing with algorithms.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on August 1, 2025.",

Late on Thursday a court granted him a temporary restraining order to block any attempt to remove him from the US or detain him.\n\nAhmed told the Guardian he believed he had been singled out for his work seeking greater accountability and transparency for social media and AI firms, which has led to Elon Musk’s X unsuccessfully suing CCDH.\n\nAhmed, who is a friend of Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, said it was another attempt to deflect accountability and transparency.\n\n“This has never been about politics,” he said, adding that his organisation had worked successfully with the first Trump administration and would do so again if asked.\n\n“What it has been about is companies that simply do not want to be held accountable and, because of the influence of big money in Washington, are corrupting the system and trying to bend it to their will, and their will is to be unable to be held accountable,” he said.\n\n“There is no other industry, that acts with such arrogance, indifference and a lack of humility and sociopathic greed at the expense of people.”\n\nAs well as Ahmed, the state department has barred the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accused the five people of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.\n\nSarah Rogers, an official at the state department, posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”\n\nThe sanctions are being seen as the latest attack on European regulations that target hate speech and misinformation. Campaigners in the UK have said the British government could be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.\n\nAhmed, who began his career working with Labour politicians in Westminster, said he had not yet formally received any notification from the US government, and that he believed its case against him was unfounded. “I’m very confident that our first amendment rights will be upheld by the court,” he said.\n\nThe next court hearing, due on Monday, is expected to confirm the protective order that prevents the US government from detaining him, said Ahmed, who spent Christmas away from his wife and infant daughter amid the legal battle.\n\nHe said this was “a rational thing for us to do, given that in every other case to date where someone has had a green card withdrawn in the last few months, they have been arrested and detained and often spirited hundreds or thousands of miles away from their friends, family and support networks.”\n\nThe CCDH has previously angered Musk over reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took it over. Musk tried unsuccessfully to sue the CCDH last year before calling it a “criminal organisation”.\n\nMore recently, the CCDH released a report warning about harmful answers produced by the latest version of ChatGPT when asked about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.\n\n“We’ve seen that social media and AI companies are increasingly under pressure as a result of organisations like mine,” Ahmed said. “No one likes being exposed as mendacious or hypocritical, but they call their friends in government or they call their pitbull litigation lawyers and start suing.”\n\nAhmed said it was particularly jarring to be targeted given that hate speech and misinformation was increasingly a bipartisan issue, raised as a concern by some Republican politicians as well as Democrats.\n\nHe said he was nonetheless ready to respond with a swift legal response when he heard the news. “When you take on the world’s biggest corporations and when you’ve had the experiences we’ve had, being sued by the world’s richest man, you dissociate and compartmentalise immediately.”\n\nThere had been a cost already, he said. “Nothing I’m going through compares to any of the parents I sit with who’ve lost their children,” Ahmed said. “I chose to take on the biggest companies in the world, to hold them accountable, to speak truth to power. There is a cost attached to that. My family understands that.\n\n“The only time I felt any sadness at all is last night when my wife told me that our child said her sixth word, and then I cried a bit.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "I spent a year listening to tech leaders talk about AI. Here are the biggest lessons on AI, work, superintelligence, and what comes next.",
    "fullText": "I've listened to and interviewed more than 50 tech leaders this year, from executives running trillion-dollar firms to young founders betting their futures on AI.\n\nAcross boardrooms, conferences, and podcast interviews, the people building our AI future kept returning to the same four themes:\n\nThis is the line I heard most often. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said it multiple times this year.\n\n\"Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable. You're not going to lose your job to an AI, but you're going to lose your job to someone who uses AI,\" he said at the Milken Institute's Global Conference in May.\n\nOther tech leaders echoed his view, with some saying that younger workers may actually have an edge because they are already comfortable using AI tools.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on Cleo Abram's \"Huge Conversations\" YouTube show in August that while AI will inevitably wipe out some roles, college graduates are better equipped to adjust.\n\n\"If I were 22 right now and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history,\" Altman said, adding that his bigger concern is how older workers will cope as AI reshapes work.\n\nFei-Fei Li, the Stanford professor known as the \"godmother of AI,\" said in an interview on \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" published earlier this month that resistance to AI is a dealbreaker. She said she won't hire engineers who refuse to use AI tools at her startup, World Labs.\n\nThis shift is already showing up in everyday roles. An accountant and an HR professional told me they're using AI tools, including vibe coding, to level up their skills and stay relevant.\n\nAnother consensus I've heard among tech leaders is that AI makes soft skills more valuable.\n\nSalesforce's chief futures officer, Peter Schwartz, told me in an interview in May that \"the most important skill is empathy, working with other people,\" not coding knowledge.\n\n\"Parents ask me what should my kids study, shall they be coders? I said, 'Learn how to work with others,'\" he said.\n\nLinkedIn's head economist for Asia Pacific, Chua Pei Ying, also told me in July that she sees soft skills like communication and collaboration becoming increasingly important for experienced workers and fresh graduates.\n\nAs AI automates parts of our job and makes teams leaner, the human part of the job is starting to matter more.\n\nAs the year went on, the stakes around AI's future began to feel bigger and more real. Tech leaders increasingly spoke about chasing artificial general intelligence, or AGI, and eventually superintelligence.\n\nAGI refers to AI systems that can match human intelligence across a range of tasks, while superintelligence describes systems that surpass human capabilities.\n\nAltman said in September that society needs to be prepared for superintelligence, which could arrive by 2030. Mark Zuckerberg established Meta's Superintelligence Labs in June and said that the company is pushing toward superintelligence.\n\nThese leaders don't want to miss the AI moment. Zuckerberg underscored that urgency in September, saying he would rather risk \"misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars\" than be late to superintelligence.\n\nSome tech leaders, such as Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi, argued that the industry has already achieved AGI. Others are more cautious. Google DeepMind's cofounder, Demis Hassabis, said in April that AGI could arrive \"in the next five to 10 years.\"\n\nEven when tech leaders disagree on timelines, they tend to agree on one thing: AI progress is compounding.\n\nI saw this acceleration from the outside as a user. New tools are rolling out at a dizzying pace — from ChatGPT adding shopping features and image generation to China's \"AGI cameras.\"\n\nThings that would have felt magical in January now feel normal.\n\nMany leaders also circled back to the need for human control amid AI acceleration.\n\nMicrosoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman said superintelligence must support human agency, not override it. He said on an episode of the \"Silicon Valley Girl Podcast\" published in November that his team is \"trying to build a humanist superintelligence,\" warning that systems smarter than humans will be difficult to contain or align with human interests.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei has been blunt about the risks AI poses if it's misused.\n\nWhile advanced AI can lower the barrier to knowledge work, the risks scale alongside the rewards, Amodei said on an episode of the New York Times' \"Hard Fork\" published in February.\n\n\"If you look at our responsible scaling policy, it's nothing but AI, autonomy, and CBRN — chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear,\" Amodei said.\n\n\"It is about hardcore misuse in AI autonomy that could be threats to the lives of millions of people,\" he added.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the \"godfather of AI,\" said in August that as AI systems surpass human intelligence, safeguarding humanity becomes the central challenge.\n\n\"We have to make it so that when they're more powerful than us and smarter than us, they still care about us,\" Hinton said at the Ai4 conference in Las Vegas.",

    "description": "AI infrastructure firms are set to win from the evolution of once asset-light Big Tech firms.",
    "fullText": "The AI market is tipped to splinter in 2026.\n\nThe last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.\n\nSuch volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.\n\nInvestors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.\n\nSo far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.\n\nHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms.\n\nThe first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.\n\nBlue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.\n\nMost companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\n\n\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.\n\nThe AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC.\n\nThe bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said.\n\n\"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"\n\nThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies.\n\nCompanies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.\n\nDorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\n\n\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.\n\nTech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.\n\nThe private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added.\n\nIf incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said.\n\nIn addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\"\n\n\"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\"",

    "title": "I moved to the US from India. Here's how I landed a job at Microsoft after first misunderstanding the Big Tech hiring process.",
    "description": "Rishab Jolly moved to the US to get his MBA after starting his engineering career in India. He was hired at Microsoft in 2017 as a product manager.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rishab Jolly, a 37-year-old senior product manager at Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington. Business Insider has verified Jolly's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore moving to the US in 2015, I studied engineering and computer science in India, where I worked as both a software quality tester and an engineer.\n\nI was always interested in the business side of technology, so I left my job in India to pursue an MBA at the University of Arizona. My goal was to gain business acumen to complement my engineering background. I saw firsthand how much innovation takes place in the US and how many opportunities exist to work on cutting-edge products, which inspired me to build my career here.\n\nOne of the most valuable parts of the MBA program was its partnerships with Big Tech companies. As part of the curriculum, representatives from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google brought projects to campus.\n\nStudents formed teams, worked on deliverables, and were graded by company representatives. In 2016, I was team lead on a Microsoft project, and we did an excellent job. That gave me a chance to network and to demonstrate my skills to an actual Microsoft product manager.\n\nI applied to about 200 jobs, sending the same generic résumé without referrals. I received only three calls back and passed two interviews, but both offers were subsequently rescinded: one company considered my visa too risky without a STEM extension, and another cited budgetary reasons.\n\nI needed to secure a job within 60-90 days after graduation, or I would be forced to return to India. I ran out of money, asked a friend if I could crash on their couch, and felt a constant sense of anxiety.\n\nDuring that time, I stayed in touch with the Microsoft contact I'd met through my MBA project. When an opening came up, I asked if he would refer me.\n\nHe agreed, and I rewrote my résumé to match the specific role. The hiring manager liked my application, called me in, and I got a shot. That referral and tailoring my résumé made all the difference.\n\nI was hired by Microsoft in July 2017 and started as a product manager. I became a senior product manager in 2021.\n\nFirst, you have to get the interview, and second, you have to pass it. For the first step, referrals are critical. Big Tech companies receive tens of thousands of résumés every month. A referral can push yours to the top of the stack.\n\nTo prepare for interviews, I relied heavily on mock interviews. I reached out to peers who had been in the same boat and asked them to test me. They helped me refine my storytelling, practice answering metrics-driven questions, and pinpoint areas for improvement.\n\nWhen I finally interviewed at Microsoft, the feedback I received was that my stories were authentic and clearly based on real experiences. That authenticity resonated far more than rehearsed answers pulled from the internet.\n\nIn today's tech world, showcasing your skills outside work or school, whether on LinkedIn, GitHub, or through personal projects, demonstrates passion and initiative.\n\nI started posting more consistently on LinkedIn during the pandemic. I shared lessons from my career, thoughts on product management, and observations about the industry. I wasn't trying to \"build a following,\" I just focused on topics that genuinely resonated with me.\n\nOver time, those posts resonated with others, and a community naturally formed around them. The growth happened gradually and organically, simply because people connected with the ideas and conversations.\n\nRecruiters notice when you go beyond the curriculum to learn new tools or contribute to open-source projects. In a fast-changing industry where AI and new technologies emerge every six months, demonstrating your ability to adapt and self-learn is as important as the content of your résumé.\n\nWhile a small percentage of jobs may prefer an MBA, I know successful product managers who came from accounting, English literature, or completely different areas. Microsoft values diverse backgrounds because innovation thrives when teams bring fresh perspectives.\n\nEven with this knowledge, I would still pursue an MBA because it was not just about academics; it was also about gaining practical experience. It provided me with exposure to new perspectives, helped me transition into product management, and connected me with mentors and peers who have shaped my career in meaningful ways.\n\nI don't think an MBA is mandatory for everyone. It depends on your goals and whether you're looking for a career pivot, a network, or structured learning.\n\nVisa restrictions, financial pressure, and cultural adjustments can make the experience stressful. I had moments when I felt defeated, but staying focused and working smart eventually brought everything together.\n\nAfter over eight years at Microsoft, I plan to continue contributing to the technology and innovation ecosystem. I'm exploring the appropriate pathways that align with my career goals, but nothing is finalized at this time. My focus is on the work itself and continuing to grow professionally.\n\nMy advice to anyone following a similar path is straightforward: network strategically, prepare thoroughly, stay authentic, and continually build your skills and presence. Things may look uncertain now, but persistence and the right relationships can open doors you didn't think were possible.",

    "description": "JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman Sachs are investing heavily in AI technology to transform operations, enhance productivity, and stay competitive.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan Chase has a technology budget of $18 billion, with much of it going toward making sure it's a leader and early mover in AI.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is a \"tremendous\" user of the bank's generative AI suite. The bank has rolled out its proprietary genAI platform to over 200,000 employees. And with about 100 more tools in the pipeline, JPMorgan is seeking to reengineer workflows for everyone from coders to portfolio managers.\n\nJPMorgan has reportedly given employees the option to use its in-house AI tools to assist in writing year-end performance reviews.\n\nExecutives at America's largest bank gave an inside look at how it's training employees to use its tools and how they're using them to deliver measurable results.\n\nDimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race, and he thinks JPMorgan's $2 billion AI investment has already matched its cost in savings.\n\nCitigroup has also been aggressively accelerating its AI plans. Over the summer, the bank doubled down on its AI ambitions with new leadership at the helm of its tech transformation.\n\nIn mid-October, Citi CEO Jane Fraser said that nearly 180,000 employees in 83 countries have access to the bank's proprietary AI tools and have used them almost 7 million times this year.\n\nIts generative AI tools have saved 100,000 developer hours a week with automated code reviews — \"a very meaningful productivity uplift,\" she said during the firm's third-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe bank launched the pilot of agentic AI for 5,000 colleagues in September.\n\n\"It allows complex, multi-step tasks to be completed with a single prompt, and the early results are very promising, and we'll expand access to this in the months ahead,\" said Fraser. \"Finally, we have launched a firm-wide effort to systematically embed AI in our processes end-to-end to drive further efficiencies, reduce risk, and improve client experience.\"\n\nShe also highlighted several tools to help its wealth management advisors. Citi hired an AI leader from Morgan Stanley earlier this year to help revamp its wealth technology.\n\nLike JPMorgan, Citi is also telling employees to use AI for performance reviews, Fraser recently told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nOne of Citi's top tech executives, Shadman Zafar, outlined the bank's four-phased AI strategy and how it will \"change how we work for decades to come.\"\n\nGoldman put $6 billion behind its technology spend this year, but David Solomon, the bank's CEO, said he wished it were more.\n\nHe said he would like to be at least $8 billion, but \"I can't afford it because I've got to deliver returns,\" he said at a conference in early October.\n\nA definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman came from a memo to employees in October announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS. The memo said the plan would leverage AI will drive efficiency at the firm, slow hiring, and result in a \"limited reduction\" of roles.\n\nGoldman, like its peers, has been rolling out tools, including an internal AI assistant to all employees this summer.\n\nBusiness Insider talked to employees about how they were using AI.\n\nGoldman's top partners and Solomon are eager to see AI rev up their businesses. From realizing internal productivity gains to capturing more business as clients look to raise money in anticipation of AI development and acquisitions, here's what the top echelon is expecting.\n\nThere is no AI without data, and there is no data strategy at Goldman without its chief data officer, Neema Raphael. Raphael gave Business Insider an inside look at how his roughly 500-person team melds with the rest of the bank to get the most out of its data.\n\nMorgan Stanley's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, lifted the curtain on some of the firm's progress on AI during its earnings call last month.\n\nShe highlighted DevGen.AI, a tool that, from January to June, Business Insider previously reported, had saved developers more than 280,000 hours, or 11,666 days they would have previously dedicated to deciphering outdated code.\n\nParable, an interactive tool that analyzes and summarizes data, and LeadIQ, an AI-powered lead distribution platform that matches users of its workplace and self-directed platforms to the bank's financial advisors, were also spotlighted in the call.\n\nA survey of Morgan Stanley's interns also gave a peek into just how popular and useful AI has been for the industry's youngest cohort. ChatGPT is their favorite tool by far — with 72% of Morgan Stanley's interns said they use it daily or several times a week. The bank was early to have a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nMorgan Stanley also spoke with Business Insider about bringing employees' AI ideas to life. Here's a look at that process.\n\nBank of America's AI rollout is also well underway.\n\nThe bank's CEO Brian Moynihan says its use of AI is already embedded across the firm, from consumer banking to institutional clients. Its virtual assistant, Erica, handled 2 million customer interactions in a single day and can now answer 700 types of questions — up from 210 a year ago. Executives said they'll share more details on the bank's AI strategy at its investor day on November 5.\n\nRob Pascal, the bank's chief experience officer, previously detailed how the bank's internal-facing AI assistant helps bankers collect, record, and review client data.",

    "fullText": "The US just escalated its clash with Europe over tech regulation.\n\nThe State Department said it has barred five Europeans, including the EU's former Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton and four members of digital campaign groups, from entering the country over what it called \"censorship\" of tech platforms.\n\nThe visa bans were met with backlash from European leaders on X, who accused Washington of intimidation and political overreach.\n\nThe dispute centers on the EU's Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, which imposes obligations on major tech platforms — many of which are based in the US — to police content and curb anti-competitive behavior. Companies in breach of it can be fined up to 6% of their global annual revenue.\n\nIn a post on X late Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department would block leading figures of what he called \"the global censorship-industrial complex\" from entering the US.\n\n\"For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose,\" Rubio wrote. \"The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.\"\n\nFor far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.

Rogers, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, named Breton among the five European individuals sanctioned, accusing him of using the EU's Digital Services Act to pressure Elon Musk and X during his tenure as commissioner for the internal market.\n\nShe also named Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, and HateAid co-CEOs Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, accusing them of pressuring US platforms over online speech. None of the four campaigners immediately responded to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nRubio added that the US was \"ready and willing to expand this list\" unless officials reversed course, framing the move as a defense of free expression and US sovereignty.\n\nThe back-and-forth has largely played out on X, a platform that was hit with a $140 million fine earlier this month for breaching the Digital Services Act.\n\nBreton responded in Tuesday X post by invoking McCarthy-era politics, asking, \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"\n\nHe added, \"To our American friends: 'Censorship isn't where you think it is.'\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also condemned the visa restrictions, describing them in a Wednesday X post as coercive measures aimed at undermining Europe's digital sovereignty.\n\n\"The rules governing the European Union's digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe,\" he said.\n\nThe European Commission \"strongly\" condemned the US decision, adding that the EU has the sovereign right to regulate its digital market and would seek clarification from US authorities.\n\nIs McCarthy’s witch hunt back? 🧹\n\nAs a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA 🇪🇺\n\nTo our American friends: “Censorship isn’t where you think it is.”\n\n\"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X on Wednesday. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"\n\nGérard Araud, France's former ambassador to the US, said the dispute reflects a deeper rupture, writing on X that \"the West\" no longer exists and that Europe is now alone in defending its interests and values.\n\nHodenberg and Ballon told Business Insider in a joint statement that they are \"not surprised\" by the move, calling it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary.\"\n\n\"Despite the significant strain and restrictions placed on us and our families by US government measures, we will continue our work with all our strength — now more than ever,\" the duo said.\n\nThe dispute has been years in the making — and Musk's X has often been at the center of it.\n\nMusk cheered the US move to sanction the officials, writing on X: \"This is so great.\"\n\nThis is so great 🤩 https://t.co/fXAfNbwEVf\n\nBreton repeatedly clashed with Musk after he bought Twitter in 2022 and pledged to loosen moderation in the name of free speech.\n\nAs the then-internal market commissioner, Breton warned that X could face fines or even be barred from the European Union if it failed to comply with EU law, later overseeing a formal investigation into the platform regarding disinformation and content moderation.\n\nThose confrontations turned X into a symbol of the broader transatlantic fight over who sets the rules for online speech — a conflict that has now spilled from regulation into geopolitics.",

    "description": "Former Amazon employees detail their journey launching an AI startup, and explain how they adapted to startup life.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Shalini Aggarwal, a 50-year-old CEO in San Jose, California, and Andy Ratsirason, a 37-year-old CTO. The two left Amazon at different times and reconnected as cofounders of Tenfali, an AI startup.\n\nThey share the main processes they had to unlearn in order to successfully grow their startup. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nShalini Aggarwal: Andy and I began working together in 2015, after I relocated to the US from India. He was a dev engineer, and I worked on the product and program execution side.\n\nAndy Ratsirason: I joined Amazon for the first time in 2014 because I wanted to be part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem. I always wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I tried to tailor my career to suit that goal. I left Amazon, came back in 2020, and left again in 2023.\n\nAfter I left for the last time, I made multiple pivots in founding a startup. I realized I needed someone else to join my team. Shalini started showing up regularly on my LinkedIn feed, liking and commenting on posts about startups and taking risks, so I reached out to her. She had just left Amazon, and we reunited to cofound Tenafli.\n\nAggarwal: We quickly realized that we took a lot of systems and tools for granted when we were in an enterprise company. The startup world is completely different; here, we have to build from scratch, and there was a lot about our mindset we had to unlearn.\n\nAggarwal: I stayed at Amazon until 2024, and my last nine months were spent working on AI projects, specifically on music recommendations.\n\nRatsirason: In 2023, I was almost three years into my return to Amazon, and I had a choice: either stay comfortable with those Big Tech paychecks or take a leap and launch my own startup. I submitted my resignation in February and then began to think about what was next.\n\nAggarwal: My decision to leave Amazon was more of a gradual process. During the COVID pandemic, my father retired, and we lost my mom. I could see how lonely my father was, and the biggest challenge was how to fill his days. That planted the seed.\n\nThrough working on personalized AI recommendations, I thought of a product that could serve as an AI companion for older adults, providing personalized recommendations and scheduling activities based on their typical daily routines.\n\nMy 50th birthday was coming up, and the AI boom was happening; if I didn't take the leap then, I knew I would never. In September 2024, I put in my two weeks' notice and left Amazon.\n\nRatsirason: At Amazon, I didn't really think about why we were building a product or if people would use it. The 'build-first' mindset meant focusing solely on building a good product, knowing the customer was already there.\n\nA clear moment that this mindset wouldn't work at an early-stage startup came after we spent months building, and launch day arrived, almost nobody showed up organically for a few weeks. That was the wake-up call: shipping isn't the finish line when we didn't have demand.\n\nAfter that, we shifted to doing customer conversations earlier and running small distribution tests, including waitlists, partnerships, and community posts, before over-investing in product.\n\nAggarwal: We applied and were accepted into several startup resource programs, including AWS Activate, Nvidia Inception, and Google's Cloud Credits program.\n\nRatsirason: We received a few thousand in AWS credits, but before we realized it, we lost almost all of the credits in the first two months. We over-provisioned capacity, and during AI testing, we left a few resources running longer than intended, which quietly accumulated costs over time.\n\nOnce we noticed the issue, we set up AWS budget alerts, added cost monitoring, made shutdowns part of our testing checklist, and simplified certain aspects of the architecture to match our stage.\n\nTo reduce costs further, we also bought a small local machine to run some of our AI experiments on, so we only use the cloud when we truly need it for scale, managed services, or production.\n\nAggarwal: The time we save with AI enables us to allocate our energy to attending summits, forums, and programs, where we can learn about the work of others in the field. We also spend more time with prospective customers doing interviews.\n\nRatsirason: We used to spend hours reading long articles and research, and trying to keep up with the latest news in the field. The cycle felt heavy and slow, pulling us away from customer conversations and shipping.\n\nWe now use AI to scan a large set of content, surface the most relevant ideas for us, and summarize the few pieces worth reading. Having to be frugal, we've learned to spend only where learning happens. Talk to users first, then build the smallest thing that can prove value.\n\nRatsirason: AI acts as a junior engineer, handling a lot of the coding for us with the requirements we set up.\n\nAggarwal: It's also taught us where we won't need to scale. I know I don't need to hire a user interface designer. If I understand the requirements of something, I can quickly draft it with the help of AI and receive feedback on it myself.\n\nRatsirason: A few years ago, launching a usable version of our product, Agefully, would have required significantly more capital and head count. We just need two engineers and subscriptions. I'm grateful to be part of this AI era.\n\nAggarwal: We've seen at scale how things work and what processes we can implement to avoid chaos later on. At the same time, the biggest disadvantage has been overcoming the mindset that tools and infrastructure are readily available. Until we learned how to work through that, we weren't allocating our energy properly.\n\nRatsirason: Coming from Amazon, the name itself has some positive weight, but it can also work against us. People might assume that since we worked at a big company, we don't know how to run a small startup because we don't have a lot of resources.\n\nThe hardest part was overcoming the fear of shipping something imperfect. Coming from Big Tech, we were accustomed to high-polish expectations and assumed anything less would turn users away. We learned that in early-stage startups, the real risk isn't rough edges, it's building something people don't need.\n\nDo you have a founder story to share?

    "description": "John Stecher reads about technology in another industry on his daily subway ride to work and spends his weekends being hands-on with tools.",
    "fullText": "The role of chief technology officer is in a constant state of evolution with the advancement of artificial intelligence.\n\nOver the last two decades of his career, Blackstone CTO John Stecher has watched technology move from a \"magic thing in the back office\" to the forefront of every business, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Technology wasn't looked at as being an absolute must-have in a business, but it is now,\" Stecher said. \"If you have any type of creaky infrastructure technology-wise, it doesn't matter which industry you're in, you're not going to be successful.\"\n\nAs the executive overseeing Blackstone's technology, cybersecurity, early-stage technology investment, and portfolio tech optimization teams, Stecher is responsible for keeping one of the world's largest investment firms competitive. That means he needs to stay ahead of the curve on everything from cyber threats to engineering advancements. Stecher shared the daily and weekly upskilling habits he relies on to do just that.\n\nWhen Stecher isn't managing the technology behind the investing giant Blackstone, he keeps himself busy with his 11-year-old and 8-year-old children. That means making the most of any free time he gets — including his 35-minute subway ride to and from the office.\n\nThe CTO said it's \"just enough\" time to come up to speed with something on his way to work, and decompress on his way home. Stecher said he typically reads news articles or research papers about applied technology in an industry outside finance, such as aircraft, robotics, or pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"You learn a ton about just how to apply different technologies in your industry, if you read about how somebody else did it elsewhere,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said that he then takes those learnings and discusses them with his colleagues.\n\n\"I, fortunately, have a bunch of amazing engineers I work with, so I have my day-to-day banter with them about what works and what doesn't,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said he can't learn by reading alone; he needs to be hands-on with technology. The CTO said part of the reason he studied computer science is so he can build and take apart the components inside a computer — and that hasn't changed.\n\n\"You can create so many unique software applications, no different than if you're drawing on a piece of paper,\" Stecher said.\n\nHe said \"the technology under the covers looks the same,\" regardless of whether you're working with an oil and gas company or a dating app like Bumble, he said. The CTO said that part of his upskilling routine involves toying around with new technology. Stecher said he aims to reserve one or two hours on the weekend to be \"hands-on\" with a tool he hasn't used before.\n\nFor example, he said he may build a tool that makes it easier for him to parse a document for work, such as the many investment committee memos he reads over the weekend.\n\nStecher said his experimentation isn't always \"spectacular.\" Sometimes it's as simple as using Claude, Anthropic's AI chatbot, to write code to automate his home. However, he said that solving everyday problems, such as turning off the lights or adjusting the thermostat, is a \"fun\" challenge that involves revisiting the basics of engineering.\n\n\"It's tactile and tangible,\" Stecher said.",

    "fullText": "State department accuses group of pressuring tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints through regulation of disinformation\n\nThe state department has barred five Europeans from the US, accusing them of leading efforts to pressure tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints, in the latest attack on European regulations that target hate speech and misinformation.\n\nSecretary of state Marco Rubio said the five people targeted with visa bans – who include former European Commissioner Thierry Breton – have led “organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.”\n\n“These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states – in each case targeting American speakers and American companies,” Rubio said in an announcement.\n\nIn recent months, Trump officials have ordered US diplomats to build opposition to the European Union’s landmark Digital Services Act (DSA), which is intended to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation, but which Washington says stifles free speech and imposes costs on US tech companies.\n\nLate on Tuesday night, Breton posted on social media: “Is McCarthy’s witch hunt back?”\n\nTuesday’s move is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or sanctions. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, those targeted will generally be barred from entering the US, and some may face removal proceedings if already in the country.\n\nRubio did not name those targeted, but under secretary for public diplomacy Sarah Rogers identified them on X, accusing the individuals of “fomenting censorship of American speech”.\n\nThe five named were: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index’; and former EU commissioner Breton.\n\nThe visa bans come after the administration’s National Security Strategy this month said European leaders were censoring free speech and suppressing opposition to immigration policies that it said risk “civilisational erasure” for the continent.\n\nRogers called Breton – who served as the European Commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024 – “a mastermind” of the DSA.\n\nMelford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), said in a video posted online in 2024 that she co-founded the organisation “to try to break the business model of harmful online content” by reviewing online news websites to allow advertisers to “choose whether or not they want to fund content that is polarising and divisive and harmful, or whether they want to steer their advertising back towards more quality journalism.”\n\nA spokesperson for GDI called the US action “immoral, unlawful, and un-American” and “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”\n\nMost Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don’t necessarily need visas to come into the US. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.\n\nWith Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive on Wednesday warned that it would take action against any “unjustified measures” after the U.S. State Department barred five Europeans it accuses of pressuring U.S. technology firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nThe Europeans were characterized by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations. They include the former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, Thierry Breton.\n\nBreton, a businessman and former French finance minister, clashed last year on social media with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with Donald Trump in the months leading up to the U.S. election.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s powerful executive branch and which supervises tech regulation in Europe, said that it “strongly condemns the U.S. decision to impose travel restrictions” and that it has requested clarification about the move. French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned it.\n\n“If needed, we will respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures,” the commission said in a statement, without elaborating.\n\nRubio wrote in an X post on Tuesday that “for far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.”\n\n“The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship,” he posted.\n\nThe European Commission countered that “the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.”\n\n“Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination,” it said.\n\nMacron said that the visa restrictions “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,” he posted on X.\n\nMacron said that the EU’s digital rules were adopted by “a democratic and sovereign process” involving all member countries and the European Parliament. He said that the rules “ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country.”\n\nHe underlined that “the rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe.”\n\nBreton and the group of Europeans fell afoul of a new visa policy announced in May to restrict the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for censorship of protected speech in the United States.\n\nThe four others are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; and Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index.\n\nRubio said the five had advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the United States.\n\nThe action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or penalties.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Sarah Rogers, the U.S. under secretary of state for public diplomacy, called Breton the “mastermind” behind the EU’s Digital Services Act, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. This includes flagging harmful or illegal content like hate speech.\n\nBreton responded on X by noting that all 27 EU member countries voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn’t where you think it is,’” he wrote.\n\nAngela Charlton contributed to this report from Paris.",

    "title": "What Is VO2max?",
    "description": "It measures your cardio fitness, but it's not as important as tech companies want you to think.",
    "fullText": "The more you work out, the fitter you'll get. Your VO2max, sometimes described on wearables as a \"cardio fitness\" score, is a number that tends to be higher among people who are more cardiovascularly fit. But it's not the only measure of fitness, and you should know what it really means.\n\nSmartwatches and fitness trackers don't actually measure VO2max; they just estimate it. To actually find your VO2max, you'd need to go to an exercise lab and do a test on a treadmill or cycle while hooked up to equipment that measures your heart rate and the air you're exhaling. I did exactly this kind of test to compare my real VO2max to the numbers reported by nine different devices. You can read about my experience, and why it matters, here.\n\nVO2max, properly rendered VO2max, is the maximal volume (V) of oxygen (O2) your body can use per minute during exercise, scaled to your body size because larger people will naturally use more oxygen. This is considered a good measure of aerobic fitness because—think back to high school biology—your body uses oxygen and food to create a usable form of chemical energy called ATP. You then use that ATP to power the movements of your muscles. The amount of oxygen directly correlates with the amount of energy produced. Or, in simpler terms, the more work you do, the more oxygen you need.\n\nSo a person who is aerobically very fit—let’s say an elite marathon runner—can do more work (run faster) than somebody who isn’t. As a result, they’ll suck in a lot more oxygen per minute during their run than, say, I would.\n\nA typical sorta-fit human being will have a VO2max somewhere in the 30s or 40s. If you exercise a lot, you can push that number higher. Elite cyclists, skiers, and ultrarunners may have numbers in the 70s or 80s, and a few people out there have scored in the 90s. I'd call myself a recreational athlete (I run a little) and my lab-tested VO2max was 43. Most of my fitness wearables reported numbers for me in the high 30's or low 40's—a good reminder that these estimates can be useful, but they aren't necessarily correct.\n\nTo be able to use a large amount of oxygen, you need more than just good lungs. You also need a strong heart and healthy circulatory system to get the oxygen to your muscles. And you need muscles that are large and can do a lot of work per minute—which means that you're strong and can do a lot of work athletically. VO2max is a way to summarize a lot of important things about cardio fitness into one simple number.\n\nBut it’s important to know that this number isn’t everything about fitness, or even aerobic fitness. First, it doesn’t make much sense to compare your VO2max to other people’s, because it’s affected by factors like blood volume and muscle mass. Men tend to have a VO2max about ten points higher than similarly fit women, for example. There are also plenty of aspects of fitness that aren't captured by VO2max. Compare two athletes with the same VO2max, and you may find that one can keep going in an endurance race longer than the other. Or one might be better at sprinting while another is better at medium-effort work. One person may be stronger than another, or have better technique, or be more resistant to injuries.\n\nThere is research correlating VO2max with longevity, but that doesn't mean that raising your VO2max a few points will add years to your life. Fitness, in general, tends to correlate with longevity and with overall health. Scientists who want to study that relationship will usually pick an easy thing or two to measure, like VO2max or grip strength. But in real life, we don't have to choose one number to maximize; we can work on multiple aspects of fitness. It's better to be well-rounded than to hyperfocus on just one metric.\n\nThe gold standard is a lab test. High-level athletes will sometimes take this test if they or their coach want to know their actual, definite VO2max number. But we can measure aerobic fitness in other ways, and there are workouts you can do to get a good estimate of VO2max. If you’re a runner, you can look up a recent race time on this chart to find your VDOT, which roughly correlates with your VO2max. (My best-ever mile time gets me a VDOT of 38, for example.)\n\nTo estimate your VO2max from a workout, you need something that will take you to your absolute maximum aerobic output. A race does this job nicely; so will a test like running as many laps of a track as you can in 12 minutes. I recall doing a test in a Phys Ed. class once where we had to step up and down from a high box as many times as possible. These tests aren’t pleasant, but their results can be a benchmark to tell you whether you’re improving your fitness over time.\n\nSmartwatches and fitness trackers typically estimate VO2max by comparing your heart rate during exercise to a measure of how much work you're doing during that exercise. Most often, this is through outdoor running or walking. The speed you run or walk is measured through GPS, and the device compares that to your heart rate. If you can run fast with a low heart rate, you must be pretty fit and your VO2max will be estimated as being pretty high. If your heart rate is high even for a slow running or walking pace, your VO2max is lower.\n\nThese estimates aren't always accurate. If your max heart rate isn't set properly in the device's settings, if it's hot out, if your running route has hills, or if you don't happen to get out for outdoor runs or walks very often, your VO2max is more likely to be wrong. That said, your VO2max estimate doesn't have to be exactly correct to be useful. If the number increases over time, you're probably getting fitter. And if it decreases, you're likely losing fitness.",

    "fullText": "Business Insider's Pranav Dixit has been covering Meta for a year now. He recently reported on the company's \"year of intensity\" with colleague Jyoti Mann. I asked Pranav for his take on a turbulent 12 months.\n\nQ: You've been covering Meta for a year now. What has that been like?\n\n\"Intense\" is the only way to describe it — exactly what Mark Zuckerberg promised employees. I joined BI a day before Meta scrapped third-party fact-checking, and almost immediately the culture shifted: DEI rollbacks, an embrace of \"masculine\" energy, and moves that seemed more aligned with the Trump administration. Then came thousands of layoffs of people labeled low performers and a noticeable spike in performance pressure.\n\nThe second half of the year brought a very different pivot. Meta effectively admitted Llama hadn't lived up to the hype and reset around a new mission: building \"personal superintelligence.\" That meant hiring Alexandr Wang, reorganizing AI under Meta Superintelligence Labs, and aggressively poaching talent while high-profile figures — including Yann LeCun — departed. It felt like covering a company reinventing its business, values, and culture all at once.\n\nQ: What stood out most from your reporting with Jyoti Mann on this \"year of intensity\"?\n\nA pervasive survival mindset. Over and over, employees told us the goal wasn't to do great work — it was to avoid landing in the bottom performance tier. Some people left on principle, saying Meta no longer resembled the company they joined. Yet others insisted this is the best job in tech: great product challenges, unmatched scale, exceptional pay. Those two realities sit side by side — one group bracing for impact, another thriving.\n\nQ: Your reporting found managers sometimes hiring people just to fill low-performance slots. How does that work?\n\nMeta's forced ranking requires a set percentage of \"low performers.\" Some managers gamed the system. Some told us they avoided backfilling roles; others hired into fuzzy positions with near-impossible expectations so they didn't have to put existing trusted team members in the bottom bucket. (Meta didn't respond to specific questions on this.)\n\nQ: What will you be watching for in 2026?\n\nThe big question is whether Meta's massive AI spend becomes a durable business or an expensive experiment. Will Meta AI become a distinct, everyday product? Will the capex binge translate into real revenue and profit? And can the culture stabilize enough to keep the AI talent Meta is betting the company on? Meta can execute — history proves that — but \"intensity\" can't last forever. 2026 will show whether the trade-offs were worth it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Make music quickly (like I did) with this powerful little groove box.",
    "fullText": "In 2025, I tested a ton of exotic smart glasses, e-bikes, and other gear for Lifehacker, but the tech that upgraded and improved my day-to-day life the most is a more niche product. I'm a (very) amateur musician, and Yamaha's Seqtrak is my favorite thing this year. It's an \"ideastation,\" a music production studio small enough to slip into a backpack. Look at how tiny this thing is:\n\nThere is so much music junk crammed in here, it's ridiculous: It's a full-on drum machine with eight drum tracks, step-sequencer, synthesizer with three separate tracks and hundreds of pre-set sounds, and a sampler—in other words, everything you need to create any kind of music from scratch, in seconds. It's even battery-powered with an onboard speaker, so it's fully portable.\n\nEven with all those functions, it's crazy easy to use for basic music-making, even if you literally have no musical knowledge. Here's what it takes to create a basic beat from nothing in about 90 seconds:\n\nThat’s just the surface. Everything can be customized completely. You can tweak any aspect of the presets and effects, add sequencer steps, mess with the arpeggiator, record or import your own samples, and warp sounds with countless synth parameters.\n\nIf you want to dig in further, there's a companion app for tablets, phones, and PCs that syncs with the Seqtrak and gives you access to all the on-board controls so you can change whatever. The app is a must for beginners: The Seqtrak has 32 input buttons, 17 dials, and three sliders, but it doesn't have a display screen, so being able to see what you're doing is a must until you're well-versed in the controls.\n\nThe screenshot below is only one of dozens of pages of elements you can mess around with to customize sounds and effects:\n\nIt can't do everything, but you can import your project from Seqtrak into another digital workstation for more advanced mastering or effects, and you can control the Seqtrak through an external MIDI device if you want more options than it offers from the box.\n\nYou could use this gear to build detailed beats and even full songs, bring it out to accompany yourself live (although, it's not the most rugged piece of equipment), or integrate it into your larger music set-up with MIDI, but I mostly just keep my Seqtrak next to my desk and play it with a MIDI keyboard—the seven little plastic keys aren't optimal—because it lowers the friction between having an idea and making it happen. It's way simpler and more immediate to fire up this groove box than start a new project in FL Studio or something. Plus, it's so tangible—physical dials and buttons are just better for creativity than sliders on a computer, even if they're controlling digital output.\n\nI don’t use my Seqtrak to finish albums or chase perfect mixes. I use it because it makes messing around with music easy and fun again. It’s a gadget that gives you endless options, but also gets out of your way.",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media. The remarkable measure went into effect just weeks ago after a slew of legal challenges and protests from tech companies.\n\nRead some of our comprehensive reporting on the ban:\n\nMillions of children and teens lose access to accounts as Australia’s world-first social media ban begins\n\nThe Guardian view on Australia’s social media ban: dragging tech companies into action | Editorial\n\nAustralia’s social media ban launched with barely a hitch – but the real test is still to come\n\nIn the weirdest news of 2025, billionaire venture capitalist and conservative svengali Peter Thiel gave a series of fevered, incoherent lectures about the antichrist and the coming of the end times.

    "description": "Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"AI godfathers,\" said AI technology has a sycophancy problem, so he lies to chatbots to get better responses.",
    "fullText": "Want to make your chatbot more honest with you? Try lying to it.\n\nIn an episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" that aired on December 18, research scientist Yoshua Bengio told the podcast's host, Steven Bartlett, that he realized AI chatbots were useless at providing feedback on his research ideas because they always said positive things.\n\n\"I wanted honest advice, honest feedback. But because it is sycophantic, it's going to lie,\" he said.\n\nBengio said he switched strategies, deciding to lie to the chatbot by presenting his idea as a colleague's, which produced more honest responses from the technology.\n\n\"If it knows it's me, it wants to please me,\" he said.\n\nBengio, a professor in the computer science and operations research department at the Université de Montréal, is known as one of the \"AI godfathers, alongside researchers Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. In June, he announced the launch of an AI safety research nonprofit, LawZero, which he said aims to reduce dangerous behaviors associated with frontier AI models, such as lying and cheating.\n\n\"This syconphancy is a real example of misalignment. We don't actually want these AIs to be like this,\" he said on \"The Diary of a CEO.\" He also said that receiving positive feedback from AI could cause users to become emotionally attached to the technology, creating further problems.\n\nOther tech industry experts have also been sounding the alarm on AI being too much of a \"yes man.\"\n\nIn September 2025, Business Insider's Katie Notopoulos reported that researchers at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Oxford put confession posts from a Reddit page into chatbots to see how the technology would assess the behaviour the posters had admitted to. They found that 42% of the time, AI gave the \"wrong\" answer, saying the person behind the post hadn't behaved poorly, even though humans judging the posts had disagreed, Notopoulos wrote.\n\nAI companies have been outspoken about trying to reduce sycophancy in their models. Earlier this year, OpenAI removed an update to ChatGPT that it said caused the bot to provide \"overly supportive but disingenuous\" responses.",

    "fullText": "Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint\n\nTech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "fullText": "Platform with 700m users says it is investigating after Anna’s Archive claims to have scraped tracks and metadata\n\nAn activist group has claimed to have scraped millions of tracks from Spotify and is preparing to release them online.\n\nObservers said the apparent leak could boost AI companies looking for material to develop their technology.\n\nA group called Anna’s Archive said it had scraped 86m music files from Spotify and 256m rows of metadata such as artist and album names. Spotify, which hosts more than 100m tracks, confirmed that the leak did not represent its entire inventory.\n\nThe Stockholm-based company, which has more than 700 million users worldwide, said it had “identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping”.\n\n“An investigation into unauthorised access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM [digital rights management] to access some of the platform’s audio files,” said Spotify.\n\nSpotify does not believe the music taken by Anna’s Archive has been released yet. Anna’s Archive, which is known for providing links to pirated books, said in a blog it wanted to create a “‘preservation archive’ for music”.\n\nThe group claimed the audio files represented 99.6% of all music listened to by Spotify users and would be shared via “torrents”, a means of sharing large digital files online.\n\n“Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start,” said Anna’s Archive, which describes its mission as “preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture”.\n\n“With your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts and other catastrophes,” said the group.\n\nEd Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for protecting artists’ copyright, said the leaked music would probably be used for developing AI models.\n\n“Training on pirated material is sadly common in the AI industry, so this stolen music is almost certain to end up training AI models. This is why governments must insist AI companies reveal the training data they use,” he said.\n\nThe Anna’s Archive site makes references to LibGen, a vast online archive of pirated books that has allegedly been used by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to train its AI models. According to a US court filing, Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, approved use of the LibGen dataset despite warnings within the company’s AI executive team that it was a dataset “we know to be pirated”.\n\nMeta successfully defended a claim for copyright infringement by authors, but the plaintiffs in the case are seeking to amend their claim.\n\nThe co-founder of an AI startup wrote on LinkedIn that members of the public could in theory “create their own personal free version of Spotify”. Yoav Zimmerman, a co-founder of Third Chair, said it could also allow tech companies to “train on modern music at scale”.\n\nHe added: “The only thing stopping them is copyright law and the deterrent of enforcement.”\n\nSpotify said it had put in place new safeguards “for these types of anti-copyright attacks” since the Anna’s Archive announcement and was “actively monitoring for suspicious behaviour”.\n\nIn the UK, creative professionals have protested against a government proposal to let AI companies use copyright-protected work without permission unless the owner of the copyright-protected work signals they do not want their data to be taken. Almost every respondent to a government consultation on the proposal has backed artists’ concerns.\n\nLiz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament this month there was “no clear consensus” on the issue, adding that ministers would “take the time to get this right”. The government has pledged to make policy proposals on AI and copyright by 18 March next year.",

Moments later, the drone strikes, hitting the soldier as he attempts to escape. The explosion spooks another horse, which unseats its rider before making a charge in another direction. A third rider is seen, but his fate is unknown.\n\n“Russian occupiers lose so much equipment during their ‘meat-grinder assaults’ that they’re forced to move on horseback,” the 92nd Brigade wrote in a post accompanying the footage.\n\nVladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has been defined by rapid technological advances on the front lines, in particular in drone warfare. Small, off-the-shelf explosive drones have proved effective at defending against mechanised units and infantry.\n\nRussia recently introduced motorbikes and all-terrain vehicles as a way to speed across open countryside monitored by drones.\n\nHorses could offer yet more flexibility – agile on off-road terrain and less likely to trigger modern landmines equipped with magnetic sensors. The first horse-mounted casualty was reported by observers of the war in Ukraine in October.\n\nAt the same time, The Telegraph reported that the Storm unit of Russia’s 9th Brigade of the 51st Army had been preparing horse-mounted assault teams to operate in the Donetsk region.\n\nBefore this, there had been numerous reports of Russia utilising donkeys, horses and even camels to transport ammunition and other heavy equipment to the front line through muddy conditions not suitable for regular vehicles.\n\nThroughout the ages, horseback cavalry charges have provided speed, shock and flexibility on the battlefield.\n\nTanks and other heavily-armoured fighting machines are rarely seen on the battlefields of Ukraine and, when they do appear, they are almost instantly disabled by a wave of drones.\n\nRussia’s Kommersant newspaper said of the return of cavalry: “In armed conflicts that have become arenas for showcasing technological innovations, participants are once again forced to rely on basic tools – from analogue telephone lines to pack animals and carts – when modern technologies prove vulnerable.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "The investing playbook to follow in the new year homes in on three key sectors of the stock market, according to Citigroup.\n\nThe bank's investment research arm unveiled its list of sector calls heading into the first quarter of 2026, which included three areas it believes investors should be overweight in as the new year begins: Information technology, financials, and healthcare.\n\nBesides financials, those sectors have seen a stellar performance in 2025. The healthcare sector of the S&P 500 is up 17% for the year, while technology stocks are up 28% year-to-date, beating the benchmark index. The financials sector has lagged the broader market, up 6% since January.\n\n\"For most of '25, we led with a Growth cluster focus while frequently advocating a Cyclical barbell,\" the bank wrote of its portfolio based on its 2025 sector picks, which outperformed the S&P 500 by over four percentage points. \"Headed into '26, we focus on a better balance with Defensives. This is aligned with our expectations for fundamental broadening,\" it said of its outlook for the coming year.\n\nHere are Citi's areas of focus heading into the new year, followed by its top stock picks for each sector.\n\nThesis: Earnings growth among banks and financial services stocks appears to be holding strong heading into 2026.\n\nFor bank stocks in particular, profit margins look \"healthy,\" and the sector is flashing positive trading signals, Citi said. The bank pointed to the sector's positive Relative Strength Index reading, one gauge that measures whether an investment is overbought or oversold.\n\nThesis: The bank said it expects \"lessening policy overhang\" to boost investor sentiment across healthcare, referring to trends like uncertainty around drug pricing fading as more pharma companies make deals with the Trump administration.\n\n\"Revisions have turned positive and the growth outlook for '26 should begin to improve,\" the bank said of the healthcare equipment & services area in particular. \"Insiders have stepped up purchases while sells have declined off recent peak.\"\n\nThesis: Fundamentals across the information technology sector look strong, Citi researchers said, pointing to an \"attractive\" growth setup in the semiconductors space and positive earnings revisions in the software & services area.\n\n\"This is our preferred growth sector given good fundamental trends and revisions. Surprisingly, not all valuation reads are stretched,\" the bank wrote.",

    "title": "Billionaire philanthropy’s growing divide: Mark Zuckerberg stops funding immigration reform as MacKenzie Scott doubles down on DEI",
    "description": "Two models for tech wealth are emerging, as notable billionaire donors reveal their priorities.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to cut off funding to the pro‑immigration group FWD.us marks a sharp turn away from the high-profile social advocacy that once defined his philanthropy, even as MacKenzie Scott is emerging as the era’s most aggressive backer of equity- and DEI-driven causes.\n\nThe split shows a broader divergence in tech philanthropy: one billionaire channeling resources into science and AI infrastructure, the other pouring unrestricted billions into institutions serving communities historically excluded from power and wealth.\n\nFor more than a decade, FWD.us was a marquee example of Zuckerberg’s attempt to fuse Silicon Valley muscle with Washington policy, pushing immigration and criminal justice reform from the political center.\n\nBut in 2025, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) quietly stopped funding FWD.us—its first year without support from Zuckerberg; his wife, Priscilla Chan; or their philanthropy—formally ending a relationship that began with a 2013 launch op‑ed and hundreds of millions of dollars in backing, Business Insider reports.\n\nThe wind‑down was years in the making: By late 2022, CZI had already begun pivoting away from social advocacy, providing “foundational” funding meant to give FWD.us runway before the partnership ended, and in April 2025, the break was formalized. The timing now reads less like a slow fade than a strategic alignment with Zuckerberg’s rightward political recalibration in the Trump era, as Meta relaxed content rules criticized by conservatives, while the company and its CEO leaned into the new administration.\n\nCZI’s new pitch sounds less like a traditional foundation and more like a research lab: Its leadership talks about GPUs, not gala dinners. In November, Zuckerberg and Chan announced that CZI would concentrate on science and AI, doubling down on the Biohub network of biology labs it has funded since 2016 and recruiting researchers with the promise of massive compute power rather than more office space.\n\nWhere early CZI grants were scattered across immigration, criminal justice, and education policy, the current strategy funnels capital into building infrastructure—data, tools, and models—that scientists can use for decades. The bet is that by underwriting AI‑enabled biomedical discovery and related fields, CZI can claim long‑horizon, system‑level impact without the political volatility that accompanies hot‑button social debates like border policy or policing.\n\nMacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is moving in the opposite direction, embracing the very equity agendas many corporations and campuses are backing away from under political pressure. In 2025 alone, she announced roughly $7.1 billion in donations—bringing her total giving since 2019 to more than $26 billion—with a heavy tilt toward historically Black colleges and universities, tribal colleges, Native scholarship providers, and organizations serving low‑income and underrepresented students.",

That came roughly a year after it launched HarmonyOS 5 in late 2024.\n\nNotably, the latest version features a new function similar to Apple's AirDrop, which enables direct file transfers between Huawei and Apple devices for the first time.\n\nHarmonyOS accounted for 17 per cent of China's smartphone operating systems in the second quarter of the year, ahead of iOS's 16 per cent, maintaining its lead over Apple for the sixth consecutive quarter, according to data released by Counterpoint Research in September.\n\nHarmonyOS was China's second-largest mobile operating system behind Android, which had a dominant 66 per cent share in the quarter, according to Counterpoint.\n\nThe increasing adoption of HarmonyOS was largely attributed to Huawei's rebound in the domestic smartphone market.\n\nAccording to the latest data from research firm BCI, Huawei reclaimed its spot as China's top smartphone vendor in the last week of November and first week of December, overtaking Apple, following the launch of its flagship Mate 80 series.\n\nThe Mate 80 series, including the basic Mate 80, Mate 80 Pro, Mate 80 Pro Max and Mate 80 RS models, as well as the foldable Mate X7, was released in late November.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

He is the first FBS player in 20 years with at least five forced fumbles (he has seven), two fumble recoveries and four interceptions in the same season.\n\n“He’s just a man of consistency, a man of routine and he’s just a great leader overall,” said Tech senior edge rusher David Bailey, a first-year transfer and also an AP All-America first-teamer.\n\nThe Red Raiders (12-1), in McGuire's fourth season, play No. 5 Oregon (12-1) in the CFP quarterfinal Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. The first-time Big 12 Conference champions already have a school-record 12 wins.\n\nRodriguez won the Chuck Bednarik and Bronko Nagurski awards as the top defensive player, and the Dick Butkus Award as the top linebacker. He got the Lombardi Award that's for exceptional performance while embodying character and discipline like the award's namesake.\n\nRodriguez played a little bit of safety in high school, but when he got to Tech he hadn’t been a linebacker since middle school, when the approach was much different.\n\n“I had no clue what I was doing. I was just going see ball, hit ball,” he said. “You’re playing linebacker, but you don’t have to study film, and you don’t have to understand the position as much.”\n\nAs a prep starting quarterback, Rodriguez accounted for 10,136 total yards (7,085 passing, 3,051 rushing) and 106 touchdowns (68 passing, 38 rushing) as Wichita Falls Rider made the Texas Class 5A playoffs three years in a row. He was then an early enrollee at Virginia, which gave him a scholarship offer as a quarterback. He never threw a pass in his 12 games with the Cavaliers, but had 56 yards rushing and 65 receiving while used as a running back, receiver and tight end. He left there after a coaching change.\n\n“It’s just really cool to see the way that his story has developed, and the kind of guy that he is,” said fifth-year Tech quarterback Behren Morton, a fellow Texan who was in some of the same camps as Rodriguez before college. “He’s probably put on close to 50 pounds, and just totally transformed his body to looking like a mean linebacker.”\n\nRodriguez played special teams and some defensive packages during his Tech debut in 2022, when he had 29 tackles and began to embrace being on that side.\n\n“Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play. I’ve done it on the offensive side of the ball, I’ve done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I’ve done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. “That’s kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.”\n\nHe was limited to five games in 2023 after injuring his foot in the opener on a play that he forced and recovered a fumble. His 127 tackles last year were the most for a Tech player since Lawrence Flugence set an NCAA FBS record with 193 in 2002. He has 117 this season after Tech reportedly invested more than $7 million on transfers along the defensive front, including Bailey, second-team AP All-America interior lineman A.J. Holmes Jr., and third-teamer Lee Hunter.\n\nAs tough as Rodriguez is, the 6-foot-1, 235-pound linebacker said there is no doubt that his wife Emma is even tougher.\n\nThe high school sweethearts got married in July 2023. Emma graduated from the United States Military Academy and is now based at Fort Riley in Kansas.\n\n\"She's the best, and she does so much for me,\" Jacob Rodriguez said. \"It's weird, I feel like to everybody else, that we do long distance and have done it. But I mean to us, it’s normal. It’s something that we’ve always done.”\n\nWhile disappointed he didn't get an invitation to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, Rodriguez was grateful and honored by the final results. His 17 first-place votes were nine more than Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin, the fourth-place finisher. Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman ahead of Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love.\n\n“I’m just so appreciative to even be in that conversation,\" Rodriguez said. \"That kind of hit home, was people really cared about me and see what the work that’s been done this year.”\n\nRodriguez has scored three touchdowns this season. He returned a fumble for a score against Oklahoma, and had short rushing TDs on his only carries when taking a direct snap in each of the last two regular-season games.\n\n“It was exciting and it was fun,” he said. “Those are the moments that I’ll never forget, where it’s just having fun playing football.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "Duke was the only team inside the top 10 to drop a game last week.",
    "fullText": "It was a pretty quiet week of college basketball, but there was one stunning major upset to carry us through and shake up the top five.\n\nHere’s everything you missed in the seventh week of the regular season, and the latest Associated Press poll.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Duke slipped, but Saturday night’s loss at Madison Square Garden seemed to come out of nowhere.\n\nThe Blue Devils, who jumped up by 17 points against a shorthanded Texas Tech team in the second half, let the Red Raiders come storming back to pick up an 82-81 upset win. That marked Texas Tech’s first win over a top-five team since 2022, and snapped a six-game losing streak against ranked opponents.\n\nThe win jumped Texas Tech up four spots to No. 15 in this week’s poll.\n\nThe loss, meanwhile, was the first for Duke in what has otherwise been a perfect start to the season. The Blue Devils entered Saturday with a perfect 11-0 record and four wins over ranked opponents — including three straight earlier this month, one over Michigan State and the other over defending national champion Florida.\n\nAs a result, Duke fell three spots to No. 6.\n\nDuke was actually the only team inside the top 10 to lose a game last week. Arizona held onto the No. 1 spot in the polls after a blowout win over San Diego State on Saturday, which got it to 11-0. Michigan remained at No. 2, too, after beating La Salle by 52 points on Sunday. Iowa State moved up a spot to No. 3, UConn took No. 4 and Purdue moved up to No. 5.\n\nWhile it didn’t matter much this time, as they rolled to a blowout win over DePaul, UConn leading scorer Solo Ball missed Sunday’s game with a minor wrist injury. Ball has averaged a team-high 15.4 points per game, and was fresh off a 26-point outing against Butler.\n\nThe next big loss came when Tennessee rolled over Louisville by 21 points on Tuesday, which snapped a three-game losing skid for the Vols. That launched them up to No. 19, while Louisville fell to No. 16.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re looking at a very slow week of college basketball ahead. The sport is largely taking a break over Christmas. So enjoy the time, and get ready for conference play to kick off across the board on the other side.\n\nAll times ET | * denotes neutral site\n\nMissouri at No. 20 Illinois | 8 p.m. | FS1 *\n\nThe full Associated Press men’s basketball poll from December 22, 2025.\n\n1.

These efforts drove adoption rates as high as 85%, boosting sales up to 4.5% and marketing efficiency by 15%. In order to drive meaningful transformation, companies need to realize that technology on it’s own can’t drive value—humans need to be convinced to buy in.",

    "title": "This Wallet-Sized E-Reader Is My Tech 'Upgrade of the Year'",
    "description": "Tiny, slightly janky, deeply lovable.",
    "fullText": "One of the often unspoken truths of being a tech reviewer is you get to test out, recommend—and sometimes even keep!—gadgets that you would never buy for yourself, because you can't justify what they cost. This is why I tend to spend large portions of my reviews talking about price: I love a cutting edge gadget as much as the next nerd, but I have two kids and I live in the most expensive city in America. As much as I admire the Boox Palma 2 Pro, my budget doesn't really have room for a niche $400 e-reader.\n\nThat's why the Xteink X4 e-reader, a minimalist 4.3-inch e-reader, is my tech upgrade of 2025: Here's a device that has no delusions of grandeur. It doesn't want to replace your phone. It doesn't want to serve up the smoothest screen tech. It doesn't want to run games or apps or seamlessly sync with you phone. It just wants to be a tiny, inexpensive e-reader that works just well enough, and is small enough to carry with you anywhere.\n\nAs I make clear in my review, the Xteink X4 can in no way compete with the Palma 2 Pro (or your average Kindle, for that matter). It has an underpowered processor and no screen light. Due to digital rights management, you probably won't be able to use it to read all the Kindle books you already own (though that's really Amazon's fault). It's kind of a pain to load it up with e-books, and once you get them on there, they might not look great, as the current software can't even display paragraph indents or italics.\n\nBut it also costs less than $50, and once it's all set up, it fulfills the exact same function as a pricier device: It allows me to easily carry my library around with me so I can read a book instead of staring at my phone. But because it's so very tiny—around 25% smaller and thinner than my iPhone 14—it does this better than any other device I've tried.\n\nMore than just functional, though, the Xteink X4 is fun—though admittedly, a lot of that comes from the vibrant community that has sprung up around it online. It has only been available for a few months, but it already has its own active subreddit, filled with geeky users helping each other out with FAQs, troubleshooting, and crowd-sourced galleries of screensaver images. They developed tools and shortcuts to get around the device's limited functionality, from a Calibre plugin that will optimize your EPUB files for the Xteink X4, to an online tool that will automatically convert them into much prettier image files. A few different folks are even working on entirely new firmware to replace the merely functional native software.\n\nYou don't have to tinker with the Xteink X4—it's perfectly usable out of the box, once you get used to quirks like navigating its slightly confusing menus with its slightly unintuitive physical buttons—but it's fun to be engaged with a bunch of other folks who are excited about making it work better. In their outsized devotion to a niche device, these folks are bringing back the spirit of the old internet, powered by a sense of community rather than an all-knowing algorithm. Like the current retro appeal of cassette tapes, the Xteink X4 makes everything better by being a little bit worse.",

    "description": "After being laid off by Oracle, Clair Todd has spent about two years job hunting, reselling antiques, and rethinking her pivot to the tech industry.",
    "fullText": "This \"as-told-to\" essay is based on a conversation with Clair Todd, a 40-year-old job seeker from New Hampshire, who worked as a site reliability engineer for Oracle until being laid off in 2023. Business Insider has verified her employment with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started at Oracle in January 2020 as a site reliability engineer. In November 2023, I started hearing that my Oracle coworkers were getting pulled into Zoom meetings and told they had been laid off. I hoped I wouldn't be next, but I was. My entire team was let go.\n\nI didn't start looking for work right away because I'd received some severance pay, and I'd heard it was difficult to land a tech role during the holiday season. I took some time to reassess what I wanted from my career and began my job search in February 2024.\n\nI was optimistic at first because most of my prior job searches hadn't taken too long. As the months dragged on, it became clear I had the wrong impression of the tech hiring landscape.\n\nMore than two years after being laid off, I'm still unemployed.\n\nWhen I was let go from Oracle, my severance, unemployment benefits, and my emergency fund helped for a while. After going through more than $50,000 in savings, I'm now in a tougher position.\n\nI earn between $500 and $1,000 a month by reselling antiques I find and refurbish, including old instruments, electronics, and collectibles that I purchase on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. It's a huge drop from the roughly $5,500 a month I used to take home at Oracle.\n\nIn addition to my mortgage, I have about $45,000 in student debt I need to pay off. I'm covering my mortgage and bills by dipping into savings and selling stocks when necessary.\n\nWhen my washer and dryer broke last year, I had to buy a new set on a payment plan — something I'd never done before. In the past, I would've just paid for it outright.\n\nIn my early 30s, I decided to go back to school and pursue a bachelor's degree. I had spent most of my career in sales and customer service roles, but I didn't see a path to earning the kind of income I wanted. I was still living in a small apartment, and I wanted to own a home someday.\n\nWhen I started thinking seriously about a career change, tech was the obvious choice. My dad, mom, and brother all worked in the field, so it felt like I'd be joining the family business. In 2015, I began pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology.\n\nAfter graduating in 2018, I landed a software engineering role at a small tech firm. I left that position later that year to take on a quality assurance engineering role at Hitachi Vantara.\n\nI took the role because I saw it as a great opportunity, but the downside was that I lived three hours away from the office. The long hours on the road quickly took a toll.\n\nAt the end of 2019, I accepted my former remote position at Oracle, a role I landed after receiving an employee referral.\n\nMy pivot to tech gave me the income I needed to buy my first home. However, after being laid off and struggling to find work, I've sometimes wondered whether it was worthwhile.\n\nMy job search has been challenging because I'm looking for midlevel roles, and a lot of the positions I've seen appear to be targeting either senior-level or entry-level candidates. I've also been targeting competitive remote roles due to a health situation I'm navigating, which makes it difficult for me to commute or work from an office.\n\nI've had several interviews, but I haven't been able to secure an offer. The technical interviews have been challenging. In one interview, it felt like I was on \"Jeopardy!\" because I was being asked what felt like software engineering trivia questions, and most of them didn't seem relevant to the actual role.\n\nMy family warned me that layoffs are fairly common in tech and that I should be prepared. I built a \"just-in-case\" savings fund over the years, but there's not much left.\n\nA few months ago, after more than a year of searching for work, I decided to stop actively looking for employment and focus on building a website development business.\n\nI would like to return to tech, but I need time to recover from the difficult process of applying and getting repeatedly rejected. I also worried that being out of the workforce for so long made it even harder to land a job, so I figured it was wise to start my business as a backup plan.\n\nMy business is still in its early stages and isn't generating income yet, which is one reason I spend time reselling goods.\n\nIt's been challenging mentally because it feels like you're not good enough when you keep getting rejected. On top of that, you have to worry about paying the bills without money coming in. I don't want to say I've given up, but my search has been extremely discouraging.\n\nI'm also not as passionate about tech as I used to be, which is kind of a shame because I was so excited to get my degree and work in the field. If I hadn't been let go by Oracle, it probably would've been a different story.\n\nBefore I scaled back my job search, I'd started focusing less on Big Tech jobs and more on roles at smaller businesses and startups. The interview process at these companies felt more human, and I was more likely to get updates on my applications — even if it was just a polite rejection.\n\nIf I re-enter the job market, I think I'd definitely focus on smaller companies rather than large corporations.",

    "fullText": "The Texas Tech football team's average yield of 10.92 points per game this season would be a school record for scoring defense in the modern era, defined by the National Football Foundation as 1950 and later.\n\nOver the past 60 years, Tech's next five stingiest defenses by average points allowed came in the five consecutive seasons from 1970-74. Those are the years Richard Bell was the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, or head defensive coach, as he was commonly referenced.\n\n\"Oh, wow,\" said Tommy Cones, a Red Raiders defensive end who lettered from 1972-74. \"Well, that tells you a lot right there. Numbers don't lie, right?\"\n\n\"That's amazing. That's amazing,\" said Gaines Baty, a defensive end who lettered from 1970-72. \"Well, he was known across the country as a defensive expert.\"\n\nBell died on Dec. 13 in Woodstock, Georgia. He was 88.\n\nMore: Texas Tech football's Jacob Rodriguez on Heisman vote, awards circuit\n\nHis passing prompted reflection among those who played under him.\n\n\"Richard Bell was the epitome of character, integrity, intensity, passion and excellence,\" Baty said. \"He set a high standard for the football team, as well as personally for every player on that team.\"\n\nBell came to Texas Tech from West Virginia with head coach Jim Carlen in 1970 and followed Carlen to South Carolina after the 1974 season. Tech and Vanderbilt played to a 6-6 tie in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 28, 1974, before Vandy coach Steve Sloan switched programs. Late on New Year's Eve, Sloan announced he was staying at Vanderbilt, but he changed his mind and accepted the Texas Tech job on New Year's Day.\n\nThe next day, the Avalanche-Journal reported Bell, according to Texas Tech insiders, \"would have landed the job had Sloan not reconsidered during the wee hours of New Year's morn.\"\n\nBell was a college head coach for only one year, going 4-7 in 1982 at South Carolina.\n\nHis long coaching career included stints as defensive coordinator at West Virginia (1968-69), Texas Tech (1970-74), South Carolina (1975-81), Duke (1983-87), East Carolina (1988), Georgia (1989-93), Navy (1994) and Air Force (1995-2006). The Arkansas native was a captain on Frank Broyles' first Razorbacks team in 1958 and made early coaching stops at Virginia Military (1962-63) and Georgia Tech (1964-67).\n\nHe worked under College Football Hall of Fame coaches Bobby Dodd and Fisher DeBerry at Georgia Tech and Air Force, respectively, and alongside Hall of Fame coach Bobby Bowden when Bowden was offensive coordinator at West Virginia.\n\nBefore leaving Georgia, Bell recruited a young defensive back named Kirby Smart.\n\n\"He just knew how to get the most out of every player,\" Cones said, \"and he had some really, really good pep talks. He was such a professional in terms of communicating, and you'd get really pumped up when he's your coach. He had a certain charisma about him. He would say the right thing, the things you wanted to hear before you went out to win a game for him.\"\n\nFormer Tech defensive tackle David Knaus described Bell as calm, controlled, thorough and confident. Knaus, an all-Southwest Conference honoree in 1973, said Bell's style was a polar opposite of Bill Parcells, who followed him as Tech defensive coordinator.\n\n\"Other than both of them being tremendous coaches, they couldn't have been more different in their styles,\" Knaus said. \"As an example, I never heard profanity ever uttered from coach Bell. He barely ever needed to raise his voice. It was always controlled correction.\"\n\nTech went 8-4 in 1970, holding opponents to 13.5 points per game. The Red Raiders slipped to 4-7 in 1971, though the defense yielded only 12.5 points per game, and defensive back Marc Dove was Southwest Conference defensive player of the year. Bell's units held opponents to 14.2 points per game in 1972, 15.3 in 1973 and 13.8 in 1974.\n\nThe 1972 team finished 8-4 with a Sun Bowl loss to North Carolina. The 1973 team finished 11-1 with a Gator Bowl conquest of Tennessee.\n\nWhile serving as the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, Bell was position coach for defensive ends and linebackers. End Bruce Dowdy earned all-Southwest Conference recognition in 1970, linebacker Larry Molinare in 1971 and Cones in 1974.\n\n\"He took a lot of running backs and good athletes,\" Baty said, \"and turned them into linebackers and defensive ends. That was kind of his way to do it. He liked a good athlete that would hit you.\"\n\nBaty came to Tech as a running back, quickly moved to linebacker and then played his entire varsity career at defensive end. Noseguard Don Rives was a second-team all-American in 1972. In the spring before that season, Rives called Baty \"the best defensive end in this league\" and \"the most underrated player in this conference.\"\n\nTo the extent that was true, Baty chalked it up to his coach.\n\n\"He made me as a player,\" Baty said. \"Not that I was anything special, but whatever I was is because of Richard Bell.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: Remembering Richard Bell, Texas Tech football defensive coordinator",

    "title": "Expert: EU Commission wants an \"unlimited special legal zone\" for AI",
    "description": "In a legal analysis for consumer advocates, experts warn of massive protection gaps due to the planned \"digital EU omnibus\". Big Tech is favored.",
    "fullText": "With the planned \"digital omnibus\" package, the EU Commission promises a breakthrough against bureaucracy. However, resistance to the initiative is constantly growing. Legal experts from the law firm Spirit Legal are now urgently warning in an expert opinion commissioned by the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzbv) that the draft represents a systematic break with the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and endangers the privacy of hundreds of millions of consumers.\n\nAt the center of the criticism is the planned Article 88c, which provides for special relief for data processing in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The experts Peter Hense and David Wagner warn here of an \"unlimited special legal zone\". Since the term \"AI system\" is extremely broadly defined, companies could in the future declare almost any automated data processing as AI-relevant in order to evade strict data protection rules. This would replace the technology-neutral logic of the GDPR with a technology-specific privilege that primarily benefits service providers.\n\nThe lawyers consider the planned relaxation in handling sensitive data such as health information or political views to be alarming. The draft suggests that their processing is all the more justified the larger the data volumes are. This reverses the principle of data minimization: mass data extraction is rewarded as long as it serves to train AI models. The experts see this as dangerous privileges for Big Tech corporations.\n\nThe authors also criticize that essential protective mechanisms are merely shifted to the legally non-binding recitals. One example is technical opt-out procedures with which users can object to the use of their data. Without anchoring in the binding legal text, supervisory authorities lack the means to effectively sanction violations. Especially with web scraping, data of individuals would be collected who often have no opportunity to even become aware of their right of objection.\n\nTo counteract these negative developments, the experts propose a specific legal basis for AI training. Companies should only be allowed to access personal information if they can prove that their goal cannot be achieved with anonymized or synthetic data. Furthermore, it must be ensured that AI models do not reproduce personal information in their answers (\"Data Leakage\"). Strict technical standards are therefore necessary already in the training process.\n\nA chapter is dedicated to the protection of vulnerable groups. Since minors frequently cannot grasp the implications of data processing for AI, the authors advocate for explicit parental consent. In addition, individuals reaching the age of majority should receive an unconditional right to prohibit the further use of their data in existing models. Without such guardrails, the digital sovereignty of the next-generation risks being permanently lost.\n\nAccording to vzbv board member Ramona Pop, the political dimension of these findings is enormous. She warns that the Commission, under the guise of innovation, primarily wants to issue a free pass to US platforms. Big Tech could easily exploit legal grey areas, while European companies and consumers would be left behind. True legal certainty can only be achieved through clear rules. Brussels, on the other hand, is proposing vague exceptions that would have to be judicially clarified over years.\n\nCurrent results of a representative online survey for the vzbv demonstrate that data protection is not a hindrance but an economic factor. According to the survey, trust is the fundamental prerequisite for using digital services for 87 percent of consumers. The GDPR serves as an important anchor: over 60 percent of respondents are more likely to trust companies if they demonstrably comply with European regulations. A dilution of these standards thus also risks the social acceptance of new technologies.\n\nThe Digital Omnibus will now be discussed in the EU Council and Parliament. The objections from civil society can hardly be ignored. The package is suspected of being primarily the result of massive pressure from the US government, rather than representing European citizen and economic interests. The rights of data subjects are being weakened under the guise of \"simplifications,\" it is said. The Commission wants to issue AI companies a blank check to extract European data.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "fullText": "The world's largest technology companies are scrambling to manage a growing crisis affecting thousands of their employees on work visas, as new social media screening requirements trigger delays at US embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and ServiceNow have all sent advisories to visa-holding employees in recent days, warning them against international travel and describing appointment delays stretching up to a year.\n\nThe memos, sent by immigration law firms representing these companies or by their internal legal teams, paint a picture of mounting uncertainty for foreign workers who form a critical part of the tech industry's workforce.\n\nThe warnings come as American embassies have postponed routine visa stamping appointments, leaving some employees already abroad unable to return to work in the US for extended periods.\n\nFor H-1B holders, the primary work visa used by tech companies, the situation creates a particularly difficult bind. If their visa stamp expires and they travel abroad, they must obtain a new stamp at a consulate before re-entering the US. With appointments now being rescheduled months into the future, what would typically be a routine trip home has become a potential career disruption lasting up to a year.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was now conducting \"online presence reviews for applicants.\" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,\" the State Department spokesperson said. Appointments in Ireland and Vietnam have also been postponed, according to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC.\n\nBelow are the full texts of the internal memos sent to employees at these companies, obtained by Business Insider, which reveal how corporate America is responding to the visa processing slowdown.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple and ServiceNow did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBelow is the text of a memo sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (BAL), the immigration firm that represents Google.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Apple's immigration team.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by ServiceNow's Global Mobility Team.\n\nHave a tip?
