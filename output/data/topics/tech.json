    "description": "A longtime HR pro says AI is making everyone's résumé look the same, when it can provide job seekers with so much more value.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Trent Cotton, an HR industry veteran who is head of talent-acquisition insights at recruiting-software company iCIMS. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs someone who works in the talent space, I've lately noticed that many people think AI helps make their résumés look better. My response to that is: You know your AI agent is cheating on you, right? It's doing the same thing for everyone, so your effort to try to stand out is actually making you blend in.\n\nIt's OK to use an AI agent to improve your résumé, but instead of asking it to do a rewrite, which can introduce errors, prompt it to behave like an expert career coach. Have it analyze your résumé and ask you probing questions to help you further build out your experience profile.\n\nNext, ask the agent what roles you might qualify for based on your skill set. The results may include ones you didn't know about, so have it explain what those jobs involve. Sometimes you just need to get a different perspective.\n\nIn my job at iCIMS, I analyze millions of data points collected from our recruiting software. Each month, I take a look at a specific sector or hot topic and dive deep.\n\nOne thing I saw last year was a pretty decent increase in application volume in manufacturing. If I'm sitting in tech, manufacturing isn't the sector I'm thinking of, but manufacturing needs tech to do things like track what's coming in and out of warehouses. AI can provide that kind of insight — but only if you ask for it.\n\nSticking with this example, you want to ask the AI: What are some of the top manufacturing companies looking to hire tech talent, and for what kind of positions? Keep going down that rabbit hole to really understand what opportunities are out there.\n\nOnce you find job listings that interest you, plug the descriptions into your AI agent and tell it to start interviewing you. When I was in college, you always went through mock interviews. They would just be absolutely brutal with you, but they prepared you. I think we've skipped a couple of generations in doing that. AI can bring mock interviews back.\n\nTell the AI agent that you want the interviewer to be like someone with business savvy, such as Steven Bartlett from the podcast \"Diary of a CEO.\" But also say you want feedback from the likes of chef and TV personality Gordon Ramsay, because he's known for providing his employees with brutally honest, constructive feedback. Say you want a true grade about your interview performance and recommendations for ways you can get better.\n\nMost AI agents will say your answers are great if you don't give them a persona like that of Ramsay. The AI version of him is going to tell you the good, the bad, and the ugly, and you're going to be better off because of it.",

    "title": "California tried to protect students' data. Tech companies found loopholes",
    "description": "A legislative battle is under way over gaps that allow companies to collect and sell students’ personal information.",
    "fullText": "The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, uses investigative reporting, data analysis, and software engineering to challenge technology to serve the public good. \n\nFor every aspect of a student’s life, there’s a tech company trying to digitize it. Inside the classroom, online tools proctor exams, create flashcards and submit assignments. Outside, technology coordinates school sports, helps bus drivers find the right route and maintains students’ health records.\n\nCalifornia has a number of laws aimed at protecting children’s data privacy, but those laws have exceptions that allow many tech companies to continue packaging and selling students’ personal information.\n\nThis year, Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a San Luis Obispo Democrat, is carrying a high-profile state bill that would add new protections for students. She says it’s important, especially as the Trump admin is trying to collect data about California residents’ immigration status, gender identity, and their use of certain public benefits.\n\nHistorically, California has been a leader in data privacy. In 2014, California passed a landmark student privacy law that prohibited technology companies from selling students’ data, targeting students in advertising, or disclosing their personal information. Then in 2018, the state passed another unprecedented bill that required all companies give California users certain privacy rights, such as a chance to opt out of data collection and delete some of their information.\n\nBut as technology evolved and proliferated, privacy laws repeatedly fell short in protecting California’s students — at the same time that the federal government has tried to collect increasing amounts of personal information, Addis said.\n\nHer bill would restrict how AI companies use student data and create new data protections for college students. Some of Sacramento’s most powerful players are paying close attention to the measure, including the California Labor Federation, which supports the bill, and the California Chamber of Commerce, which opposes it. Combined, these two groups spent nearly $8 million on campaign donations to state legislators or other political activities in 2024, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database. TechNet, a trade association that represents many of the most powerful tech companies, also opposes the bill.\n\nThe proposal, Assembly Bill 1159, would close certain loopholes in the state’s 2014 education privacy law, but experts say it may not be enough to prevent companies from selling students’ data.\n\nJen King is a privacy and data policy fellow at Stanford’s institute for AI, where she studies the tricks that companies use to gather users’ data and prevent them from opting out, sometimes known as “dark patterns.” In her personal life, she’s vigilant about avoiding online data tracking and maintains a landline in her Bay Area home to avoid giving out her cell phone number.\n\nKing doesn’t want her children’s information available online or for any company to sell, though sometimes it happens before she can stop it.\n\nIn the fall, King got an email about a platform called TeamSnap, which her 12-year-old son’s cross country coaches were using to manage the team’s roster. The company wanted her information, including her name, date of birth, gender, email address, and phone number. Once she logged in to the platform, she could see some of her son’s information, such as his name, email, and date of birth, were already listed. Photos and personal information from all of her son’s teammates were also available for her to see.\n\n“I was super irritated,” she said. “You don’t need my birth date — I’m a freaking parent.” She acknowledged some personal information could be useful for a coach but said that other questions seem designed to help the platform sell information to data brokers and ultimately, to advertisers.\n\nHer 17-year-old son’s data is also on TeamSnap, she later learned, because his robotics team uses it. This month, when King tried to show The Markup and CalMatters her TeamSnap account, a pop-up appeared, asking her if the company could track her activity across other apps and websites.\n\nFederal law requires companies to get parental consent before knowingly collecting or selling data from children 12 and under, but once a child turns 13, their data is generally treated much like an adult’s information, especially when that child is interacting with tech platforms outside of school. TeamSnap’s privacy policy says it doesn’t knowingly collect personal information about users under 13 “without express parental consent,” though it says in some cases a team or organization may provide information on behalf of the child.\n\nThe policy also says that TeamSnap has “not sold the personal information of any consumer for monetary consideration” in the last 12 months, but that its “use of cookies and other tracking technologies may be considered a sale of personal information under the CCPA (California privacy law).” Information sold to advertisers and marketers included users’ names, contact information, purchase history and geolocation, the policy says.\n\nCalifornia privacy law specifically requires certain large for-profit companies to get consent to collect data from anyone under 16. Often, consent happens when a user first opens a website and a pop-up appears, asking if the website can sell your data or track your cookies.\n\nIf a teacher, coach, or other authority figure tells a student that they have to use a website or an app, then the student cannot realistically opt out, King said. They may be too young to understand how to opt out, she added. “Most 15-, 16-year-olds don’t have any idea what this is about.”\n\nEven older college students may have little agency in the technology they use, especially if it’s required for class or residential life. At Stanford, for example, King said her undergraduate students are often required to create Facebook accounts for student groups.\n\nThe same is true for parents. King said she reluctantly gave TeamSnap her personal information, including her name, email, date of birth, and the landline number for her home, because it was the only way to get updates about her son’s team.\n\nIn 2014, California became the first state in the country to regulate education technology companies directly, but being first comes with its drawbacks. “We didn’t have examples of what best practice was,” said Amelia Vance, the president of the Public Interest Privacy Center, a nonprofit organization. The law only applies to products that “primarily” serve K-12 schools and that are designed and marketed for students.\n\nMany tech companies argue that their products aren’t primarily intended for students or at least that they were not designed or marketed that way. The language-learning app DuoLingo, for example, has a version for schools, but the app is also popular for adults. Apps or technologies serving extracurricular programs or sports teams can claim they weren’t designed and marketed for the classroom, or that their use isn’t mandatory, said Vance. “You have this sort of black hole where there haven’t been protections.”\n\nAddis’ bill expands the number of education technology companies that fall under the state’s student privacy laws, but the language is murky when it comes to apps or online services used outside of class.\n\nIn the case of TeamSnap, Addis’ communications director Alexis Garcia-Arrazola said the company would “most likely” fall under the scope of the bill if its technology is marketed to schools, if schools direct students to use it, and if the sports team is sponsored by the school.\n\nPublic records show that Piedmont Unified School District in Alameda County, Tamalpais Union High School District in Marin County, and Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District all purchased versions of TeamSnap, but only the Santa Monica Malibu district responded to questions about any privacy restriction imposed on the company. Brandyi Phillips, the chief communications officer for the Santa Monica Malibu schools, said the district has an annual subscription with TeamSnap, which is only available to sports staff and parents. She said there’s an agreement with the company “to protect District information and to prevent unauthorized access” but did not clarify if that agreement prevents the district from selling students’ information.\n\nBerkeley Unified School District, where King’s children attend school, did not respond to questions about any contracts, purchase orders or agreements with TeamSnap.\n\nLocally, school districts and colleges have the power to negotiate the privacy terms of any contract they make with a technology company, but many websites and apps offer free versions that a teacher or coach might recommend without getting formal approval from their district.\n\nLast year, the California State University system signed a nearly $17 million contract with Open AI, the company that operates ChatGPT, including an agreement that the company will not train its models on student data. Advocates for Addis’ bill say the same privacy restrictions should apply to any AI company with access to California student data, regardless of whether the company has an agreement with the student’s school district or college.\n\nAddis’ bill comes as privacy laws in California and across the country are in flux. In 2020, California voters approved a proposition to create a new state agency to enforce data privacy rules and regulate the businesses that collect data. Advocates for the proposition contributed over $6.7 million to the campaign, compared to just over $50,000 contributed by the opposition, according to state data. The state agency that the proposition formed, now known as CalPrivacy, released new rules this year, restricting the use of automated decision-making technology, such as the use of AI to make admissions or hiring decisions. Those rules were originally stricter but businesses, lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom pressured the CalPrivacy board to water them down.\n\nIn Washington D.C., Congress is considering changing federal law to limit how companies interact with children under 17. Separately, Congress is considering a bill that would require social media companies to prevent and mitigate children’s sexual exploitation, bullying, and self-harm. California Attorney General Rob Bonta is concerned that one version of the social media bill contains language that could erode existing protections in California law.\n\nBonta’s office is responsible for enforcing many of the state’s existing privacy laws. In November, he said the state worked with Connecticut and New York to reach $5.1 million in settlements against Illuminate, an education technology company that uses data to track and evaluate students’ progress, such as their testing scores and developmental milestones. The company had a data breach, exposing “sensitive information” from over 434,000 California students, the state attorney general’s office said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time California successfully went after a company for violating the state’s landmark 2014 education privacy law.\n\nTo increase enforcement, Addis’ bill contains a new provision — the right for students and parents to sue tech companies in certain cases for privacy violations. Business and technology groups have opposed the bill, arguing that the new regulations and the right to sue would stifle investment in AI-powered learning tools.\n\nKing said that giving consumers the right to sue is often the only way to increase enforcement. Otherwise, the onus is on individual consumers to find concerning practices and try to opt out.\n\nDespite being an expert in data privacy, King said that she struggled at first to figure out how to delete her TeamSnap account, only later to discover that she needed to send an email to the company. She laughed at the irony, since it’s these kinds of dark patterns in user design that fuel part of her research.\n\nIn academia, the strategy of trapping customers is sometimes called the “roach motel,” she explained, a reference to a popular television ad from the late 1970s for a cockroach trap.\n\n“You can check in,” she said, “but you can never check out.”",

    "fullText": "Like a modern-day Paul Revere, Ben Dziobek's voice rang across the night as he ran toward a crowd waiting outside New Brunswick City Hall on Wednesday.\n\nThe news? Members of the city council struck down potential plans to build a data center.\n\n\"They canceled it! They canceled it!\" Dziobek shouts in footage shared by New Jersey's Climate Revolution Action Network. Loud cheers followed, and then a chant: \"The people, united, will never be defeated!\"\n\nThe New Brunswick City Council had just decided to remove data centers from the list of permitted uses in a plan to redevelop several parcels of land. While no data center had yet been proposed, even the possibility that a data center could someday end up there raised alarm among city residents.\n\n\"The city administration is asking the council to amend the redevelopment plan to remove data centers as a permitted use, and to reinsert the requirement for inclusion of a park on the site that's provided in the prior redevelopment,\" New Brunswick's city planner Daniel Dominguez said at the meeting.\n\nLarge, warehouse-style data centers have become a flash point for many communities across America as Big Tech and other AI companies look to power the large language models and chatbots they say are going to change the world. Those data centers, however, can be a drain on water resources and power grids, increase pollution, and decrease the quality of life.\n\nAn investigation by Business Insider published last year found that over 1,200 data centers had been approved for construction across the US by the end of 2024. These data centers, the report found, could consume as much power as entire US states and guzzle enormous amounts of water daily in drought-stricken regions.\n\nIn New Brunswick, those environmental concerns were top of mind.\n\n\"Community members cited concerns over environmental impact, energy consumption, water usage, noise pollution, and the broader implications of allowing large‐scale artificial intelligence and data infrastructure to expand into residential and public community spaces,\" the Climate Revolution Action Network, a local environmental activist group that helped organize opposition to the redevelopment plan, said in a press release.\n\nOn Wednesday, residents and environmental advocates attended a New Brunswick City Council meeting to discuss the proposal.\n\nDuring the meeting, Dominguez said the inclusion of a potential data center in the redevelopment plan was intended to \"diversify the commercial development site,\" but that it was \"not critical to the project.\"\n\nAttendees cheered after the city council ultimately voted to nix the data center.\n\n\"I'd like to thank the council for deciding to scrap what many people did not want in their neighborhoods,\" one attendee said. \"We don't want these kinds of centers in here that are going to take resources from the community.\"\n\nNew Brunswick is one among many communities across the country fighting potential data center developments.\n\nA large group of residents opposing a proposed data center in Clarmore, Oklahoma, turned out for a council meeting to discuss the project last week. Police arrested one of them for speaking for 30 seconds over their allotted three minutes. In San Marcos, Texas, hundreds of residents showed up at City Hall on Tuesday to protest a data center. The city council eventually scrapped that plan after a nearly 9-hour debate, according to local reports.",

    "title": "Early pecking order and Verstappen’s concerns: 7 key takeaways from F1 testing",
    "description": "After three weeks in Barcelona and Bahrain, F1 heads to Melbourne. But what are the main lessons from pre-season testing? From Mercedes’ favourite status to interesting tech solutions, here are the key takeaways",
    "fullText": "Prior to winter testing, George Russell was already the bookmakers’ top favourite for the 2026 Formula 1 world title, and that picture has not changed after three weeks of running.\n\nYes, Ferrari ultimately topped the timesheets, but that says little. Traditionally, the Scuderia tends to show a bit more than some of its rivals and Charles Leclerc even bolted on a set of C4 tyres, a softer compound than Pirelli normally brings to Bahrain. Mercedes did not feel that necessity, which in itself may be a sign of confidence.\n\nF1 Bahrain pre-season test: Ferrari tops testing overall by 0.8s\n\nAs McLaren team boss Andrea Stella explained on Friday evening: individual lap times say little, only the long runs reveal a first indication. In that respect, Mercedes has made a good impression at various moments. Moreover, rivals – not least Max Verstappen – have expressed the view that Toto Wolff’s outfit is still holding quite a bit of performance in reserve. In that regard, it was telling that Pirelli has indicated that the lap times in Bahrain (in contrast to those in Barcelona) were slower than anticipated, which may also point to sandbagging.\n\nMercedes remains the favourite after the first on-track action of the year, but that does not take away from the fact that Ferrari has started well. The long runs looked relatively consistent, also in terms of energy deployment over multiple laps. There is cautious reason for optimism in Maranello, although it is not something that should make anyone in Brackley or Brixworth nervous.\n\nWhen Stella shared his own view on the early pecking order, the message was clear: Mercedes and Ferrari are a step ahead, behind them McLaren and Red Bull seem relatively close to each other – with Oscar Piastri slightly quicker than Verstappen in Thursday’s long runs.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that not all Mercedes customer teams seemed to have used the exact same mappings as the factory team in Bahrain – an aspect Alpine alluded to. Perhaps there is still a bit more to come for the likes of McLaren in that regard.\n\nThis, however, does nothing to diminish the good impression Red Bull has made with its own power unit. Wolff described the DM01 as “the benchmark”, although that praise seemed rather politically charged. Moreover, technical director Pierre Wache explained that Red Bull had mastered certain aspects of the energy management slightly earlier than its competitors, but he was quick to add that the rest of the pack had since taken steps in the same direction.\n\nIt may not make Red Bull Powertrains the absolute benchmark, contrary to what Wolff said, but it remains impressive how that project has come out of the blocks. The power unit has proven reliable so far and Red Bull looks competitive. As Mekies rightly pointed out on Friday evening: that in itself is already quite an achievement for a newcomer.\n\nBased on early evidence, the four top teams from last year still appear to be the four top teams in 2026. With changes to both the engine and chassis regulations, in theory, the door was open for a major surprise, but a fairytale à la Brawn GP in 2009 has not materialised.\n\nSeveral factors underlie this. The most important one is that the big four still have the most potential. Yes, the budget cap is meant to ensure a level playing field, but structurally the larger outfits still retain some crucial advantages. That applies both in terms of facilities and personnel, although there is one team on the grid that should theoretically be able to match that – but more on that below.\n\nTeam by team: How Bahrain's double pre-season test went for the F1 2026 field\n\nAs for the ‘best of the rest’ position, Alpine and Haas seem to hold good cards for now. Alpine had virtually written off 2025 to perform better this season and that approach appears to be paying off, at least in the early days. The Mercedes power unit naturally helps, although team members acknowledge that its integration and adjusting the working methods after years of being a factory team will take some time. Still, Alpine seems back in a position to fight for something – and that is already an important step forward compared to last season.\n\nThe biggest loser of pre-season testing is easy to guess: Aston Martin. That message was already audible during its season launch in Saudi Arabia. From all corners at the home of title sponsor Aramco came the same line: “It’s not about where we stand in Melbourne, it’s all about our development and the second half of the season.” In Bahrain it became clear why that message was being emphasised so strongly: the team has work to do, a lot of it in fact.\n\nAn important part of that seems related to Honda. The F1 project of the Japanese brand now looks very different compared to the successful years with Red Bull. After the decision to officially quit F1 at the end of 2021, many people left or were reallocated to other R&D divisions within the company. Honda therefore largely had to rebuild the project from scratch. Add to that the integration with a new partner, and the fact that Aston Martin is now running its own gearbox for the first time, and the complexity of the whole project becomes clear.\n\nHonda ‘unhappy’ with its own F1 performance, not just reliability\n\nIn that respect it did not help that Adrian Newey, by his own admission, was only able to start late, and that the new wind tunnel with its 2026 car became operational four months later than planned. As the integration of the engine into the chassis was considered a key advantage of this partnership, that delay is now being felt in other areas. With Newey, Honda and the hyper-modern Silverstone campus, all the ingredients for long-term success appear to be in place, but if pre-season testing has made one thing clear, it is that this project will take time – perhaps a lot of time. The follow-up question is whether Fernando Alonso still has that time behind the wheel.\n\nA fear that technical directors usually express ahead of a regulation change is that the new rules might be too restrictive. This time it was said by, among others, Newey. But in practice this ruleset seems to offer enough room for distinctive designs. In pre-season, the creation of Newey himself stood out, not least because of the rather extreme suspension choices at the rear.\n\nDuring testing in Bahrain a few more interesting solutions emerged. Audi came up with completely new sidepods – a concept that differed from what the other teams had shown up to that point – and Ferrari drew attention with a rotating rear wing. Team boss Frederic Vasseur emphasised that it was a test item and that it has to be analysed whether it will be raced in Melbourne, although the FIA has confirmed that it is legal and usable if Ferrari wishes to run it.\n\nSuch creative interpretations are still possible in 2026, and that in itself is good news. It not only fits the innovative nature of the pinnacle of motorsport, but also underlines the continuous arms race between all teams. Under a new set of regulations that applies more than ever, which means this has only been the first glimpse of what will be an extreme development rate – in Australia and beyond, the pace of teams introducing new parts will remain relentless.\n\nWhile that aspect – the development race – is still “peak F1”, that does not apply, according to all drivers, to the experience behind the wheel. Verstappen voiced his objections first and in the most outspoken way. The Dutchman called F1’s new era “Formula E on steroids” and added that he did not even want to test the 2026 car in the simulator last year, simply because it felt so bad.\n\nMax Verstappen on F1 2026 flaws: ‘I already said that in 2023, but nobody listened’\n\nAlthough the overall picture cannot easily be remedied and is linked to how these regulations came about (politically) – first finalising the engine rules for Audi and Honda and only then looking at the chassis and aerodynamics – it is clear that teams are learning quickly. In terms of energy management and avoiding unnatural things, such as lifting and extra downshifting, it already looks slightly better than in Barcelona, although the real challenges are still to come.\n\nThose challenges will confront teams in Melbourne. Energy harvesting will be a much greater challenge there, as Stella explained, which may require more ‘unnatural things’ from drivers. A potential workaround could be running 300kW electric power in race trim rather than 350kW and relying on ‘super clipping’ (charging to 350kW instead of 250kW while flat-out), although the FIA wants to monitor the early races before taking any action. Until then, the hope will be that the image does not become too alienating for diehard fans. Despite teams having learned a lot, drivers’ concerns have not disappeared – certainly not for some of the tracks that are to come.\n\nThe final point is not directly related to the on-track action, but after the past few months it cannot be omitted: the political discussion about the compression ratio. While the pure racing may not be “peak F1”, the political chess game certainly is. It is alive like never before, with the Mercedes engine dominating the discussions in Bahrain.\n\nWolff has indicated that Mercedes kept the FIA “in the loop” throughout the entire development process, although the governing body nevertheless saw the need – after questions from other manufacturers – to put the compression ratio tests to a vote. If a double test is indeed introduced – one of which at a temperature of 130 degrees Celsius – that tightening will only take effect on 1 August, meaning everyone loses a little – the textbook example of an F1 compromise – and the issue will continue to simmer in the background for a while.\n\nNikolas Tombazis said on behalf of the FIA that the performance advantage is much smaller than some in the paddock suspect and that, in his view, the topic does not deserve that much attention at all. But that too is typical F1; every grey area and every potential performance differentiator – no matter how small – is fiercely contested. During the testing days in Barcelona and Bahrain many things in F1 turned out to be different, but this aspect certainly did not.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "title": "Peter Thiel and other tech billionaires are publicly shielding their children from the products that made them rich",
    "description": "As governments race to restrict minors’ social media use, the tech billionaires who built the platforms are imposing strict screen limits at home.",
    "fullText": "Despite building an increasingly screen-focused world, billionaire tech leaders are keeping their own children away from the tech they helped create.\n\nAs far back as 2010, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs told a New York Times reporter his kids had never used an iPad and that, “We limit how much technology our kids use at home.”\n\nSince then, the trend of Silicon Valley billionaires keeping their families away from technology has become even more pronounced, thanks in part to the rise of social media and short-form video.\n\nExcessive device use among children has become more common in recent years as busy parents turn to screens to find some peace. The trend has accelerated so much that some young children accustomed to extensive screen time are dubbed “iPad kids.” On average, children in the U.S. ages 8 to 18 spend 7.5 hours per day watching or using screens, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n\nYouTube cofounder Steve Chen said at a talk at the Stanford Graduate School of Business last year that he wouldn’t want his kids consuming only short-form content, noting that it might be better to limit kids to videos longer than 15 minutes.\n\n“Shorter-form content equates to shorter attention spans,” he said.\n\nAt the 2024 Aspen Ideas Festival, early Facebook investor and billionaire Peter Thiel joined Chen among the ranks of tech leaders who are setting strict limits on screens. Thiel said he only lets his two young children use screens for an hour-and-a-half per week, a revelation that prompted audible gasps from the audience.\n\nOther tech CEOs, including Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Snap’s Evan Spiegel, and Tesla’s Elon Musk, have also spoken about limiting their children’s access to devices. Gates has said he did not give his children smartphones until age 14 and banned phones at the dinner table entirely. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, in 2018, said he limits his child to the same 1.5 hours per week of screen time as Thiel. And finally, Musk, who bought the social media company X, formerly Twitter, in 2022, said it “might’ve been a mistake” to not set any rules on social media for his children.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who once said his own children were too young to use TikTok, clarified in 2023 that if his children lived in the U.S. and had access to the rigorous protections associated with the platform’s under-13 settings, he would let them use the app. He said even an 8-year-old could use the platform in the under-13 experience, which, among other protections, includes vetted content, no access to posting, and no advertisements.\n\nScientific research backs up their parenting instincts. A 2025 study of nearly 100,000 people found that short-form video use was consistently associated with poorer cognition and a decline in many aspects of mental health across both younger and older social media users.\n\nAs young people increasingly spend most of their waking moments online, the backlash against social media, and especially minors’ use of social media, has reached a breaking point.\n\nIn the past year, Australia and Malaysia became the first countries to ban adolescents under 16 from using social media. And several other countries, including France, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, are considering similar legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand earlier this week to defend his company against claims from a 20-year-old plaintiff that the social media giant built its platforms to hook young children.\n\nAnd yet, far from being a new phenomenon, the idea that social media use is harmful for young people has been around for years. Still, it’s the tech leaders who created the attention economy who have been the most attentive to this fact.\n\nTo be sure, several social media CEOs have publicly pushed back on claims that their platforms are harmful. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri testified earlier this month in the trial against Meta that social media does not constitute “clinical addiction.” Meta’s lawyers during the trial also outlined a range of safety features Instagram has introduced for younger users, including limits on the visibility of adult content and muted notifications at night.\n\nYet, as the trials against social media companies continue and country after country moves toward legislating what Silicon Valley’s billionaires have quietly practiced for years, the private behavior of the world’s most powerful tech figures stands in contrast to what they’re promoting and building.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Although he never worked in Big Tech, Brian Jenney earned more than he ever imagined in software development using this salary negotiation strategy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brian Jenney, 42, who lives in California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got into tech in my early 30s, I had no clue how crazy lucrative the industry was.\n\nI started as a web application developer in 2015, earning roughly $60,000 a year.\n\nOver the years, I became savvier at negotiating my salary, and by 2023, I was making over $250,000.\n\nI've earned more than I could have ever imagined, without working in Big Tech, where people often assume the big money is made.\n\nHere's what I've learned along the way.\n\nI used to have addiction issues, so I didn't really work from the ages of 25 to 30 and lost knowledge that people gain from white collar jobs at this stage of life.\n\nI was naive about the salary potential of my industry, and when people in tech said they were on $150,000, it blew my mind, and I began to feel underpaid.\n\nIn 2017, after two years in the web developer role, I landed a job at a startup. I was so impressed when I was offered $120,000 that I didn't negotiate my salary, which was dumb in retrospect.\n\nThe environment was extremely fast-paced and high-caliber. I struggled with imposter syndrome as one of the team's more junior members. I felt like one of the worst developers there and that I was already being paid more than I deserved. It discouraged me from asking for a raise.\n\nIn 2019, I joined the media intelligence company Zignal Labs. I was so happy about the job offer that I didn't negotiate the salary, so my pay initially stayed roughly the same as in my previous job. It felt like I had plateaued, even though I had more money than I needed. An unfortunate symptom of working in tech is that you get drawn to wanting more.\n\nChoosing this role turned out to be the right move, though. I had more room to grow and was in a better learning environment at a larger company.\n\nDuring the tech hiring spree of 2020, my peers said they were getting crazy offers, and I didn't want to miss out. That August, I joined The Clorox Company, a manufacturing firm, as a software engineer. By 2023, I was making over $250,000: the peak of my earnings in tech.\n\nIn 2024, I was laid off, and I've continued to work in various software engineering roles. I bought a business in 2023, and my focus has shifted to seeking out flexibility and time to build it, instead of maximizing corporate compensation.\n\nInterviews are like a carnival game where you can win big money by performing well, and you can't get to the negotiation stage without passing them. They're structured, learnable, and winnable with the right preparation.\n\nWhen I have job interviews lined up, I do technical practice and use a platform called Pramp, which pairs you with strangers for practice interviews. I've found this helps simulate the nerves and pressure of real interviews better than practicing with friends.\n\nI'll try to do at least two mock interviews before an interview I really care about.\n\nOver the years, I've benefited a lot from people in tech being open about their salaries and career paths, which helped me understand what was possible and gave me confidence to negotiate and aim higher.\n\nI've learned that salary negotiation is a game you have to play, and if you don't, you lose money.\n\nI began consistently negotiating pay in the late 2010s. I usually tell the employer that I'm really excited to start the job, but that I was hoping to come in at a higher salary range, usually 10 to 20% more.\n\nI've found this to be very effective, and it has never gone badly for me. If an employer sounds firm on their offer, I usually try to explore whether a sign-on bonus is possible instead, but I don't push aggressively beyond that.\n\nI've interviewed with but never been hired by the Big Tech companies. Besides, I like working at smaller startups and non-tech companies where I think you can have a greater impact.\n\nBig Tech employees are going to \"beat me\" on pay because their stock compensation will outpace my earnings. But I see my current lifestyle as comparable to theirs. I believe there's a reason software engineers aren't driving around Mountain View in Ferraris: they can't cash out all their stock money yet.\n\nThere's always more you can earn, but when my salary hit the $150,000 mark, I knew it was more than I needed. I'd rather prioritize jobs where I'm happy, I'm learning, and I can cover my needs while still saving. That's all I really need.\n\nDo you have a story to share about growing your salary in tech?

    "description": "Toyota’s most senior software executive has revealed that the carmaker is considering banning drivers from switching off vehicle safety features in the Combination of increasing government regulations and Toyota’s goal of zero traffic accidents are forcing hard questions about turning safety technology off",
    "fullText": "Toyota’s most senior software executive has revealed that the carmaker is considering banning drivers from switching off vehicle safety features in the future.\n\nGovernment regulations normally shape the degree of strictness a carmaker imposes, and Australian and European safety regulations in recent years have started to impose various lane keeping, speed limit awareness and driver monitoring systems in cars.\n\nAt present, those systems can typically be switched off manually at the touch of a button or swipe of a screen, if the driver deems that they would prefer to manage these processes themselves.\n\nBut Toyota software development centre president Akihiro Sarada says that the Japanese carmaker is serious about its mission of “zero traffic accidents” — not just deaths, but all car accidents.\n\n“Our ultimate goal is to eradicate all traffic accidents, and of course, autonomous driving is a technology that is necessary to realise a safe environment,” said Sarada.\n\n“We have to study and decide if we would enable an ‘off’ button.”\n\nAllowing drivers to operate the vehicle however they see fit, including by exceeding the speed limit or approaching lane markings to hit a corner apex, may not be compatible with achieving Toyota’s goal of eliminating accidents.\n\nSarada said that Toyota was considering allowing drivers to temporarily disable safety features — or drive in the manner they see fit — in two environments: on roads where the car’s software knows no other cars or pedestrians are around, and on the racetrack.\n\n“If it is safe, for example, if it is on the circuit, [autonomous driving and sporty human driving] can co-exist,” said Sarada.\n\n“In the area[s] where drivers are able to have fun driving, then we want them to have the discretion to decide the way they drive their cars.\n\n“We have to really study in detail whether or not it is really mandatory for us to control that detail, to the level where we have to forbid them to enjoy their driving.”\n\nToyota’s software boss also hinted that connected-car technology — online systems that detect other cars, pedestrians and road conditions — might even allow keen drivers to drive as they see fit on the public road, but that warnings would kick in if risks increased.\n\n“Drivers want to have excitement in driving. By using connected data, they can receive announcements that under [certain] conditions they can have more fun, that right now it is safe, but several seconds later, [if] there is a risk [they can] receive a warning beforehand,” Sarada explained.\n\nBut even this ‘leniency’ could, in theory, stop a driver from disabling safety technologies like lane-centring or speed limit controls on country roads if other cars, cyclists or particularly pedestrians are present in the area.\n\nIt’s a balancing act within Toyota between departments like Sarada’s — tasked with deploying software that reduces accidents, injury and death — and performance-arm GR, which must convince buyers that they should spend their cash on sporty, fun-to-drive cars.\n\nFor decades, Toyota has run ahead of some vehicle safety regulations. For more than 20 years, drivers and passengers in Toyota and Lexus models have been unable to input satellite navigation destinations while the vehicle is in motion.\n\nThat’s a common practice that other carmakers would typically allow, sometimes via rotary dials — often perceived as ‘safer’ to use while moving — but also often via simple touchscreen inputs.\n\nIn recent years other firms have followed Toyota’s lead on blocking some touchscreen functions while the vehicle is in motion. The two key smartphone mirroring products, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both prevent most on-screen keyboard use while driving.\n\nEuropean regulations have also started to encroach on touchscreen use via that continent’s Advanced Driver Distraction Warning requirements, which will come into force for all new vehicles registered in the EU from July 2026.\n\nEven in the EU, however, safety features — including speed warning, stability control and lane-keeping are typically allowed be switched off, though all restart at the next vehicle ignition and a driver would be held responsible for increasing the risk of a crash if a safety system is deactivated.\n\nTypically, governments — including in Australia and Europe — issue broad guidelines for how safety features should work, leaving precise implementation decisions up to carmakers.",

    "fullText": "After meeting with unspecified tech leaders, senator calls for urgent policy action as companies race to build ever more powerful systems\n\nBernie Sanders has warned that Congress and the American public have “not a clue” about the scale and speed of the coming AI revolution, pressing for urgent policy action to “slow this thing down” as tech companies race to build ever-more powerful systems.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford University on Friday alongside congressman Ro Khanna after a series of meetings with industry leaders in California, Sanders was blunt about what he called the “most dangerous moment in the modern history of this country”.\n\n“The Congress and the American people are very unprepared for the tsunami that is coming,” he said.\n\nKhanna, a progressive Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, shared Sanders’s concerns, warning that the country was experiencing a “new gilded age” run by tech billionaires who believe “they would have been heroic conquerors in a different era”.\n\n“That’s just not my observation,” Khanna said. “That’s what they tell me.”\n\nKhanna and Sanders declined to specify which tech executives they met with during the senator’s visit to California, but the congressman said it was “senior leaders” at the “most prominent tech companies”.\n\n“I think it was important for both Senator Sanders to hear from tech leaders and tech leaders to hear from Senator Sanders, who represents and understands the concerns of so many working-class Americans,” Khanna said in an interview after the event.\n\nDuring his remarks, Sanders reissued his call for a moratorium on the expansion of AI data centers to “slow down the revolution and protect workers” while policymakers catch up.\n\nKhanna does not want a moratorium, but has instead pushed to “steer” AI, advocating for the US to adopt a “Singapore model” for data center growth, with an emphasis on renewable energy and water efficiency. In his remarks before an auditorium of mostly students, Khanna outlined seven principles to guard against “oligarchic capture and dominance” of wealth generated by AI innovation.\n\n“We must ask not what America can do for Silicon Valley, but what Silicon Valley must do for America,” said the congressman, who is eyed as considering a 2028 presidential bid.\n\nThe event capped a days-long visit to California, a state he won in the 2020 presidential primary and where he returned to rally thousands during his Fight Oligarchy tour last year. In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Sanders delivered a scathing denunciation of the “greed” of the billionaire class. There he helped formally launch a campaign for a ballot initiative that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth more than $1bn – a proposal that has already prompted some ultra-wealthy tech leaders to flee, or threaten to do so.\n\nAt Stanford, Sanders focused his remarks on his concerns over how AI would impact not only the labor force but personal wellbeing and people’s ability to interact with one another. He mentioned that a restaurant in DC offered a Valentine’s Day special for people and their “AI buddies”, which drew laughs from the students.\n\nIt may seem funny, Sanders said, “but the truth is that a lot of people are becoming dependent upon AI for their emotional support. What is the long-term impact of that? What is the long-term impact if we lose work as an important part of our lives? What do we do with our lives?”\n\nSanders read statements from industry leaders who have predicted widespread automation, and cited projections that AI and robotics could eliminate tens of millions of jobs in the coming decade – from truck drivers to fast‑food workers and many white‑collar roles.\n\nPolling has found Americans are deeply concerned, as federal regulators and states debate how to impose guardrails on the nascent but fast-developing technology. A 2025 Pew survey found that 64% of the public thinks AI “will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”. Just 17% of Americans say “AI will have a very or somewhat positive impact on the United States” over the same period.\n\nThe tech CEOs leading the AI race have argued that AI will drive productivity, innovation and new kinds of employment as technological advancements have always done. But critics, like Sanders, say the “unprecedented” speed and scale of the changes threaten to enrich the “multibillionaires” while deepening inequality and leaving policymakers and the public ill-equipped to mount a response in time.\n\nSander urged his colleagues in Washington – and the public – to begin a serious public debate about the future of work as AI disrupts the economy, democracy and people’s emotional lives.\n\n“AI and robotics are neither good nor bad,” he said. “The question is: will a handful of billionaires benefit from it, or will the general public benefit?”",

    "description": "As tech CEOs predict mass job displacement, billionaire former Shark Tank star Mark Cuban just revealed the “smartest counter” to that narrative.",
    "fullText": "Despite ongoing fears that artificial intelligence could wipe out entire career fields, billionaire Mark Cuban says the concerns may be overblown—for now.\n\nThe former Shark Tank star took to X to respond to a viral clip from the All-In podcast, in which investors Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya revealed the real-world expense of deploying AI agents to enhance productivity: In some cases AI agents are costing more than $300 per day—adding up to over $100,000 annually. For Palihapitiya, founder of Social Capital, the price has forced him to rethink the budget he’s willing to give top developers, warning that otherwise, “I’ll run out of money.”\n\nHave AI-driven layoffs materialized as predicted?\n\nHow do AI agents compare to human workers currently?\n\nWhat are the actual costs of deploying AI agents?\n\nWhy does Mark Cuban think AI won't replace workers soon?\n\nFor Cuban, that reality is the “smartest counter” he has seen so far to predictions that AI will replace large numbers of workers—at least in the short term.\n\nEven if the technology is capable, he said, companies still need to prove the economics make sense, and he’s not convinced the high price tag outweighs the value humans continue to bring.\n\n“Humans have a far greater capacity to know the outcomes of their actions,” Cuban said. “Agents, and LLMs as well, never do.”\n\nAI systems still lack real-world judgment in ways that make replacing workers risky, Cuban added. He pointed to a simple example: An 18-month-old who pushes a sippy cup off a high chair quickly learns the consequences from their parents’ reaction. AI, on the other hand, lacks awareness.\n\n“Agents can tell you the sippy cup will fall,” Cuban said. “But they have no idea of the context and what will happen next.”\n\nThe technology also lacks consistency, often “spac[ing] out” and failing to recognize why and when mistakes occur, he said—a level of competency on par with the youngest Gen Z talent.\n\n“Agents are still like college interns that come in hungover, make mistakes, and don’t take responsibility for them,” he added.\n\nTaken together, Cuban’s argument suggests that the biggest obstacle to AI replacing workers may not be the technology itself—but whether companies can trust it to perform consistently at a price that makes sense.\n\nCuban declined to elaborate further after Fortune reached out for comment.\n\nDespite AI’s current flaws, business leaders continue to warn that rapid technological advances could soon reshape the workforce.\n\nDario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level jobs within one to five years. More recently, he suggested the technology could become capable of performing most jobs, if not all, in “much less than five years.”",

The startup launched its first product, Tinker, last October.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company has become known for attracting star-studded talent. It quietly hired Neal Wu, a legendary coder who won three gold medals in an Olympiad for programming, and Soumith Chintala, the creator of the open-source AI project PyTorch at Meta, who is now Thinking Machines Lab's CTO, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Two memory-product entrepreneurs have seen their fortunes rocket this year thanks to heady demand from AI giants.\n\nDavid Sun, 74, and John Tu, 84, are the cofounders and 50-50 owners of Kingston Technology, a leading maker of computer drives and memory modules. Sun is the California company's operating chief, while Tu is president and CEO.\n\nThe pair have seen their respective net worths soar by 44%, or nearly $14 billion, since the start of January, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nOnly Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Czechoslovak Group CEO Michal Strnad, and Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim have gained more wealth so far this year.\n\nSun and Tu have even outpaced Jim, Alice, and Rob Walton; the heirs to the Walmart fortune were up about $13 billion each for the year at Thursday's close.\n\nThe memory magnates are both worth about $45 billion, putting them in 45th and 46th place respectively on the rich list — ahead of the likes of MacKenzie Scott, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, and Miriam Adelson.\n\nSun and Tu were born in Taiwan and mainland China, respectively, studied electrical engineering in college, and emigrated to the US in the 1970s, per Bloomberg. They met in Los Angeles, where they bonded over basketball and went into business together.\n\nThe pair founded a memory-device company, Camintonn, in 1982, and sold it four years later for $6 million, Bloomberg says. They lost all their savings in the Black Monday crash of 1987, but went on to found Kingston and sell 80% of it to SoftBank for $1.5 billion in 1996. They bought back the stake for $450 million in 1999.\n\nAI hyperscalers have been clamoring for memory chips to build out data centers, fueling a severe global shortage that has driven prices skyward.\n\nThis \"memory supercycle\" promises to boost revenues and profits at memory-product companies, which has propelled their stock prices in recent months.\n\nFor example, Micron Technology stock has more than quadrupled over the past 12 months, valuing the memory-chip maker at $470 billion — more than Mastercard, Oracle, Costco, Bank of America, or Home Depot are worth.",

    "title": "Now That Trump's Tariffs Have Been Ruled Illegal, Will Tech Prices Lower?",
    "description": "It's not clear whether prices will come down now that these tariffs are ending.",
    "fullText": "It's official: Most of President Trump's tariffs are illegal. The Supreme Court struck down the president's signature economic orders on Friday in a 6-3 ruling, spelling the end of a controversial policy that added an estimated $1,000 tax increase for each American household, raised prices on consumer goods, and alienated key U.S. allies.\n\nNot all of Trump's tariffs need to end because of this ruling. The court acknowledged that presidents have the power to \"unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope.\" Instead, the court found that tariffs enacted based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) were done so improperly, as the administration \"points to no statute\" from Congress that says the IEEPA could be used for tariffs. That means tariffs against steel and aluminum could continue, since those were enacted from other laws, but both the \"reciprocal\" tariffs placed against other countries, and the flat 25% tariff placed on goods from countries like Canada, China, and Mexico, cannot currently stand.\n\nThat raises a lot of questions. Will the Trump administration seek to impose these tariffs through other means, avoiding the IEEPA altogether? Will companies that have paid tariffs already get their money back? And, perhaps most pressing to the average consumer, will prices for common goods, like tech, finally come down?\n\nThere's no clear answer to this one, since there's really no precedent here. Trump is the first president to use the IEEPA as a reasoning to enact tariffs, and, as such, this is an enormous flip-flop that doesn't have a previous framework to look back to.\n\nThe reason tariffs are inflationary, or raise prices on goods, is because they make it more expensive for U.S. companies to import foreign goods. People can confuse this point: Tariffs place a tax on the importer of a good, not necessarily the manufacturer of that good. When a company exports its products to the U.S. with a tariff in place, it does not directly pay the tariff: The company that imports those products pays. As a result, importers raise their prices to compensate. Look at Nintendo: The company raised its original MSRPs for Switch 2 accessories like the Pro Controller and Joy-Con 2, as well as the original Switch, in the wake of tariffs. As these products cost more to import to the U.S., prices go up to give the company a cushion. It could've been worse, too, since Nintendo didn't raise the price of the Switch 2 or its games—though there's no telling whether those MSRPs were set with tariffs in mind, too.\n\nAs such, you might expect that if these tariffs disappear, these prices will come down. If Nintendo felt the need to raise Pro Controller prices by $15 in response to tariffs, it might reverse course now that Trump's tax is no longer placing a burden on U.S. importers. While anything's possible, I don't think it's very likely. For many goods, prices can rise quickly, especially with factors like tariffs, but can take a long time to fall—if at all. Some economists think that ending tariffs would cause prices to rise slower, but not stop: a disinflationary effect, rather than deflationary.\n\nWe the consumer may be to blame. If companies raise prices in response to tariffs, and consumers continue to buy those products regardless, it shows that the market supports those prices. The consumer doesn't necessarily see the impact of the tariff going away, so why lower prices? It's only in that company's best interest anyway, since they'll sell goods at higher prices without paying the tariff tax. If the company was struggling to sell inflated goods, perhaps prices will come down: If Nintendo is selling far fewer Switch units following its tariff increases, maybe it'll cut the price back down to encourage sales. But it's truly difficult to say without being on the inside.\n\nThen, of course, there are the forces at play that push prices north besides tariffs. Computer components come to mind, particularly RAM. These components are becoming more expensive—and harder to find—not necessarily because of tariffs, but because AI companies are scooping them up for data processing. All of a sudden, everything that runs on these components is at risk of rising in price, since one section of the market has such a high demand. It doesn't matter if RAM is cheaper to import next month after tariffs are gone, if there's no RAM left to buy.\n\nThat means your gaming consoles, laptops, smart displays, cars—anything that runs on RAM, GPUs, and CPUs—could rise in price, unless more components can be made to meet demand. SCOTUS might've taken the burden of tariffs away from these imports, but it might not bring prices down, or, worse yet, do anything to stop them skyrocketing. Micron, the only American-based producer of RAM, didn't think memory shortages would end this year, even ahead of the tariff news. The company is investing in more facilities to produce components, but that takes time, which means price increases could continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe can speculate all day about how the end of these tariffs will affect prices, but it's just that: speculation. Companies will do what they're going to do with the prices, and there's nothing in the Supreme Court's ruling to tell us whether our iPhones, Switches, or Echos are going to be cheaper later this year or not. Prices could plummet, come down slightly, stay the same, go up slowly, or go up quickly. My best guess is that the average consumer product previously affected by these tariffs will stay about the same price it is now, barring some other major change in the markets—but again, that's just a guess.\n\nAs such, my advice is to make your purchase decisions based on other, more stable factors: Research the products you're interested in to determine which has the best value; compare prices across different stores, both in-person and online; wait for traditional sales events if you're looking for major deals.\n\nThe most concrete risk of price increases right now comes from that computer-component shortage. If you've been in the market for a new computer, or a device that relies heavily on these components (like gaming consoles), it might be a good time to buy. Prices can easily go up, but take a long time to come back down.",

    "fullText": "Narendra Modi’s thirst to supercharge economic growth is matched by US desire to inject AI into world’s biggest democracy\n\nIndia celebrates 80 years of independence from the UK in August 2027. At about that same moment, “early versions of true super intelligence” could emerge, Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, said this week.\n\nIt’s a looming coincidence that raised a charged question at the AI Impact summit in Delhi, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi: can India avoid returning to the status of a vassal state when it imports AI to raise the prospects of its 1.4 billion people?\n\nModi’s hunger to harness AI’s capability is great. He compared it on Thursday to a turning point that resets the direction of civilisation, such as “when the first sparks were struck from stone”. The most common analogy heard among the thousands of visitors to the summit was the dawn of electricity, but Modi was talking about fire.\n\nHis desire to use AI to supercharge Indian economic growth is matched by that of the big US tech companies. OpenAI, Google and Anthropic all played prominent roles at the summit, announcing deals to get ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude AIs into more people’s hands.\n\nThe Trump administration, seeing AI as central to its battle for supremacy with China, was clearing the path for the three AI companies. The US government signed the Pax Silica, a technology agreement that binds India closer to US tech and away from Beijing.\n\nAt the signing, Jacob Helberg, the US under secretary of state for economic affairs, emphasised the threat from China if India should even think about looking elsewhere for its AI. “We have seen the lights of a great Indian city extinguished by a keystroke,” he said, in an apparent reference to a suspected Chinese cyber-attack on Mumbai in 2020.\n\nIndia lacks the semiconductors, power plants and vast gigawatt datacentres to go it alone. In common with most other countries, it faces a choice between US and Chinese AI models. Which they choose could have profound consequences for who controls India’s future, because if AI’s power emerges as predicted, it will not only tweak economic and social structures, but become their new bedrock.\n\nStuart Russell, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, who closely follows India’s progress, said: “If we get to AGI [artificial general intelligence], AI is going to be producing 80% of the global economy. All manufacturing, most agriculture, all services will be just done; managed by AI, produced by AI.”\n\nImagine, he said, an Indian village priced out of having a health centre. In the future, AI could design the hospital and “along comes a bunch of giant quad copters carrying the materials, and a bunch of robots come and assemble everything. Two weeks later, you’ve got a hospital.”\n\nIn this scenario, technology becomes integral to a country’s wellbeing. Elements of sovereignty can be fought over, but how successful that will be remains to be seen. AI’s power is such that its controller gains enormous leverage.\n\nAnthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, told the summit: “It may sound absurd, but AI can even help India achieve a standout 25% economic growth.” If that were to happen, it would take India to a per-capita GDP in a decade that is equivalent to Greece today. How could a leader resist?\n\nModi’s tech secretary, Shri Krishnan, said India realised it must ally with like-minded countries to ensure it did not become “enslaved”. It is a high-stakes decision.\n\nIndia appears unlikely to turn to China, for now. It has the AI models, but there are tensions on the Himalayan border, and Chinese companies and leaders were scarce at the summit.\n\nWill India thrive with US AI? Silicon Valley companies talk of cooperation not control. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global policy, said: “We don’t see India as a customer, we see it as a strategic partner.”\n\nUS officials framed the deal with India as an alliance of two nations that “broke centuries of colonial rule”, and as “two great democracies saying we will build together”.\n\nThe Guardian asked Michael Kratsios, Donald Trump’s science and technology adviser, if India risked being controlled by the US under a form of digital colonialism.\n\n“I would say it is actually the opposite,” he said. “Any country that builds on top of the American AI stack will have the most open, independently controlled, secured stack the world has to offer. And that is why we are soon keen to share it with so many countries that are prioritising their AI sovereignty.”\n\nRussell sees another possibility. “I think the American companies want to get in at that high-school and middle-school level to create basically a bunch of AI addicts who can’t tie their shoelaces without the help of AI,” he said. “Silicon Valley has always been about eyeballs. You monetise later and it works. Google and Facebook generate vast amounts of money.”\n\nCould India build its own AI? It is investing billions in datacentres and semiconductor capacity, but it takes years to come online.\n\nAltman was asked on Thursday how Indian entrepreneurs could build their own AI and his response was blunt. “Look, the way this works is we’re going to tell you it’s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation and you shouldn’t even try, and it’s your job to try anyway and I believe both of those things.”\n\nIndia can press US tech companies to adapt their AIs to its kaleidoscope of languages and cultures, and attempt to insist on guardrails. There is much at stake. As the summit came to a close, Joanna Shields, a former Facebook and Google executive and a UK minister for internet safety, warned: “If we have a world where we are accepting models from just the global north, we will lose so much of our cultural diversity, our uniqueness as people, wherever we come from … We don’t want to develop a monoculture based on a handful of models that everybody uses around the world and we lose that richness of who we are, what makes us human.”",

    "fullText": "Matthew Ramirez started at Western Governors University as a computer science major in 2025, drawn by the promise of a high-paying, flexible career as a programmer. But as headlines mounted about tech layoffs and AI’s potential to replace entry-level coders, he began to question whether that path would actually lead to a job.\n\nWhen the 20-year-old interviewed for a datacenter technician role that June and never heard back, his doubts deepened. In December, Ramirez decided on what he thought was a safer bet: turning away from computer science entirely. He dropped his planned major to instead apply to nursing school. He comes from a family of nurses, and sees the field as more stable and harder to automate than coding.\n\n“Even though AI might not be at the point where it will overtake all these entry-level jobs now, by the time I graduate, it likely will,” Ramirez said.\n\nRamirez is not alone in reshaping his career out of anxiety over AI. As students like him are reconsidering their majors over concerns that AI may disrupt their employment prospects, more established workers – some with decades of experience – are rethinking their trajectories because they’re encountering AI at work and share the same unease. Some workers are eschewing it entirely; others are embracing it.\n\nIt’s not clear when AI will become advanced enough to replace certain white-collar workers and just how many jobs it will be capable of taking over. But jitters around its potential impact are already pushing people to change course, reshaping the labor market before automation fully arrives.\n\nWhat is clear is why workers are feeling on edge. The World Economic Forum projects that AI could displace 92m roles worldwide by 2030, including many white-collar positions. In the US, employers cited AI as a factor in nearly 55,000 job cuts in 2025, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a consulting firm, as job seekers navigate a tougher market.\n\nWhile AI is still just one factor among many that are leading to layoffs, ADP, the largest payroll company in the US, found that professional and business services roles, alongside information services jobs in media, telecom and IT, collectively lost 41,000 jobs in December 2025. In that same month, employment grew in healthcare, education and hospitality, per the firm’s data.\n\nMany of those white-collar roles involve writing, data analysis and coding – tasks generative AI tools can increasingly perform. Hands-on, people-facing work remains less exposed.\n\nJobs that emphasize interpersonal and hands-on skills are increasingly appealing to young people who are wary of automation, according to Dr Jasmine Escalera, a career development expert at Zety, a professional development platform.\n\nShe pointed to research showing that 43% of gen Z workers who are anxious about AI are moving away from entry-level corporate and administrative roles and toward careers that rely on what she calls “human skills”, including creativity, interpersonal connection and hands-on expertise.\n\nIn that same report, 53% of young respondents said they were seriously considering blue-collar or skilled trade work. Escalera said it was a move that workers were making to reduce their exposure to AI and one that the Wall Street Journal, the paper of record of white-collar work, had recently urged its readers to consider.\n\nBut the pivot may come with sacrifices. Many of the white-collar roles that workers worry could be automated – from software development to financial analysis – are paid median salaries well above $75,000 a year, with developers raking in about $133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Blue-collar jobs pay less. Many skilled trades, like electricians and plumbers, receive closer to $60,000 a year. These types of jobs also often require in-person work, physical labor and less predictable schedules – all trade-offs workers may accept in their attempts to future-proof their careers.\n\nFor some job seekers, any mention of AI is a red flag in job listings, so they’re skipping them entirely.\n\nAfter getting laid off last January, Roman Callaghan, 30, spent nine months hunting for his next job. As a medical coder at a medication access firm for four years, Callaghan handled administrative tasks like calling insurance providers and entering medical data. After his employer started rolling out AI across the company to streamline workflows, he wondered whether the move would one day affect his job. When he was laid off two years later, he suspected his fears had come true, though his employer didn’t specifically cite AI as a reason.\n\nWhen he looked for new work, he avoided any roles that mentioned phrases like “integrating AI”, “AI-first” or “developing AI” in job descriptions. Callaghan wanted a new job, but his AI anxiety steered him away from roles that now felt short-term to him. He just didn’t want to risk being laid off again because a future employer would eventually use AI to cull its ranks.\n\nIn the past nine months, he said, he applied to at least 100 jobs across data entry, medical coding, call centers and paralegal work, while deliberately skipping 30 to 40 postings that referenced AI. While he searched, he took odd gigs to make ends meet, first at a local fish store and later at a call center. He stayed there until mid-October, when he landed a data entry job.\n\nAvoiding AI-centric jobs “felt like it narrowed the amount of companies I could work for”, Callaghan said. “Even though my options were limited, sticking to my convictions felt worth it.”\n\n​​Recruiters say that kind of avoidance is becoming more common. Marshall Scabet, the CEO of Precision Sales Recruiting, which helps manufacturers hire sales professionals, said that roughly a quarter of sales candidates he spoke with over the past six months were trying to pivot away from software-as-a-service (SaaS) jobs.\n\nMany clients told him they worried their tech sales roles could be replaced by AI, Scabet said, and believed selling industrial equipment was safer from automation. Doing so, he said, requires building human relationships with vendors.\n\n“In their opinion, there was less likelihood of that job being taken by AI,” Scabet said. “AI isn’t just going to walk into a factory and give a pitch about a machine.”\n\nFor more experienced workers, their encounters with AI in the workplace are pushing them to reconsider entire industries or build new skill sets.\n\nLiam Robinson, a 45-year-old animation artist, says he is actively avoiding jobs in the mobile gaming industry he has worked in for more than a decade. In his last role as an art director, his employer encouraged staff to use generative AI to speed up production. Robinson, who refused to use AI in his own work, said he watched the quality of animation suffer around him as his colleagues began relying on the tech.\n\nLast September, after disclosing in a self-evaluation survey that he wasn’t using AI, Robinson was laid off. It left him disillusioned with the direction of the industry. He believes AI flattens creativity, erodes craftsmanship and hurts the environment, fueling his resistance to work for companies building or deploying it.\n\nHe is not actively applying for new roles and instead is focused on creating webtoon comics. But if money runs dry, he said, he would take on other work, from driving for Uber to trash disposal. “As long as I’m useful and making a little money, that’s enough,” Robinson said.\n\nAs professionals like Robinson confront the possibility that skills they spent years mastering are no longer highly valued, many are redefining what stability looks like, according to Arianny Mercedes, founder of the career strategy firm Revamped.\n\nRather than chasing prestige or high salaries, Mercedes said her job-seeking clients increasingly prioritize roles tied to regulated or essential parts of an organization, such as healthcare administration, education or compliance.\n\n“The objective isn’t to avoid AI,” Mercedes said. “It’s to be in roles where AI changes the tools of work without undermining authority or decision-making.”\n\nFor others, the safest response to AI is to lean into it.\n\nAfter designing and developing websites for four years, Dmitry Zozulya decided to leave his work behind. As AI tools have proliferated and make it possible to code and create branding at a fraction of what it used to cost, the 29-year-old found it increasingly difficult to sell website and landing page work.\n\nInstead, Zozulya began offering AI-driven automation services, helping businesses streamline workflows. He now runs a small consultancy while building personal projects to deepen his experience.\n\n“I believe it’s very important to adapt,” Zozulya said. “Even when it’s uncomfortable.”\n\nWhether the rise of AI is steering workers away from entire industries or just certain roles, it is disrupting many people’s calculus for what their future at work will look like – and it’s happening abruptly.\n\nFor Ramirez, that recalculation began before he had even entered the workforce. He believes switching from computer science to nursing means he’ll find work after graduation, even if it means letting go of the future he once imagined.\n\n“When you throw AI into the picture, the likelihood of healthcare jobs disappearing is slim as of right now,” Ramirez said. “I can’t speak for the future, but in the next few years, they’re still going to be there.”",

    "fullText": "Good news, connoisseurs — your judgment may be highly prized in the AI age.\n\nA debate about the importance of \"taste\" has seemed inescapable on X in recent days, prompting bold declarations, a fair share of eye-rolling, and, yes, plenty of memes.\n\nBut there might be some truth to the idea.\n\nThe most recent wave of taste discourse began when Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham — who coined \"founder mode\" — posted a prediction on Saturday.\n\n\"When anyone can make anything, the big differentiator is what you choose to make,\" Graham wrote on X.\n\nThis wasn't Graham's first time writing about the importance of taste; in his post over the weekend, he linked to an old essay of his from 2002, titled \"Taste for Makers,\" and he also wrote about the topic again in 2021.\n\nThen, OpenAI's president weighed in.\n\nOpenAI president Greg Brockman went even stronger, declaring, \"Taste is a new core skill.\"\n\nA variety of leaders across Silicon Valley also came out in support of the benefits of cultivating taste. As engineers grow into managing more agents and making more decisions, having strong judgment skills (or \"taste,\" as they'd call it) could be crucial.\n\nCloudflare CTO Dane Knecht agreed with Graham and linked back to an earlier post he'd written in January that stated, \"In 2026, taste is the engineering differentiator.\"\n\nEngineers across the industry chimed in. \"The AI will make anything but it takes human taste to decide if it's worth keeping,\" one Google software engineer wrote.\n\nWhat even is taste? The term is slippery.\n\n\"The taste thing works because it's nebulous, unassailable, and it feeds the ego,\" Poggio cofounder Matt Slotnick wrote on X, weighing in on the discourse.\n\nGraham gave one glimpse, writing that it was about \"being honest with yourself\" and moving beyond the mindset of \"I like what I like.\"\n\nNot everyone agreed that taste would become a future-proof skill of the future. Linear head of product Nan Yu wrote that \"you probably don't have better taste than AI.\"\n\n\"There are plenty of other distinctly human things that we can contribute, but 'having better taste' isn't one of them,\" he wrote.\n\nMatt Schumer, the author of the viral \"Something Big is Happening\" essay on AI, agreed.\n\n\"There's a good chance AI will have better ideas than us within a few years,\" he wrote. \"I don't see why \"taste\" and direction are uniquely human, like many people say. If an AI can train on it, it can learn it.\"\n\nThere's another high-profile figure who championed taste (and basically built his career around it): Def Jam cofounder Rick Rubin.\n\nThere's an interview making the rounds of Rubin, in which he says he has \"no technical ability\" when it comes to music. Anderson Cooper asks what he's being paid for. Rubin responds: \"The confidence that I have in my taste.\"\n\nIs that what software engineers will soon look like? Several meme accounts on X seem to think so, commenting photos of Rubin's bearded face on Brockman's post.\n\nSoftware engineers in 2030 be like pic.twitter.com/Vmfx8Qydzg\n\nIt also begs the question: Do engineers even have good taste to begin with? The answer depends on who you ask — and how you define taste.\n\nGeneral Catalyst creative director Reggie James wrote that techies would be \"ruffled\" when they learn they're not the top of the taste pyramid.\n\nStripe alum Sam Gerstenzan wrote that taste was \"so rare\" in Silicon Valley that, if asked to name the five people with the best taste, everyone would name the same people.\n\nits almost like these tech guys understand that they dont have good taste so they are trying to turn it into this quantifiable set of data points instead of this mysterious, ineffable quality derived from going out and engaging with culture!\n\nThe irony, of course, is that tech bros aren't known to have the best taste in one specific arena: style.\n\nThe same people prizing taste are wearing backpacks to the bar, Very AI growth head Abril Zucchi wrote. Another user shared a \"Person in tech that has 'taste' starter pack.\"\n\nPerson in tech that has “taste” starter pack https://t.co/jQw0PYESAM pic.twitter.com/4gPjDWAZOB\n\nThe sneaker brand Allbirds was a popular punching bag.\n\n\"'Taste is the new core skill' says men who kept Allbirds afloat,\" Vercel CMO Keith Messick wrote.\n\n“in the ai era, taste is the new core skill” pic.twitter.com/1vsvJZmnK8\n\nGraham responded to one of the memes, which showed \"taste\" as a polo and cargo shorts.\n\n\"Taste in clothing isn't important,\" he wrote. \"If your goal is to think well, clothing should just be as comfortable as possible.\"\n\nRick Rubin — famous for his disheveled, DGAF appearance — would likely agree.",

    "title": "PwC engineers built an AI agent to tackle the corporate world's least sexy task: spreadsheets",
    "description": "When tech exec Matt Wood arrived at PwC, he found that massive spreadsheets were \"all anybody was working on.\"",
    "fullText": "The real way to judge a company's AI expertise isn't in the flashy headlines, but by looking at the \"unsexy\" work rolling out behind the scenes, Matt Wood, PwC's global and US commercial technology and innovation officer, told Business Insider.\n\nIf Wood's theory holds — that real AI prowess shows up in unglamorous advances — PwC's latest launch is certainly notable. After all, what could be less sexy than spreadsheets?\n\nThe Big Four firm announced this week that it has developed a \"frontier AI agent\" capable of reasoning over vast, enterprise-grade spreadsheets — something that conventional AI systems struggle with because of their complexity, size, and interdependencies.\n\nThe agent can understand and navigate spreadsheets, mimicking \"how experienced practitioners work: scanning, searching, jumping across tabs, integrating charts and receipts, and reasoning,\" PwC said in a press release.\n\nWood, who joined PwC in 2024 from a role as vice president of AI at Amazon Web Services, said that when he started, he'd noticed the wraparound, ultra-wide monitors filled with spreadsheets: \"That's all anybody was working on,\" he said.\n\nBut these were not \"your school soccer team budget spreadsheet,\" said Wood. The spreadsheets that power large enterprises are enormously complex, often containing millions of cells, charts, graphs, images, receipts, and dozens of interlinked workbooks. \"They are more like financial engines than they are spreadsheets,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThese files often underpin business-critical decisions, yet PwC \"found that even today's modern AI was very poorly suited to managing these big enterprise spreadsheets,\" Wood said.\n\n\"They just kind of shrug and give up for want of a better word.\"\n\nCreating an AI capable of understanding and reasoning across large, complicated spreadsheet applications is what PwC's engineers set out to solve. Their solution was a \"genuine advance in the field,\" Wood said.\n\nThe agent has unlocked use cases across assurance, advisory, and tax, and boosts time saving on some tasks \"from literally days to hours,\" said Wood.\n\nHe gave the example of audit walkthroughs, where teams previously spent weeks manually gathering and validating evidence across numerous complex spreadsheets that existing AI tools couldn't handle.\n\nNow, users simply upload the files, and the frontier agent automatically maps their structure, extracts relevant data, and performs validation and consistency checks — tasks that would otherwise require combing through millions of rows by hand.\n\nThe result is faster meetings, less back-and-forth with clients, and cleaner, structured data ready for deeper AI-driven analysis, he said.\n\nPwC's AI spreadsheet agent was built in-house by engineers — a function the firm has been rapidly expanding as it shifts beyond the traditional roles associated with the Big Four.\n\nIn January, PwC launched a dedicated tech engineering career track to attract more technical talent, saying it wants to become \"a destination for top engineering talent.\"\n\nPreviously, the firm offered only consulting and accounting career paths. Wood told Business Insider that adding the engineering track is \"a signpost\" of its future plans.\n\nAt the same time, PwC is retraining non-technical employees. The US branch of the firm recently announced a companywide workplace learning strategy focused on knowledge sharing and on developing a mix of human and AI skills needed for the future.\n\nWood described the work engineers do at PwC as having two modes: \"transforming today\" and \"building for tomorrow.\"\n\nThe first focuses on improving current workflows — reducing back-and-forth with clients, increasing trust, and delivering work more efficiently. The second reimagines professional services from scratch: \"If you were to start from a blank piece of paper, what would professional services look like in an AI agent world?\" said Wood.\n\nPwC engineers also work directly on client engagements, building AI systems tailored to specific projects. For example, they help organizations reorganize and redesign their finance functions from the ground up using agents, Wood said.\n\nMany of the consulting industry's top players are pursuing similar investments in technical talent as AI reshapes the work they do.\n\nAccenture, already one of consulting's most technically sophisticated players, has added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global headcount.\n\nEY, another Big Four firm, has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday invited leaders of some of the top artificial intelligence companies to gather on stage as part of a commitment to build more “inclusive and multilingual” AI around the world.\n\nAnd they did. But what caught some of the audience's attention, and later went viral on social media, was an awkward interaction between two rival tech leaders: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.\n\nModi, host of the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, clasped hands with those closest to him — Altman to his left and Google CEO Sundar Pichai to his right — and beckoned all 13 tech leaders to lift their hands up in a chain, like theater actors at the end of a show.\n\nEveryone was holding hands except for Altman and Amodei, who stood next to each other but for several seconds awkwardly avoided hand contact. Both eventually put up their fists instead.\n\nThe interaction quickly became a visual symbol of the deep rivalries in the AI industry, particularly between OpenAI and Anthropic, though Altman sought to brush off any deeper meaning.\n\n“I didn't know what was happening,” Altman later said in a video interview with Indian media outlet Moneycontrol. He said he was “confused, like when (Modi) grabbed my hand and put it up, and I just wasn’t sure what we were supposed to be doing.”\n\nThe two AI developers have a history, one that predates the creation of OpenAI's hit product, ChatGPT, and Anthropic's competing chatbot Claude.\n\nAmodei worked at OpenAI before he and a group that included his sister, Daniela Amodei, quit to form Anthropic in 2021. The newer company promised a clearer focus on the safety of the better-than-human technology called artificial general intelligence that both San Francisco firms aim to build.\n\nOpenAI first released ChatGPT in late 2022, revealing the huge commercial potential of AI large language models that could help write emails and computer code and answer questions. Anthropic followed with its first version of Claude in 2023.\n\nTheir different approaches spilled over into public debate earlier this month in the United States when Anthropic aired TV commercials during the Super Bowl that ridiculed OpenAI for the digital advertising it’s beginning to place in free and cheaper versions of ChatGPT.\n\nWhile Anthropic has centered its revenue model on selling Claude to other businesses, OpenAI has opened the doors to ads as a way of making money from the hundreds of millions of consumers who get ChatGPT for free. Altman took to social media to criticize the TV commercials as dishonest.\n\nO'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.",

    "fullText": "As debate continues over AI’s true impact on the labor force, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said some companies are engaging in “AI washing” when it comes to layoffs, or falsely attributing workforce reductions to the technology’s impact.\n\n“I don’t know what the exact percentage is, but there’s some AI washing where people are blaming AI for layoffs that they would otherwise do, and then there’s some real displacement by AI of different kinds of jobs,” Altman told CNBC-TV18 at the India AI Impact Summit on Thursday.\n\nAI washing has gained traction as emerging data on the tech’s impact on the labor market tells a muddied, inconclusive story about how the technology is destroying human jobs—or if it has yet to touch them.\n\nA study published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, found that of thousands of surveyed C-suite executives across the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Australia, nearly 90% said AI had no impact on workplace employment over the past three years following the late-2022 release of ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, prominent tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have warned of a white-collar bloodbath, with AI potentially wiping out 50% of entry-level office jobs. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski suggested this week the buy-now, pay-later firm would reduce its 3,000-person workforce by one-third by 2030 in part because of the acceleration of AI. Around 40% of employers expect to follow Siemiatkowski’s lead in culling staff down the line as a result of AI, according to the 2025 World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report.\n\nAltman clarified he anticipates more job displacement as a result of AI, as well as the emergence of new roles complementing the technology.\n\n“We’ll find new kinds of jobs, as we do with every tech revolution,” he said. “But I would expect that the real impact of AI doing jobs in the next few years will begin to be palpable.”\n\nData from a recent Yale Budget Lab report suggests Altman and Amodei’s vision of mass worker displacement from AI is not certain and is not yet here. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Population Survey, the research found no significant differences in the rate of change of occupations mix or length of unemployment for individuals with jobs that have high exposure to AI from the release of ChatGPT through November 2025. The numbers suggested no significant AI-related labor changes at this juncture.\n\n“No matter which way you look at the data, at this exact moment, it just doesn’t seem like there’s major macroeconomic effects here,” Martha Gimbel, executive director and cofounder of the Yale Budget Lab, told Fortune earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "In 2026, it’s a scary time to work for a living.\n\nGone are the days of quiet quitting, the Great Resignation, and the highly visible union-organizing battles that began the decade and signaled that perhaps worker power was on the rise again in the US. Instead, much of that momentum is being crowded out of our minds by anxieties: a worsening affordability crisis, geopolitical instability, and the specter of artificial intelligence looming over the workplace.\n\nFor the tech CEOs leading the AI race and enriching themselves as they jostle for dominance, AI isn’t a phantasm at all, but a glimmering unicorn. When they predict AI is just months away from being able to do everything a software engineer does, or that it will one day take over CEOs’ jobs, their excitement for the future is palpable. For the rest of us, it’s hard to feel confident in their offhand remarks about how “some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs will be created”. A 2025 Pew survey found that “64% of the public thinks AI will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”, which is probably why only 17% of Americans say AI will have a positive effect on the US over the same time period.\n\nUncertain times like these call for scrutiny. Throughout 2026, the Guardian will publish Reworked, a reporting series that centers the human stakes as AI disrupts our workplaces, in ways both thrilling and alarming. Like this essay, the stories in this series will focus on workers’ real-world power and plights as well as the realities and exaggerations of the hype surrounding AI’s transformative possibilities.\n\nSo which version of the future of work awaits us? It is yet to be settled, which means there is still time to shift course.\n\nBlue-collar workers who have long grappled with algorithmic surveillance and optimization at work are now worrying that technological advancements will only make their jobs more dehumanizing. “[For] lower wage workers, there is concern about being replaced by robots. But on the other hand, there’s a lot of concern about being turned into robots,” Lisa Kresge, a senior researcher at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, told me.\n\nAnd white-collar workers are now wondering if their work will begin to resemble blue-collar labor – either because they will be similarly tracked and managed, or because they will need to switch to more manual work that’s resistant to being taken over by AI.\n\nIt may seem that workers haven’t been this vulnerable in a long time. In some ways, that’s true. But this is also a pivotal moment, one in which something unexpected is happening: society’s collective anxiety over AI is catalyzing workers to push back.\n\n“It is creating an opportunity,” Sarita Gupta, the Ford Foundation’s Vice President of US Programs and co-author of The Future We Need: Organizing for a Better Democracy in the Twenty-First Century, told me. “When you have a young Silicon Valley software engineer realize that their performance is tracked or undermined by the same logic as a working class warehouse picker, class divisions dissolve, and larger working-class movements for dignity are possible. That is what we’re starting to see.”\n\nPeople across industries and income brackets are anxious and frustrated, quite like they were when the Covid pandemic placed punishing demands on frontline workers and erased the boundaries between work and life for everyone else. Those struggles prompted power shifts: At the same time that workers led unionization efforts at Amazon warehouses and Starbucks locations around the US, the Great Resignation saw a record number of employees quit their jobs, and the ones who remained in the workforce began negotiating for and gaining better pay and conditions.\n\n“It was not a pretty time for a lot of workers. And so part of the resurgence of labor organizing from that period of time was in response to a lot of fears,” Kresge said.\n\nShe also sees the rise of AI as an opening for the labor movement to regain some of the power it’s lost after decades of attacks from employers. “I’m hopeful about the opportunity for technology to lift up some of the issues that have been under way in our economy for decades … in terms of how workers are treated and how we are distributing the rewards of productivity.”\n\nConditions for workers have been rough for a long while now. “Over time, unions have lost collective bargaining power, and a lot of that is due to the lack of laws that we need and enforcement of laws,” Gupta said. “For four decades, productivity soared while wages stayed flat, and unionization hit historic lows.” In 2025, only 9.9% of US workers were union members – the same percentage as 2024, but still the lowest numbers in almost 40 years.\n\nToday, the advent of AI is drawing the world’s attention to the extreme imbalance of power between employers and their employees – and people are getting worked up. Even if the outcomes are still undetermined, that’s a glimmer of possibility in bleak times.\n\nAI is still a nascent technology. Many of the predictions about what it will be capable of and how it will transform labor and the economy are just that – predictions. The question of worker power in the age of AI hasn’t been decided yet, even if billionaire CEOs with a vested interest in the unregulated dominance of AI keep implying that it has.\n\n“There is a concerted effort among many tech leaders to basically create mystification around AI as a tactic, to a large extent, to disempower workers, policymakers, and anyone who might be critical of the growing concentration of funding and resources in our society toward this goal,” Kresge told me.\n\nIn other words, take what these billionaires say with a grain of salt. The rise of AI is already transforming society, the economy, and our relationship to work, but a lot of these shifts are anticipatory, based on our belief in the potential of a technology that’s still being built.\n\n“We have to always remind ourselves that the direction of technology is a choice, right? We can use AI to build a surveillance economy that squeezes every drop of value out of a worker, or we can use it to build an era of shared prosperity,” Gupta said. “We know if technology were designed and deployed and governed by the people doing the work, AI wouldn’t be such a threat.”",

    "fullText": "In Wednesday’s ACC Action, Virginia clocked Georgia Tech, 94-68, and Wake Forest surprised Clemson, 85-77.\n\nWake Forest basically dominated the entire game. A week or two ago, who would have expected that?\n\nWell, here’s something you may have missed – Clemson has lost three straight, to Virginia Tech, Duke and now Wake Forest. And all three losses were by double figures. Prior to this, the Tigers were 13-1 in their last 14 games. Brad Brownell has work to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Wake Forest, despite not really having anyone inside to speak of, is catching fire late. Too late, probably, but it’s still impressive that the Deacs have won three straight.\n\nSteve Forbes has continued to tinker with his lineup. In this one, he went with Tre’Von Spillers, Cooper Schwieger and Sebastian Akins up front and Juke Harris and Myles Colvin the backcourt. Harris led the way with 20 points.\n\nJake Wahlin paced the Tigers with 17.\n\nAs for Virginia, remember that scene in Braveheart when Longshanks realizes that if Wallace can take York, he can get the rest of England?\n\nVirginia shot up 39-9 in the first half. Obviously, the game was over at that point. Georgia Tech gave up 59 points in the first half, en route to losing their eighth straight game.\n\nThe question isn’t really how bad it was. The question is the fallout. NC State got nuked at Louisville two games ago but bounced back nicely against UNC and is still on target for a tournament bid. Meanwhile, Georgia Tech is on target to miss the ACC Tournament, since the bottom three teams won’t go anymore.\n\nHowever, it could still escape this fate as BC and Pitt also have just two ACC wins. We’ll see.\n\nThe other question is this: was it because the Yellow Jackets are really bad or because Virginia is really good?\n\nVirginia has certainly been winning and has won eight straight road games, which is tremendous. However, the Wahoos beat SMU by 4, lost to UNC by 5, nipped Notre Dame by 3, BC by 13, FSU by 3 and Ohio State by 4. We’re tentatively going with the Yellow Jackets being that bad.\n\nOver at WRAL, Pat Welter and Chris Lea discuss Hubert Davis’s UNC and reach the same conclusion we’ve discussed from time to time: Davis has no idea how to communicate with his team.\n\nThat doesn’t mean they won’t win games of course, but it does go a long way to explaining why guys who transfer from UNC do so well at their new schools. Consider Michigan’s Elliott Cadeau, Minnesota’s Cade Tyson and Vanderbilt’s Tyler Nickel for a few quick examples. Consider also that Caleb Love became a consistent and reliable presence at Arizona in his final two years.\n\nRecap: Big First Half Fuels Wake Past Clemson 85-77\n\nWake Forest answers questions about toughness against Clemson 85-77\n\nClemson Jr. Forward Jake Wahlin postgame following loss to Wake Forest\n\nClemson Tigers Fall Behind Early Again, Lose Third Straight Game to Wake Forest\n\nWake Forest remains hot, extends Clemson’s slide\n\nVirginia overwhelms Georgia Tech with historic first half\n\nAnother bad start sends Georgia Tech to eighth straight loss\n\nUVA Basketball: ‘Hoos dominant in 94-68 blowout win at Georgia Tech\n\nEvaluating UVA basketball’s resumé after 26-point win at Georgia Tech\n\nGo to the DBR Boards to find Blue Healer Auctions | Drop us a line",

    "description": "OpenAI and Meta alum Philip Su said that AI was turning software engineers into managers. The IC role is \"dead,\" he wrote.",
    "fullText": "Use AI at work? You might be a manager and not even know it.\n\nPhilip Su is on the frontline of AI. He worked at OpenAI until 2025, when he left to found his startup, Superphonic. Before that, he worked at Microsoft and Meta.\n\nIn January, Su made a provocative claim on Substack: \"AI Killed the Individual Contributor.\"\n\nSu wrote that software engineers are asked to perform tasks once reserved for managers: set priorities, resolve conflicts, and give feedback. Rather than building, they're spending time \"pondering and tweaking the machine that builds the thing.\"\n\n\"The halcyon days of the IC are over,\" Su wrote. \"Not because AI codes better than you, but because maximizing your productivity necessitates focusing your time on all the things that are, at the end of the day, manager tasks.\"\n\nSu doubled down this week on the podcast \"A Life Engineered.\" He said the IC role was \"probably over\" because engineers were delegating their work to AI.\n\nIf everyone's a manager (of AI), do we need managers (of humans) anymore? Su said yes. There's a \"human coordination problem\" that AI cannot solve, he said.\n\nSu's theory of managerial takeover comes amid the \"great flattening\" in Big Tech. Flat org charts are all the rage: few managers, many ICs. Elon Musk's companies are known for their lack of managers; Amazon and Meta have recently culled management layers as they aim to increase their IC-to-manager ratios.\n\nMeanwhile, tech CEOs are also embracing \"founder mode.\" The reviled opposite of that, according to Paul Graham's 2024 essay, is \"manager mode.\"\n\nBut maybe managers are back en vogue — so long as they're managing AI agents. Vercel COO Jeanne DeWitt Grosser told Business Insider that companies will see a new role: the \"agent manager.\"\n\nThe tools will get better, too. Su already finds that he has to review AI-written code \"less carefully\" than he used to.\n\n\"It might currently feel like managing a team of barely-competent interns,\" he wrote in his essay. \"It'll soon feel like managing a team of very high performers, each better, faster, and smarter than you.\"",

    "title": "The biggest names in AI are gathering for a summit in India. Here are 5 of the biggest takeaways.",
    "description": "From Sam Altman to Demis Hassabis, AI leaders gathered in India to speak about the future of the technology.",
    "fullText": "AI's biggest power players showed up in India on Thursday.\n\nOpenAI's Sam Altman, Anthropic's Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Scale AI's Alexandr Wang, and Mistral's Arthur Mensch spoke in succession at the AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi.\n\nFrom a potential \"AI divide\" to calls for stronger global coordination, here are five of the biggest takeaways from the summit so far.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said the world must not let the digital divide \"become an AI divide.\" He said expanding access to compute infrastructure, connectivity, and training is essential as AI reshapes economies.\n\nPichai said AI represents \"the biggest platform shift of our lifetimes\" and could drive \"hyper progress\" across science, healthcare, and economic development. But its benefits are neither \"guaranteed nor automatic.\"\n\n\"We must be equally bold in tackling problems in regions that have lacked access to technology,\" Pichai said. \"We cannot allow the digital divide to become an AI divide. That means investing in compute infrastructure and connectivity.\"\n\nGovernments must act both as regulators and innovators to ensure AI improves public services and broadens opportunity, he added.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that while AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, there's a gap between those capabilities and real-world impact.\n\n\"There is this duality between the fundamental capabilities of the technology and the time that it takes for those capabilities to diffuse into the world,\" he said.\n\n\"There are just frictions to adopt things through enterprises, and I think even more so in the developing world,\" he added.\n\nThe Google DeepMind CEO said India will be a \"powerhouse for AI\" across the world. He praised summits that bring together scientists, policymakers, and technologists, the latter of whom he said can't be left alone navigating AI.\n\nHassabis said we're in \"one of the most momentous\" times in human history and compared AI to the advent of fire and electricity.\n\n\"It's gonna be something like 10 times the impact of the Industrial Revolution, but happening at 10 times the speed, probably unfolding in a matter of a decade rather than a century,\" he said.\n\nGiven this level of impact, he said we need to use a scientific approach to understand AI's capabilities and build guardrails so that the technology \"serves the purposes that we want.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said rapid advances in AI could require new global governance mechanisms, something akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\"In particular, we expect the world may need something like the IAEA for international coordination of AI,\" Altman said, adding that such a body would need \"the ability to rapidly respond to change in circumstances.\"\n\nAltman said AI's trajectory could create risks that no single company or country can manage alone.\n\n\"We need a society-wide approach about how we're going to defend against this,\" he said, referring to the possibility of highly capable \"bio models\" becoming available.\n\nLong-term AI development is a responsibility to future generations, Altman also said, adding that it is a \"moral imperative\" to ensure future generations can benefit from and build upon technological progress.\n\nMeta's former chief scientist said we're still missing something \"big\" in AI.\n\n\"Why do we have systems that can pass the bar exam and win mathematics olympiads? But we don't have domestic robots. We don't even have self-driving cars,\" LeCun said. \"We certainly do not have several cars that can teach themselves to drive in 20 hours of practice like in 17-year-old.\"\n\nHe said that babies and animals have a much better understanding of the physical world around them than any AI systems today, which is why we don't have \"smart robots\" yet.\n\nHe said what is needed is world models — \"mental models of the world that allow us to think ahead, apprehend new situations, plan, sequence of actions, reason, and predict the consequences of our actions.\"\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company. His new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said we need to make AI effective for the Global South, and that needs conscious planning.\n\n\"We need to make AI as effective in every language as it is in English, and today, it is not,\" he said. \"Performance tests show that's the case.\"\n\n\"One of the good things to come out of this week is new announcements to better data in other languages, to provide better tools and measurement systems for AI that is built in other languages,\" he added.\n\nThe other thing that needs to be done is to work on problems that matter to the Global South. That means focusing on improvements in agriculture for India, and addressing food security in Africa.",

    "description": "Some tech workers are about to get caught \"sleepwalking\" as the culture shifts under their feet.",
    "fullText": "It's a tough time to be just average.\n\nWorkers who are decent at their jobs — but not superstars — are facing a tougher slog in industries like tech, where employers have the upper hand, and AI threatens to automate their roles.\n\nWhat used to be a spectrum of employee performance is hardening into something more binary. Companies are focusing more on two camps: hotshots and underachievers.\n\nThis corporate sorting risks leaving the solid performers who make up the bulk of healthy companies feeling overlooked — and potentially vulnerable, workplace observers told Business Insider.\n\n\"Good-enough, B player is the most dangerous place to be,\" said Jeff Hyman, who has been a recruiter for about 30 years. In part, that's because poor workers don't last long, and midlevel workers might have a false sense of security.\n\n\"They're sleepwalking,\" Hyman said. \"They're spending time polishing their LinkedIn while AI is just starting to, task by task, nibble at their job description.\"\n\nThe split-screen is particularly apparent in tech: Dell is revamping its sales compensation program to boost rewards for its highest performers and trim what goes to those who don't meet their full quota, Business Insider reported this month. In January, Business Insider reported that Meta plans to reward its strongest performers with larger payouts, while Amazon has said it's looking closely at each worker's impact.\n\nIt's an idea long used in marketing — like segmenting a customer base — to reimagine how they manage their workforce, said Richard Smith, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. The thinking goes that leaders should focus on the MVPs who hold \"strategic importance\" for a company in the long term.\n\nLast year, for example, Microsoft gave managers what it described as new and enhanced tools to help them accelerate high performance and \"swiftly address low performance,\" Business Insider reported.\n\nRewarding the stars has \"always been the case, and now it's just more unapologetically so,\" said Alan Stein, a career coach who worked at Facebook, Google, and Salesforce. In part, that's because of a crush of available workers.\n\nWith US companies hiring at one of the lowest rates in over a decade, employers have more leverage and potentially less incentive to invest heavily in developing middle-tier employees, said Smith, who runs the Human Capital Development Lab at Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe tech industry's latest approach, Stein said, marks a departure from what he saw as an \"everybody has potential\" ethos that emerged during the pandemic-era hiring boom.\n\n\"It was a lot of talk,\" said Stein, CEO of Kadima Careers, which offers job seekers coaching on how to get six-figure roles.\n\nIt was little surprise, he said, that Big Tech would ultimately direct a bigger share of payouts to those who get it done — just as pro sports teams reward their standouts.\n\nAt many large organizations, Stein said, about 10% to 20% of employees fall into the \"walks on water camp,\" with a similar share marked as underperformers. The majority sit in the middle — the solid, reliable \"worker bees,\" he said.\n\n\"They can't all be Zuckerberg,\" Stein said, referring to Meta's CEO. \"They need people that get the work done.\"\n\nOne risk for employers that focus heavily on their upper crust is that it can damage morale on the B team and signal to people at other firms — including the rock stars — that a company isn't a great place to work.\n\nBeyond recruiting headaches, a workplace where fear dominates tends to undercut what CEOs often say they want: innovation, creativity, and collaboration.\n\nSmith frames it as a math problem: Is it more valuable to improve the top 5% of your workforce by 20%, or 80% of your workforce by 5%?\n\nFinding ways to create that broad-based improvement creates \"a lot more impact,\" Smith said.\n\nThat risk of middle-child syndrome extends beyond tech to professional services such as law, auditing, engineering, and consulting — all of which are experiencing major shifts, thanks in part to AI, he said.\n\nNot all companies are stepping up efforts to trim their lowest-rated people. After online speculation that it would make a round of performance-based layoffs, Meta told Business Insider this month that it's not planning to cut the bottom 5% of workers this year, as it did in 2025.\n\nThe news isn't necessarily all bad for mid-tier workers either, Stein said. Even in tech, good-enough performers often still receive raises and enviable perks.\n\n\"You still have the free lunch. You still have the equity, and you're still a free agent. You can go somewhere else,\" he said.\n\nHyman, who's CEO of Recruit Rockstars, a recruiting and career management firm, said he advises B players to \"make yourself irreplaceable\" by honing skills AI can't yet do well. That includes showing superior judgment, building relationships with customers, and navigating ambiguity.\n\nIt might also mean learning AI to the point where you can go to your manager and announce that you've created an agent to automate work.\n\n\"That at least buys you time,\" Hyman said.\n\nYet, as soon as AI reaches a tipping point where it can handle a sufficient number of tasks that an average or above-average worker can do, Hyman said, \"that B player is in trouble.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Apple's small but mighty Mac Mini is flying off the shelves.\n\nThe sudden increase in demand is confusing some store workers, who are wondering why now?\n\nIn a TikTok video posted February 9, an employee can be heard telling a customer at Best Buy: \"I don't know what's with the Mac Mini, everyone keeps buying them a lot. Is this some AI thing?\"\n\nYes, it is an AI thing, and it's giving the Mac Mini a moment with tech enthusiasts.\n\n“is this some AI thing??” me trying to explain to Best Buy employees why everyone is coming in to buy the Mac mini #ai #openclaw #clawdbot\n\nOpenClaw is a rapidly evolving, open-source, autonomous AI agent previously known as Clawdbot or Moltbolt. Its creator, Peter Steinberger, recently joined OpenAI after being courted by AI CEOs, including Sam Altman and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg. OpenClaw can organize users' schedules, monitor vibe-coding sessions, and run other AI agents. It can also be locally run on your computer, which can eat up a lot of memory. That's driven a bit of a frenzy for devices with higher memory, like some Mac Minis.\n\nPeople are buying up the 5\"-by-5\" computer at a pace Apple can't seem to keep up with, as the tech giant shows weekslong wait times for the higher-memory Mac Minis. New York-based shoppers, for example, can get the 16-gigabyte Mac Mini by this weekend, while the 24-gigabyte and 32-gigabyte options have shipping and pick-up windows that extend until March 18, as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCustom and higher-memory configurations often take longer to ship, but the online buzz around the Mac Mini and OpenClaw is easy to link.\n\nResellers on eBay are also trying to cash in on the hype. There are dozens of new Mac Mini listings asking for the retail price or more for brand-new and pre-owned computers.\n\nBefore you snap up your M4 chip Mac Mini, you might consider waiting for a new wave of devices to drop. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, known for his inside information on Apple, reported that new Mac computers, including a new mini, are expected in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Nostalgia is everywhere on the internet right now.\n\nWith doomsayers predicting that AI could bring about the apocalypse, this January marking the highest number of layoffs to kick off a year since 2009, and ongoing political unrest, people are harking back to simpler times.\n\nRather than looking forward to the year ahead, many people hailed in 2026 by reminiscing about 2016 — posting throwback pictures and declaring that 2026 will be the new 2016, set to songs released around that time, such as Zara Larsson's \"Lush Life.\"\n\nMany have thrown it back even further — think pieces and experts have dubbed 2026 the \"year of analog.\" This trend is less about trying to live like it's 2016, but more 2006 — or 1996.\n\nThe tech-induced nostalgia is shining through in recent Reddit posts that ask: \"What is a luxury item from 20 years ago that is basically worthless trash today?\"\n\nThis question has been posted on Reddit in several threads over the last few months. These threads have amassed thousands of comments in the past few weeks.\n\nAmong the items people are discussing are portable GPS devices, digital cameras, iPods, and paying for novelty ringtones.\n\n\"I paid $700 for one of those in... 2003?\" one Reddit user says of a portable GPS device. \"Best purchase ever because I'm directionally challenged and relied on MapQuest (!) printouts on the passenger seat.\"\n\n\"Ringtones. Oh you want one of your ringtones to be a 5 seconds snippets from Lose yourself. That'll be 8.50$. People would flex about their ringtones,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nIn another post, a Redditor reminisced about USB storage drives.\n\n\"I remember in 5th grade, a flash drive was on our required supplies list, and I got one that was 512mb. A teacher told me that was more than I would need for the rest of my life,\" they wrote.\n\nThe PalmPilot, BlackBerry, plasma TVs, and SD cards have also gotten repeat mentions.\n\nSome of these pieces of tech — namely the digital camera — have been reborn in recent years as status symbols for a generation craving a time that felt more authentic.\n\nAs part of the push to get offline, many Gen Z and millennials are rejecting new technology by Bricking their phones — blocking certain apps and websites — and leaning into in-person hobbies.\n\nKathryn Jezer-Morton recently wrote for The Cut that 2026 is all about \"friction-maxxing\" — a rejection of the numbing convenience that AI and technology bring us, which Jezer-Morton says is distancing us from life itself.\n\nIt's as if consumers are harking back to a time when it felt as though technology was made to work for us, rather than make our lives more complicated.\n\n\"After a period of intense euphoria and excitement with regards to AI, we are coming down on the other side of the hill,\" Thomas Roulet, a professor of organizational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The tool is democratised and has become normalised, and people realise it hasn't made their work easier or less intense — quite the opposite,\" he added.\n\n\"So it's normal to find GenZ employees — who will have to go through their entire career using those tools — to be disillusioned,\" he said.\n\nWhen the future of AI is being predicted by some tech execs and experts as a white-collar bloodbath with millions of workers laid off, or that those living without AI glasses could be at a \"cognitive disadvantage,\" it's no wonder.\n\nIn an uncertain time, one thing that's sure in 2026: de-digitalizing your life is officially a status symbol.",

In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.\n\nThe DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.\n\nThe judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.\n\nThe reprieve from the California DMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.",

    "description": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat",
    "fullText": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US quietly funded a global effort to keep the internet from splintering into fiefdoms run by authoritarian governments. Now that money is seriously threatened and a large part of it is already gone, putting into jeopardy internet freedoms around the world.\n\nManaged by the US state department and the US Agency for Global Media, the programme – broadly called Internet Freedom – funds small groups all over the world, from Iran to China to the Philippines, who built grassroots technologies to evade internet controls imposed by governments. It has dispensed well over $500m (£370m) in the past decade, according to an analysis by the Guardian, including $94m in 2024.\n\nThen came Doge, Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency, tasked with reducing the size of US government agencies and initiatives. Career employees who staffed Internet Freedom resigned or were sacked in 2025 as part of larger reductions. Many of its programmes were cut permanently; its main granting office issued no money in 2025. The Open Technology Fund (OTF), a nonprofit that works with the government to direct roughly half of this money, won a lawsuit to get some of this funding restored in December; the Trump administration is now appealing against that ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration this January withdrew from the Freedom Online Coalition, a global alliance set up by the US to defend digital rights.\n\nThe cuts risk curtailing technologies that helped Iranians to coordinate during recent anti-government protests, and that allowed videos and images of massacres to reach the outside world. They could have a major impact in other nations too; the efforts of groups in Myanmar to get past the junta’s “digital iron curtain”, and the ability of users in China to avoid surveillance.\n\n“The programme was effectively gutted,” said a former US official. “They didn’t issue any grants this year.”\n\n“I would like to live in a world where a single US programme is not such a linchpin, such a load-bearing programme, but it has been. It’s hard to deny it has been,” said one digital rights expert based in Europe who has worked on a number of projects for Internet Freedom.\n\nTo report this story, the Guardian spoke to 10 people with knowledge of Internet Freedom, including six of its grantees, and reviewed documents related to its operations and budget.\n\nThe US Department of State has been approached for comment. The OTF declined to comment.\n\nThe purpose of the programme was to make it extremely difficult to do what North Korea has accomplished through decades of censorship efforts, and what Iran succeeded in doing this January during a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests: cut an entire population off from the global internet.\n\nThe US aimed to circumvent this by funding groups capable of building and harnessing technologies that evade such restrictions and censorship. These include familiar tools, such as the encrypted messaging service Signal and the Tor browser, which allows users to be anonymous online.\n\nThey also include far more powerful tools. Advanced circumvention technologies can make it possible to get past even extremely powerful censorship regimes – to leap the firewall in China, for example, or to obtain international news in Iran even when mobile phone networks are out, through methods like satellite datacasting, in which data is broadcast in a similar way to television signal.\n\nAnother technology has allowed Iranians to securely communicate during recent anti-government protests, alerting each other to shootings and police presence, even as the rest of the internet has been cut off.\n\nThe soft-power aim behind this was to keep the internet as it is: mostly accessible, mostly a global commons. The groups it funded made censorship costly and difficult. “When you challenge censorship, the long-term effect is that oppressive governments must either open their internet, or to go in the direction of North Korea,” said the former US official.\n\n“But because each of those options is costly for them, they’ll keep trying to censor their networks so as to have the economic benefits of the internet without the drawbacks of freedom of speech and access to information. So the fight continues.”\n\n“Internet Freedom funded the development of many of the censorship-circumvention technologies that millions of people around the world depend on to maintain a link to the outside world,” said Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who works closely with many of these groups.\n\nTheir makers are “often operating on a shoestring and passion. They believe in the cause. There’s no fancy offices, they’re working out of their apartments. It’s not a moneyed industry.”\n\nMost recipients of this money keep it quiet; it’s a dangerous thing, in some places, to take state department funds. But even as the funds run out, more and more organisations – journalists, activists, and civil society – are seeking out these technologies, and the groups that build them. Censorship regimes are getting worse worldwide.\n\n“It’s a massive blow. The need is bigger and other funding is also gone. Organisations that provide these tools are being overwhelmed,” said the digital rights expert. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\nSome of the groups working on these technologies have laid off staff; others are continuing without pay. A few hold out hope that some money can be restored – although they fear that the Trump administration might more overtly politicise its aims. While a recent appropriations bill contains a budget line for Internet Freedom, it names no specific programmes as recipients of this cash.\n\nOthers say they’re existing in a brief grace period as the rest of the funds run out.\n\n“Everybody’s just waiting right now, to be honest. But at the same time, wait at your own risk,” said an Iranian technologist funded through Internet Freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, censorship tech is growing cheaper and easier to access. Chinese companies have exported sophisticated middleboxes – devices that sit on network cables and allow authorities to monitor internet traffic – to countries across Africa and Asia in the past year. These allow regimes such as Iran’s to fine-tune their control over the domestic internet – allowing commerce to continue, for example, while communication is throttled.\n\nSeveral recipients of the US money expressed hope that Europe might fund these technologies in the future; some have already petitioned EU officials for funding.\n\nThe cuts “make it easier to build a ‘digital iron curtain’. It makes it easier for the Kremlin to put Russians in a digital information bubble that reinforces specific narratives about people outside of Russia. This makes it easier for China to do this. For Iran to do this,” one said.",

    "fullText": "China didn't just celebrate Lunar New Year this week. It staged a robotics flex.\n\nAt the annual Spring Festival Gala, the Lunar New Year show in China, humanoid robots from Chinese startup Unitree Robotics flipped, lunged, and swung swords and nunchucks just feet from child performers in a tightly choreographed kung fu routine.\n\nIn one sequence inspired by \"drunken boxing,\" a traditional Chinese martial arts style, the robots staggered, fell backward, then rose again — showcasing advances in control and coordination.\n\nClips circulating online quickly drew comparisons to last year's broadcast, which featured Unitree humanoid robots performing a Chinese folk dance. The choreography then was noticeably simpler.\n\nThe gala, often likened to the US Super Bowl for its massive audience, also featured other Chinese robotics firms, including MagicLab, Galbot, and Noetix, in separate segments throughout the broadcast on Monday evening.\n\nReactions on Chinese social media showed viewers being struck by how quickly the technology has advanced.\n\nOn RedNote, a user who goes by Ma Xiao said in a video posted on Wednesday that during last year's performance, the robots were only \"doing very simple things.\"\n\n\"Now, they're doing kung fu, they're doing flips, they're doing synchronized dancing,\" he said. \"Everybody's shocked.\"\n\n\"Now the rest of the world knows what China's speed is,\" he added.\n\nAnother RedNote user, DKKD, posted a video of friends reacting to the performance on Tuesday, captioning it: \"Three Americans were scared by the Spring Festival robot.\"\n\n\"They were all shocked by the robot's level of evolution (including me),\" the user wrote.\n\nOne viewer in the video can be heard saying: \"It's way more impressive than last year. It's crazy.\"\n\nUnitree CEO Wang Xingxing said in an interview with Chinese media following the gala that the company expects to ship up to 20,000 humanoid robots this year, up from about 5,500 in 2025.\n\nGlobal shipments of humanoid robots could reach \"tens of thousands\" this year, with Unitree potentially contributing between 10,000 and 20,000 units, Wang said on Tuesday.\n\nChinese companies developing humanoid robots and autonomous systems are racing to outdo global rivals.\n\nIn September, Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, unveiled R1, a humanoid robot that drew comparisons to Tesla's Optimus. Two months later, EV and robotics maker XPeng introduced the latest version of its humanoid, Iron, which the company described as \"highly human-like.\"\n\nChina's elite universities are also moving to build talent for the sector. In November, China's Ministry of Education issued a notice stating that top institutions are preparing to launch a new undergraduate major in \"embodied intelligence,\" a field that combines AI with robotics.\n\nStill, China's rapid push into robotics hasn't been seamless.\n\nXPeng's Iron fell face-first during its first public appearance in China earlier this year. Its CEO, He Xiaopeng, later wrote on Chinese social media that the mishap was part of \"learning to walk.\"\n\nLast month, a Unitree humanoid kicked an engineer in the groin during a test. Humanoid robots stumbled and fell while racing against humans in a half-marathon in Beijing in April last year.",

    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a landmark trial about social media addiction. Parents who attended hope the 'tide will turn' against Big Tech.",
    "fullText": "Lori Schott, a mother from rural Colorado, said she stared down Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg as he walked into court in Los Angeles on Wednesday to testify in a landmark trial regarding social media addiction.\n\nSchott lost her 18-year-old daughter, Annalee, to suicide in 2020. She believes the content Annalee saw on social media platforms \"destroyed\" her mental health.\n\n\"I made eye contact with him for quite a long time,\" Schott said of Zuckerberg. \"I was not backing down.\"\n\nSchott is not a plaintiff in the case where Zuckerberg testified on Wednesday, but is among more than 2,000 individuals who have similar personal injury lawsuits pending regarding social media addiction and harm.\n\nThe case underway in Los Angeles centers on a 20-year-old woman, identified by the initials KGM, who says her use of social media throughout her childhood negatively affected her mental health, contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts. It is considered a bellwether trial that could indicate how other similar lawsuits related to social media harm, like Schott's, could play out.\n\nMeta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, was named as a defendant alongside Google-owned YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat. TikTok and Snapchat both settled the lawsuit out of court.\n\nLast month, Meta warned investors that its mounting legal battles over youth safety could \"significantly impact\" its 2026 financial results. Attorneys for more than 100,000 individual arbitration claimants have \"sent mass arbitration demands relating to 'social media addiction'\" since late 2024, the company said in a 2026 10-K, which warned that potential damages in certain cases could reach into the \"high tens of billions of dollars.\"\n\nIn a statement, Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokesperson, said: \"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\" Otway highlighted changes the company has made over the past decade, including Teen Accounts, which give parents tools to manage their teens' accounts.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. A Snapchat spokesperson said in a statement: \"The Parties are pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, parents showed up hours before the courthouse opened in hopes of getting a seat inside. Many of them had personal stories about how they believed social media use harmed their children.\n\n\"We face a lot of stigma from people telling us we're bad parents,\" said Amy Neville, another parent who attended to show her support. She said that once the evidence comes out in the trial, she believes \"the tide will turn, and the general public will be on board with us.\"\n\n\"It is by design that social media is tearing their family apart,\" Neville said.\n\nOn the stand, Zuckerberg said that teens represent less than 1% of Meta's ad revenue and that most teens don't have disposable income, so it's not especially valuable to advertisers to reach them.\n\nZuckerberg said it's in Meta's best interest to create a platform that inspires people and makes them want to stick around for the long term.\n\n\"If people aren't happy with a service, eventually over time they'll stop using it and use something better,\" he said.\n\nSarah Gardner said that regardless of the outcome of the trial, she hopes it raises awareness about how the social media companies, and specifically Zuckerberg, have been operating. Gardner is the CEO of the Heat Initiative, an advocacy group that pressures Big Tech companies to make their platforms safer for kids. She was at the courthouse with the parents who believe they have been affected.\n\nGardner said she's hopeful the trial will empower more people to say, \"I don't want to be on Instagram anymore.\"",

He argued that the era of “static” tools—where businesses must bend their workflows to fit a software's limitations—is rapidly ending.\n\n\"Software is dead because everything's going to be customized to your unique utilization,\" Cuban stated, citing a shift where AI models mold themselves around specific business needs in real time.\n\nThis AI Helps Fortune 1000 Brands Avoid Costly Ad Mistakes — See Why Investors Are Paying Attention\n\nOwn the Characters, Not Just the Content: Inside a Fast-Growing Pre-IPO IP Company\n\nHe noted that even industry titans like Microsoft Corp.

    "fullText": "Australia experienced a boom in smart-home technology at the start of the 2020s. Years on, some early adopters are experiencing buyer’s remorse\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nWhen the smart home devices Elly Bailey was expecting in the post never showed up at her Gold Coast home, she was frustrated. As a technology reviewer, these products were crucial for her work.\n\nWhen she eventually found the cause, she had to laugh. It wasn’t a sticky-fingered neighbour or a rogue delivery driver causing her to miss parcels, but her smart doorbell – the very thing she’d hoped would prevent missed deliveries, and part of exactly the range of internet-connected devices she was meant to be reviewing.\n\n“It’s pretty funny,” says Bailey, 33, who goes by the handle @ellyawesome on TikTok, where she has more than 1.1 million followers. She’d been loving her Google Nest doorbell up until then. She could see who was at the front door from upstairs and speak to delivery people through her phone while she was out.\n\nBut it had one obvious flaw: “When someone presses this doorbell, all it does is send a notification to my phone.” She says this feature is “great” when she’s out, but without a telltale chime she was missing deliveries while at home and away from her phone. She complained about this to her followers in a clip that’s been liked more than 1,400 times.\n\n“The crazy irony is the doorbell itself does make a little ding-dong sound when you press the doorbell button, but it’s only loud enough for the person at the door to hear it,” she says.\n\nBailey is far from alone in her scepticism around smart home technology – many adoptees have realised the devices designed to make life easier regularly achieve the opposite. Stories of people being locked out of their homes by faulty smart locks, woken up by pets activating cameras on the driveway, and being left in the dark by broken smart lights are rife on social media and product review websites.\n\n“Technology is brilliant … until it isn’t,” says Georgina Wilson, an architect in Sydney who learned this the hard way when her husband pressure-hosed the front of the house and accidentally watered their smart keypad unit. The incident hasn’t changed her mind on the convenience of a smart lock, but it did result in an expensive emergency locksmith callout – and quickly forced her to put a backup plan in place: keys in a hidden lockbox, with copies distributed to family members and neighbours.\n\nShe says some of her clients have had similar, or worse, experiences. “We’ve seen clients unable to flush toilets, lock front doors, or exit garages during power outages.”\n\nSince smart home technology uptake spiked during Covid lockdowns, Daniel Vasilevski, an electrician in Sydney, says he’s seen many smart tech horror stories. One client in Maroubra got locked out of their house for two days. Others have ended up with no working lights. Subscription complaints are also rife, with even some relatively simple devices like smart doorbells and thermostats requiring monthly fees. Vasilevski estimates 15 to 20% of his callouts these days are for problems with smart tech – some are simple repair jobs, while others want their smart systems demolished altogether.\n\nThere can be a more sinister side, too. Experts say smart homes are prime targets for cybercriminals. More than 120,000 smart home cameras were hacked in South Korea last year and the Australian Signals Directorate recently warned that Chinese hackers are exploiting people’s home routers and smart devices.\n\nWhile cases of spying fridges and doorbells being hacked are still rare, Emily Holyoake, a cyber and home-security expert based in Canberra, says technology facilitated domestic abuse is a significant issue.\n\n“The scariest things I’ve heard are about loss of privacy, where ex-partners have still had access to their partner’s home and made changes either locking them out, letting themselves in or watching their every move,” she says.\n\nRenters, too, have privacy concerns, as smart locks can allow landlords to keep tabs on their every move.\n\nJulie Provenzano, a real estate broker with 83,000 TikTok followers, believes it might be smarter to stick with an analogue home. She recently told fans she was “apped-out”. “Hi-tech doesn’t necessarily mean easier … It leaves people in a hostage situation with IT departments,” she said.\n\nVasilevski’s clients have faced similar issues. When something goes wrong, it’s not just the tech that’s a problem, but finding someone to fix it. Many locksmiths are not trained to work with sophisticated, connected devices. He says electricians will sometimes turn away smart home repair jobs because of how faffy and time-consuming they can be to troubleshoot. “It isn’t worth the hassle, most of the time,” he says. This is particularly true with lower-end smart tech suppliers who offer little in the way of after-sale support.\n\nGaby Albutros, a project manager at Sydney firm RSE Home Automation, says that when brands shut down or devices are discontinued, as was the case with Belkin’s Wemo smart home range in January, customers can be left high and dry.“The only option when they go wrong is to have them ripped out.”\n\nCurtains and blinds seem to be among the few smart-control devices that experts in the industry agree upon. Provenzano says they’re one of the only smart devices she endorses, and Vasilevski agrees, saying he wouldn’t install smart tech in his home because of the issues he sees at work, but that “smart control curtains are pretty reliable because they only get used twice a day”.\n\nWhile Holyoake doesn’t suggest eschewing the Internet of Things entirely, she says the key is to be intentional about the technology you’re putting in your home. In her household, she uses smart security cameras, lighting, a robot vacuum and even a digital whiteboard – all things she says make family life easier, especially with neurodivergent kids.\n\nMindful of the risks, she suggests smart-home adopters make time to check their security settings once a month. “Make sure only the people you know and trust have access, always make sure you change the default password, check for security and software updates, and always ask: who has access to my data and where is it stored? Do I need a subscription to access my own data? Can I still access devices if the internet goes out?”\n\nBailey might be a likely champion for all things smart, but even she prefers a hybrid setup. She’s been offered everything from smart lights to smart washing machines as part of her job, so she could have the world’s most connected home if she wanted to, but aside from the smart doorbell – which she’s kept because she still thinks the benefits outweigh the drawbacks – she’s chosen to keep most parts of her home “consciously dumb”.\n\n“Ultimately I’m an old-school millennial who’s very happy to put my washing on myself,” she says. “I think that keeps me smart, to be honest.”",

    "fullText": "AI's next target? Helping you kick your phone addiction.\n\nAI devices are a top priority for Big Tech companies that view it as the future of how humans and AI interact, writes BI's Amanda Hoover.\n\nYou've likely heard of this hardware before, which acts as a sort of AI sidekick for your life. From the Rabbit R1 and Humane to Friend, the names are different, but the stories are the same: big expectations, difficult execution.\n\nAmanda's story covers how it's not just upstarts looking to shake things up. Tech giants like Apple, Meta, and OpenAI are working on their own solutions.\n\nIt's an uphill battle considering how addicted most of us are to our phones. However, the push for phone-free lifestyles, especially among Gen Z, does create an opening.\n\nThese tech giants also don't have much of a choice.\n\nApple, for example, has largely sat out the AI wars, saving a ton of money on model development. That only works if the iPhone remains a key distribution channel for the AI it's skipping out on developing.\n\nMeta's business is also heavily reliant on smartphone usage. (How often do you check Instagram on your desktop computer? Do you even have a desktop computer?) If user behavior around phones changes in a meaningful way, you can bet Meta wants to be ahead of it.\n\nAI devices also give companies a front-row seat to your life.\n\nYou could argue that's already the case with these AI chatbots. I'd argue the relationship between you and your chatbot of choice is still mostly transactional. You have a question/problem/thought; the chatbot has an answer (hopefully).\n\nThe relationship with AI wearables is more fluid. It's always listening, learning, and collecting. The pitch is that makes it a better copilot. Understanding your habits means it can figure out the best way to serve you.\n\nThat's putting a lot of faith, and your personal data, into an AI device, though\n\nMany executives I've spoken to have said this is the future. Truly leveraging AI is about incorporating it into your daily routine, not treating it as a one-off for specific problems.\n\nThe irony is that strategy has the potential to make AI even more addictive than the smartphones it's trying to replace.",

    "title": "Ukraine's drone war showed the West it needs to view small drones less like prized gear and more like expendable ammo",
    "description": "Western militaries often view new technology as precious and valuable. Ukraine shows that they can't afford to view small drones that way.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's large-scale drone war is pushing Western militaries to treat small drones less as high-end equipment and more as expendable ammunition that isn't meant to come back.\n\nUS Army and British Army officials, as well as a NATO veteran who volunteered to fight in Ukraine, told Business Insider that effective drone warfare requires sending large numbers forward — and accepting many will be lost as a routine cost.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the US Army's new drone lethality course, told Business Insider that the conflict shows that \"if you're going to flood the zone with drones,\" especially in a combat situation where electronic warfare is heavy, \"you're going to lose a lot of drones.\"\n\nShe said it's a \"transition from the army of old,\" where a lost drone was \"a significant emotional event\" that was reported to senior leadership. In Ukraine, it's different. \"Drones go down all the time.\" There, losses are typically shrugged off, rather than investigated.\n\nThat shifting mindset is shaping how Western militaries train.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the British Army's 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards, told Business Insider that his battalion has changed its training to allow drones to be damaged or even destroyed to reflect battlefield realities. \"I absolutely think they need to be disposable because otherwise you're not training realistically,\" he said.\n\nJakub Jajcay, a former special forces member from Slovakia who fought in Ukraine, told Business Insider that if NATO militaries want to start using drones for real missions, they \"need to get used to the fact that they're basically expendable material more akin to ammunition or fuel or gasoline, things like that, rather than specialized high-end pieces of equipment that need to be looked after.\"\n\nHe said when he was serving in the military for his home country, \"drones were very specialized pieces of equipment.\"\n\nThe drones were fairly expensive, he shared, \"and there was always a sort of bureaucratic process\" in using them. Sometimes, only designated individuals were allowed to use the drones.\n\nIf something happened to a drone, \"that would've been a big problem in training. If we had lost a drone, somebody would've been in big trouble for that.\" The war in Ukraine shows how poorly that peacetime mindset fits large-scale combat.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has featured drones on an unprecedented scale. Ukraine says roughly 80% of its strikes are carried out using drones rather than other weapons. Many never reach their targets and are lost along the way, though.\n\nCheap drones worth several hundred dollars have destroyed weaponry worth millions. But many of them don't have any effect. A report last year from the UK's Royal United Services Institute said that \"between 60 and 80% of Ukrainian FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators.\"\n\nSome drones are jammed or disrupted by electronic warfare, while others are shot down or get their cables cut. Sometimes they're knocked out by soldiers on their own side.\n\nMany of the drones on the battlefield are single-use, designed to explode when they hit their target, but many of them are destroyed, damaged, or disabled before they even reach that point.\n\nJajcay said that even drones designed to be used again and again \"have a lifespan of maybe a few dozen missions at most.\"\n\nHe also said that drones failed \"all the time,\" and those losses were expected.\n\nThe US Army is recognizing and learning from these dynamics in Ukraine, as are other Western militaries, as they incorporate the idea that drones cannot be treated as overly precious assets into their drone warfare training and doctrine.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider that out of the thousands of drones used daily, only around 30% of them hit their targets, while many others don't have a significant impact on their targets.\n\nThe Army is learning that lots of drones need to be sent forward.\n\nIrwin-Clark told Business Insider that the way the UK sees drones has also shifted. He said \"every time there's an iterative change in technology in the battlefield, everyone gets very excited about it and the ownership of that asset tends to be far too high.\"\n\nHe said that often when a new and powerful technology emerges, senior leaders will try to tightly control it, arguing that because there are only a handful available, only a select few should have the authority to decide when it's used. The assets are carefully protected, at least initially. Later on, trust is imparted to soldiers to handle technology previously in the charge of higher-ups.\n\nThat pattern, Irwin-Clark said, is \"exactly what's happening with drones.\"\n\nHis battalion wrapped the first drones it received years ago in bubble wrap, \"and we didn't fly them very often,\" he said. \"When we did,\" he continued, \"we made sure we flew in the middle of a field with nothing, no obstacles around.\"\n\nNow, his battalion is deliberately crashing its latest drone delivery into targets, while looking at how to make repairs. \"It really doesn't matter if we break them,\" Irwin-Clark said.\n\nThe US is coming at it the same way. Martin, who previously commanded a Gray Eagle drone company, said her course takes into account that \"drones crash. I'll say that to the day I die having owned drones as a commander: drones crash.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last year that the defense department needs to view small drones as consumables rather than \"durable property\" — more like ammunition than valuable equipment. It's a change that Jajcay described as \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nWestern armies were using various drones in warfare before Russia's invasion, often using them as surveillance platforms or tools for launching missile strikes. Small drones weren't used the way they're being used in Ukraine, but the US, UK, and others are learning drone lessons from the war.\n\nMartin said the ongoing conflict in Ukraine shows that even when you lose drones, it's ultimately \"still cheaper than employing missiles on specific targets.\" That's an equation the US Army can't totally ignore.\n\n\"They're cheaper, and you're not putting human lives in danger\" to carry out the mission, she shared. And the Army knows that \"they're going to crash. It's going to happen.\"",

    "description": "Microsoft says it is on track to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring artificial intelligence to lower-income countries, as concerns mount over the technology’s potential to deepen inequality.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft says it is on track to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring artificial intelligence to lower-income countries, as concerns mount over the technology’s potential to deepen inequality.\n\nThe announcement was made Wednesday at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where leading tech executives, government officials and AI researchers are debating how to use AI to solve real-world problems.\n\nPolicymakers globally are increasingly worried that the unequal adoption of AI risks widening income and development gaps between rich and poor countries. In December, the United Nations Development Project called for global cooperation on standards and safety to ensure the technology “functions as a shared public good rather than a concentrated advantage.”\n\nAt the summit, Microsoft likewise expressed the need for cross-border partnerships to prevent poorer countries from being left behind.\n\n“We need to act with urgency to address the growing AI divide,” Microsoft president Brad Smith and chief responsible AI officer Natasha Crampton said in a joint statement. “Artificial intelligence is diffusing at an impressive speed, but its adoption around the world remains profoundly uneven.”\n\nThe company’s $50 billion commitment to developing economies by 2030 compares with the roughly $80 billion that Microsoft invested into data centers last year alone, more than half of which was directed to a single economy: the United States.\n\nA recent Microsoft report found that AI usage in the global north, a catch-all term for developed and high-income countries, is roughly twice that of the global south — and growing.\n\n“This disparity impacts not only national and regional economic growth, but whether AI can deliver on its broader promise of expanding opportunity and prosperity around the world,” Smith and Crampton said.\n\nThey warned that, just as unequal access to electricity has exacerbated a growing economic gap between the global north and south, without urgent action, the AI divide could perpetuate that disparity in the century ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, the technology could be used positively to help poor countries leapfrog older development pathways. “If AI is deployed broadly and used well by a young and growing population, it offers a real prospect for catch-up economic growth for the Global South,” said Smith and Crampton.\n\n“It might even provide the biggest such opportunity of the 21st century,” the pair said.\n\nMicrosoft’s $50 billion investment will, among other things, help to build the data centers crucial to providing the computing power needed to run AI models. Extending internet access is another focus.\n\nOnly about 36% of Africa’s population had broadband internet access in 2022, according to the World Bank. That compares with some 90% of US households, official figures show.\n\nThe AI Impact Summit, hosted by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highlights the country’s ambition to position itself as an AI leader in the global south.\n\nHigh-profile attendees include Sam Altman of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai who is due to deliver a keynote address on Friday.",

    "title": "OpenAI, Meta, and Apple's latest battle: Breaking your phone addiction",
    "description": "The tech companies that created our phone addiction are trying to cure us with AI wearables.",
    "fullText": "The average American picks up their phone more than 200 times a day. Teens are pinged with some 250 notifications a day — during school, after school, and overnight. The apps meant to prevent you from checking apps have done little to stop the problem. Now, some of the tech companies that helped create our screen dependence are trying to disrupt it.\n\nLater this year, OpenAI plans to debut a small, screenless device that Sam Altman describes as more \"peaceful\" than a smartphone. Apple, the Oz of screentime, is developing smart glasses, a pin, and AirPods with more AI built in, according to a Tuesday report from Bloomberg, with the rumored pendants featuring microphones and cameras to be the \"eyes and ears\" of the iPhone. Meta has teased its fully augmented reality Orion glasses since 2024. While that device doesn't have a release date, the company last year sold some 7 million pairs of its smart glasses, which is the start of the post-smartphone future Mark Zuckerberg has predicted. Eventual smart specs could be more screen all-the-time than screenless, but they also rely on AI to make the experience much more hands-free than swiping and scrolling on a phone.\n\nCould AI be what finally breaks our phone addiction?\n\nSince 2007, no device out of Silicon Valley has captured universal imagination the way Steve Jobs did when he put your iPod, your phone, and the internet together on a 3.5-inch screen. Competitors have tried for a decade-plus to get people to shift us from the iPhone to smart glasses, and largely failed. The awe around smartphones has turned to derision, as excessive screen time is linked to disrupted sleep, anxiety, and fractured attention. Now, developers are hoping the AI boom can give us the next big thing.\n\nBeating the smartphone would mean replacing a device that 91% of American adults now carry — a device for which millions of apps have been developed and people now depend on in lieu of wallets and cameras and health monitors. New AI devices can't just copy what smartphones do, says Ramon Llamas, a research director at a technology intelligence firm IDC: They have to show they have a solution to an everyday problem. If they don't, Llama says, \"these things are just gonna really end up as solutions looking for a problem to solve.\"\n\nCritiques of screen time can be as blunt and smoothbrained as what the critics say excessive screen time makes you. A seven-hour daily log may seem like a staggering amount of dependence, but what did the person spend those seven hours doing? Doomscrolling late into the night, or FaceTiming with a far-away friend? With AI wearables, there's the risk of becoming dependent on the device for different reasons.\n\n\"The screen may not be there, but what's getting filled in the back is already this problem of AI companionship,\" says Olivia Gambelin, an AI ethicist and author of the book \"Responsible AI.\" An AI device designed to do something very specific — like listen to a meeting and then send follow-up emails or messages related to action points discussed — could save people time and keep them from writing tedious emails and Slack messages from their desk. But that same device listening in to personal conversations with family and friends could compromise a relationship, and erode the positive effects that texting a friend to check-in can have on both people (already, my friends are tiring of AI summaries on the iPhone that summarize our group text and become an intermediary into our threads of gossip and jokes in the name of efficiency). Wearing microphones and cameras to social interactions and into businesses is likely to really weird out some of the people around you. More people are entering into romantic, dependent relationships with AI companions, and a swell of loud dissenters are criticizing the technology for taking jobs and attempting to replicate human relationships.\n\nBut OpenAI is betting that it can package its technology in a device in a way that calms the user. \"When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way,\" Altman said in November. OpenAI's device, he said, would be less Time Square, more \"sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm.\" That's because the AI device would learn \"contextual awareness of your whole life,\" and when best to send you alerts.\n\nOther AI wearables have failed by falling short of that goal. Humane AI sold a wearable pin, priced at $700 plus a monthly fee to connect it, but pulled it from the market a year ago. It failed perhaps because it tried too hard to replace our phones — it didn't interact with them, but provided a shoddy replacement. Novelty wasn't a factor that could outshine usability. The AI Friend pendant, which can't search the internet or help with tasks outside of sending reminders and acts instead as an eavesdropping sycophant around its user's neck, was mocked relentlessly and sold just a few thousand devices after it hit the market last year.\n\nCompanies trying to make AI hardware should focus on \"transformative features,\" Jason Low, research director at Omdia, tells me in an email. AI wearables must be more than \"marginally more convenient,\" should integrate with our existing products, and have a clear, stated value. For example, glasses that provide real-time language translation or devices for fitness and health tracking offer features our smartphones can't do as well. The Oura ring continues to grow in popularity, particularly among women after starting out as a niche tech bro buy, for the novel insights it can offer; the company announced last fall it has sold 5.5 million rings since 2015, with more than 2.5 million sold between June 2024 and September 2025. \"These devices often deliver a more polished user experience compared to general-purpose, do-it-all AI devices,\" Low says.\n\nLlamas tells me that the AI functions of a wearable have to be \"contextual, personalized, and actionable,\" like reminding the wearer to send birthday flowers or responding accurately to being asked to direct the user to the nearest Starbucks. A first attempt device shouldn't try to replace the smartphone, but to integrate with the Apple or Google ecosystems, he says. Apple and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment about their rumored products for this story.\n\nIf anything has hyped Silicon Valley like the iPhone, it's been AI. But three years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, the value generative AI in the white collar workforce has yet to be fully realized. That could make a product for consumers a hard sell, too. \"Some of the overwhelm that's coming with AI that I see in general users is you can use it for everything, or it's promoted that way, which is actually quite stifling,\" Gambelin says.\n\nIn our quest to find a peaceful equilibrium with tech, the screen itself may not be the problem; it's what's summoning us to the screen. Its bright colors, games, and infinite scroll give quick dopamine hits that entice us to stay glued to it. But much of what pings my phone throughout the day are useless notifications trying to get me to reopen one of the dozens of apps — a markdown moment on a clothing thrifting app, a like on the Instagram story I've posted of my dog from my best friend, and ironically, a report of how much time I've already logged. There's a relentless business model at play to keep us on these apps. No screens would mean no infinite scroll through TikTok, no Candy Crush — but app developers and companies may need to find new ways to reach people if wearables caught on, and an always-there AI device and companion might not be as peaceful as Altman describes. Our collective screen time is a problem, but the AI wearable will have to surprise us all with something novel to be useful.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

The report identified Applovin, a company that helps iPhone apps monetize users via advertising technology, as an example of a common short.

In 2021, one year before a global market plunge brought on in part by concerns over lofty tech valuations, there were 128 campaigns — the most in the last five years until 2025.\n\nOf last year's 166 campaigns, 55 of them were focused on technology companies, by far the most of any sector.\n\nThe slide in software stocks such as Salesforce and Oracle this year has added fuel to short-sellers' questions about the industry's valuations in the age of AI.\n\nNew shortseller BMF Capital, run by Frankie Gerola and based in Arizona, told Diligent that one of the firm's first bets, against defense AI company BigBear.ai, came about in part due to what it viewed as a \"lack of true AI innovation.\" BigBear, which has attracted other short sellers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the short-sellers' critiques.\n\nBMF Capital is also keeping an eye on companies \"that repeatedly change narratives in search of relevance, such as a sports company pivoting into AI dating.\"\n\n\"That kind of identity drift usually precedes capital stress or poor fundamentals,\" BMF Capital said.\n\nLast year, the average short campaign generated returns of 7.2% 30 days after launch, according to Diligent. So far in 2026, the software-stock crash has generated billions for those betting against the stocks, short-seller tracker S3 Partners said.",

    "fullText": "The once relentless rally in AI-fueled stocks has lost momentum, as investors confront the unsettling idea that advances in artificial intelligence could erode the very value propositions that made tech giants dominant in the first place. Yet some executives and market veterans warn against short-term panic, calling the selloff a rare opportunity to buy into the next phase of the AI boom.\n\nThe AI growth story has been tempered by a widespread selloff in software stocks. Call it the software-mageddon or the SaaSpocalypse, but companies who specialize in designing, selling, and maintaining digital software products are getting battered. Earlier this month, JPMorgan analysts wrote that software companies had lost around $2 trillion in value over the past year, calling it “the largest non-recessionary 12-month drawdown in over 30 years.”\n\nThe culprit has been an increasingly widespread feeling among investors that AI is sorting tech players into winners and losers. Under this view, software companies could fall into the latter camp as the capabilities of newer AI models promise to replace expensive digital services, rendering the business models of companies like Salesforce and Atlassian obsolete.\n\nBut not all investors are convinced these companies are destined for irrelevance. Hidden within the chaos could lie an undervalued chance to buy these tech stocks at a discount, a relative rarity in an age of soaring valuations and speculative growth. It all depends on whether bullish buyers consider AI as complementary to existing software services, or capable enough to replace them entirely.\n\n“I think this software selloff will go down as a generational opportunity to own some of the stalwarts,” Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a Yahoo Finance interview Friday. “I feel more emboldened about the bull thesis on tech and AI this year, despite obviously this massive pullback.”\n\nIves named three industry leaders that he sees as being unfairly punished in today’s market, and that could be in for a powerful rebound:\n\nIves called the software stock correction a “structural selloff” that was the largest in scale he’d seen in 25 years. But instead of spelling doom for these companies, he framed the wipeout as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in enterprise technology, arguing that software developers will remain a “core part of the use cases,” even in an AI-powered future.",

    "fullText": "Data analytics firm moves from Denver after about six years and joins host of businesses relocating to south Florida\n\nPalantir announced on Tuesday that it has moved its headquarters to Miami from Denver. The data analytics company, criticized for its role in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, joins a host of other businesses and billionaires that recently moved to Florida in search of a more business-friendly climate.\n\nPalantir’s move across state lines comes after its chair, Peter Thiel, announced on 31 December that he opened a Miami office for his private investment firm. Thiel already has a mansion in Miami Beach. The company, previously headquartered in Palo Alto, announced the move on X but did not provide further details or respond to a request for comment. Palantir’s stay in Colorado lasted about six years; the company exited California in August 2020 – with its CEO, Alex Karp, citing disagreements with the state’s values.\n\nPalantir’s Denver office has frequently been the site of protest, as the company faces heated criticism for its involvement in the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants. Tools and platforms built by Palantir have been used by the federal government in efforts to surveil and detain immigrants. The company has also inked a major contract with the UK’s National Health Service.\n\nColorado’s immigration and tech activists view Palantir’s departure as a result of their sustained organizing. Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee and organizer for AI regulation in Denver, said that a coalition of unions and grassroots organizations, including Denver Anti-War Action, held a few dozen town halls, strikes and protests that mounted pressure on Palantir’s presence in the city. Pinto also said that Palantir may have been dissuaded by Colorado’s state lawmakers taking the lead on AI regulation with proposals to limit surveillance and discrimination.\n\n“Colorado has rejected the values of Palantir – the values of an economy built on exploitation of people’s data, whether it’s for warfare or for immigration enforcement,” Pinto said.\n\nMany of California’s wealthiest billionaires seem to be considering a move to Florida – spooked by the state’s consideration of a billionaire tax. There has also been a concerted effort by the business leaders Ken Griffin and Stephen Ross to convince billionaires to move to south Florida and to bring their businesses with them.\n\nPalantir has tried to distance itself from Trump’s immigration apparatus, but that has not quelled protest. Some of the company’s employees appear to be disturbed, too. Karp recorded a video about Palantir’s involvement with ICE for staff and said they could sign NDAs if they wanted more details, according to Wired.\n\nJames Fishback, a Republican candidate for Florida governor, wrote on X in response to Palantir’s move, saying he would ban Palantir from all government contracts if elected. “You are a threat to our civil liberties,” Fishback wrote. He had voiced the same position last month. Fishback’s commitment comes amid increasing pressure on lawmakers to evaluate their relationship with Palantir. The nationwide campaign Purge Palantir has been documenting politicians who received funds from the company’s executives and pressuring them not to accept their donations. The campaign has had some success so far. The Colorado Sun reported that the Colorado representative Jason Crow and Colorado senator John Hickenlooper planned to donate more than $50,000 each, in campaign contributions from Palantir, to immigrant rights groups.\n\nPalantir blew past Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter of 2025 and reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m. Its stock, however, has sunk 20% since the start of 2026.",

    "fullText": "Prof Michael Wooldridge says scenario such as deadly self-driving car update or AI hack could destroy global interest\n\nThe race to get artificial intelligence to market has raised the risk of a Hindenburg-style disaster that shatters global confidence in the technology, a leading researcher has warned.\n\nMichael Wooldridge, a professor of AI at Oxford University, said the danger arose from the immense commercial pressures that technology firms were under to release new AI tools, with companies desperate to win customers before the products’ capabilities and potential flaws are fully understood.\n\nThe surge in AI chatbots with guardrails that are easily bypassed showed how commercial incentives were prioritised over more cautious development and safety testing, he said.\n\n“It’s the classic technology scenario,” he said. “You’ve got a technology that’s very, very promising, but not as rigorously tested as you would like it to be, and the commercial pressure behind it is unbearable.”\n\nWooldridge, who will deliver the Royal Society’s Michael Faraday prize lecture on Wednesday evening, titled “This is not the AI we were promised”, said a Hindenburg moment was “very plausible” as companies rushed to deploy more advanced AI tools.\n\nThe Hindenburg, a 245-metre airship that made round trips across the Atlantic, was preparing to land in New Jersey in 1937 when it burst into flames, killing 36 crew, passengers and ground staff. The inferno was caused by a spark that ignited the 200,000 cubic metres of hydrogen that kept the airship aloft.\n\n“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Wooldridge said. Because AI is embedded in so many systems, a major incident could strike almost any sector.\n\nThe scenarios Wooldridge imagines include a deadly software update for self-driving cars, an AI-powered hack that grounds global airlines, or a Barings bank-style collapse of a major company, triggered by AI doing something stupid. “These are very, very plausible scenarios,” he said. “There are all sorts of ways AI could very publicly go wrong.”\n\nDespite the concerns, Wooldridge said he did not intend to attack modern AI. His starting point is the gap between what researchers expected and what has emerged. Many experts anticipated AI that computed solutions to problems and provided answers that were sound and complete. “Contemporary AI is neither sound nor complete: it’s very, very approximate,” he said.\n\nThis arises because large language models, which underpin today’s AI chatbots, rattle out answers by predicting the next word, or part of a word, based on probability distributions learned in training. It leads to AIs with jagged capabilities: incredibly effective at some tasks, yet terrible at others.\n\nThe problem, Wooldridge said, was that AI chatbots failed in unpredictable ways and had no idea when they were wrong, but were designed to provide confident answers regardless. When delivered in human-like and sycophantic responses, the answers could easily mislead people, he added. The risk is that people start treating AIs as if they were human. In a 2025 survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology, nearly a third of students reported that they or a friend had had a romantic relationship with an AI.\n\n“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge said. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”\n\nWooldridge sees positives in the kind of AI depicted in the early years of Star Trek. In one 1968 episode, The Day of the Dove, Mr Spock quizzes the Enterprise’s computer only to be told in a distinctly non-human voice that it has insufficient data to answer. “That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he said. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the Star Trek computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”",

    "fullText": "Google, Anthropic and OpenAI bosses to mingle with global south leaders wrestling for control over technology\n\nSilicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.\n\nDuring the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.\n\nAmid a push to speed up AI adoption across the globe, Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, the heads of Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, will all be there. Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.\n\nMeanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioning India as the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.\n\nModi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raised serious concerns about India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”\n\nSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.\n\nIndian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.\n\nIf a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.\n\nIndia’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”\n\nSafety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.\n\n“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”\n\nOne of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”\n\nBut the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.\n\n“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.\n\nCompanies such as Google are focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.\n\n“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”\n\nGoogle’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: ICE more than tripled the amount of data stored in Microsoft’s cloud at the same time that its arsenal of surveillance technology ballooned\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deepened its reliance on Microsoft’s cloud technology last year as the agency ramped up arrest and deportation operations, leaked documents reveal.\n\nICE more than tripled the amount of data it stored in Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform in the six months leading up to January 2026, a period in which the agency’s budget swelled and its workforce rapidly expanded, according to the files.\n\nICE appears to be using a range of Microsoft’s productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyse the data it holds in Azure. Files suggest some of the agency’s own tools and systems may also be running on Microsoft servers.\n\nThe documents – obtained by the Guardian and its partners +972 Magazine and Local Call – raise questions about whether Microsoft technology is facilitating an immigration crackdown by an agency accused of conducting unlawful operations and using excessive force on a large scale.\n\nICE enforcement operations have surged over the past year as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign. The agency is now at the centre of a battle in Congress over its funding, sparked by the deaths of two people in Minneapolis, that has led to a partial shutdown of the US government.\n\nIn July, ICE received a $75bn budget increase, making it the highest-funded US law enforcement body. With this unprecedented increase in funds, the agency has embarked on a spending spree on technology, awarding contracts to large firms such as Palantir alongside lesser-known providers.\n\nICE, which has been likened to a domestic surveillance agency, enjoys access to vast troves of data on people living in the US. It has a growing arsenal of surveillance technology, including facial recognition apps, phone location databases, drones and invasive spyware.\n\nAs the agency expanded through 2025, it boosted spending on cloud computing. Amazon and Microsoft, both longtime providers to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have emerged as beneficiaries of deals worth tens of millions of dollars struck by third-party resellers.\n\nThe leaked documents do not specify the kinds of information stored by ICE on Microsoft servers. However, they indicate the agency has used Azure services including “blob storage” of raw data, as well as AI tools that analyse images and videos, and translate text.\n\nIn January, according to the files, ICE held almost 1,400 terabytes in Azure, which if only comprised of photographs would be equivalent to approximately 490m images. This was up from 400 terabytes in July 2025 after climbing through the second half of last year, files suggest.\n\nICE is also using virtual machines on Azure, according to the documents. These are effectively computers that run in the cloud but that can be accessed remotely. ICE appears to be renting these high-powered computers to run software.\n\nThe agency, which has more than doubled its workforce since January 2025, is also understood to have significantly expanded its access to Microsoft’s suite of productivity apps which provide users with access to document management tools and an AI chatbot.\n\nIt’s unclear from the files whether ICE is using Azure to store or analyse information collected through any of its surveillance or intelligence gathering activities, or whether the cloud platform supports other functions, such as the running of detention centres or deportation flights. ICE did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft said it “provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS and ICE, delivered through our key partners”. They said Microsoft’s policies and terms of service “do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity”.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “There are currently many public issues relating to immigration enforcement, and we believe Congress, the executive branch, and the courts have the opportunity to draw clear legal lines regarding the allowable use of emerging technologies by law enforcement.”\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company later appeared to narrow this position. It acknowledged to employees it had contracts with ICE and DHS, but said it “does not presently maintain AI services contracts tied specifically to enforcement activities”.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in facing disquiet among employees over its business with federal immigration authorities. For large US tech groups, ICE and sister agency Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have long been customers, but have become increasingly controversial for their aggressive tactics and involvement in fatal shootings.\n\nLast week, Amazon workers and activists protested outside the company’s Seattle headquarters, demanding the company cut ties with federal immigration agencies. The company benefits from a series of large cloud deals with DHS to provide cloud infrastructure to ICE and CBP.\n\nAt Google, which provides cloud services to both agencies, more than 1,300 workers have signed a recent petition with a similar set of demands. “DHS is violating civil and national law as well as civil and human rights,” the petition reads. “We must end our complicity in powering them.”\n\nBeyond the headlines: inside stories from the Guardian’s investigations team.

    "description": "Anni Chen says vibe coding is hard to resist. It speeds up her productivity, but she doesn't trust it blindly.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Anni Chen, who has worked at Amazon for about three-and-a-half years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified her employment history.\n\nI'm a tech lead at Amazon responsible for deploying large-scale generative AI and LLM-driven systems. I focus on what we call memory, which powers personalization in generative AI experiences across Amazon.\n\nI vibe code every day. It's definitely a productivity boost.\n\nFor debugging or small tasks, I sometimes treat it like a lottery. Maybe it will produce something amazing. Sometimes, it does.\n\nVibe coding helps me brainstorm what the solution could look like, even if I don't adopt the final solution it proposes. Vibe coding also speeds up the time spent rewriting code when you realize a requirement wasn't covered.\n\nWhen I vibe code, it's always iterative. I give it the basic information it needs, it produces a version, then I check it — similar to a code review with coworkers. I might say, \"You missed this part\" or \"You missed that part.\"\n\nThe AI sometimes fixes issues but introduces something new. You have to keep an eye on it.\n\nFor complex tasks, you need more double-checking. But even with the extra checking, it's still faster.\n\nI was working with a partner team and ran into complex locking issues. Without an LLM, I might have taken a day to research possible solutions, especially since it was relatively new to me.\n\nWithin 15 minutes, I brainstormed with the LLM about possible solutions. I pointed out weaknesses in its suggestions and asked it to improve them. In 15 minutes, I had a proposal to send to the team.\n\nTechnical knowledge helps — you know what's a good solution and what's not. You know what tastes good, but you don't know what dishes are available. The LLM brings up all the dishes, and you choose.\n\nStill, I'm hesitant to use vibe coding directly in production.\n\nLLMs are very good at solving problems, but sometimes they make implicit assumptions you don't realize they're making. If you don't tell it explicitly, for example, that something needs to work for multi-threading, it might just produce the minimum version that works, but when it's large-scale or productionized, it could crash.\n\nNon-technical builders could tell an LLM to build something that handles millions of users. But if you have zero technical knowledge, it's hard to anticipate constraints upfront. If you don't tell the model the implicit assumptions, it won't respect those constraints. Later, you'll run into problems.\n\nNon-technical people might use the LLM to fix issues reactively. But technical people can anticipate constraints proactively and prevent problems in the first place.\n\nTechnical people also understand vibe-coded content better, and they're in a better position to understand what LLMs are good at and not good at. For example, knowing how they're trained and why they're weaker at certain tasks like math. That understanding helps you master them as tools.\n\nWhen you scale to one million or 100 million customers, systems need to be coded differently to handle that scale.\n\nInitially, leadership pushed vibe coding. Our team is a GenAI team, so we were naturally more receptive. In non-GenAI teams, engineers initially reacted like, \"No, I won't let AI do my job. I don't trust AI-generated code.\"\n\nAfter people tried it, attitudes shifted. People realized it's pretty good sometimes. Now it's more widely adopted.\n\nIt's very hard to resist vibe coding nowadays. If you're an employee, leadership sees the productivity boost and will encourage you to use it.\n\nWhen your peers are using it and coding faster, it's hard to resist. If you can't keep up with the speed, it becomes difficult to collaborate.\n\nEven if you resist, you still consume AI passively. AI comments are embedded in code reviews. So even if you don't vibe code directly, you're still interacting with AI outputs.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding? Contact this reporter at cmlee@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "In Europe, there's been a lot of handwringing over why there are very few large, successful tech companies in the region. Peter Steinberger, the creator of the agentic AI hit OpenClaw, has an answer.\n\nSteinberger was recently hired by OpenAI and is moving from Europe to the US. An Austrian by birth, he previously split his time between London and Vienna.\n\nOn X, a professor from a European university asked why Europe couldn't retain this tech talent.\n\nSteinberger replied that most people in the US are enthusiastic, while in Europe, he's scolded about responsibility and regulations.\n\nIf he built a company in Europe, he would struggle with strict labor regulations and similar rules, he added.\n\nAt OpenAI, he said most employees work 6 to 7 days a week and are paid accordingly. In Europe, that would be illegal, he added.\n\nThe most valuable company in Europe is Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML, valued at about $550 billion. In contrast, there are 10 US companies worth more than $1 trillion. Most of these are tech companies.\n\nIn 2024, a landmark EU report found that the region had fallen behind the US, particularly in innovation. It proposed a series of changes to tackle the problem, but by the end of 2025, few of the recommendations had been implemented.\n\nSteinberger said he was hopeful about EU INC, an effort to create a single corporate legal framework to make it simpler to run a business across the region.\n\nBut this seems to be \"fizzling out,\" he wrote on X. \"Watered down, too much egoistic national interest that ultimately hurts everyone.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Why an A.I. Video of Tom Cruise Battling Brad Pitt Spooked Hollywood",
    "description": "A 15-second clip created by an artificial intelligence tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance appears more cinematic than anything so far.",
    "fullText": "It took only a 15-second clip of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt duking it out on a crumbling rooftop at twilight to draw swift outrage, and sizable fear, from Hollywood over the last few days.\n\nThe widely circulated video was created by the Irish director Ruairi Robinson using Seedance 2.0, a powerful artificial intelligence video generation tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance. It had plenty of the bells and whistles of a big-budget Hollywood film: sweeping camera angles, stunt choreography, crisp sound effects and haunting music.\n\nWith a two-sentence prompt and the click of a button, Seedance had produced a stunningly realistic result that was a drastic improvement over previously generated artificial intelligence videos, often shoddy clips known as A.I. slop. This video was so convincing that it drew near immediate condemnation from some of Hollywood’s top organizations and companies.\n\nRhett Reese, a scriptwriter known for his “Deadpool” films, said in an interview that the Cruise-Pitt video had sent a “cold shiver” up his spine.\n\n“For all of us who work in the industry and devoted our careers and lives to it, I just think it’s nothing short of terrifying,” he said. “I could just see it costing jobs all over the place.”\n\nByteDance released Seedance 2.0 last week, nearly two months after a previous version had failed to prompt much anger. A news release from the company praised the updated tool’s “physical accuracy, realism and controllability,” which it said was suitable for the needs of “professional-grade creative scenarios.”\n\n“The creation process,” the release went on, “is more natural and efficient, allowing users to control their creations like a true ‘director.’”\n\nUsers promptly flocked to the platform to spin up their own content. An alternate ending to “Game of Thrones” went viral, as did a video of the notoriously beefing rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake burying the hatchet on “The Tonight Show,” and one of Samara Morgan, the vengeful girl in “The Ring” horror films, emerging from an old television set to pet a cat.\n\nRobinson himself posted additional videos, including of Pitt and Cruise battling a robot, and of Pitt sparring with a sword-wielding “zombie ninja.”\n\nAt the same time, Hollywood was swift to sit up straight. Charles Rivkin, the chairman and chief executive of the Motion Picture Association, called on ByteDance to “immediately cease its infringing activity,” saying in a statement that Seedance 2.0 had engaged in the unauthorized use of copyrighted works on a “massive scale.” Human Artistry Campaign, a global coalition that advocates using A.I. “with respect for the irreplaceable artists, performers and creatives,” said on social media that unauthorized works generated by Seedance 2.0 violated the “most basic aspects of personal autonomy.”\n\nDisney, which in a watershed $1 billion deal last year agreed to allow OpenAI’s Sora users to generate video content with its characters, sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing it of supplying Seedance with a “pirated library” of Disney’s characters — “as if Disney’s coveted intellectual property were free public-domain clip art.”\n\nByteDance, which also owns TikTok and has been valued at $480 billion in the private markets, said in a statement that it respected intellectual property rights and was aware of the concerns about Seedance.\n\n“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” the statement said.\n\nAs last year’s deal between Disney and OpenAI suggests, Hollywood has for years wrestled with how to manage the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence. The concerns outlined by Reese echoed the Writers Guild strike in 2023, when for months thousands of union members demanded that studios institute guardrails protecting them from having their jobs or their intellectual property stolen by A.I. In the end, the group won guarantees that A.I. would not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation.\n\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors and media artists, said its contracts had specific and enforceable rules about digital replication. The kind of material represented by the Cruise-Pitt battle, he said, “could not be produced by any of the signatories to our contracts — the studios, the streamers — without the specific, informed consent of those individuals.”\n\nAccording to Crabtree-Ireland, the real concern is that, even if videos generated by Seedance and other A.I. platforms “are not malicious in intent,” they could “really violate someone’s right to control how their image, their likeness and their voice is used.”\n\nNot everyone is awed by Seedance’s latest technology. Heather Anne Campbell, an executive producer and a writer on the animated series “Rick and Morty,” said her social media accounts last week had been inundated with Seedance-generated clips of anime, sci-fi and unlikely superhero battles. But she is not yet worried, she said, about losing her job to the technology.\n\n“Everybody is, I think, swept up by the circus that came to town and is showing off,” she said. “I haven’t seen anything good yet. Nothing that has taken my breath away, nothing that is poignant, nothing that is provocative even. It’s all just garbage.”\n\nCampbell added that A.I. services like Seedance were at best “averaging machines,” and argued that the greatest art was never made quickly or impersonally.\n\nStill, some people working in Hollywood find it difficult to imagine that studios will not come to see A.I. as a cost-saving shortcut. “It would be cheaper to have A.I. write a screenplay than it would be for me to write a screenplay,” Reese, the “Deadpool” writer, said. “I just know that in the back of my mind, that’s where the terror comes from.”\n\nFor Reese, a long-term answer to the unease that A.I. will reorder Hollywood could not come quickly enough.\n\n“If I could wave my magic wand and make A.I. go away, at least in the creative field,” he said, “I would absolutely wave the wand.”",

    "description": "The United States plans to deploy more high-tech missile systems to the Philippines to help deter aggression in the South China Sea, where the treaty allies on Tuesday condemned what they called China...",
    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States plans to deploy more high-tech missile systems to the Philippines to help deter aggression in the South China Sea, where the treaty allies on Tuesday condemned what they called China’s “illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities.”\n\nBeijing has repeatedly expressed alarm over the installation in the northern Philippines of a U.S. mid-range missile system called the Typhon in 2024 and of an anti-ship missile launcher last year. It said the U.S. weapons were aimed at containing China’s rise and warned that these were a threat to regional stability.\n\nChina has asked the Philippines to withdraw the missile launchers from its territory, but officials led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have rejected the demand.\n\nU.S. and Philippine officials held annual talks Monday in Manila on broadening security, political and economic engagements and boosting collaboration with regional security allies.\n\nThe U.S. and the Philippines outlined in a joint statement Tuesday specific defense and security plans for this year, including joint military exercises, Washington's support to help modernize the Philippine military and efforts “to increase deployments of U.S. cutting-edge missile and unmanned systems to the Philippines.”\n\nThe longtime allies \"underscored their support for preserving freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and other lawful uses of the sea for all nations,” the statement said.\n\n“Both sides condemned China’s illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive activities in the South China Sea, recognizing their adverse effects on regional peace and stability and the economies of the Indo-Pacific and beyond,” it added.\n\nConfrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard forces have spiked in the disputed waters in recent years. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in the territorial standoffs.\n\nNeither side elaborated on the planned missile deployments but Philippine ambassador to Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, who took part in Monday’s talks, said U.S. and Filipino defense officials discussed the possible deployment this year of “upgraded” types of U.S. missile launchers that the Philippines may eventually decide to purchase.\n\n“It’s a kind of system that’s really very sophisticated and will be deployed here in the hope that, down the road, we will be able to get our own,” Romualdez told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Typhon missile system that the U.S. Army deployed to the main northern Philippine region of Luzon in April 2024 and an anti-missile launcher called the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System that was deployed in April last year also to Luzon have remained in the Philippines, Romualdez said.\n\nDuring joint drills, U.S. forces have exhibited the missile systems to batches of Filipino forces to familiarize them with the weapons’ capabilities and usage, military officials said.\n\nRomualdez said the U.S. missile deployments to the Philippines did not aim to antagonize any country.\n\n“It’s purely for deterrence,” he said. “Every time the Chinese show any kind of aggression, it only strengthens our resolve to have these types.”\n\nThe Typhon missile launchers, a land-based weapon, can fire the Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range, from the northern Philippine region of Luzon.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Marines deployed the anti-ship missile launcher, the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System, to Batan island in the northernmost Philippine province of Batanes, which faces the Bashi Channel just south of Taiwan.\n\nThe sea passage is a critical trade and military route that the U.S. and Chinese militaries have tried to gain strategic control of.",

    "fullText": "Industry using ‘diversionary’ tactics, says analyst, as energy-hungry complex functions such as video generation and deep research proliferate\n\nTech companies are conflating traditional artificial intelligence with generative AI when claiming the energy-hungry technology could help avert climate breakdown, according to a report.\n\nMost claims that AI can help avert climate breakdown refer to machine learning and not the energy-hungry chatbots and image generation tools driving the sector’s explosive growth of gas-guzzling datacentres, the analysis of 154 statements found.\n\nThe research, commissioned by nonprofits including Beyond Fossil Fuels and Climate Action Against Disinformation, did not find a single example where popular tools such as Google’s Gemini or Microsoft’s Copilot were leading to a “material, verifiable, and substantial” reduction in planet-heating emissions.\n\nKetan Joshi, an energy analyst and author of the report, said the industry’s tactics were “diversionary” and relied on tried and tested methods that amount to “greenwashing”.\n\nHe likened it to fossil fuel companies advertising their modest investments in solar panels and overstating the potential of carbon capture.\n\n“These technologies only avoid a minuscule fraction of emissions relative to the massive emissions of their core business,” said Joshi. “Big tech took that approach and upgraded and expanded it.”\n\nMost of the claims that were scrutinised came from an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, which was reviewed by leading tech companies, and corporate reports from Google and Microsoft.\n\nThe IEA report – which devoted two chapters to the potential climate benefits of traditional AI – had a roughly even split between claims that rested on academic publications, corporate websites and those that had no evidence, according to the analysis. For Google and Microsoft, most claims lacked evidence.\n\nThe analysis, released during the AI Impact Summit in Delhi this week, argues the tech industry has misleadingly presented climate solutions and carbon pollution as a package deal by “muddling” types of AI.\n\nSasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, an open-source AI platform and community, who was not involved in the report, said it added nuance to a debate that often lumped very different applications together.\n\n“When we talk about AI that’s relatively bad for the planet, it’s mostly generative AI and large language models,” said Luccioni, who has pushed the industry to be more transparent about its carbon footprint.\n\n“When we talk about AI that’s ‘good’ for the planet, it’s often predictive models, extractive models, or old-school AI models.”\n\nGreen claims even for traditional AI tended to rely on weak forms of evidence that had not been independently verified, the analysis found. Only 26% of the green claims that were studied cited published academic research, while 36% did not cite evidence at all.\n\nOne of the earliest examples identified in the report was a widespread claim that AI could help mitigate 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nThe figure, which Google repeated as recently as April last year, came from a report it commissioned from BCG, a consulting firm, which cited a blogpost it wrote in 2021 that attributed the figure to its “experience with clients”.\n\nDatacentres consume just 1% of the world’s electricity but their share of US electricity is projected to more than double to 8.6% by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. The IEA predicts they will account for at least 20% of the rich world’s growth in electricity demand to the end of the decade.\n\nWhile the energy consumption of a simple text query to a large language model such as ChatGPT may be as little as running a lightbulb for a minute, partial industry disclosures suggest, it rises considerably for complex functions such as video generation and deep research, and has troubled some energy researchers with the speed and scale of its growth.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said: “Our estimated emissions reductions are based on a robust substantiation process grounded in the best available science, and we have transparently shared the principles and methodology that guide it.”\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment, while the IEA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJoshi said the discourse around AI’s climate benefits needed to be “brought back to reality”.\n\n“The false coupling of a big problem and a small solution serves as a distraction from the very preventable harms being done through unrestricted datacentre expansion,” he said.",

    "title": "New GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator Parts Reverse Engineered From ATACMS Ballistic Missile Tech",
    "description": "Replacing GBU-57s dropped on Iran highlights issues that come from being locked into a single contractor, which the Pentagon is trying to change.",
    "fullText": "Last year, the U.S. government was able to reverse engineer a critical subcomponent for the 30,000-pound GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bunker buster bomb. Leveraging technology from the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missile saved years of work that would have otherwise been necessary to “eliminate obsolescence issues and meet operational demands.” The reverse-engineering effort also highlights the impacts of being locked into a single vendor, and underscores why the Pentagon is now pushing to make changes to, if not end this practice.\n\nDetails about the reverse-engineered component and other aspects of the MOP program were contained in a recent U.S. Air Force contracting announcement regarding efforts to replenish stocks of those bombs following Operation Midnight Hammer. During that operation, B-2 Spirit stealth bombers dropped 14 GBU-57/Bs on Iranian nuclear facilities. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) had to produce a detailed justification for awarding a sole-source contract to Boeing for the production of new MOPs and the sustainment of the existing inventory. Boeing is the bomb’s current prime contractor. A redacted copy of that document is available online.\n\n“The Government has a follow-on need for additional production of [redacted] MOP Tail Kits with projected delivery starting 10 January 2028 to replace expended units and reach the United States Air Force’s [redacted],” the so-called Justification & Approval (J&A) document explains. “The Government has a need for replenishment production of GBU-57 MOP weapon system components.”\n\nIt is unclear what the total size of the GBU-57/B inventory was before or after Operation Midnight Hammer. As of 2015, prime contractor Boeing had delivered at least 20 of the bombs, according to the Air Force. However, additional orders have been reported over the years. In 2024, a story from Bloomberg had also said that a facility in Oklahoma was being expanded to help triple or even quadruple the annual output of these bombs.\n\nThe MOP’s tail kit, also designated KMU-612/B, contains the bomb’s GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guidance package and other systems. It is combined with a BLU-127/B penetrating “warhead” and other components, including advanced fuzes designed to help produce the maximum destructive effect on a target after burrowing deep down into the ground, to create a complete GBU-57/B bomb, or all-up-round (AUR).\n\n“In August of 2025, the Government successfully reverse engineered a critical subcomponent of the MOP weapon system saving 4-years of design work and enabling the utilization of existing Army ATACMS technology to eliminate obsolescence issues and meet operational demands,” according to the J&A document. “However, the time to reverse engineer all MOP components would result in unacceptable delays in meeting mission requirements.”\n\nThe MOP J&A does not elaborate on the ATACMS technology in question, or what company or companies may now be in line to produce the resulting subcomponent for the bombs. Lockheed Martin is the current prime contractor for ATACMS, a family of short-range ballistic missiles that you can read more about here. It should also be noted that the U.S. military’s reverse-engineering parts of key weapon systems is not entirely uncommon, especially if the original source of the components in question has gone out of business or otherwise no longer exists.\n\nThe J&A document says it would take an estimated 60 months, or five years, to create an entirely new MOP tail kit design and then go through the required processes to certify it for operational use. It also explains why the KMU-612/B tail kit, specifically, is so central to the need to award a new sole-source contract to Boeing.\n\n“With regards to IP [intellectual property] rights, The [Redacted] Company is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MOP weapon system and retains ownership of the intellectual property data associated with the munition’s tail kit,” it explains. “In particular, [redacted] owns the technical data package and manufacturing process methodologies of the tailkit unit entirely. [Redacted] has uniquely acquired expertise over a period of ~18 years of adapting this specialized weapon to meet evolving mission needs as MOP transitioned from proof-of-concept to full operational capability. This expertise pertains, but is not limited to, knowledge of the guidance algorithms, navigation systems, hardware components, specialized test equipment, and software critical to producing and sustaining the MOP weapon system.”\n\n“The other components and sub-components, as noted above, have been proprietary to [redacted] from the inception of this weapon system. The USG [U.S. government] does not own or control, via license or by other IP rights, any computer software, methodologies, or technical drawings,” the document adds. “[Redacted] was queried in August 2025 as to the potential of selling IP rights to the USG for the MOP weapon system and the USG was denied.”\n\nThat being said, “over the course of the ~18 years of MOP development to the AURs acquired today the USG has, at certain junctures, been able to separate from the sole-source environment for this weapon with Boeing,” the J&A notes. “The USG was able to break away the Warhead Cases for the MOP under a weapon design agent effort, thereby giving the USG complete IP control over the Warhead TDP. Based on the IP ownership of this TDP the USG awards contracts competitively.”\n\nThe prospect now of new U.S. strikes against targets in Iran, including deeply buried nuclear sites and other facilities, highlights the continued importance of the depth and readiness of the GBU-57/B inventory. There is clear evidence that Iranian authorities have taken new steps to try to shield key elements of the country’s nuclear program from future attacks, either from the air or on the ground. MOP has been and continues to be the only conventional munition capable of prosecuting many of these targets, and was specifically designed from the outset with sites in Iran top of mind. A conflict with Iran is not the only scenario where the bombs would be relevant. North Korea and China, among others, have also invested heavily in underground and other hardened facilities.\n\nThe huge bunker busters are otherwise the definition of high-value, low-density munitions. At present, they can only be employed operationally by B-2 bombers. Each B-2 can also only carry two of the bombs at once. MOP is expected to be an important part of the arsenal of the future B-21 Raider, which is smaller than the B-2 and is expected to be able to carry a single one of these bunker busters.\n\nThe details in the MOP J&A document also underscore broader issues surrounding IP rights and ‘vendor lock’ in the U.S. defense contracting space that have increasingly been coming to the forefront in recent years. Competition inherently creates opportunities to lower costs and diversify supply chains. A broader supplier base also offers benefits when it comes to scaling up production of key subcomponents and complete systems.\n\nThe continued extent of Lockheed Martin’s control over the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is perhaps the most widely known example of the negative impacts of vendor lock. U.S. officials have been outspoken about the maintenance and sustenance challenges this has created, especially when it comes to the timely sourcing of spare parts, and the operational risks this creates. TWZ previously explored the particular issues surrounding the F-35 in an in-depth feature.\n\nForeign F-35 operators, especially in Europe, are now also facing regular questions about what could happen to the jets if the U.S. were to cut off access to various sustainment pipelines in light of new diplomatic strains with Washington. Just this past weekend, Dutch State Secretary for Defense Gijs Tuinman caused a stir when he asserted it would be possible to “jailbreak an F-35 just like an iPhone” if necessary, as you can read more about here.\n\nBIG: Dutch Defence Minister Gijs Tuinman hints that software independence is possible for F-35 jets. \n\nHe literally said you can “jailbreak” an F-35. \n\nWhen asked if Europe can modify it without US approval: \n\n“That’s not the point… we’ll see whether the Americans will show… pic.twitter.com/f11cGvtYsO\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) February 15, 2026\n\nIn recent years, successive U.S. administrations have made securing greater IP rights and ensuring opportunities for competition key elements in negotiating new defense contractors. As an example, the Air Force previously made clear that avoiding the F-35 program’s vendor lock was a top priority for the acquisition of the F-47 sixth-generation stealth fighter. President Donald Trump’s administration is now pursuing a host of new contracting reforms, in part to further break up the locks that private companies have on programs like the Joint Strike Fighter.\n\n“We will enable third-party integration without prime contractor bottlenecks. Success will be measured by the ability of qualified vendors to independently develop, test and integrate replaceable — excuse me, replacement modules at the component level throughout the system life cycle,” War Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a speech last November. “There’s no more complacency and no more monopolies.”\n\nAt that time, Hegseth had also acknowledged Byzantine processes and other contracting hurdles that the U.S. military had created for itself over the years.\n\nHow “the sole-source environment” surrounding the GBU-57/B continues to evolve now remains to be seen. A successor to that bomb, called the Next Generation Penetrator (NGP), is also now in development, and Boeing is involved in that effort, too. The Pentagon’s experiences with MOP, together with the new contracting reform push, are likely to inform how the replacement weapons are acquired.\n\nIn the meantime, U.S. authorities continue to try to free elements of the MOP program from vendor lock, including now by repurposing technology originally designed for the ATACMS short-range ballistic missile.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "description": "A hierarchy of simplicity for every layer of the stack. Flask over Django, HTML over React, bare server over Kubernetes, small models over the latest GPT. And when each one actually earns its complexity.",
    "fullText": "2026-02-14 · engineering, architecture, opinion, simplicity, ai\n\nThere's a mass delusion in software engineering that more tools equals more capability. That if Netflix uses Kubernetes, you should too. That if Facebook built React, your three-page marketing site needs it. That the \"modern stack\" is modern for a reason, and choosing anything simpler means you're behind.\n\nIt's nonsense. Most of the time, the simplest tool that solves your problem is the right tool. Not the most popular one. Not the one with the best conference talks. The one with the fewest moving parts.\n\nHere's how I think about technology choices, layer by layer.\n\nIf you're building an API, start with FastAPI or Flask. One file. A few routes. You can read the entire application in ten minutes. There's no ORM you didn't ask for, no admin panel you'll never use, no middleware stack you need to understand before you can return JSON.\n\nDjango is a different tool for a different problem. It's an application framework, not a microframework. It makes decisions for you: how your database models work, how authentication works, how your admin interface looks. If you're building a product with user accounts, permissions, a database-backed admin panel, and you have a team of five or more, Django saves you months. It's opinionated in ways that keep large teams from making inconsistent choices.\n\nThe mistake is reaching for Django when you need three endpoints and a database query. You'll spend more time learning what Django wants than building what you want.\n\nSpring is the same idea taken further. Enterprise teams, compliance requirements, complex service meshes. If you're at a bank with 200 engineers and a mandate to use Java, Spring is genuinely good at what it does. If you're two people building a SaaS, it'll bury you.\n\nThe rule: Pick the framework whose complexity matches your problem's complexity. If you can describe your backend in one sentence, you probably need a one-file framework.\n\nThis is where the industry has lost its mind the most.\n\nPlain HTML with some CSS works for an astonishing number of things. This site you're reading is static HTML. No JavaScript framework. No build step. No node_modules folder with 800 packages. I write Markdown, a Python script generates HTML, and Nginx serves it. It loads in under a second on any connection.\n\nWhen you need interactivity, HTMX is a revelation. It lets you add dynamic behavior by writing HTML attributes instead of JavaScript. Need a button that loads content without a page refresh? One attribute. Need a form that submits asynchronously? One attribute. You keep writing HTML and your server keeps rendering HTML. No JSON APIs, no client-side state management, no hydration bugs.\n\nSvelte sits in a similar sweet spot. It compiles to vanilla JavaScript. No virtual DOM. No runtime library. The output is small and fast. If you need more interactivity than HTMX gives you but don't want the overhead of a full SPA framework, Svelte is excellent.\n\nReact makes sense when you're building a genuinely complex, stateful application. Think Figma. Think Google Docs. Think Notion. Applications where the UI has hundreds of independent state changes, where components need to communicate across deep trees, where you need a component ecosystem because you're building something too large for one team to own entirely.\n\nThe problem is that people use React for everything. Landing pages. Blogs. Documentation sites. Marketing pages. I've seen teams spend three sprints setting up Next.js for a site that could have been twenty HTML files. The framework overhead, the build pipeline, the SSR complexity, the hydration issues. All of it unnecessary. All of it actively making the product worse by making it slower and harder to maintain.\n\nI run this site on a Raspberry Pi behind Nginx. The deploy script is 40 lines of bash. rsync copies files, Nginx serves them. If the Pi dies, I buy a new one for $50 and rsync again. Total infrastructure cost: about 5 watts of electricity. Twelve months in, it's still running.\n\nFor most small projects and early-stage products, a single server with systemd services is all you need. You SSH in. You know what's running. You can read the logs. When something breaks, you fix it directly. There's one machine, one set of logs, one reality to debug.\n\nDocker containers make sense when you need reproducible environments. When your app has dependencies that conflict with other things on the same machine. When you need to hand off a project and say \"run docker compose up and it works.\" When you're deploying the same service across staging and production and need them to be identical. Containers solve real problems.\n\nBut Docker adds a layer. Now you're debugging things inside a container that works differently than your local machine. Now your logs are in a different place. Now you need to understand volumes, networks, build caches. Every layer you add is a layer you need to understand when things go wrong.\n\nKubernetes makes sense at scale. When you have dozens of services, when you need automated scaling, when you need rolling deployments with zero downtime across multiple regions. When you have a platform team whose full-time job is managing infrastructure. Google built Kubernetes because Google has Google-sized problems.\n\nIf you're three engineers running a SaaS with a few thousand users, Kubernetes is not solving your problem. It's replacing your problem with a harder problem. You'll spend more time writing YAML manifests and debugging pod scheduling than building your product.\n\nI've watched startups with five engineers spend months setting up Kubernetes clusters. The CTO wanted it on the resume. The engineers wanted to learn it. The product needed a VPS and a Postgres database. They could have shipped in a week and scaled later. Instead they built infrastructure for a million users while they had twelve.\n\nSQLite is the most underrated database in existence. It's a single file. No server process. No connection management. No port configuration. It handles more concurrent reads than most apps will ever need. If your data fits on one machine and you don't need concurrent writes from multiple processes, SQLite is fast, reliable, and effectively zero maintenance.\n\nPostgres is the right choice for most production applications. It's battle-tested, well-documented, and handles basically everything. JSON columns, full-text search, geospatial queries, pub/sub. Before you reach for Redis, Elasticsearch, or any other specialized database, check if Postgres can already do what you need. It usually can.\n\nDistributed databases (CockroachDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) solve problems that 99% of applications don't have. If you need writes across multiple regions with single-digit millisecond latency, sure. If you need to handle millions of writes per second, sure. If you're building a CRUD app with a few thousand users, a single Postgres instance on a $20/month VPS will serve you for years.\n\nThis is the one closest to home because I build tools around this exact principle at NehmeAI Labs.\n\nThe default instinct right now is to throw the biggest frontier model at every problem. Summarization? Frontier model. Classification? Frontier model. Extracting a date from an email? Frontier model. It's the Kubernetes of AI: massively capable, massively overkill for most tasks.\n\nA 4B parameter model trained on a specific task will outperform a 400B general model on that task. Not sometimes. Reliably. FlashCheck is a 4B model that detects hallucinations in RAG pipelines. It scores 91.7% on RAGTruth. It beats Llama 405B on this specific task while using 100x less compute. Not because small models are magic, but because a focused model doesn't waste capacity on things it doesn't need to know.\n\nThe same logic applies to inference costs. Most teams routing everything through their most expensive model are sending simple prompts to a frontier model because they never measured whether a cheaper one could handle it. RightSize exists to answer exactly that question: it evaluates your real prompt traffic and finds where smaller, cheaper models are sufficient. Typical savings are 50-100x. Not because the quality drops. Because most prompts don't need the most powerful model available.\n\nThis maps directly to the philosophy of this entire post. Your inference costs are a design choice, not a fact of life. You don't start with the biggest model and optimize later. You start with the smallest model that works and scale up only where the task demands it.\n\nThe pattern is always the same. Start simple. Measure. Add complexity only where the data tells you to.\n\nI'm not arguing that simple is always right. I'm arguing that it's the right default. You should start simple and add complexity when you feel the pain, not before.\n\nHere's when you genuinely need the heavier tools:\n\nLarge teams. Django's opinions prevent 50 engineers from making 50 different architectural choices. React's component model lets teams work on the same frontend without stepping on each other. Kubernetes lets a platform team provide self-service infrastructure to dozens of product teams. The overhead pays for itself through coordination.\n\nCompliance and enterprise. Banks, healthcare, government. When you need audit trails, role-based access at every layer, and the ability to prove exactly what ran in production six months ago. Spring Boot's security stack and Kubernetes' declarative infrastructure make compliance audits possible at scale.\n\nGenuine scale. When your SQLite file would be terabytes. When your single server can't handle the traffic. When you actually have the users and the load that demand distributed systems. The key word is \"actually.\" Not \"projected.\" Not \"hoped for.\" Actually. And when you do migrate, be honest that it's a rewrite, not a simple upgrade.\n\nComplex client-side applications. If your users spend hours in your app doing complex, stateful work (design tools, collaborative editors, data dashboards), React or similar frameworks earn their complexity budget.\n\nEvery tool you add is a tool you need to:\n\nA three-person startup using Kubernetes, React, GraphQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Terraform has the operational complexity of a 50-person engineering org without the people to manage it. They'll spend 70% of their time on infrastructure and 30% on the product. That ratio should be inverted.\n\nThe best engineers I know aren't the ones who use the most tools. They're the ones who use the fewest tools that solve the problem. They resist the urge to optimize for problems they don't have. They ship with boring technology and save the interesting technology for when it's actually needed.\n\nSimple isn't a limitation. It's a discipline. And the debugging is a lot easier when there are fewer layers to dig through.",

Kickoff time will be announced later, but the game will be nationally televised on ESPN.\n\nThe move continues a recent trend under Sanders, whose program has become a regular in standalone windows. Colorado’s opener has now been shifted off a traditional Saturday for the third straight season and for the 12th time in the last 14 years. Last season’s opener against Georgia Tech at Folsom Field was played on a Friday night.\n\nThe Sept. 3 matchup marks the second game of a home-and-home series between the programs. Georgia Tech holds a 1-0 edge after a 27-20 win in Boulder last season. The Buffaloes will look to even the series in what will be just their second game played in the state of Georgia. Colorado previously faced Georgia in 2006.\n\nMore:Shedeur Sanders’ jersey retirement was 'breaking point' for Colorado legend\n\nThe trip to Atlanta also carries added significance for Sanders, who starred there with the Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta Braves. On Oct. 11, 1992, he famously played in both an NFL and MLB game on the same day. Sanders was taken by the Falcons fifth overall in the 1989 NFL Draft.\n\nColorado’s home opener is scheduled for Sept. 12 against Weber State.

    "title": "NatWest hails progress after £1.2B spent on tech last year, but true AI",
    "description": "Bank described the last 12 months of its tech transformation as ‘the year of [AI] deployment at scale.’",
    "fullText": "NatWest bank invested £1.2bn into its information technology transformation in 2025 and saw huge productivity gains as a result, but this year will see artificial intelligence (AI) become truly transformative for customers and staff.\n\nThe bank said it has already freed up £100m in funds as a result of simplification and the use of the cloud. AI is at the centre of the bank’s plans, with 2025 seeing the technology deployed across the company “at scale”.\n\nHeadline figures for 2025 saw the bank’s software engineers generate 35% of its code through AI software development tools, all 60,000 staff given access to AI productivity software, and thousands of human hours saved. Last year, the bank also embarked on a major collaboration with AI supplier OpenAI.\n\nOther tech achievements in 2025 included the hiring of 1,000 software developers, 100 new features developed on its retail banking app, the appointment of its first chief AI research officer and the establishment of its AI research office.\n\nIn a blog post, NatWest Group CIO Scott Marcar said this year will see the bank take advantage of the AI “building blocks” deployed last year.\n\n“The only certainty is that how customers bank will look very different in the future,” he said. “That’s why being closer to them, with insight and trust, matters more than ever. As technology reshapes how people live, work and bank, we’ve put in place the building blocks to understand, respond to and serve customers’ fast evolving needs,” wrote Marcar.\n\n“Last year brought AI deployment at scale across NatWest, and as we move into 2026, the transformative benefits are becoming more of a reality for our customers and colleagues – delivering growth, greater productivity, and, most importantly, deepening relationships – so that we can be a trusted partner for tomorrow’s banking,” he added.\n\nFrom a staff perspective, all staff now have access to AI tools including Microsoft Copilot Chat and the bank’s internal large language model (LLM), with more than half reported to have taken additional training.\n\nAccording to the bank, more than 70,000 hours were saved through automated AI call summaries in its retail business, while relationship managers in its wealth business were able to spend 30% more time on customer conversations by using AI. According to NatWest, through agentic and voice AI, customers will receive “more intuitive, personalised and seamless interactions” this year.\n\nIn the next few months, 25,000 NatWest customers will have access to its agentic financial assistant within Cora, its customer-facing agentic AI assistant. “Underpinned by OpenAI models, customers will be able to ask natural language questions about their recent spending, in their own words, on their app,” said the bank.\n\nThe bank will then experiment with voice-to-voice AI capability, which aims to provide “human-like empathy, tone and inflection”.\n\nAs part of its wider multi-year digital transformation, NatWest has added around 6,000 tech staff since 2021. In 2025 alone, it recruited 1,000 software engineers through its India Hub in Bengaluru. Its chief AI researcher, Maja Pantic, is working with AI in areas such as audiovisual conversational AI, multi-biometrics and proprietary small language models.\n\nMarcar wrote: “We can’t underestimate the scale of the work we have done to date to rebuild our technology foundations to make us faster, safer and more resilient. A scalable, modular tech stack now underpins how we deliver new products and services, how we integrate with partners, and how we provide the protection and operational resilience customers expect.”\n\nHe said the bank has been moving away from legacy systems in an “inside-out” transformation. It has also created a single, connected view of each customer. “We can anticipate needs faster, remove friction from everyday banking and make onboarding more seamless,” he wrote on his blog post.\n\nMarcar stressed that the proliferation of AI will support human workers, adding: “It’s a future where the expertise of our colleagues is augmented by the intelligence and ease of modern technology.”",

    "description": "An updated Air Force dress code policy strictly prohibits a popular wearable device for troops. Here is why officials say the tech is a security risk.",
    "fullText": "The United States military is among the largest and most technologically sophisticated in the world. Needless to say, it has access to some extraordinary equipment, with the U.S. Air Force operating some of the fastest fighter jets in service today. These are aircraft that most civilians will never ever come close to flying, but by the same token, there is some civilian technology that Air Force personnel are not permitted to use while in uniform.\n\nSmart glasses are becoming increasingly popular, with International Data Corporation noting in July 2025 that the second-generation Meta Ray-Ban glasses captured nearly two-thirds of the market after a successful end to 2024. The broader concept of smart glasses, however, touches on significant fears about privacy and security, meaning that there's a smart reason not to wear models such as Meta's AI glasses. It's also for this reason that the Air Force has prohibited the wearing of such devices. On January 9, 2026, the Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs issued new guidance targeting \"dress and personal appearance.\" The policy noted that, with regard to traditional eyewear, specific shades of frames and lenses for sunglasses and eyeglasses must be adhered to, while \"It is unauthorized to wear mirrored lenses or smart glasses with photo, video or artificial intelligence capabilities while in uniform.\"\n\nElsewhere in this memo, the iconic duty-identifier patches were brought back, powerful symbols of pride in a shared role and expertise. This same collective spirit, however, means that any Air Force member could endanger their fellow members through the use of smart glasses, which is why they were banned.\n\nIf there's one term that's pivotal to U.S. Air Force operations, it's OPSEC: Operations security. There's a wealth of information, from troop movements to the specs of particular vehicles or weapons, that could be potentially disastrous if it leaked. When smart glasses are in the picture, such a leak could occur accidentally, or even without the responsible parties knowing it happened.\n\nThis is the argument put forward by Dana Thayer, the Information Protection Chief of the 104th Fighter Wing, in a statement shared by dvids in response to this prohibition of the devices. Thayer warns that such devices can and will continue to record even when the wearer hasn't specifically set them to do so, which Thayer equates to receiving a plethora of pop-up ads about a specific product that you haven't expressly searched for online but only discussed. Imagine the conversation is about a top-secret new military operation rather than a fast-food craving, and the potential gravity of wearing smart glasses in uniform becomes obvious.\n\nAs is the case essentially anywhere AI and similar technologies are in use, there are significant advantages to be gained. Smart glasses may even serve as a viable alternative to computer monitors, for instance, increasing versatility in work environments. It's vital to be aware of the dangers too. The U.S. Army and Navy have not yet instituted such a blanket measure as an outright ban on in-uniform use of smart glasses, but perhaps they will. It's an evolving technology and an evolving situation, and the devices may find a place where their utility can be deployed, even in the most sensitive situations.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Mark Cuban expects legions of workers will be needed to implement AI at companies, creating a huge opportunity for tech-savvy young people.\n\nThe tech billionaire and former \"Shark Tank\" investor made the prediction during an August interview with TBPN, a tech talk show and podcast.\n\nAI guru Rohan Paul shared a clip of Cuban's comments over the weekend, which was widely reposted; Cuban himself shared three responses from other AI gurus on his X feed.\n\nOne declared it the \"MOST underrated clip on the internet right now.\" Another drew a parallel to Salesforce and the millions of administrative and integration roles it spawned. A third heralded a shift from generic software to customized intelligence.\n\nCuban is calling the IT services boom of the 2000s, but for intelligence instead of infrastructure. Every wave of business technology from PCs to cloud to mobile spawned a massive local services layer. The AI wave needs the same thing, and 33 million companies are waiting. \n\nThe… https://t.co/sgBXH1VJLd\n\nCuban told TBPN that when he was 24, he would walk into companies and executives would point to their secretaries and receptionists and say they didn't need a PC. Cuban recognized that as an opportunity to sell old-school bosses on the benefits of computers and teach them how to use them.\n\nHe said it's a similar situation with the latest tech wave, which some believe will render millions of human workers obsolete and trigger mass unemployment.\n\nCuban said he advises high-school and college students to not just \"learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies.\"\n\nCuban, a minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said that tens of millions of US companies don't have AI budgets or AI experts.\n\n\"This is where kids getting hired coming out of college are really going to have a unique opportunity,\" he said. They should spend their free time learning how to use different AI tools, make AI videos, and customize AI models so they can teach business leaders in any industry how to harness the tech, he added.\n\n\"That is every single job that's going to be available for kids coming out of school because every single company needs that,\" Cuban said. \"There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI and that's what people don't understand.\"\n\nCuban emphasized the opportunity isn't limited to software engineers. Many older workers are \"afraid\" to ask complex questions to AI models, he said, unlike \"kids coming out of school today that are fearless in the questions they ask and the followups and their ability to prompt.\"\n\n\"That's jobs for everybody,\" he added.",

The Quantum Circuit Inc. acquisition adds gate-model quantum technology to its established quantum-annealing platform, which could broaden the types of problems D-Wave can tackle, especially for AI and machine-learning workloads. The $10 million, two-year Quantum Computing as a Service agreement with a Fortune 100 customer and the $20 million system installation at Florida Atlantic University give the company multi-year, contract-backed visibility rather than just one-off pilot projects. For you as an investor, the key question is whether these deals become templates that can be reused with other large enterprises and institutions, or remain isolated wins. Competition from players like IonQ, Rigetti, and large tech groups such as IBM or Alphabet means execution quality, speed of product integration after the Quantum Circuit deal, and customer satisfaction on these deployments could be important differentiators.",

    "description": "\"Nobody truly knows who the long-term winners and losers of this extraordinary technology will be,\" Deutsche's Jim Reid wrote this morning.",
    "fullText": "Investors wobbled last week as they worked through the disruption AI is likely to cause across global industries, with further hiccups potentially bubbling through this week. But the reckoning should have been expected, argued Deutsche Bank in a note to clients this morning, because it is a readjustment of perhaps overly optimistic expectations.\n\nSoftware stocks in particular suffered a wipeout amid mounting concerns that large language models may replace current service offerings. Companies in the legal, IT, consulting and logistics sectors were also impacted. JP Morgan wrote last week that some $2 trillion had been wiped off software market caps alone as a result, a reality that prior to a fortnight ago, Deutsche’s Jim Reid argued had been purely academic. \n\nA 13-figure sell-off is something Reid has speculated over for some time, telling clients: “For months, my published view has been that nobody truly knows who the long term winners and losers of this extraordinary technology will be. Yet as recently as October, markets were implicitly pricing in a world where almost every tech company would come out a winner.\n\nWhy did software stocks suffer major selloffs recently?\n\nWhat caused the $2 trillion market cap wipeout?\n\nWhat makes AI disruption different from past cycles?\n\nHow are experts viewing current AI stock valuations?\n\n“Over recent weeks we’ve seen a more realistic differentiation emerge within tech—but that repricing is now rippling into the broader economy with surprising speed.”\n\nReid hasn’t been alone in his suspicion that investors had perhaps been painting over the entire stock market (and indeed wider economy) with the same, optimistic brush. Some speculators have made broad-stroke arguments that the efficiencies offered by AI will result in wins for the vast majority of companies, while others have argued that while AI is not in a bubble, there are pockets of overoptimism that may burst. \n\nJPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon is of such an opinion, explaining at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit last year: “You should be using it,” (speaking to any business that was listening). But he added a caveat, saying that back in 1996, “the internet was real,” and “you could look at the whole thing like it was a bubble.” Then he broke down the real difference that he sees—between AI, on the one hand, and generative AI, on the other. It’s an important distinction, Dimon said, while adding that “some asset prices are high, in some form of bubble territory.”\n\nIndeed, Jeremy Siegel, Emeritus Professor of Finance at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, argued that such shifts demonstrate investors are “asking the right questions.” Writing for WisdomTree a week ago, where he serves as senior economist, Siegel said: “When companies talk about $200 billion in capital expenditures, markets should scrutinize payback periods, competitive dynamics, and whether durable moats can be built in an environment where technology is evolving at breakneck speed. That tension explains why leadership will continue to rotate even as the secular story remains intact.” \n\nThat said, Reid suggested that the market may be repricing overzealously, arguing the disruption in “old economy” sectors feels overdone: “The real challenge is that even by the end of this year, we still won’t have enough evidence to identify the structural winners and losers with confidence. That leaves plenty of room for investors’ imaginations—both optimistic and pessimistic—to run wild. As such big sentiment swings will continue to be the order of the day.”",

    "description": "Peter Navarro says the White House may force Big Tech to cover electricity and grid costs tied to AI data centers.",
    "fullText": "The White House is signaling it may force Big Tech to foot the full bill for America's AI boom.\n\nCompanies building data centers \"need to pay for all of the costs,\" and taxpayers should not shoulder the impact of the AI boom.\n\nThe White House has to \"make sure the American people are not hurt,\" he added.\n\nNavarro's comments come as the AI data-center boom faces mounting scrutiny over rising utility bills.\n\nTech giants are pouring hundreds of billions into infrastructure to power artificial intelligence. In November, Meta pledged $600 billion to expand AI technology, infrastructure, and its workforce. Apple said in August it would boost its US infrastructure plans by adding another $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion.\n\nAt the same time, energy costs are rising. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate hikes from regulators last year, more than twice the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many power providers have cited surging electricity demand from large-scale data centers as a key reason for seeking higher rates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that households should absorb those increases.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote last month in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nNavarro also said on Fox News that the US must keep expanding its data center capacity if it wants to remain \"No.1 on the global stage in terms of AI.\"\n\n\"We have to lead China and others on this,\" Navarro said. \"At the same time, we have to be mindful of the impacts across this nation.\"\n\nThe US must stay ahead \"not just for economic reasons but for national security reasons,\" because AI \"will be one of the most dangerous weapons of war,\" he added.\n\nSome AI companies have moved to reassure policymakers that households won't bear the cost of the industry's rapid expansion.\n\nAnthropic said on Thursday that it will cover 100% of the grid upgrade costs associated with its AI data centers.\n\n\"The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,\" Anthropic said. \"But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.\"\n\nThe pledge follows the company's November announcement that it plans to invest $50 billion in AI infrastructure, starting with facilities in Texas and New York.\n\nMicrosoft has taken a similar approach. Last month, the company said it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the electricity costs tied to its data centers and minimize the burden of data center expansion on surrounding communities.",

    "fullText": "Delivery service Instacart is moving further into new areas, such as advertising and retail tech.\n\nThe company's roughly 600,000 gig workers, who shop and deliver groceries and other retail goods, are its most visible face for many people. But Instacart's business is growing in many directions, CEO Chris Rogers said on a November earnings call.\n\n\"We have the leading online grocery marketplace, a best-in-class suite of enterprise technologies for retailers, and a growing advertising ecosystem,\" Rogers said on the call, his first as CEO after assuming the position in August.\n\nInstacart needs people to make good on its growth plans. The company had about 170 open roles on its careers website as of early February.\n\n\"We're hiring selectively, with priority on roles that support our core marketplace, Instacart Enterprise solutions for retailers globally, and our ads and data platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\n\"We regularly review compensation to ensure it's competitive and aligned with market benchmarks, location, and role,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThat hiring can include some employees from outside the US on H-1B work visas.\n\nBusiness Insider analyzed 157 H-1B visa applications submitted by Instacart and certified by the Department of Labor in the year ending September 30, 2025. These applications provide insight into how much employees in certain roles make. Many of the salaries were for tech roles, including data science, engineering, and product management positions.\n\nThe Trump administration has initiated changes to the H-1B visa system. In September, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new applications. He's also proposed changes to work visa rules that could tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider. However, these changes were largely initiated after this reporting period.\n\nHere's a look at some of the jobs for which Instacart has disclosed salaries in the work visa data.\n\nData Scientist: $125,000 to $210,000\n\nDirector of Engineering, Machine Learning: $320,000 to $380,000\n\nEngineering Manager, Software: $220,000 to $290,000\n\nManager, Machine Learning Engineering: $260,000 to $280,000\n\nPrincipal Software Engineer: $350,000 to $380,000\n\nSenior Computer Vision/AI Engineer: $180,000 to $290,000\n\nSenior Data Scientist: $170,000 to $265,000\n\nSenior Engagement Manager: $235,000 to $285,000\n\nSenior Engineering Manager: $275,000 to $305,000\n\nSenior Engineering Manager, Software: $275,000 to $305,000\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $185,000 to $300,000\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $190,000 to $298,000\n\nSenior Product Manager: $185,000 to $280,000\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $176,000 to $285,000\n\nSoftware Engineer: $165,000 to $215,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $250,000 to $310,000\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood doesn’t give up on her favorite stocks easily.\n\nThe head of Ark Investment Management actively manages her tech holdings, and her timing often links to market movements.\n\nSometimes Wood buys her top holdings on the way down, hoping for a bargain. That’s what she just did.\n\nIt’s been a weak start to the year for Wood. As of Feb. 13, Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) was down 9.79% year to date, while the S&P 500 lost 0.14%, as pressure mounted on growth-focused tech stocks.\n\nWood gained a reputation after her Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. Last year, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF gained 35.49%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 17.88% in the same period.\n\nBut Wood's style also brings painful losses in bearish markets, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\n\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term gains. As of Feb. 13, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -14.67%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 13.33% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar.\n\nWood focuses on high-tech companies across artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics. She thinks these businesses have great growth potential, though their volatility often causes fluctuations in the Ark’s funds.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking. The analyst hasn’t updated the 2025 ranking.\n\nIn a letter published on Jan. 15, Wood says the U.S. economy is storing up energy for a sharp rebound in 2026.\n\n\"Despite sustained real gross domestic product growth during the past three years, the underlying US economy has suffered a rolling recession and has evolved into a coiled spring that could bounce back powerfully during the next few years,\" Wood wrote.\n\nWood also rejects the “AI bubble” talk, saying it \"is years away\" and \"the most powerful capital spending cycle in history\" is coming.\n\n\"What once was the cap in spending seems to have become a floor now that the AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and multiomics sequencing platforms are ready for prime time,\" she said.\n\nNot all investors agree with Wood’s optimism. In the 12 months through Feb. 11, the Ark Innovation ETF saw roughly $1.4 billion in net outflows, according to ETF research firm VettaFi.",

    "description": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah, Feb 15 - The U.S.",
    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah, Feb 15 - The U.S. Departments of Energy and Defense on Sunday for the first time transported a small nuclear reactor on a cargo plane from California to Utah to ‌demonstrate the potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe agencies partnered with California-based Valar Atomics to ‌fly one of the company’s Ward microreactors on a C-17 aircraft — without nuclear fuel — to Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Under ​Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Michael Duffey were on the C-17 flight with the reactor and its components, and hailed the event as a breakthrough for U.S. nuclear energy and military logistics.\n\n“This gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration sees small nuclear reactors as one ‌of several ways to expand U.S. energy production. Trump ⁠last May issued four executive orders aimed at boosting domestic nuclear deployment to meet growing demand for energy for national security and competitive AI advancements.\n\nThe Energy Department in December issued two grants to help ⁠accelerate development of small modular reactors.\n\nProponents of microreactors also have touted them as energy sources that can be sent to far-flung and remote places, offering an alternative to diesel generators which require frequent deliveries of fuel. But skeptics have argued that the industry has not proven that small ​nuclear reactors ​can generate power for a reasonable price.\n\n\"There is no business case for ​microreactors, which — even if they work as designed — will ‌produce electricity at a far higher cost than large nuclear reactors, not to mention renewables like wind or solar,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nThe Energy Department plans to have three microreactors reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain itself — by July 4, Wright said.\n\nThe microreactor in Sunday's event, a little larger than a minivan, can generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, according to Valar CEO Isaiah Taylor. It will start operating in July ‌at 100 kilowatts and peak at 250 kilowatts this year before ramping up ​to full capacity, he said.\n\nValar hopes to start selling power on a test ​basis in 2027 and become fully commercial in 2028. ​Although private industry funds its own development of nuclear technology, it also needs the federal government “doing some ‌enabling actions to allow fuel fabrication here and uranium ​enrichment here,” he said.\n\nFuel for Valar's ​reactor will be transported from the Nevada National Security site to the San Rafael facility, Wright told reporters.\n\nHowever, even small generators result in a significant amount of radioactive waste, Lyman said. Other experts have said designers are not compelled to ​consider waste at inception, beyond a plan for ‌how it will be managed.\n\nAlthough disposal of nuclear waste remains an unresolved issue, the Energy Department is in talks ​with a few states, including Utah, to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal, Wright ​said.",

In the past Starmer has just said that he would like to do this at some point in the next parliament.\nIn his reply, Starmer said that at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend he was arguing that the UK, and Europe as a whole, needs to “step up”.\nWe want a just and lasting peace, but that will not extinguish the Russian threat, and we need to be alert to that, because that’s going to affect every single person in this room, every single person in this country, so we need to step up.\nThat means, on defence spending, we need to go faster.",

But he said he was “open-minded” about whether this would include a full, Austalian-style ban.\n\nStarmer suggested that one option will be to limit the technology that allows “doomscrolling”. He said:\n\nWe’ve taken the powers to make sure we can act within months, not years.\n\nWe also need to act very quickly, not just of the age concern, but on the devices and applications that make the sort of auto-scrolling, the constant glueing to the machine that you can never stop scrolling.\n\nIn a post on his Substack account, Starmer said out in more details the options that could be implemented as a result of the consultation being carried out. He said:\n\nWe will be going to parliament for new government powers, enabling us to act on the findings of the social media consultation where the evidence suggests we need to. This could include:\n\n-Setting a minimum age limit for social media: unlike the Tories, who took years to pass the Online Safety Act, we will take powers that would allow us to implement a minimum age for social media in a matter of months to prevent kids from accessing harmful social media.\n\n-Restricting specific functionalities: that are detrimental to kids’ wellbeing and keep them hooked to their screens like endless scroll or autoplay\n\n-Limiting VPN access for kids: to make it harder for kids to get around age limits of services or certain functionalities.\n\nThis is all designed to put the wellbeing of children first.",

    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names behind the artificial intelligence boom are looking to stack Congress with allies who support lighter regulation of the emerging technology by drawing on the crypto industry’s 2024 election success.\n\nMarc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman are among tech leaders who’ve poured $50 million into a new super political action committee to help AI-friendly candidates prevail in November’s congressional races. Known as Leading the Future, the super PAC has taken center stage as voters grow increasingly concerned that AI risks driving up energy costs and taking away jobs.\n\nAs it launches operations, Leading the Future is deploying a strategy that worked two years ago for crypto advocates: talk about what’s likely to resonate with voters, not the industry or its interests and controversies. For AI, that means its ads won’t tout the technology but instead discuss core issues including economic opportunity and immigration — even if that means not mentioning AI at all.\n\n“They’re trying to be helpful in a campaign rather than talking about their own issue all the time,” said Craig Murphy, a Republican political consultant in Texas, where Leading the Future has backed Chris Gober, an ally of President Trump, in the state’s hotly contested 10th congressional district.\n\nThis year, the group plans to spend up to $125 million on candidates who favor a single, national approach to AI regulation, regardless of party affiliation. The election comes at a crucial moment for the industry as it invests hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure that will put fresh strains on resources, with new data centers already blamed for driving up utility bills.\n\nLeading the Future faces a growing challenge from AI safety advocates, who’ve started their own super PAC called Public First with a goal of raising $50 million for candidates who favor stricter oversight. On Thursday, Public First landed a $20-million pledge from Anthropic PBC, a rival to OpenAI that has set itself apart from other AI companies by supporting tougher rules.\n\nPolls show deepening public concern over AI’s impact on everything from jobs to education to the environment. Sixty-two percent of US adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week, and 58% are concerned the government will not go far enough in regulating it, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nJesse Hunt, a Leading the Future spokesman, said the group is “committed to supporting policymakers who want a smart national regulatory framework for AI,” one that boosts US employment while winning the race against China. Hunt said the super PAC backs ways to protect consumers “without ceding America’s technological future to extreme ideological gatekeepers.”\n\nThe political and economic stakes are enormous for OpenAI and others behind Leading the Future, including venture capitalists Andreessen and Horowitz. Their firm, a16z, is the richest in Silicon Valley with billions of dollars invested in AI upstarts including coding startup Cursor and AI leaderboard platform LM Arena.\n\nFor now, their super PAC is doing most of the talking for the AI industry in the midterm races. Meta Platforms Inc. has announced plans for AI-related political spending on state-level contests, with $20 million for its California-based super PAC and $45 million for its American Technology Excellence Project, according to Politico.\n\nOther companies with massive AI investment plans — Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — have their own corporate PACs to dole out bipartisan federal campaign donations. Nvidia Corp., the chip giant driving AI policy in Washington, doesn’t have its own PAC.\n\nTo ensure consistent messaging across party lines, Leading the Future has created two affiliated super PACs — one spending on Republicans and another on Democrats. The aim is to build a bipartisan coalition that can be effective in Washington regardless of which party is in power.\n\nTexas, home of OpenAI’s massive Stargate project, is one of the states where Leading the Future has already jumped in. Its Republican arm, American Mission, has spent nearly $750,000 on ads touting Gober, a political lawyer who’s previously worked for Elon Musk’s super PAC and is in a crowded GOP primary field for an open House seat.\n\nThe ads hail Gober as a “MAGA warrior” who “will fight for Texas families, lowering everyday costs.” Gober’s campaign website lists “ensuring America’s AI dominance” as one of his top campaign priorities. Gober’s campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn New York, Leading the Future’s Democratic arm, Think Big, has spent $1.1 million on television ads and messages attacking Alex Bores, a New York state assemblyman who has called for tougher AI safety protocols and is now running for an open congressional seat encompassing much of central Manhattan.\n\nThe ads seize on Democrats’ revulsion over Trump’s immigration crackdown and target Bores for his work at Palantir Technologies Inc., which contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Think Big has circulated mailings and text messages citing Bores’ work with Palantir, urging voters to “Reject Bores’ hypocrisy on ICE.”\n\nIn an interview, Bores called the claims in the ads false, explaining that he left Palantir because of its work with ICE. He pointed out the irony that Joe Lonsdale, a Palantir co-founder who’s backed the administration’s border crackdown, is a donor to Leading the Future.\n\n“They’re not being ideologically consistent,” Bores said. “The fact that they have been so transparent and said, ‘Hey, we’re the AI industry and Alex Bores will regulate AI and that scares us,’ has been nothing but a benefit so far.”\n\nLeading the Future’s Democratic arm also plans to spend seven figures to support Democrats in two Illinois congressional races: former Illinois Representatives Jesse Jackson Jr. and Melissa Bean.\n\nLeading the Future is following the path carved by Fairshake, a pro-cryptocurrency super PAC that joined affiliates in putting $133 million into congressional races in 2024. Fairshake made an early mark by spending $10 million to attack progressive Katie Porter in the California Democratic Senate primary, helping knock her out of the race in favor of Adam Schiff, the eventual winner who’s seen as more friendly to digital currency.\n\nThe group also backed successful primary challengers against House incumbents, including Democrats Cori Bush in Missouri and Jamaal Bowman in New York. Both were rated among the harshest critics of digital assets by the Stand With Crypto Alliance, an industry group.\n\nIn its highest-profile 2024 win, Fairshake spent $40 million to help Republican Bernie Moreno defeat incumbent Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, a crypto skeptic who led the Senate Banking Committee. Overall, it backed winners in 52 of the 61 races where it spent at least $100,000, including victories in three Senate and nine House battlegrounds.\n\nFairshake and Leading the Future share more than a strategy. Josh Vlasto, one of Leading the Future’s political strategists, does communications work for Fairshake. Andreessen and Horowitz are also among Fairshake’s biggest donors, combining to give $23.8 million last year.\n\nBut Leading the Future occasionally conflicts with Fairshake’s past spending. The AI group said Wednesday it plans to spend half a million dollars on an ad campaign for Laurie Buckhout, a former Pentagon official who’s seeking a congressional seat in North Carolina with calls to slash rules “strangling American innovation.” In 2024, during Buckhout’s unsuccessful run for the post, Fairshake spent $2.3 million supporting her opponent and eventual winner, Democratic Rep. Donald Davis.\n\n“The fact that they tried to replay the crypto battle means that we have to engage,” said Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Texas who helped launch Public First. “I’d say Leading the Future was the forcing function.”\n\nUnlike crypto, proponents of stricter AI regulations have backers within the industry. Even before its contribution to Public First, Anthropic had pressed for “responsible AI” with sturdier regulations for the fast-moving technology and opposed efforts to preempt state laws.\n\nAnthropic employees have also contributed to candidates targeted by Leading the Future, including a total of $168,500 for Bores, Federal Election Commission records show. A super PAC Dream NYC, whose only donor in 2025 was an Anthropic machine learning researcher who gave $50,000, is backing Bores as well.\n\nCarson, who’s co-leading the super PAC with former Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah, cites public polling that more than 80% of US adults believe the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, and says voter sentiment is on Public First’s side.\n\nPublic First didn’t disclose receiving any donations last year, according to FEC filings. But one of the group’s affiliated super PACs, Defend our Values PAC, reported receiving $50,000 from Public First Action Inc., the group’s advocacy arm. The PAC hasn’t yet spent any of that money on candidates.\n\nCrypto’s clout looms large in lawmakers’ memory, casting a shadow over any effort to regulate the big tech companies, said Doug Calidas, head of government affairs for AI safety group Americans for Responsible Innovation.\n\n“Fairshake was just so effective,” said Calidas, whose group has called for tougher AI regulations. “Democrats and Republicans are scared they’re going to replicate that model.”\n\nAllison and Birnbaum write for Bloomberg.",

    "description": "After a weekend of FA Cup action without VAR, BBC Sport ask managers, fans and pundits whether the game needs technology - and what needs to change.",
    "fullText": "Would football be better without the video assistant referee (VAR) system?\n\nPremier League fans, managers and players got a reminder of what life was like without VAR in the FA Cup fourth round - and it is fair to say this weekend was not without its problems.\n\nFor this season and the previous FA Cup campaign, VAR has not been brought in until the fifth round, with many fans looking forward to a return to football without interruptions from technology.\n\nAfter a season full of controversy, delayed decisions and confusion fuelled by VAR, its very existence has been questioned at times, with many claiming the game would be better without it.\n\nIn fact, after a day full of long delays, mixed messages and irate managers in early February, ex-Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Match of the Day: \"For the good of the game, you'd have VAR gone.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there.\n\n\"Do you want more right decisions or do you want a more free-flowing football experience that is genuine and spur of the moment?\"\n\nAfter a couple of offside goals being allowed, a blatant penalty not being awarded plus various other controversial decisions, the weekend certainly brought the subject back into the public eye.\n\nLong delays, irate managers and mixed messages - is VAR bad for game?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nWhy is there no VAR in the FA Cup third and fourth round?\n\nWe have all heard the arguments against VAR.\n\nDecisions taking too long, celebrations being put on hold while deliberations take place, confusion as goals are given - or ruled out - for marginal reasons, denying referees the ability to use their own common sense.\n\nBut Newcastle's controversial 3-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday could hardly have gone better for supporters of VAR - or worse for those who argue football is better without it.\n\nTammy Abraham's opener was clearly offside, Villa's full-back Lucas Digne inexplicably escaped conceding a penalty for handball and the Frenchman could easily have been dismissed for a reckless challenge as well.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said: \"I'm so torn because the game is better without VAR in terms of excitement and the spectacle for the supporters and us when we're living a moment live.\n\n\"But it does give accurate results. It does make the game more precise in terms of decision making. You have to respect those moments. They're worth their weight in gold, especially us today when we were on the wrong side of it.\"\n\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery went further, saying \"VAR is necessary. It's necessary to help the referees\".\n\nThere was also some controversy at Anfield during Liverpool's 3-0 win over Brighton.\n\nSubstitute Rio Ngumoha, 17, had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside for the hosts, while the Seagulls were furious Mohamed Salah was awarded a penalty.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"In general, I enjoy watching football without VAR because if you then score you're like 'it's a goal'.\n\n\"I like VAR only for the clear and obvious things - I'm not meaning a red card yes or no for Marc Guehi on Mo Salah because I thought it was.\n\n\"So let's stay away from that and only go to offside yes or no, ball over the line yes or no and, for the rest, the referee referees the game.\n\n\"I think we're now so used to VAR that I would prefer to have VAR during a game.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola was unsure whether football was better with VAR, despite seeing Omar Marmoush denied a goal for a debatable offside in his side's 3-0 win against Salford.\n\n\"Sometimes before I thought it was better and sometimes I think VAR helps us to have a more fair game,\" he said. \"To be honest I don't know.\"\n\nFor some though, it is simple - rather than VAR being a solution for wrong decisions, they would argue officials just need to get things right.\n\nWhen asked on Match of the Day Live whether the errors at Villa Park put him in favour of VAR, ex-Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, said: \"No. I would like the officials to do their job properly. It is not too much to ask, is it?\n\n\"If you ever needed any evidence of the damage that VAR has done to referees, I think Saturday is a great example of that.\n\n\"These guys look petrified to make a decision because they didn't have a comfort blanket.\n\n\"For me, [referees' decisions] are actually getting worse.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given added on Match of the Day: \"It shows you why we use VAR. A lot of decisions the officials got wrong at Villa Park. VAR is like a comfort blanket for referees.\n\n\"The decision is taken away from the officials. The linesman has been told all season not to put their flag up, so their brain has been trained. I think it shows VAR is a help even though we complain about it most weeks.\"\n\nWhen asked whether football had become too reliant on VAR, Howe had some sympathy with the argument.\n\n\"There is an argument to say yes,\" he said. \"Because when VAR is there, there is a tendency to think 'oh well I won't give that because VAR is there to check it'.\n\n\"Then your decision making isn't as sharp as it would normally have to be. Maybe there is a difference there. I would probably say you are right in that respect.\"\n\nBut former referee Graham Scott feels it is unfair to claim officials hide behind VAR.\n\n\"I really don't think that's fair,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"Obviously I work with them closely and I know these guys and they're not like that. It's not how their minds work, not how their processes work.\n\n\"I spent half my career with VAR and half without it - the other way around of course, without it first.\n\n\"And then when I was in the Premier League I was still dropping into the Championship quite often. So you're in and out, in and out. And your processes essentially stay the same.\n\n\"What has changed though is with VAR you don't have that spell in a game where you know you've made a really big error and you now have to reset and go again.\"\n\nJames: Football without VAR is real football. Having gone to games for the last 30 years, the last few years have been terrible in comparison. I don't bother cheering goals any more as the officials are far more interested in finding ways of disallowing goals than the entertainment of the match-going fan.\n\nVAR will be the thing that makes me turn in my season ticket, and if West Ham do get relegated the lack of VAR will be a blessing.\n\nFrank: I supported the introduction of VAR, but it was great not having it today. It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many VAR ridiculous errors.\n\nAlan: Much, much better [without]. VAR has ruined the game, thankfully I now support non-league football where there are humans, making human mistakes and getting it right.\n\nStephen: Much better without VAR. No waiting for obvious incidents that everyone can see immediately but takes VAR forever to decide. Time for return of refs and linesman to start refereeing the game again.\n\nMike: Better, even though City probably had a goal chalked off incorrectly. Right or wrong, its so much better to just know immediately if its a goal or not. VAR is a moment-killer.\n\nLes: The game is so much better without VAR. It flows without problem like it used to do. The officials are there to make decisions rightly or wrongly. VAR are always making wrong calls so I can't see the point of it. Offside because someone's toes are on the lines drawn is absolutely pathetic.\n\nBonnie: As a Villa and VAR fan, that is exactly the decision that VAR doesn't get credit for. VAR gets it right 100%\n\nRoger: That was so blatantly offside, have linesman lost their natural ability to spot stuff like this since the introduction of VAR? Whenever you see a defence hold their line like Newcastle did, strikers are more often than not offside. Poor decision.\n\nPeter: There's an easy fix for VAR offsides. If you can watch one TV replay and see the on-field decision is clearly wrong, you intervene.\n\nStephen: That's what you all wanted isn't it? More goals regardless of whether they're actually fair or not?\n\nLiga: It's these types of situations and these types of situation only where VAR should and needs to be used for offsides. Not those hairline millimetre is he on or off line drawing nonsense situations.\n\nCallum: This season is proving 2 things. 1) VAR is a must. 2) Brave, high pressure attacking football is dead.\n\nBen: What are linesman for exactly? Having no VAR is a another shambles, who makes these decisions?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going\n\nTech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).\n\nThe phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.\n\nGavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.\n\nRather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.\n\n“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”\n\nUnlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.\n\nRobert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.\n\n“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”\n\nThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.\n\nWhen the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.\n\nSome opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.\n\nThiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.\n\n“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”\n\nTech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.\n\nJust this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.\n\nAdding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”\n\nJoining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.\n\nMcCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.\n\n“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”\n\nMeta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.\n\nThe social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.\n\nThe crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.\n\n“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”\n\nWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.\n\nThe California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.\n\nSingleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.\n\nBut then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.\n\nMahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.\n\nMahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.\n\nGoogle’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nAs political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That’s for sure.”",

    "fullText": "A marginal VAR offside decision caused a fair amount of controversy for Newcastle in midweek. Joe Willock had a goal disallowed at Tottenham when the semi-automated technology said his forehead was offside.\n\nAbraham's goal was the kind of decision the video review was brought in for - the real howlers.\n\nThe Villa striker was clearly ahead of the defence when Douglas Luiz played the free-kick. With VAR, the goal would have been ruled out.\n\nIt would be easy to blame switching between systems as a defence for the assistant, Nick Greenhalgh. But with or without VAR, he would be expected to raise his flag if he's identified an offside.\n\nShould Digne have been sent off?\n\nWould the VAR have stepped in to show a red card to Digne for serious foul play with his late challenge on Jacob Murphy? It is far from certain from what we have seen in the Premier League.\n\nWe often hear the VAR has referenced glancing contact to uphold the decison of a yellow card. See Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby last month.\n\nDigne did come in at some speed and that would have increased the chance of being sent off on review.\n\nYet the Frenchman did not push through on to the shin of the Newcastle player. That his foot came off quickly probably would have saved him.\n\nIt may well have been one of those where the on-field decision would have stood, whether it was yellow or red card.\n\nSerious foul play or denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity (Dogso)?\n\nReally, this incident could have been either. After all, Bizot brought down Murphy with a knee-high challenge - although it was not with studs leading.\n\nWhen the Dutch goalkeeper fouled the Newcastle forward, the Magpies were left with three attackers up against only Luiz, although Dogso could only be applied to the player fouled.\n\nThe VAR would have taken into account the general run of the ball was not towards goal. They would also consider if Luiz would have been able to get across to prevent the shot.\n\nYou can make a case for a degree of doubt for Dogso. But much like the Digne decision it is one which would likely have stayed with the on-field decision.\n\nRead more analysis on the officiating in Aston Villa v Newcastle here",

    "fullText": "Agentic AI apps first interview you and then give you limited matches selected for ‘similarity and reciprocity of personality’\n\nDating apps exploit you, dating profiles lie to you, and sex is basically something old people used to do. You might as well consider it: can AI help you find love?\n\nFor a handful of tech entrepreneurs and a few brave Londoners, the answer is “maybe”.\n\nNo, this is not a story about humans falling in love with sexy computer voices – and strictly speaking, AI dating of some variety has been around for a while. Most big platforms have integrated machine learning and some AI features into their offerings over the past few years.\n\nBut dreams of a robot-powered future – or perhaps just general dating malaise and a mounting loneliness crisis – have fuelled a new crop of startups that aim to use the possibilities of the technology differently.\n\nJasmine, 28, was single for three years when she downloaded the AI-powered dating app Fate. With popular dating apps such as Hinge and Tinder, things were “repetitive”, she said: the same conversations over and over.\n\n“I thought, why not sign up, try something different? It sounded quite cool using, you know, agentic AI, which is where the world is going now, isn’t it?”\n\nFate, a London startup that went live last May, bills itself as the first “agentic AI dating app”. Its core offering is an AI personality named Fate that “onboards” users during an interview, asking them about their hopes and struggles before putting forward five potential matches – no swiping involved.\n\nFate will also coach users through their interactions, if they desire, a functionality Jasmine described as helpful and another user said was “scary” and “a bit like Black Mirror’.\n\nRakesh Naidu, Fate’s founder, demonstrated its coaching ability in an interview with the Guardian. “I just feel a bit hopeless at the moment in regards to my chats. I feel like I’m not being engaging enough or meaningful enough,” he said into his phone. “I just need some kind of meaningful questions I can ask to really uncover the essence of people.”\n\n“I hear you, Rakesh,” said a synthetic female voice. “Here are a few ideas. One, what’s something you’re passionate about that not many people know?”\n\nNaidu, 28, said he started Fate in order to address shortcomings in the world’s biggest dating platforms – apps such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, which monetise the time users spend on them and “are literally profiting off keeping people lonely”.\n\nOther startups, from Sitch to Keeper, have launched across the US, hoping AI features can provide the novelty to win them a share of a crowded market. Sitch leverages the power of AI to manage vasts amounts of information, inviting users to “give us detailed feedback down to the hair colour, where they want to raise a family, and their fav music”; Keeper says it can find “a match with rare and real soulmate potential”.\n\nPart of the issue, Naidu says, are algorithmic approaches to matchmaking: Tinder at one point ranked users’ desirability through an Elo score, an algorithm originally used to rate chess players. On dating platforms, it’s a Hobbesian proposition – high-scoring users are shown to other high-scoring users, low-scoring users to other low-scoring users. “It’s very superficial,” said Naidu.\n\nAI, in theory, can offer a different way. Awkward as it may be to discuss your dating life with a chatbot, Fate does not rank you based on your responses, but instead uses an LLM to try to find other users who, based on their interview, might be similar to you. That approach, along with the AI dating coach, helps users to focus on authentic connection, said Naidu – “similarity and reciprocity of personality”.\n\nAmelia Miller, a consultant for Match Group (which owns Tinder and Hinge), worries about this approach.\n\nA recent study from the group surveyed 5,000 Europeans about their online dating preferences – and found that while many were interested in AI tools to weed out fake profiles and flag toxic users, most, 62%, were skeptical about using AI to guide their conversations. One obvious anxiety might be the dystopian idea of two agentic AIs steering a conversation, with the humans nominally in charge turning into little more than meatspace mouthpieces.\n\nMiller, however, who coaches people on their relationships with AI, says she sees many clients turn to an LLM for advice in the smaller, uncomfortable moments of building their relationships – asking AI how to craft a text, for example, or respond to an intimate question.\n\n“Often I’m trying to make sure that people aren’t turning to machines because turning to humans demands a level of vulnerability that has become uncomfortable now that there is an alternative,” she said.\n\nThe appeal of an AI coach such as Fate is that revealing yourself to it – your judgments, hopes and idiosyncrasies – involves no risk; it does not remember or evaluate. Friends do, and, says Miller, asking advice from them helps hone the skills for successful relationships.\n\n“Advice is really one of the key ways that people practice vulnerability in a more low-stakes environment – they build up to more vulnerable moments in a romantic context.”\n\nJeremias has been using Fate for several months. He said he doesn’t use the AI coach: “I could see it being helpful, but I mean there are obviously some concerns. Like the new generation are basically not going to have the real world experience of actually trying and failing.”\n\nThe app recently helped him to meet someone after a long period of being single in London. He’s not sure if this is because of the AI matching, or because Fate simply serves up only five matches at a time – no infinite swiping – and, excruciatingly, forces its users to write an explanation when they reject a potential match.\n\n“It makes the swiping more thoughtful. If I’m actually saying no to this person, what are the reasons I’m saying no to them?”\n\nHe and Jasmine both have second dates upcoming, both after being single for several years, they say.\n\n“It is exciting because you get like, you know, the butterflies in your stomach again, going on a date with someone, doing yourself up really nicely, wearing dresses, heels. It’s fun,” said Jasmine.",

In January, the company also said it planned to lay off 775 employees at its distribution centers, citing efforts to accelerate the use of \"advanced technology and automation.\"\n\nNike had several leadership shake-ups in 2025, including promoting at least four insiders to senior roles reporting directly to CEO Elliott Hill.\n\nHill, who rejoined the company in October 2024, has told investors that Nike is aligning its employees around five key action areas: culture, product, marketing, marketplace, and connecting with consumers on the ground in their communities.\n\nThat strategy plays into Nike's efforts to focus its marquee brands — Nike, Jordan, and Converse — on key sports such as running and basketball. It's also pushing a new collaboration, NikeSKIMS, an athleisure brand for women.\n\n\"We are in the midst of realignment at Nike,\" Nike said in a July statement to Business Insider. The realignment and sport strategy aim to \"create sharper distinction and dimension\" for its brands, the company said.\n\nHere's what some key Nike roles can earn, based on work visa data for the year ending September 30.\n\nThe salary data includes information from Nike Inc. and some subsidiaries, such as its retail services arm and Air Manufacturing Innovation division.

Monica De La Cruz (R-TX) told Nexstar.\n\nDe La Cruz was part of a group of South Texas leaders who met with House Speaker Mike Johnson this week to discuss the proposal, as home builders in the state warn of slowing construction times and difficulty hiring over fears of immigration raids.\n\n“They hear Monte Cielo and say, ‘No, no. You can pay me whatever you want, but I’m not going to go work there,’” Alejandro Garcia, a home builder at work on a development in Weslaco, Texas, that has been raided multiple times, told The Wall Street Journal last week.\n\nA concrete supplier in the region, meanwhile, told the paper that concrete use fell 60 percent between May and November, as builders lost workers and projects stalled.\n\n“A project that was taking maybe four to five months on an average, starter-type home is now taking eight, nine, 10 months, just because of the delays,” Efrain Gomez, treasurer of the South Texas Builders Association, told NewsNation. “It’s a huge ripple effect.”\n\nImmigrants, legal and otherwise, make up more than half the construction workforce in states like Texas, California, Florida, and New York, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nThe Trump administration’s immigration campaign has butted up against key industries like agriculture, hospitality, and construction that rely heavily on the labor of immigrants and undocumented people.\n\nThe administration has pushed to expand the H-2A visa for farm workers, and last year, Trump toyed with a pause on raids on hotels, restaurants, and agriculture, only for the administration to insist days later there would be “no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"\n\nThe administration has faced similar tensions over the H-1B specialist visa program, which is heavily in use by the president’s allies in the tech industry but undercuts his emphasis on hiring American workers.",

    "fullText": "LTK, a Softbank-backed startup and creator economy unicorn, let go of some staff on Thursday as part of a reorganization, a company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe cuts were designed to refocus LTK's business around its revamped brand platform and to account for structural changes to internal teams like marketing, according to the company.\n\nThe job reductions, which hit a variety of roles including software engineers and staffers who worked with creators, affected a low single-digit percentage of LTK's overall head count, which numbers over 550 employees, they said.\n\n\"LTK recently completed a targeted organizational restructure to ensure we are aligned around the skills and priorities required for our next phase of growth,\" the spokesperson said. \"This was not a broad-based layoff, but a strategic realignment focused on strengthening performance and positioning the business for long-term success.\"\n\nLTK, previously known as RewardStyle, was founded around 15 years ago by president Amber Venz Box. The company, which says it's profitable and doubled its EBITDA in 2025, has raised a little over $300 million in its lifetime. Most of that capital came in a 2021 round from SoftBank's Vision Fund 2, which valued the startup at $2 billion.\n\nOver the last decade, LTK has established itself as one of the leading players in affiliate marketing, building a network of influencers who promote products on social media in exchange for commissions.\n\nRecently, the company has made a series of moves to establish itself beyond social media affiliate marketing.\n\nThe company relaunched its app for influencer-driven shopping, called LTK, in early 2025, to add more consumer-facing features as it sought to build its own brand identity with consumers.\n\nIn late 2025, the company announced it was revamping its platform for brands, offering features such as creator discovery and performance tracking at no cost. LTK makes money by collecting a commission on sales. The company said that over 1,000 brands have been onboarded onto the platform.\n\nLTK is one of several creator economy startups that have focused their businesses on e-commerce. Other big players in the space include affiliate platform ShopMy and live-selling app Whatnot, which in October raised $225 million at an $11.5 billion valuation.",

    "description": "The red storm was too much for the ‘Cats to stop in Clearwater.",
    "fullText": "Last night brought a test of epic proportions for Northwestern, as it was tasked with taking down No. 1 Texas Tech in its first game of its long weekend in Clearwater, Fla.\n\nThe start seemed promising for NU, but reality struck early, and the hope for an upset slowly faded as the ‘Cats posted zero after zero in the bottom half of each inning.\n\nThat reality check was the nation’s best returning arm in NiJaree Canady, who pitched five innings of relief for the win, only giving up two hits while striking out eight.\n\nAs for the Red Raiders, it took them an inning to figure out Northwestern starter Emma Blea, crossing the plate twice in the second and never looking back. The two that crossed the plate were the only two earned runs for NU pitchers.\n\nIt was smooth sailing for Blea in the top of the first, as she retired .500 hitter Mihyia Davis on a lineout to center before painting the outside corner to log a backwards K at the expense of Mia Williams.\n\nFirst strikeout of the day for Emma Blea, and we are off at the @ClearwaterInv! 🔥\n\nT1 | NU 0, Texas Tech 0 pic.twitter.com/tEduUMGjTj\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nTaylor Pannell reached on an infield single on the very next pitch before Blea retired the side, doing her own dirty work by scooping up a Jackie Lis grounder.\n\nNorthwestern’s first at-bat was nearly a copy-paste of Texas Tech’s: a K, a popout, a single and a flyout all in succession.\n\nA leadoff walk surrendered to Alana Johnson came back to sting Blea and the ‘Cats later in the second. Lauren Allred laced a one-out double into the right-center gap, scoring Johnson to break the ice. Lagi Quiroga followed with one of her own, this one to the opposite gap, as the Red Raiders swiftly snatched an early 2-0 lead.\n\nNU seemed to kickstart some momentum of its own after Blea got back into her groove to end the inning. Kansas Robinson found herself on base after an error from Red Raiders’ starter Samantha Lincoln. Tru Medina then stood in the box to get plunked by a pitch, and after a Bridget Donahey flyout and an Izzy Cunnea sac fly, Kate Renschen drew a walk to load the bases.\n\nTexas Tech head coach Gerry Glasco then emerged from the dugout to bring out Canady, who cleaned up the mess in two pitches to halt the second-inning rally.\n\nBlea continued to settle back down and sent the ’Cats back to the dish after a 1-2-3 inning in the third, highlighted by a smooth play from Medina.\n\nWe see you, Tru Medina! 👀👏\n\nThe rookie making plays in the hot corner!#SCTop10 pic.twitter.com/GOVeIwi886\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nThe heart of the Northwestern order seemed to have Canady scouted, but luck wasn’t on its side in the frame. Kelsey Nader grounded out after a nine-pitch at-bat, Kaylie Avvisato ripped a line drive only to have it gloved by Pannell and Robinson went down on strikes after working a full count.\n\nBad omens continued to haunt Northwestern as it took the field for the fourth. An error by Donahey at short gave way to another double by Allred, setting up two runners in scoring position for Texas Tech. Quiroga’s sac fly did the job to drive in the run, padding the lead once more.\n\nThe ‘Cats seemed to have spiraled themselves out of the contest, as Canady shoved in the next half-frame, striking out Medina and Dohaney before getting a measly pop-up out of Cunnea to finish the fourth still unscathed.\n\nSigne Dohse’s first full inning of relief went quite smoothly, as she bounced back from an early base hit and induced soft contact to get out of the frame. Canady took note and did the same, also getting in and out of the circle after facing four batters.\n\nMedina’s throwing error to start the sixth opened the door of opportunity for Texas Tech, and it walked straight through. Allred got hit by a pitch to advance Logan Halleman, Hailey Toney laid down a bunt to move both runners and Davis came through to bring them both home on Texas Tech’s fourth two-bagger of the night.\n\nThat would be all for the Red Raiders’ scoring, but that was all Canady needed. She sat down five of the next six batters she faced before Chloe Riassetto’s number was called for the final out and the save.\n\nQuite the jarring welcome from the Panhandle for the ‘Cats to process, but there’s no rest for the weary. After Northwestern’s loss to UCF on Friday morning, NU rounds out the trip with contests against Missouri, No. 17 Georgia and No. 8 Texas A&M.",

    "fullText": "The first week of the season has Georgia Tech Softball off to a promising start. Already with a 5-2 record under their belts, the team looks ahead to their upcoming weekend in Gainesville, Florida for the Florida Classic, where they will play University of Florida (7-0; 0-0 SEC), Florida International University (FIU) (6-0; 0-0 C-USA), and Marshall University (4-3; 0-0 SBC) throughout the weekend.\n\nThe first matchup of the season was a home series last week versus Villanova as part of the Buzz Classic. The Jackets took home the win in both the Thursday and Friday games 8-0. Thursday’s game was pitched by sophomore Madalyn Johnson and Friday’s by sophomore Tymber Harris.\n\nUnfortunately, that was immediately met with a series of losses against #16 Alabama, where the Crimson Tide took the Friday and Saturday games from the Jackets, resulting in the two losses on the record. Alabama won 9-0 and 7-2 during those games.\n\nTech  ended the weekend with two wins versus East Carolina University (ECU) 13-6 and 6-2 in their Sunday doubleheader. The Jackets used five different pitchers between the two games with  Johnson seeing both games for a total of seven innings pitched against ECU.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Jackets took on the Kennesaw State Owls, adding to their slew of wins with a 10-2, 6-inning victory. Senior Kenley Hilleary started the game against her former school, pitching over half of the game before sophomore Sydnie Watts finished the game to secure the 10-2 win for the Jackets. Senior outfielder Paige Vukadinovich and sophomore outfielder Alyssa Willer shared the most runs scored for the team at three each, with senior infielder Jayden Gailey, freshman outfielder Abby McKinnis, freshman infielder and utility player Madi Duffel, and senior catcher Reese Hunter scoring one each as well.\n\nThis weekend, the team takes on the Florida Classic in Gainesville to face FIU at 1:00pm and Florida at 6:00pm Friday, FIU at 9:00am and Marshall at 11:30am on Saturday, and Florida at 11:30am on Sunday.",

    "fullText": "Tech titans had a Thursday to forget this week.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, and Michael Dell saw a combined $26 billion wiped off their net worths in one day, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nTheir fortunes shrank because their respective stakes in Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and Dell slid in value. The stock prices of those first four companies fell by around 2% on Thursday, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the immense costs of building out AI infrastructure and whether they'd see a return on their spending.\n\nDell shares tumbled 9% after rival Lenovo warned a memory-chip shortage was driving up costs, raising concerns on Wall Street that other hardware manufacturers would also see their profits contract. The sell-off triggered a $5 billion drop in its founder's personal fortune to $135 billion.\n\nMusk saw an unmatched $8 billion wealth decline on Thursday. But the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is still up about $57 billion at $676 billion this year, thanks to the soaring valuations of SpaceX and another of his companies, xAI.\n\nZuckerberg took an almost $7 billion blow to his net worth, fueling a year-to-date decline for the Meta CEO of a little over $3 billion, to $230 billion.\n\nBezos' fortune fell by $4 billion, extending the Amazon founder's wealth decline this year to around $27 billion.\n\nHuang rounded out the tech quintet with a $2.5 billion reduction in the Nvidia CEO's net worth, according to Bloomberg's rich list.\n\nOther tech bosses also saw some of their wealth erased. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin took roughly $1.5 billion hits to their net worths on Thursday as shares of Google's parent company slipped by less than 1%.\n\nIn contrast, Walmart stock climbed nearly 4% to a record high on Thursday, as fears eased over tariffs and investors rotated out of tech.\n\nThe retailer's stock jump added more than $4 billion to the respective net worths of founder Sam Walton's three surviving children: Jim, Rob, and Alice.\n\nThe trio was worth more than $150 billion each at Thursday's close. They only trail Musk in wealth gain this year after notching increases of more than $20 billion apiece.\n\nThe world's 10 wealthiest people together grew nearly $600 billion richer last year, catapulting their combined fortunes above $2.5 trillion — more than Amazon is worth.",

    "description": "A defense-tech founder built an AI \"council\" of 15 agents to help him run his company, using ChatGPT and Nvidia tools to replace traditional roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aaron Sneed, a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started my business, as a solopreneur, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nThe council, which is compiled of all AI agents, helps me save around 20 hours a week, and that's a very conservative estimate. Every kind of general corporate chair, HR, legal, and finance AI agent has a seat on the council.\n\nHere's how I use around 15 custom agents, including a chief of staff agent, to manage my workload.\n\nI've worked on autonomous platforms that make decisions independently for at least 10 years. That made me latch onto commercial large language models and AI tools very quickly when they came out.\n\nI primarily use Nvidia's platform as my underlying hardware for technical prototyping and experimentation. I use their GPUs, and they provide free access to their AI software since I purchased their hardware. Additionally, my council is built on OpenAI's ChatGPT business platform using custom GPTs and projects.\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nMy chief of staff agent is important because it's the voice that sets priority based on parameters like risks, issues, and opportunities.\n\nI told my chief of staff which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback because I've learned that they naturally want to agree with me. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish.\n\nI have a roundtable set up with all my AI agents, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nThe training never really stops, because if I don't continuously train the models, I won't get the outputs I want or need. It takes me about two weeks to train my agents to the level of experience they need to be at for me to feel confident in them. Early on, it took me longer to produce a deliverable than if I'd just done it myself because I hadn't focused properly on training.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nAll of the AI companies have different prompt engineering guides. I recommend taking the time to look at them because there's a lot of user error that causes things to slow down when working with AI.\n\nIt takes time to get the agents to a good place. A lot of companies are going to try to jump into using AI too quickly for too much without understanding how to use it properly, and these companies could hurt themselves in the long run.\n\nI'm ill-equipped to handle a lot of these roles and responsibilities, but I'm also forced to do it because I'm bootstrapped.\n\nWith my legal agent in particular, I've learned the bounds of putting AI tools into real-world practice. I have a lawyer, and I use my legal agent to try to do some upfront work before handing documents off to my lawyer for a patent or dispute case, or anything like that.\n\nWhen I was training my model to help me use facts and data to plot a case, I had a lot of information laid out, and I thought what my legal agent created sounded good to me as a non-lawyer. Then I presented all that information to my lawyer, and he said that it was technically and factually correct, but we don't want to express that information because it shows our cards going in.\n\nHis legal skillset helped me realize that, even though I thought my agent was correct and ideal to use, it still won't replace a lawyer with that human context, experience, and skills.\n\nIdeally, I would have an HR person, a legal person, and so on, and each would have their own chief of staff AI agent who would help them out. That's what I think the future will look like.",

    "fullText": "Lyft is setting itself up for its next stage of growth.\n\nThe service, which relies on about 1 million gig-worker drivers, is breaking into new areas, including launching a service for older riders called Lyft Silver and one for teens. Like rival Uber, Lyft is also experimenting with self-driving cars, a development that CEO David Risher said could be \"transformational.\"\n\n\"A new Lyft is emerging,\" Risher said on the company's August earnings call, after it reported new highs for gross bookings, adjusted earnings, and free cash flow during its second quarter.\n\nThat comeback has hit snags. In February, its stock fell 17% in one day on disappointing fourth-quarter results and a surprise operating loss for 2025.\n\nStill, Risher, who became the company's CEO in 2023, said on a February earnings call that Lyft is on track to meet its 2027 financial goals, which include reaching $25 billion in annual gross bookings as well as targets for free cash flow and EBITDA.\n\nAll of that requires hiring the right people.\n\nAs of mid-February, Lyft had about 150 jobs listed on its website, spanning positions from AI transformation strategist to software engineer.\n\nWork visa data shows that Lyft sought to hire about 140 workers through the H-1B program in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended on September 30, based on filings with the US Department of Labor.\n\nLyft did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nCompanies are required to submit this work visa data, including salary information, to the US Department of Labor for foreign hires. The compensation figures don't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to base pay. However, the salaries in the filings are benchmarked against industry-average pay rates for similar roles and can provide insight into what the company pays for those jobs.\n\nThe process could change if the Trump administration's proposed changes to the H-1B visa system take effect.\n\nOver the last several months, Trump added a $100,000 fee to new applications and proposed changes to work visa rules that could give an edge to the highest-paid applicants. However, these changes were largely initiated after this reporting period.\n\nHere's a look at some of the annual salaries for Lyft jobs included in the disclosures:\n\nData Science Manager: $176,000 to $300,000\n\nData Scientist: $120,000 to $264,000\n\nData Engineer: $130,250 to $222,000\n\nSoftware Engineer: $128,000 to $312,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $181,000 to $300,000\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $144,000 to $207,500\n\nNetwork Engineer: $115,000 to $165,000\n\nEngineering Manager: $148,000 to $264,000\n\nBusiness Systems Engineer: $138,000 to $176,880\n\nData Analyst: $118,000 to $177,000\n\nAnalytics Lead: $114,000 to $150,000\n\nProduct Manager: $148,000 to $264,000\n\nProduct Designer: $124,000 to $155,000\n\nActuarial Analyst: $108,000 to $192,000\n\nSenior Analyst: $123,280 to $207,000\n\nFinancial Data Analyst: $90,000 to $162,000\n\nDo you have a story to share about Lyft?

    "fullText": "Dip-buyers in the retail crowd rushed back into stocks and ETFs after last week's big software-led plunge, JPMorgan says.\n\nJPMorgan quantitative strategists examined trading trends among retail investors, finding that retail investors bought the dip after the sell-off and after some post-earnings stock moves. They also flagged some stocks to watch due to an imbalance between retail and institutional interest.\n\nDuring the software meltdown, retail traders pulled back, with buying hitting a year-to-date low on February 5. From Friday, February 6, to Wednesday, February 11, retail investor flows surged above the daily average seen so far in 2026, largely driven by ETFs, compared to single stocks.\n\nHere is a closer look at some of the themes popular with retail traders following the software-led rout, according to JPMorgan.\n\nAfter the software sector sold off into a bear market, retail investors piled into high-quality AI plays.\n\nJPMorgan highlighted Microsoft as one of the stocks that retail investors bought the dip in, and noted it's one of the bank's \"AI-Resilient\" software stock picks.\n\nPalantir and AppLovin stand out as some of the top software names bought in the retail space in 2026, along with Microsoft. Salesforce, Roper Technologies, and Intuit were some of the most-sold names in the same period.\n\nBeyond the past week, retail traders have broadly preferred buying media and semiconductor stocks while selling software since the start of 2026.\n\nRetail investors shared some of Wall Street's worries about Big Tech's AI spending after earnings, but sentiment was mixed, JPM said, citing Reddit comments.\n\nThe analysts highlighted that retail traders bought the post-earnings dip in Amazon and Alphabet shares, while sitting out on Meta stock's climb.\n\nJPMorgan flagged several stocks popular on social media that saw high retail buying and high hedge fund shorting.\n\nThey noted that this combination of social media interest and conflicting retail and institutional investors signals potential unexpected flows.\n\nIn the last week, stocks with a large imbalance between retail buying and hedge fund shorting include Hims and Hers and Strategy.",

    "title": "More hiring managers want you to prove you're good with AI during interviews",
    "description": "Some major companies are shifting from telling job candidates not to use AI to requiring them to use it to prove their tech fluency.",
    "fullText": "Leaders at the software company Canva used to wonder whether job candidates were secretly using AI during technical interviews.\n\nManagers saw the company's engineers getting more done with the technology, so they needed to ensure new hires could do the same.\n\n\"We just flipped the script and went, 'OK, we're going to invite you to use AI,'\" Brendan Humphreys, Canva's chief technology officer, told Business Insider.\n\nThe result, he said, has been stronger hires better equipped to wield powerful AI tools to help write code and solve problems.\n\nCanva is one of a growing number of companies — including Meta and McKinsey — that are inviting some job candidates to use AI in parts of the hiring process.\n\nBroadly, when ChatGPT emerged in late 2022, many employers worried that job seekers would use AI to help talk their way past interviewers. Yet as the technology becomes more capable and embedded in daily work, a number of companies are moving from policing it to evaluating candidates' AI know-how.\n\nThat's what happened at Arcade, an IT infrastructure startup. The company has always asked technical candidates to complete a take-home exercise. Yet now, it expects them to use AI in the process, Alex Salazar, the company's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the technology's capabilities surged over the past year or so, he realized that candidates would likely turn to AI regardless of whether Arcade sanctioned it. Ultimately, Salazar said, the company wants its workers, including new hires, to use AI.\n\n\"So why are we creating this artificial test that doesn't even really reflect the work they're going to do when they get here?\" he said.\n\nHumphreys came to a similar conclusion at Canva. To factor in AI, he said, the company reworked its technical interview to make the questions \"complex, ambiguous, and problematic.\"\n\n\"If you just dump the question that we're giving you into an AI, you're going to get a substandard answer,\" Humphreys said.\n\nTo land a job at the company, which has about 265 million monthly users of its graphic design software, technical candidates need to know how to thoughtfully question AI, he said.\n\nOne way to avoid concerns that candidates might be leaning too hard on AI is to have job seekers show their work. In Canva's case, the company asks candidates to share their screen during a technical interview.\n\n\"We want to see the interactions with the AI as much as the output of the tool,\" Humphreys said.\n\nArcade tells candidates to use whatever AI tools they want on their exercise, then include a transcript of their conversations with the AI. The idea is to learn who knows how to do the job and to work with an agent. Doing so, Salazar said, comes with a \"very real learning curve.\"\n\nHe said that the shift to allowing AI use in the exercise meant that Arcade placed greater emphasis on a candidate's \"taste.\" That sensibility is important, he said, because AI can kick out answers, yet the best results often come from repeated iteration with these tools, he said.\n\n\"It's going to show their ability to use the AI, but it's also going to show what they think 'good' is,\" Salazar said of candidates' interactions with AI.\n\nOther companies want workers to demonstrate their AI acumen during the hiring process, too.\n\nIn a June post on an internal message board, Meta said it was developing a coding interview in which candidates could use an AI assistant, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat mode of working, Meta wrote, was \"more representative\" of the environment in which future developers would be operating. It also makes \"LLM-based cheating less effective,\" the company said, referring to large language models.\n\nThe consulting firm McKinsey & Company is piloting a change to its graduate recruiting process, asking candidates to use the company's internal AI assistant, Lilli, during case interviews to assess how they work with the technology, several media outlets reported in January.\n\nThe acceptance of, or even the preference for, AI in some parts of hiring doesn't mean companies will welcome job seekers who use the tools to misrepresent their skills. Even if a candidate gets away with it at first, hiring managers are likely to eventually discover that someone doesn't have the goods, Susan Peppercorn, an executive coach, told Business Insider.\n\nThat's because candidates who complete an assessment, for example, \"are going to have to explain how they arrived at their thinking,\" she said.\n\nUnderstanding that thought process is what Canva seeks in its hiring, said Humphreys, who oversees roughly 2,600 technical employees in roles including software engineering, IT, and machine learning.\n\nIt's a way of seeing whether a candidate makes sound technical decisions when it starts producing code, he said.\n\n\"What we're testing for now in our interview process is an ability to harness that power, to control that power — to kind of ride the dragon,\" Humphreys said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Maker of chatbot with coding ability says annualised revenue grew tenfold in each of past three years, to $14bn\n\nAnthropic, the US AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, has raised $30bn (£22bn) in a funding round that more than doubled its valuation to $380bn.\n\nThe company’s previous funding round in September achieved a value of $183bn, with further improvements in the technology since then spurring even greater investor interest.\n\nThe fundraising was announced amid a series of stock market moves against industries that face disruption from the latest models, including software, trucking and logistics, wealth management and commercial property services.\n\nThe funding round, led by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the hedge fund Coatue Management, is among the largest private fundraising deals on record.\n\n“Anthropic is the clear category leader in enterprise AI,” said Choo Yong Cheen, the chief investment officer of private equity at GIC.\n\nAnthropic said its annualised revenue – an estimate of full-year sales based on recent company data – had reached $14bn, having grown more than tenfold in each of the past three years. A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.\n\nAnthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.\n\nThe staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.\n\nAnthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many of the US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.\n\nSome listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.\n\nShares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid out this month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.\n\n“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies. \n\n “Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.\n\nFounded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.\n\nThe funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this article",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: in 2025 briefing to Wes Streeting, officials warned reputation of tech firm behind US ICE operations would hinder rollout of data system in UK\n\nHealth officials fear Palantir’s reputation will hinder the delivery of a “vital” £330m NHS contract, according to briefings seen by the Guardian, sparking fresh calls for the deal to be scrapped.\n\nIn 2023, ministers selected Palantir, a US surveillance technology company that also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation, to build an AI-enabled data platform to connect disparate health information across the NHS.\n\nNow it has emerged that after Keir Starmer demanded faster deployment, Whitehall officials privately warned that the public perception of Palantir would limit its rollout, meaning the contract would not offer value for money.\n\nPalantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.\n\nBefore he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.\n\nMPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.\n\nIn a private briefing for Wes Streeting before a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.\n\n“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”\n\nThe briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.\n\nThe officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”\n\nDonald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.\n\n“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”\n\nThe BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.\n\nThe briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.\n\nStreeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.\n\nNone mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”\n\nNew figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for the NHS as a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.\n\nThe former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.\n\nHe said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.\n\n“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”\n\nJohn Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.\n\n“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.\n\n“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”\n\nNHS England declined to comment.",

    "fullText": "Scientists and business leaders are responding to a viral essay warning of AI's impact on jobs with a mix of agreement and skepticism.\n\nThe essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" written by cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI, Matt Shumer, has racked up more than 60 million views on X as of Thursday.\n\nIn the 5,000-word post, Shumer said that AI could upend daily life on a scale \"much bigger\" than COVID, a comparison which drew pushback online. He wrote that the changes already unfolding in the tech sector are likely a preview of disruptions that could soon reach other industries as well.\n\n\"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare,\" Shumer told Business Insider's Brent Griffiths in an interview.\n\nHere's what some of the sharpest minds in AI are saying about Shumer's essay.\n\nHaber, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz specializing in technology investments, posted on X that Shumer's essay contains \"great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\"\n\n\"'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days is going to be the most valuable person in the room.' Not eventually. Right now,\" Haber quotes from the essay. \"Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's possible.\"\n\nThe Reddit founder responded to Shumer's initial post on X with a simple comment: \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\nSince 2023, Reddit has introduced a range of AI-driven tools, from search features that summarize user discussions to AI that sharpens its content recommendations and targets ads, but Ohanian recently emphasized that the platform must retain its humanity to stay competitive.\n\nMarkowitz, the author and managing partner and director of research at Nightview Capital, a long-term-oriented investment firm, responded to Schumer with an essay almost as long, which criticized the practice of chasing speed and replacing the value of humanity simply because it could be done.\n\n\"These two worlds — Wall Street and Silicon Valley — have formed a feedback loop of short-termism so tight, so self-reinforcing, that they've confused efficiency with purpose, growth with meaning, and the elimination of people with progress,\" wrote Markowitz.\n\n\"I have two research assistants. Could I replace them with AI? Of course. But their value extends their weekly output,\" Markowitz added. \"They give meaning to my work and I love seeing the excitement in their faces when they make a new discovery that I, alone, could not have found.\"\n\n\"Let me say it again: we are not our tools. We never have been,\" Markowitz wrote in conclusion.\n\nMcLees, the founder of HumanSkills.AI, wrote on X that Shumer is not wrong, but he said that the advice Shumer provided is akin to \"telling someone the floodwaters are rising and handing them a better bucket.\"\n\n\"As AI grows in ability, our role in defining direction, values, and purpose only becomes more essential,\" McLees said.\n\n\"What do you bring when the machine can do the work? That's the only question that matters when intelligence is abundant,\" McLees added. \"Shumer wrote the alarm. It's a good one. But alarms don't tell you where to go. You have to find that within yourself.\"\n\nMarcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU and founder of AI companies Robust.AI, has some harsh words for Schumer in his newsletter.\n\nMarcuz called Shumer's blog post \"weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech,\" and said he did not provide real data to support the claim that the latest AI can write complicated apps without mistakes.\n\n\"Shumer's presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere,\" Marcus added, after discussing various studies that question the accuracy and productivity gain AI tools actually provide.\n\nMisra, Vice Dean of Computing and Artificial Intelligence at Columbia University, responded in a lengthy Substack article that detailed why he doesn't think AI is as scary as it sounds, at least not right now.\n\nMisra wrote that many strange AI behaviors that make them seem sentient, such as perceived resistance and self-preservation, are simply a result of training data.\n\nAs for the possible elimination of jobs, Misra said he understands the anxiety, but history says we may not need to panic.\n\n\"When the camera was invented, portrait painters had every reason to panic. Their livelihood depended on a skill that a machine could now approximate,\" Misra wrote.\n\n\"What happened? Painters didn't disappear. They were freed from the obligation to faithfully reproduce reality and ventured into impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism,\" Misra added. \"The camera didn't kill painting. It liberated it.\"",

    "description": "AI's next phase will shift from Nvidia and cloud leaders to large incumbent companies adopting the technology to boost profits and cut costs.",
    "fullText": "Investors are growing jittery about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence stocks, but the real payoff may be just beginning — and it could extend well beyond Silicon Valley's usual winners, a $19 billion hedge fund investor said.\n\n\"This is a generational platform shift. We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",
