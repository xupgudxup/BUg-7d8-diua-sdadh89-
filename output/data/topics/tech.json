    "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Issue 'Bold' Statement: 'It Shouldn't Have Come to This'",
    "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle slam Big Tech's safety failures in reaction to Australia's social media ban for children under 16.",
    "fullText": "Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, have released a powerful statement via their Archewell Foundation regarding the world’s first law implemented in Australia that bans social media for children under the age of 16. The couple, who have focused their philanthropic work on online safety and mental wellness, lauded the nation's leadership while cautioning that the measure does not fix the root cause of the crisis.\n\nThe legislation took effect on December 10, targeting platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Twitter (X), and Snapchat, and imposing potential fines of up to AUD$50 million ($49.5 million USD) on companies that fail to keep young users off their services.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess summed up their complex reaction with a strong statement: \"It shouldn't have come to this.\" They expanded on their praise, celebrating the urgency of the intervention against addiction and exploitation. “We celebrate Australia’s leadership for seeing and acting on how these technology companies are negatively impacting young people with little to no recourse or accountability, and feeble efforts from the companies to stem the flow of harms,” the statement reads.\n\nHarry and Meghan emphasized that the bold move sends a necessary signal to Silicon Valley. They view the ban as vital for protecting children at a critical developmental stage. “This bold, decisive action to protect children at a critical moment in their development sends a strong signal that a child’s mind is not a commodity to be exploited. It buys young people valuable time back in their childhoods, but it doesn’t fix the fundamental issue we all still face with social media platforms.”\n\nThe couple pointed to the devastating human cost that necessitated the government’s action. “We’ve heard from too many grieving parents. Too many families devastated by cyberbullying, feeds that radicalize kids toward self-harm, and algorithmic manipulation designed to maximize engagement at any cost.”\n\nThe statement also acknowledged the significant positive potential of social media, particularly for vulnerable youth, arguing that these platforms can be a “genuine lifeline” for LGBTQ+ young people and those suffering mental health crises. However, the omnipresent harms often overshadow the benefits.\n\nThe core of the couple's critique is that the ban is only a temporary solution. “Here’s the truth: the ban is an effective measure to stop imminent harm, but ultimately only works as a band aid that does not address tech’s broken design and exploitive business incentives, requiring us to protect young people in the first place.”\n\nThe statement concluded by calling for a \"reckoning,\" hoping this Australian ban will force tech leaders to take responsibility for platforms built with growth as their first principle, rather than safety. The message notes what the Sussexes deem to be an ethical failure: \"The companies ‘unintended consequences’ of a decade ago are now part of their money making strategy, and children have become their collateral.”\n\nNext: Prince Harry Called Oprah in a Panic to Handle Delicate ‘Problem’ at Home",

    "fullText": "One of the most fundamental algorithms that appears in interviews at big tech companies is Binary Search. Of course, nobody will ask you to implement binary search directly. However, as Jon Bentley cited in his famous book Programming Pearls, only a small percentage of people he asked—10% to be precise—were able to code this algorithm without any errors.\n\nHere, I will show you a correct implementation of binary search, its variants that appear in interviews, and LeetCode problems that you can solve using these techniques.\n\nGiven an array of items, we can find the position of a specific item linearly by iterating over the array, comparing each item with the desired item, and returning the position when the current item equals the desired item.\n\nWe must also consider the case where the desired item is not in the array; in this case, we can return any value. Since we are talking about positions in an array, we can return -1 if the item is not present. This is a very simple concept and implementation. However, if the array is sorted, we can do better.\n\nWe can find the position of an item in logarithmic time (O(log n)), where n is the number of items in the array, when the array is sorted.\n\nTo do this, we repeatedly compare the item we are looking for with the middle element of the array. If the middle element is the one we are looking for, we have our result. Otherwise, we need to update the range of the array we are considering accordingly.\n\nIf the element we are looking for is greater than the middle element, we need to search in the higher part of the array. Otherwise, we need to search in the lower part of the array.\n\nWhat we just described is the Binary Search algorithm. Below is the implementation of the binary search algorithm in C++:\n\nThis is less than 20 lines of code that you need to understand very well if you want to be successful in an interview. Note that I said “understand,” not “memorize.”\n\ncould be implemented in different ways, such as:\n\nCan you explain why the first implementation is better than the second?\n\nThe answer is integer overflow. When we add two integer numbers, we can exceed the maximum value allowed in the computer’s representation of an int. Knowing these details and how to answer such questions puts you in a much better position compared to other candidates.\n\nAs you can see, even a small detail can demonstrate your expertise and experience. All these small details together help you get the position you want.\n\nDespite these details, as I said, nobody will ask you to implement binary search directly. However, there are some important variants of the binary search algorithm that appear as part of problem-solving. I will describe four of them in the next sections.\n\nLet’s consider we have a sorted array with duplicate elements, such as [10, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40, 50]. Also, let’s assume we are searching for the element 30 and we need to find the smallest position of this element in case of duplication.\n\nWith the binary search algorithm implementation shown above, we cannot guarantee we will always return the smallest position of an element in case of duplication. However, we can modify the original algorithm to answer this question correctly.\n\nAnd here is a very important point: You can only make this modification if you know the binary search algorithm and its implementation well.\n\nThinking about the problem, instead of returning the position when we find the element in the array, we need to update our result and continue the search in the lower part of the array.\n\nUpdating the result instead of returning immediately is easy to see. You cannot return immediately because there may be duplicate elements in the array. Since we want the smallest position, we cannot just return.\n\nSo, why go to the lower part of the array instead of the higher part? The answer is because of the problem definition: we want the smallest index. So, if we find the element, in case of duplication, we are interested in the presence of this element before the current position.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nThis problem is similar to the one above, but now we are interested in the higher part of the array in case of duplication. This is because we want the largest index instead of the smallest one.\n\nIn this case, the implementation in C++ could be:\n\nThis is a little different, but only slightly. Now, we are not interested in finding an element, but the largest value less than the given element. So, every time we find an element that is smaller than our desired element, we need to update our result. We also need to update the considered range of the array.\n\nIn this case, we are interested in the higher part of the array, since we are trying to find the largest value less than our element.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nSimilar to the problem above, but now we are interested in finding the smallest value greater than the desired value. So, we need to update our result when we find a larger element instead of a smaller one.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nHere are some interesting problems to solve on LeetCode using the techniques explained in this post:",

    "fullText": "Most people don't get told their genius might destroy the company they built. But Jeff Bezos isn't most people. At Italian Tech Week in October, the Amazon founder looked back on an early piece of feedback that changed the way he approached invention—and may have helped save Amazon from becoming its own worst enemy.\n\n\"I am an inventor,\" Bezos told the audience. \"This is my fundamental nature.\" His favorite place? In a room with a whiteboard, surrounded by a small group, spitballing ideas. \"You can literally put me in front of a whiteboard and I can come up with a hundred ideas in half an hour,\" he said with a grin.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nBut that endless flow of innovation—once considered a superpower—nearly became a liability. In the early years of Amazon, one longtime executive pulled Bezos aside with a blunt warning. \"Jeff, you have enough ideas to destroy Amazon,\" Jeff Wilke told him.\n\nIt stunned him. \"This was such a shocking idea for me,\" Bezos admitted. Wilke, a manufacturing expert, saw the problem clearly: every new idea was essentially a task dropped into a queue. If the company couldn't absorb it fast enough, it wasn't just useless—it was destructive.\n\n\"You have to release the work at the right rate that the organization can accept it,\" Bezo said, quoting Wilke. \"You're creating a backlog, a queue, work in process. It's adding no value and in fact, it's creating distraction.\"\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThat was the moment Bezos shifted. Instead of flooding Amazon with nonstop initiatives, he started filtering. \"I started prioritizing the ideas better, keeping lists of them, keeping them to myself until the organization was ready,\" he said.\n\nEven more important, Bezos began thinking like a builder—not just of ideas, but of infrastructure. \"How can I build an organization that can be ready for more ideas?\" he said. The answer was scaling leadership, growing bandwidth, and creating systems that could handle multiple innovations at once.\n\nAmazon didn't slow down after that—it got smarter. \"We built a company that's very good at inventing and doing more than one thing at a time,\" Bezos said. But none of it worked until he accepted a hard truth: ideas are powerful, but only if they're released at the right moment. Without discipline, even genius becomes a liability.",

    "description": "Drone schools in Ukraine say they've realized what traits tend to make people the best pilots for the fight against Russia.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's drone schools say it's clear: young, tech-savvy people with a gaming background make the best drone pilots.\n\nAcross the country, drone schools are training new operators for what has become one of the most important roles in Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion — flying the drones that scout Russian positions, find targets, and blow up tanks and troops.\n\nThree leaders working at two schools told Business Insider that younger students with gaming or tech experience tend to consistently pick up skills the fastest. These students often are already comfortable with controllers, joysticks, and staring at a screen for a long time.\n\nThe instructor comments offer insight into what kind of person makes the best pilot, useful as Ukraine continues to fight for its survival and Western militaries study the war, investing more heavily in drone programs for a potential future fight.\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said younger people and gamers, \"are really good because their system of motor movements in their hands is already well developed.\"\n\nHis colleague, Tetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, agreed, telling BI that \"those who used to play video games, those who are accustomed to using a joystick, would be better in terms of running an FPV drone.\"\n\nTechnical fluency matters too. It's easier to train people with IT or engineering backgrounds than it is teachers, marketing specialists, or accountants. This war is one of rapidly evolving technology and tactics, especially in drone warfare.\n\nBeing an operator isn't just about physical control; it's about really understanding how drones work and what they can do. The school strives to instill these principles in all students.\n\nAnd gaming experience, technical knowledge, and flexible adaptation in the face of new technology tend to be more easily found among younger students. If they're over 50, Tetyana explained, \"it is a bit more challenging for students to get hold of controlling some types of drones.\"\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said someone who flies well isn't automatically a strong combat operator — but after a year of training, his team has identified what works.\n\n\"Young people aged 18-27 are the easiest to train,\" he said. \"They memorize information and acquire skills faster and more effectively. As we have noted, the older a person is, the more difficult it is for them to learn.\"\n\nSimilar to the other drone school leaders, Pervak said people who have a technical mindset can absorb training \"more easily and understand the intricacies of using UAVs in combat better.\" Those who were programmers and gamers often \"find it easiest to focus on a monitor for long periods of time. Everyone else must develop this skill.\"\n\nGood health is also key, but he said the school has nonetheless \"successfully trained people with visual and hearing impairments, back problems, contusions, and even head injuries.\"\n\nDrones account for about 60% of Ukraine's front-line strikes, according to the country's commander-in-chief. With shortages of artillery shells and other weaponry, Ukraine has leaned heavily on drones. The inexpensive systems have been highly effective at damaging and destroying equipment worth millions.\n\nCheap drones offer an asymmetric advantage and provide the Ukrainian military with combat power it couldn't generate with humans and crewed assets alone. But its drone force is only as strong as its pilots are capable, making drone training essential.\n\nThe drone school leaders are not alone in their assessment of who tends to make the best pilots.\n\nUkrainian soldiers with gaming backgrounds have also credited that experience for their skills, and Ukraine's special drone unit, Typhoon, previously told Business Insider that gamers make great drone pilots. But they also cautioned that real drone warfare is much more complicated and dangerous than any video game.\n\nOne Typhoon operator said that \"people think flying a military drone is like playing 'Call of Duty,' until they realize there's no restart option,\" referring to the popular video game.\n\nWestern drone pilots have previously expressed similar sentiments. Tanner Yackley, a former US Air Force drone operator who left in 2018, previously told Business Insider that it's fundamentally different because \"you're making life or death calls every single day.\"\n\n\"There's not a single game in the world that can prep you for what you're going to do,\" he said.\n\nAs NATO watches the war in Ukraine, worried about a wider conflict, its forces are already adapting and also looking to gamers, even embracing tech from the gaming world to make it easier for younger troops to quickly skill up on new technology.\n\nSome American and European troops, for instance, are training on a new air-defense system that uses an Xbox controller to launch interceptor drones.\n\nThe drone schools, however, are constantly grappling with challenges, such as limited funding, reliance on donated drones, and the threat of Russian strikes. They have to keep their curricula updated, with instructors traveling to the front and rewriting lessons every couple of weeks to match the rapid battlefield shifts.",

Cloud sales rose 34% from the previous quarter but also fell short of estimates.\n\nImportantly, Oracle also pledged to spend about $15 billion more next year than previously forecast, sparking fresh concerns about aggressive capex among the biggest tech firms.\n\nThe tech titan's stock drop was enough to weigh on other AI names and drag markets lower in Thursday's session.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood at the 9:30 a.m. ET opening bell on Thursday:\n\n• Nasdaq 100: 25,563.72, down 0.8%\n\nOracle stock has been highly volatile lately, dropping almost 20% in the last month after a huge surge following a blockbuster revenue forecast issued in September.\n\nIt's flurry of deals cemented the company as an AI power player, announcing a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, new partnership commitments with both Nvidia and Meta Platforms, and plans to expand its AI and cloud computing infrastructure in booming international markets.\n\nNow Oracle's lackluster earnings are prompting speculation that its big plans in the space are going to take awhile to payoff, and that it's spending plans are too ambitious. Morgan Stanley described the results as a moment when investors might resume their disbelief about the AI trade.\n\n\"Cloud growth at the low-end of the guide with building pressure on gross margins and op margins may further sap investor confidence in ORCL's ability to execute efficiently against a large and growing book of GPUaaS business, leaving the shares lacking a clear catalyst,\" analysts at the bank wrote on Thursday.\n\nSeveral other high-growth AI stocks were pulled down by Oracle's earnings report, dragging down the entire S&P 500 index, which fell 0.31% in premarket hours, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index rose slightly.\n\nHere are some of the biggest losers on Thursday:\n\nFor many investors, it is likely concerning that a company like Oracle could manage to fall short of analyst estimates after doing so much to position itself as an AI infrastructure leader this year. The key takeaway is likely that the company overpromised on what it could deliver.\n\n\"Oracle faces its own mounting scrutiny over a debt-fueled data center build-out and concentration risk amid questions over the outcome of AI spending uncertainty,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"This revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending.\n\nThe concerns aren't limited to Oracle. While some have recently argued that the biggest AI fears may be overblown, it's possible that if one major tech player overspent on AI in 2025, others may have done the same. This could weigh on investor sentiment around AI as the market heads into 2026.",

    "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company's licensing deal with OpenAI will let it capitalize on a fast-growing technology and engage younger audiences.",
    "fullText": "Disney CEO Bob Iger says his company's major licensing deal with OpenAI is all about establishing a foothold in a new realm of entertainment and engaging younger audiences.\n\nThe licensing agreement gives ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora video platform access to Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader. Disney is also investing $1 billion in the AI company and becoming a \"major customer.\"\n\nSpeaking on CNBC about the deal with OpenAI's Sam Altman on Thursday, Iger said it gives Disney a chance to get in on a fast-growing area of tech.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" Iger said.\n\nIger said the deal also fulfills a longtime desire by Disney to put user-generated content on its Disney+ streaming platform. Disney initially plans to put select videos created on Sora onto Disney+ to increase engagement with users, especially younger ones. Ultimately, Iger wants to let Disney+ users create such videos within the platform itself.\n\n\"That's a big step for us,\" he said.\n\nDisney has long been highly protective of its famous characters and storylines, and Iger is widely seen in Hollywood as a champion of the creative set. But like other entertainment players, Disney has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content. Social media and user-generated content, in contrast, continue to rise. The bet with OpenAI is that the deal can get people to spend more time on Disney platforms by giving them new ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nIger has long positioned the company as pro-technology, and he said, in reference to the OpenAI deal, that he'd rather participate in technological innovation than be disrupted by it.\n\n\"We think this is actually a way for us to be part of these developments, as opposed to being harmed by them,\" he said.\n\nIger said the deal is also a way for Disney to participate in the big rise in user-generated short-form video on social-media platforms.\n\nAltman said Thursday that the demand for Disney characters, in particular, is \"off the charts\" on OpenAI's products. He said he sees the deal enabling people to do things like putting themselves in a lightsaber scene from \"Star Wars\" or creating a custom birthday video for their kid using the Buzz Lightyear character.\n\nAI firms have been \"frenemies\" to media companies, as many in Hollywood are concerned about how they use copyrighted material and the threat that they could pose to the creative process. Iger said the OpenAI deal is good for creators rather than a threat.\n\n\"This does not in any way represent a threat to the creators at all. In fact, the opposite,\" Iger said. \"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it.\"\n\nDisney said the agreement does not include any talent likeness or voices and that OpenAI would have guardrails in place to make sure Disney's IP was used in a safe way.\n\nIn June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. That suit is ongoing.",

    "description": "Thanks to tech advances, bosses are gaining new ways to track what workers are up to — and sometimes that even extends beyond the office.",
    "fullText": "Your boss has never had more ways to peer over your shoulder.\n\nIt's not new for bosses to watch workers, of course — especially on corporate devices. But technology updates that let employers better monitor whether you're in the office, or view texts on employer-owned devices, are giving employers even more control.\n\nEmployer surveillance has grown because of the rise of remote work, and because of a proliferation of tools that allow for monitoring, a recent report from the US Government Accountability Office found.\n\nNow, not only has tech improved, say workplace observers, so has the power of many employers over their workers.\n\nDiscussions over worker monitoring are \"one of the pieces on the chessboard\" in negotiations between employers and employees, said Ben Zhao, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago.\n\nIt's a reversal of a pandemic-era power shift that briefly favored workers on issues such as more flexible hours or remote work. As the job market cools, bosses monitoring workers' logins more closely, for example, is a way to \"get some of that power back,\" he said.\n\nZhao, who has focused on information security and privacy issues for several decades, said employers also realize that workers have many ways to go outside a company's walls — from unsanctioned AI tools to online chat platforms — to find and share information. That can create security and legal headaches.\n\nSome back-and-forth between workers and employers over what information bosses have access to is normal, he said, but there's a risk when it's not disclosed.\n\nNew technology can give employers more opportunities to monitor employee activities, if they so choose. A recent update at Google, for instance, adds to the capabilities that companies have for archiving text messages on employer-owned Android phones.\n\nAt Microsoft, a coming change to its Teams messaging tool will automatically update your work location when you connect to your employer's WiFi.\n\nWith both features, employers would have to switch on those options.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Business Insider that the Android update is an optional feature for work phones in \"regulated industries\" where employers spell out that they're required to archive communications.\n\n\"This update simply allows organizations to support modern messaging — giving employees messaging benefits like high-quality media sharing and typing indicators — while maintaining the same compliance standards that already apply to SMS messaging,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe forthcoming Microsoft feature, which allows Teams to identify which company building workers are in based on their WiFi connection, is \"intended to help employees coordinate in-person work more smoothly with their teams,\" a spokesperson said in an email to Business Insider.\n\n\"It is not a monitoring tool and we do not support employee surveillance in any way,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\nAccording to the US Government Accountability Office, workers tend to be in favor of monitoring if it's intended to protect their safety, and often are opposed if it's intended to track productivity.\n\nEarlier this year, AT&T reduced the use of an attendance-tracking system that had frustrated some employees due to inaccuracies in tallying when people were in the office.\n\nThe shift highlights tensions that can emerge in the workplace over tracking efforts.\n\n\"Any workplace surveillance should have strict limitations on its use,\" said William Budington, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group advocating for digital rights. That might include not using the technology outside the workplace or beyond work hours, he said.\n\nAnother risk, Budington said, is that workers can easily forget they're carrying a company-issued device. Workers might text a friend, check medical information, or go on social media — even though employers could have full access to communications and location data.\n\nIt's not, Budington said, \"a scary ankle monitor that you are forced to wear.\" Yet it can amount to the same thing if workers carry their company phone with them outside the office, he said.\n\nThe most legally and ethically fraught issue isn't what employers can do with the phones and laptops they hand workers; it's what bosses might extract from personal equipment that workers use for their jobs.\n\nOne benefit of improved technology is that IT departments can often remove work-related information from a worker's personal phone without wiping the entire device as they might have been forced to in the past, said Vanessa Matsis-McCready, VP of HR services and associate general counsel at Engage PEO, which provides HR services.\n\nShe said that while employers often have policies for devices that access their networks, intercepting workers' personal information can cause hassles for employers.\n\n\"A lot of companies want to do the right thing,\" Matsis-McCready said. \"They don't want to know all this information either, because if they have it, then they have to keep it safe.\"\n\nWith company-owned devices, employers have access to any personal information you put into them, she said.\n\nWhere it gets tricky, Matsis-McCready said, is when an employer is tracking a personal device and a worker might be talking with a headhunter, going on a personal trip, or heading to a doctor's appointment.\n\nUltimately, she said, workers who have questions about what their employers might be monitoring should ask.\n\n\"I don't think a person should ever feel powerless,\" Matsis-McCready said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your workplace?

    "description": "Leading tech and AI companies are thinking with their stomachs when it comes to naming their secretive AI advancements.",
    "fullText": "It may sound like a trip through the produce aisle, but leading AI companies have something much more important on their lists.\n\nMeta, OpenAI, and Google have all relied on food-related names for their sometimes secretive plans for future AI models. Thinking with your stomach is nothing new for Silicon Valley, just look at the assortment of desserts Android assembled over the years before Google had its fill.\n\nHere is a look at the mouthwatering and just plain goofy names AI and tech companies are using\n\nMeta has codenamed its future AI frontier model \"avocado,\" per a CNBC report. Guac usually costs extra, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's AI pivot has not come cheap. Meta plans to spend more than $70 billion this year on AI infrastructure, which is on top of $14 billion investment Meta made in Scale AI and to poach its founder, Alexandr Wang.\n\nOpenAI has hit a rough patch, feeling the heat from Google's advances and stumbling with a series of missteps. So perhaps it was time to spice things up. The ChatGPT maker has codenamed its new large language model \"garlic,\" according to The Information. Garlic is separate from another LLM OpenAI is developing, codenamed \"Shallotpeat.\"\n\nGoogle appears to have loved a codename so much that it made it public. Google's AI image generator in Gemini is named Nano Banana Pro, which it released on November 20. Before then, Google had internally called the model nano-banana, though they had not publicly disclosed their zany choice.\n\nThe clearance section offers a wide selection of great names. OpenAI might have one of the best all-time codenames with \"strawberry,\" which it used to refer to its o1 model. The name was likely a play on the viral struggle of AI models to correctly identify the number of Rs in the fruit. Before Strawberry, OpenAI had a secretive project named Q*.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk's xAI had a sweet tooth when it codenamed an early testing version of Grok-3 \"chocolate.\"\n\nMistral AI, the France-based startup, went in a completely opposite direction with \"Jaguar,\" its codename for a testing model.\n\nAnd Anthropic named its family of models Opus, Sonnett, and Hakiu, a trio of three different types of compositions.",

    "description": "The startup's new tech could compete with Big Tech's health AI projects from heavyweights like Alphabet and OpenAI.",
    "fullText": "Included Health is rolling out a new AI tool that could pit it against Big Tech's latest health bets.\n\nThe healthcare startup has launched an AI-powered personal health assistant, Business Insider has learned exclusively. The tech draws on patients' medical claims, benefits information, and other data to offer on-demand answers to health-related questions.\n\nIncluded Health is tapping into a hot area in healthcare AI, where it's competing against other health startups as well as tech heavyweights. Alphabet's Verily released its own AI-powered app in October that allows patients to connect their medical records and ask a chatbot their health-related questions. OpenAI wants to win in consumer health tech, too, and is considering building tools such as its own personal health assistant, Business Insider reported in November.\n\nIncluded Health has been scaling on the premise of personalizing how patients interact with their healthcare for over a decade. The company, which sells tech to about 300 employers and health plans to help patients better navigate their health benefits, tested its AI assistant for about 18 months to ensure its accuracy in smaller pilots before making it available to its entire employer base, CEO Owen Tripp said.\n\n\"This can't be ChatGPT level of probability. It has to be precise,\" he said.\n\nTripp is optimistic about patients receiving general health guidance from LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. Those AI tools can help patients learn more about their conditions and prepare for doctor's visits, he said. But he emphasized that Included's tech takes that guidance a step further.\n\n\"When it gets down to the business of actually taking care of oneself or taking care of somebody else, you're going to need a lot of very secure, specific data and a whole context to go solve problems, including the exact medical history of that patient,\" Tripp said.\n\nPatient-facing healthcare AI sometimes walks a regulatory tightrope, especially if the tech provides personalized advice that effectively replaces the work clinicians are licensed to do. Tripp said he doubts that most large tech companies attempting to delve into medical records aggregation will want to grapple with that complexity.\n\n\"I predict, like many before them, they will pull back. It's just hard, and the juice is often not worth the squeeze for these high-profile companies,\" he said.\n\nIncluded Health's personal health assistant, called Dot, has become its members' front door and the foundation for Included's new products, said COO Nupur Srivastava.\n\nIncluded recently put Dot in front of members during open enrollment to help answer their benefits questions, Srivastava said. The AI agent can also help patients prepare for doctor's visits and send the clinician a summary of patients' past visits ahead of time.\n\nIncluded Health still employs plenty of its own clinicians and care advocates that members can talk to if they prefer. Srivastava also noted that if a patient mentions the term 'suicide' in a conversation with Dot, \"within a minute, someone will call you.\"\n\nWhen asked about Big Tech and AI startups' ambitions to build personalized health AI, Tripp said that Included Health is in talks with multiple potential partners to help them achieve those goals. He didn't specify which companies it's talking to, but he suggested some AI companies are focused on acquiring personalized health data that they can anonymize and use to train models.\n\n\"But when it comes to actually delivering patient care, we're pretty confident that companies that are going to succeed will be the ones that have well-trained physicians licensed in all 50 states, delivering on a real-time platform, across mind, body, and wallet,\" he said.\n\nIncluded Health was supposed to go public in 2022. The startup had hired banks for an IPO push, but pulled out of its planned investor meetings when the market started to tank, Tripp told Business Insider in January.\n\nTripp declined to share specifics about Included's exit strategy as of November. But Included is profitable, so the company doesn't need to raise money through a public listing, he said. Included hasn't publicly fundraised since it was formed from the 2021 merger of Grand Rounds and Doctor on Demand, and the company hasn't shared its valuation.\n\nThe public markets haven't been forgiving to healthcare startups. Only two digital health companies went public this year, Hinge Health and Omada Health. And while Hinge and Omada have fared far better than most companies that listed during digital health's 2021 IPO wave, healthcare IPO hopefuls still face high standards to going public and significant volatility risks once they begin trading.\n\n\"The last few years in our space haven't been a great commercial for being a public company,\" Tripp said.\n\nWith so many developments in healthcare AI, however, Tripp does recognize that an IPO could create opportunities for Included Health to acquire other companies.\n\n\"I do think this is a time where there are going to be some interesting capabilities and technologies available in the market that allow us to provide even more service to our members,\" he said. \"I do have my eyes very open to how I would use capital to execute on some of those M&A events. That part is more important to me.\"",

    "description": "Archaeologists have found the earliest evidence yet of fire technology — and it was created by Neanderthals in England more than 400,000 years ago.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nNeanderthals were the world's first innovators of fire technology, tiny specks of evidence in England suggest. Flecks of pyrite found at a more than 400,000-year-old archaeological site in Suffolk, in eastern England, push back archaeologists' evidence for controlled fire-making and suggest that key human brain developments began far earlier than previously thought.\n\n\"We're a species who've used fire to really shape the world around us,\" study co-author Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said in a news conference on Tuesday (Dec. 9). \"The ability to make fire would have been critically important\" in human evolution, Davis said, \"accelerating evolutionary trends\" such as developing larger brains, maintaining larger social groups, and increasing language skills.\n\nSince 2013, Davis and colleagues have been excavating an archaeological site in England called Barnham, which yielded stone tools, burnt sediment and charcoal from 400,000 years ago. In a study published Wednesday (Dec. 10) in the journal Nature, the researchers revealed that the site contained the world's earliest direct evidence of fire-making — and that this fire technology was likely pioneered by Neanderthals.\n\nBarnham was first recognized as a Paleolithic human site in the early 1900s due to the presence of stone tools. But recent excavations uncovered evidence of ancient human groups occupying the area more than 415,000 years ago, when Barnham was a small, seasonal watering hole in a woodland depression.\n\nIn one corner of the site, archaeologists found a concentration of heat-shattered hand axes as well as a zone of reddened clay. Through a series of scientific analyses, the researchers discovered that the reddened clay had been subjected to repeated, localized burning, which suggested the area may have been an ancient hearth.\n\n\"The big turning point came with the discovery of iron pyrite,\" study co-author Nick Ashton, curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, said in the news conference.\n\nPyrite, also known as fool's gold, is a naturally occurring mineral that can produce sparks when struck against flint. While pyrite is found in many locations around the world, it is extremely rare in the Barnham area, meaning someone specifically brought pyrite to the site, probably with the aim of making fire, the researchers said in the study.\n\nBecause of the importance of controlled fire, paleoanthropologists have long debated the timing of this invention.\n\n\"There are so many obvious advantages to fire, from cooking to protection from predators to its technological use in creating new types of artifacts to its ability to bring people together,\" April Nowell, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the University of Victoria in Canada who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"We only have to think of our own childhoods gathering around a campfire to understand its emotional resonance.\"\n\nResearchers believe that early humans first used wildfires for cooking food. This was a crucial step in human evolution because cooking widened the range of food available and made it more digestible, which in turn provided more nutrients needed to grow a larger brain, Davis said.\n\nBut there is limited evidence for deliberate early fire technology, and that evidence is often ambiguous, the researchers noted in the study.\n\nFor example, scientists unearthed reddened sediment at Koobi Fora in Kenya that dated to about 1.5 million years ago. Researchers suggested it could hint at early fire use because the key hominin at the site — Homo erectus — had a fairly large brain. And at two sites in Israel dated to about 800,000 years ago, burnt animal bones and stone tools suggest possible control of fire by the human ancestors who lived there.\n\nFire technology then exploded around 400,000 years ago. Archaeologists have found evidence of burning at cave sites in France, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and the U.K., and then more widespread use of fire in Europe, Africa and the Levant (the region around the east Mediterranean) by 200,000 years ago.\n\nBut these previous examples do not show the same kind of conclusive geochemical evidence of fire making that was found at Barnham, Ashton argued. He called the team's careful analysis of the Barnham sediment and identification of pyrite \"the most exciting discovery in my 40-year career.\"\n\nHowever, any bones at Barnham have since disintegrated, so the \"smoking gun\" of butchered and burned animal bones that could prove the site was used for cooking has not been found.\n\nThis also means there are no skeletal remains of the fire producers themselves at Barnham — but study co-author Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the National History Museum in London, has a guess about their identity.\n\n\"We assume that the fires at Barnham were being made by early Neanderthals,\" Stringer said in the news conference, based on a nearby site called Swanscombe, where Neanderthal skull bones were discovered that dated to the same time period as Barnham.\n\nWhile experts have known for about a decade that some Neanderthals could make fire, that evidence goes back only 50,000 years. The Barnham finds push that date 350,000 years further back, suggesting Neanderthals were much smarter than most people give them credit for.\n\nNeanderthals \"are fully human,\" Stringer said. \"They have complex behavior, they're adapting to new environments, and their brains are as large as ours. They're very evolved humans.\"\n\nNowell said that the study's results add fuel to a larger debate about Neanderthals' control of fire and their social and cultural use of it.\n\n\"There is a lot of discussion right now about whether all Neanderthals made fire or if it is only some Neanderthals at some times and places that made fire,\" Nowell said. The new study \"is another important data point in our understanding of Neanderthal pyrotechnical capabilities with all that implies cognitively, socially and technologically.\"\n\nIf the researchers are correct that Neanderthals made fire from flint and pyrite more than 400,000 years ago in England, this raises additional questions, Nowell said.\n\n—Neanderthals could be brought back within 20 years — but is it a good idea?\n\n—Neanderthals cannibalized 'outsider' women and children 45,000 years ago at cave in Belgium\n\n—'Perfectly preserved' Neanderthal skull bones suggest their noses didn't evolve to warm air\n\n\"Despite its obvious advantages, questions remain about the nature of early fire use: When did fire use become a regular part of the human behavioral repertoire? Were early humans dependent on the opportunistic use of wildfires and lightning strikes? Was fire rediscovered multiple times?\" Nowell said.\n\nThe ancestors of Homo sapiens were living in Africa 400,000 years ago and not likely interacting with early Neanderthals half a world away.\n\n\"We don't know if Homo sapiens at that date had the ability to make fire,\" Stringer said, because to date there is no clear evidence for control of fire any earlier than Barnham.\n\nThis means that Neanderthals may have invented ways to make and control fire somewhere in continental Europe, which then enabled our human cousins to move further north into England, heating and lighting their way with fire.\n\n\"It's plausible that fire became more controlled in Europe and spread to Africa,\" Ashton said. \"We have to keep an open mind.\"",

    "title": "The daily schedule of Elon Musk, from his hearty breakfast to a 3 a.m. bedtime",
    "description": "Elon Musk has amassed a $491 billion fortune through his work at Tesla, SpaceX, and more. Here's the tech CEO's daily routine.",
    "fullText": "He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, the social media platform, X — and he's also a father of at least 14 children.\n\nAccording to Forbes, he's amassed a fortune worth $491 billion, making him the world's richest person. Musk has said he didn't get there by working a typical 40-hour week, and is instead known to have a strenuous schedule that he said has demanded 120-hour workweeks in the past.\n\nStill, the South African mogul shares similarities with the average person in his typical daily routine. Like many of us, Musk enjoys a sweet treat in the morning and spends time scrolling social media.\n\nHere's how his days usually go, according to interviews and posts by Musk himself over the years.\n\nMusk told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 that he usually goes to bed around 3 a.m. and sleeps for six hours. So, he's typically waking up around 9 a.m. each day.\n\nHe might've been trolling when he wrote a response to a doctor that same year on X saying he eats \"a donut every morning,\" but a quick search of Musk's posts reveals he's quite a fan of the pastry.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in December 2025, he gave an updated glimpse into his morning routine, saying his typical breakfast is \"steak and eggs and coffee.\"\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he was trying to break the cycle of checking his phone as soon as he woke up. While on the Full Send Podcast, Musk described it as \"a terrible habit\" he hoped to escape.\n\nBut, as of 2023, he still wakes up and immediately looks at his phone for emergencies, the Journal reported.\n\nIf his posts on X are any indication, the habit persists. He has been active on the platform since before he acquired it in a $44 billion deal in 2022, often posting at odd hours and in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's unclear if Musk slots in time to post and respond to others each day, but it certainly looks like he rarely takes a day off from the app.\n\n\"Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it's still working,\" Musk told Walter Isaacson in the \"Elon Musk\" biography.\n\nMusk previously credited showering with having the biggest positive effect on his daily life.\n\nDuring an AMA session on Reddit in 2015, a user asked which of his daily habits impacted his life the most.\n\nAs the CEO of one of the leading EV makers in the US, it's no surprise that Musk has more than one option for his daily commute.\n\nWhen an X user posted a meme about deciding between driving a Cybertruck without autopilot or a Tesla Model S with self-driving technology, Musk responded that it's a choice he faces \"every day.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck has been in the backdrop of many celebrity paparazzi shots and Instagram posts since its official launch in November.\n\nLike many, Musk appears to have had ups and downs in his relationship with physical exercise over the years. In 2021, he told Joe Rogan that he'd avoid it altogether if he could.\n\n\"I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air,\" he said on X in June 2023.\n\nBut less than two months later, he said he was \"lifting hard almost every day.\" Around the same time, talk of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg going head-to-head in a fight swirled online.\n\nMusk told Miller during his December 2025 podcast appearance that he often skips lunch or eats something \"small\" for his midday meal.\n\nDinner, though, can be \"anywhere,\" he told the podcast host, who is married to White House advisor Stephen Miller.\n\n\"I like the wide range of cuisine,\" Musk said, with \"American\" food like cheeseburgers and pizza being his favorites.\n\nHe added, \"If I had to say, like, there's only one thing you can ever have for the rest of time, which admittedly would be a bit monotonous, but it would probably be a cheeseburger, because cheeseburgers are amazing. It's a genius invention.\"\n\nNo wonder his Tesla Diner in Hollywood features burgers prominently on the menu.\n\nMusk has admitted on several occasions that running more than one company isn't easy. He splits time between his companies depending on the \"crisis of the moment,\" the 54-year-old said in 2021.\n\nOne X user pointed out in January 2023 that Musk had testified in a lawsuit in the morning, attended an event at a Nevada Tesla factory in the evening, and worked with Tesla on AI at night — all in one day.\n\nMusk responded that he'd also spent time at \"Twitter HQ past midnight.\"\n\nAnd then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.\n\n\"I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work—do that seven days a week,\" Musk told the Journal in 2023. \"I'll have to do that for a while — no choice — but I think once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.\"\n\nOn the Tesla earnings call in April 2024, Musk said: \"Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.\"\n\nAlthough he's not getting eight hours a night, Musk has upped his sleeping schedule from being nearly nonexistent in the past.\n\nIn May 2023, Musk told CNBC that he's no longer pulling all-nighters. Instead, he said he tries to get at least six hours of sleep.\n\nAccording to Isaacson's biography of Musk, the billionaire has spent many nights awake and pondering the issues his companies face. His former partner Claire Boucher — known by her stage name Grimes — also told Isaacson that Musk once stayed up all night playing the \"Elden Ring\" video game when it first came out.\n\nHe has a history of sleeping on the floors of his offices and the Tesla factory.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk all but moved into its San Francisco headquarters. He said there's a couch in the library that he would crash on from time to time.",

    "description": "Vertical Aerospace unveiled its new eVTOL, with controls inspired by the F-35 that make it easier to hover. Its first routes are planned for 2029.",
    "fullText": "Vertical Aerospace has unveiled its new flying taxi, Valo.\n\nAhead of its big reveal on Wednesday, I was one of the first people to get a look at the aircraft.\n\nFlying taxis are officially called electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, or eVTOLs.\n\nThe starting use case is that they can significantly reduce commute times between airports and city centers. Plus, they're quieter and less polluting than helicopters.\n\nFor example, Vertical says it would take 12 minutes between Canary Wharf and London Heathrow Airport, compared to over an hour via public transit or car.\n\nHowever, its planned network also includes regional links between significant English cities, which it hopes could boost growth.\n\nValo could also be operated for emergency medical services and cargo missions, while Vertical is planning a future hybrid version with autonomous capabilities.\n\nIt's aiming for regulatory approval from the UK's Civil Aviation Authority in 2028.\n\n\"Valo sets a new standard — bigger, safer and more capable than anything in the sector,\" said Vertical's chair, Dómhnal Slattery. \"It's a breakthrough for aviation and a clear sign of the UK's leadership in aerospace.\"\n\nHere's what it looks like inside Valo, and how it's also using design ideas from fighter jets.\n\nCanary Wharf is one of London's two primary financial districts, alongside the historic City of London. It was built on old docklands, and JPMorgan Chase recently announced plans for a new tower there.\n\nI got a look at the aircraft at the same time as numerous Vertical customers, which include American Airlines, Japan Airlines, and the helicopter operator Bristow.\n\nValo can reach speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. The firm aims to produce 175 units a year by 2030, ramping up to over 225 units annually.\n\nVertical is positioning itself as an original equipment manufacturer, or OEM — the same sort of role as Airbus and Boeing.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors like Archer Aviation are working on operational plans as well, which include setting their own ticket prices and planning apps for hailing aircraft.\n\nVertical is working with Skyports and Bristow on this network. The former builds infrastructure, known as vertiports — similar to helipads but with facilities for passengers and aircraft charging. Bristow specializes in operating civilian helicopters.\n\nA notable aspect of this network is its planned connections to Oxford and Cambridge. Transport links to the two cities, given their strength in academia and burgeoning startups, are seen as key to helping boost economic growth in the UK.\n\nMichael Cervenka, Vertical's chief commercial and strategy officer, compared it to the TARDIS from \"Doctor Who,\" which is famous for being much bigger on the inside than from the outside.\n\nIt was indeed surprising to see suitcase after Rimowa suitcase pulled out — 12 altogether.\n\nEVTOL manufacturers are building a new type of aircraft, so safety is paramount as they work toward certification. They're aiming to achieve the highest standard, which is also used for commercial airliners. This is referred to as 10-9, meaning one catastrophic failure in a billion flight hours.\n\nHaving several propellers and flaps means that if one of them stops working, the aircraft can still fly.\n\nTilting propellers also provide the pilot with more control.\n\n\"We can do something you would really struggle to do in any other tilt rotor or helicopter,\" Cervenka said. \"We can take off, we can hover one meter above the ground, or less, and we can do a 360-degree turn in gusting winds with the aircraft staying very stable.\"\n\nThis model was arranged with four seats, but there's also room for another two.\n\nWhile Archer and Joby's passenger seats are all forward-facing, this arrangement felt more futuristic.\n\nValo has a divider between the cabin and cockpit, and the pilot can talk to passengers via a speaker. In addition to privacy, this physical barrier enhances safety as nobody can interfere with the controls.\n\n\"Here, one of the really important things for us was: Yes, this starts with a premium service, but you don't know who you're getting into the aircraft with,\" Cervenka said.",

    "description": "Companies are pouring money into AI but failing to translate that investment into workforce capability, largely because traditional training methods don’t help employees retain or apply complex skills. Extended reality—virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality—bridges this gap by letting people learn through immersive, emotionally engaging, hands-on experiences that the brain encodes like real events. Organizations from Bank of America to Boeing to Walmart are already seeing faster learning, higher confidence, reduced errors, and lower costs by using XR to train employees in everything from customer-service scenarios to technical assembly. The technology works because it aligns with how people actually learn, benefits from major improvements in affordability and accessibility, and meets the expectations of a workforce already accustomed to immersive digital environments. The companies that start with focused pilot projects, match the right XR tool to the right skill gaps, and scale deliberately will build training systems that actually change behavior and materially improve performance.",

    "description": "The real story of the fight for Warner Bros. Discovery is viewers shifting from studios to tech platforms, impacting how and what you watch.",
    "fullText": "The Warner Bros. Discovery-Paramount-Netflix drama has Hollywood in a tizzy this week — but it's missing one big thing: What about you?\n\nAmericans are deep in a new era of entertainment and are increasingly likely to get their fix on YouTube and TikTok rather than with WBD's popular franchises like Harry Potter and \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nThe headlines around the deal have focused on whether Netflix or Paramount's David Ellison will win in the boardroom. But the results in your living room will be due to forces that are much bigger than the companies themselves, and have changed the way we watch. Movie theater releases are down, cable TV is dying, streaming prices are likely to rise, and Hollywood's power is waning in the age of tech giants.\n\nThe reason companies like Netflix and Paramount want to buy Warner Bros. is because competition in the entertainment industry is fierce, driven by the decline of cable TV and the rising popularity of small screens and tech companies.\n\n\"If Big Tech never made a move into media, there's a very good chance we wouldn't be seeing this much consolidation as we are now,\" said Brandon Katz, an entertainment analyst at Greenlight Analytics.\n\nNow that Americans spend more time with the big players in entertainment like Google-owned YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon, mergers can help legacy players like Disney, Fox, and Comcast compete. It'll mean lost jobs. The combo that formed WBD led to multiple rounds of layoffs, including about 1,000 roles in mid-2024. Both Paramount and Netflix present themselves as the bigger job savers, but both promise billions in \"synergies\" that will likely result in cuts.\n\n\"The problem is the acquisition and pending consolidation of two media giants, not who the buyer is,\" said The Writers Guild of America, the union representing TV and film writers.\n\nAdditionally, deals offer companies the opportunity to consolidate their brands. WBD has already combined HBO's prestige shows with Discovery's mainstream fare to form HBO Max, and Disney has brought Hulu and ESPN+ into its streaming bundle.\n\nIt all trickles down to what you get to watch, where you watch it, and how much you have to pay. Streaming prices have been increasing while big theatrical movie releases have declined over time, and there's good reason to think those trends will continue, regardless of where Warner Bros. ends up. Industry trends for movie-going are clear, with the number of wide releases and box-office grosses still below their pre-COVID levels.\n\nWhoever ends up with Warner's HBO Max will likely bundle it with their existing streamer and raise the price based on the more expansive offering, Katz said.\n\n\"Within 18 months, all consumers should expect to be paying more for these subscriptions,\" he said.\n\nIt's also widely expected that the combination of two of these companies will lead to less output. That's one of the main objections of Hollywood, whose livelihood depends on stuff getting made.\n\n\"This is one less entity writing checks,\" said Josh Rosenbaum, a producer at Waypoint Entertainment, whose credits have included Yorgos Lanthimos' Oscar-winning \"The Favourite.\"\n\nParamount promised that if it wins the WBD battle, it'll release 30 movies a year in theaters, while Netflix says it'll continue to put Warner Bros. movies in theaters while favoring a quick-to-streaming strategy for its own films. The Disney and Fox merger is a cautionary tale; their combined theatrical releases have declined nearly 50% since the merger was announced in 2017.\n\nThe dinosaurs may be fighting a losing battle. People (especially younger generations) are increasingly getting their entertainment from user-generated platforms. A Hub Entertainment Research survey found that people aged 13 to 24 spend an estimated 21% of their screen time watching non-professional videos on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, compared to just 16% spent on traditional TV shows. In contrast, people aged 35 and up spend 39% of their screen time on TV shows — more than twice as much as they spend on online videos (14%).\n\nThat's put pressure on traditional players. YouTube — not any traditional Hollywood powerhouse — is the No. 1 streaming service on TVs, according to Nielsen. Netflix's engagement per user has stagnated over the past few years, despite the company's increased spending on content, while YouTube has widened its lead on TV screens, according to Bernstein research. Netflix and other leading streamers have taken steps to bring social media-first creators and video podcasters onto their platforms, but show no signs of fundamentally changing their models.\n\n\"The real threat to the media industry in general is the new formats like short form,\" Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said. Paramount is at least talking about a technology-led overhaul of how entertainment is made, which has investors intrigued. But whatever changes it makes are likely to be incremental in the near term, he said.",

    "fullText": "Time Magazine is getting ready to announce its Person of the Year for 2025, and prediction markets have an interesting idea about who—or, more accurately, what—might win the award.\n\nOnline bettors on Polymarket and Kalshi don't think high-profile figures like Sam Altman or Jensen Huang will receive the honor, but instead believe it will go to the technology they're helping create—AI.\n\nKalshi shows 55% for AI to get the award, while Polymarket shows the odds at 47%. Huang, Altman, and Pope Leo XIV are among the other top names on both sites.\n\nA Kalshi spokesperson pointed out that a non-human winner of Time's award wouldn't be unprecedented.\n\n\"I believe the reason that we listed 'AI' as an option in the first place is because there is historical precedent for non-humans winning 'Person of the Year,'\" the spokesperson told Business Insider. \"In 1982, the computer won, in 1988, the endangered earth won, and there have been multiple non-human non-objects that have won, such as the 'Spirit of Ukraine' in 2022.\"\n\nIt should be noted that in 1982, Time actually broke tradition and named the personal computer the \"Machine of the Year.\"\n\nThat year marked a watershed moment in technological advancement, primarily due to the launch of the Commodore 64 and IBM's progress in personal computing. Similarly, 2025 has seen the widespread adoption of AI technology, which has already transformed culture in the three years since ChatGPT debuted in 2022.\n\nKalshi lists ChatGPT among the other Person of the Year candidates, although the platform currently indicates that its odds of winning are only 6%. The chatbot isn't listed among Polymarket's betting options.",

    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

    "title": "How the Fitness Tech Boom Is Making Health Inequality Worse",
    "description": "We live in a time of unprecedented insight into our bodies—if you can afford it.",
    "fullText": "The latest Apple Watch costs $429. A basic Peloton Bike is $1,395, plus a $49.99 monthly subscription. Throw in a WHOOP membership at $149 annually, maybe an Oura Ring for another $349, and suddenly you're looking at thousands of dollars to participate in what's become the standard way many Americans approach their health. For some, that price tag is steep. For others, it's a non-starter.\n\nI'm no stranger to the appeal of the latest, greatest wearables and smart health devices. But as all this wellness technology become the norm, what does this mean for people who don't strap a smartwatch onto their wrists? If comprehensive health data—and the insights it provides—becomes a luxury good, the existing digital health divide will only get worse.\n\nThe issue starts well before anyone considers buying a fitness tracker. Digital equity in healthcare is already a fundamental access issue. \"In many ways, access to healthcare means access to technology,\" says Amy Gonzales, an associate professor in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Communication. \"Especially since [the COVID-19 pandemic], the healthcare industry relies heavily on technology for their services. Text reminders about your appointment, scanning a QR code to check in, needing an e-health account to see your test results, or some providers only being available via telehealth, and so on.\"\n\nThe basic infrastructure of modern healthcare—patient portals, appointment scheduling apps, prescription management systems—demands a level of digital literacy and access that not everyone can meet. Seniors may struggle with smartphone interfaces. Low-income families might rely on limited mobile data or shared devices. People with certain disabilities may find standard health apps difficult or impossible to navigate. And the problem compounds: Gonzales notes the populations most likely to face barriers with technology are often the same groups who may need that healthcare the most.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of baseline digital inequity, fitness trackers and wearables have gotten more and more popular. These aren't essential medical devices in the traditional sense—nobody's life support depends on their Fitbit—but they've become cultural markers of health optimization. More concerning, they're increasingly becoming tools that provide genuinely useful health information that simply isn't available to people without the resources to buy in. Heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, sleep stages, stress levels, and more: We're living in a time of unprecedented insight into what our bodies are doing, if you can afford it.\n\nIN some circles, these devices have become simply how health-conscious people approach their wellbeing. Studies have shown that wearables can help detect abnormal heart rhythms, encourage increased physical activity, and provide early warning signs of illness. Some insurance companies offer discounts for users who share their fitness tracking data. Employers incorporate wearables into wellness programs.\n\nWhile this is promising for those who can afford it, others get left behind. \"The digital divide is even more problematic with 'bonus devices,' or health 'accoutrements,' like smart wearables,\" says Gonzales. If at-risk health populations are already at-risk for digital access, it tracks that this access gap is only getting wider.\n\nThe creation of a two-tiered information system is perhaps the most insidious aspect of fitness tech inequality. A person with an Apple Watch receives detailed daily reports about their cardiovascular health, activity levels, and sleep quality. They get alerts when their heart rate becomes irregular, or they can share comprehensive data with their physician that provides context for symptoms and conditions. Someone without these devices? They're left with subjective assessments and whatever gets captured during periodic doctor visits.\n\n\"If you don't have the same resources to track your blood pressure, blood pressure, or physical activity,\" says Gonzales, \"you are certainly being left behind on useful healthcare.\" Consider two people with similar cardiovascular risk factors. The one with a wearable device might receive an alert and seek immediate treatment, potentially preventing a stroke. The other person might not notice symptoms until a serious cardiac event occurs. Both deserved that potentially life-saving alert, but only one could afford the device that provided it.\n\nAs more people in higher-income brackets adopt these technologies and share data with healthcare providers, medical understanding itself may become skewed toward populations who can afford comprehensive self-monitoring. If research studies increasingly incorporate wearable data, but if that data predominantly comes from affluent, educated users, the resulting insights may not apply equally across all demographics.\n\nAccess isn't the only lens through which to view this fitness tech. \"There's this implicit assumption that wearables are inherently good,\" says Gonzales. \"What about privacy risks?\" After all, if you think you own all your health data, think again.\n\nThink of the history of the healthcare industry's relationship with marginalized communities. The Tuskegee syphilis study, forced sterilizations, and ongoing disparities in pain management and maternal mortality have created a pretty understandable skepticism toward giving up data, to say the least. \"Given the history of experimentation and exploitation of certain low-income populations, there's a natural distrust in these sub-groups,\" Gonzales says. \"Maybe these demographics intentionally avoid third parties collecting their data.\"\n\nSo, the same communities that might benefit most from health monitoring technology may also have the most legitimate reasons to be wary of it. As I've previously covered, data privacy protections remain inconsistent, and the long-term implications of sharing detailed biometric data with corporations are still unclear. For populations that have historically been surveilled, exploited, or discriminated against, choosing not to participate in constant data collection might be a rational decision, rather than simply a matter of access. There's something to be said for health approaches that don't involve third-party corporations accumulating detailed records of your body's functions.\n\nNaturally, budget options for fitness tech do exist, and these options can help some people access these technologies. But even \"affordable\" options still cost money that many families simply don't have for what remains, technically speaking, optional equipment. When you're choosing between a $50 fitness tracker and groceries, the choice isn't really a choice at all.\n\nAll of this is to say that the fitness tech inequality problem can't be solved by individual purchasing decisions or corporate discount programs. It's embedded in broader questions about healthcare access, digital equity, and what we consider essential versus optional in maintaining health. Glucose monitors, fertility trackers, or blood pressure cuffs could more easily qualify as medical equipment, where an Oura ring is still a luxury good. Addressing the gap requires reimagining what counts as necessary healthcare technology. Otherwise, we could be approaching a future where your ability to detect health problems early, track chronic conditions, and optimize your fitness depends on whether you can afford a monthly subscription.\n\nHealthcare has become digitized, creating new opportunities for monitoring and intervention, but also new mechanisms for inequality. As fitness technology continues advancing, offering more sophisticated monitoring and more actionable insights, that fundamental inequality will only get worse. Because at the intersection of healthcare and technology, \"the people who struggle with one are often the same people who need the other,\" Gonzales says.\n\nThe Apple Watch on your wrist may feel like a personal choice, a small investment in your personal wellness. But scale that up across millions of people and billions of data points, and individual choices become structural inequalities. Technology that was supposed to democratize health information may instead be creating new hierarchies of who gets to know what about their own bodies. And those who need that knowledge most may be the least likely to access it.",

    "description": "Chinese app Rednote started off as a shopping app. Now, it's one of the hottest hubs for Chinese tech workers in Silicon Valley to talk shop about AI.",
    "fullText": "When the Chinese app Rednote launched in 2013, it was mainly used for shopping and cosmetics reviews. Now, it's one of the hottest hubs for Chinese tech workers in Silicon Valley to talk shop about AI.\n\nRednote is also known as Xiaohongshu, which translates to \"Little Red Book.\" For Chinese tech workers in the Bay Area working at companies like OpenAI and Meta, Rednote has become a sort of home away from home for shopping and food recommendations. And since the launch of ChatGPT, AI-related content on Rednote has exploded.\n\nTechnology-related content on the app has more than doubled in the past year, and the number of tech-related creators has more than tripled, according to Rednote. Many users post video reviews or tutorials of AI models, just like people review their favorite beauty products.\n\n\"Every time a new model is out, people on Xiaohongshu will share their reviews,\" said Tony Peng, founder of the Recode China AI newsletter. \"If I want real user-generated feedback, I go to Xiaohongshu.\"\n\nMany American Gen Z users downloaded Rednote in January amid fears of a TikTok ban. More than half of the app's users were born after 1995, Rednote said.\n\nTech founders told Business Insider that they have used Rednote to promote their startups, demo products, and hire people. Some of the most popular posts on Rednote focus on Big Tech companies or AI giants such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google DeepMind. Users may share their anxieties about the tech job market, ask for help, or discuss the compensation packages they've received.\n\nBrandon Chen, cofounder and CEO of the AI-powered chat app Intent, needed to apply for a visa last year to work in the US.\n\nTo do this, he had to prepare hundreds of PDFs for his lawyer, and he decided to write an AI program to help organize them. He posted before-and-after screenshots of his project on Rednote. Soon, people messaged him asking if he would release it as an app so they could use it.\n\n\"I thought it was amazing. I just randomly developed something for myself,\" Chen told Business Insider.\n\nHe ended up releasing it as a product called Riffo.\n\nChen said he used Rednote to promote his product and even to recruit workers in Japan. He posted on Rednote asking if any Japanese speakers could help with his social media expansion efforts, and within 15 minutes, someone reached out, Chen said.\n\nQian Chen, a journalist and media entrepreneur who cofounded the tech media company Valley101, said she distributes her videos on channels including YouTube, WeChat, and Rednote. The videos she has produced on topics like Meta's recent AI layoffs, and the battle between ChatGPT and Google, have performed especially well on Rednote, she said.\n\nRednote helps startup founders foster communities, users say.\n\nBill Zhu, founder and CEO of Pokee AI, which uses AI to build workflows, said he found a tight-knit community on Rednote to share his learnings, attract users for his products, connect with others, and ask for feedback. Rednote users are often drawn to posts about personal experiences, Zhu said. In Rednote posts, he has chronicled his fundraising efforts, including successes and setbacks.\n\n\"You can actually connect with the founder,\" Zhu said. \"It's someone you're actually talking to. You can reach out to this person building this awesome piece of tech that is able to solve these problems.\"\n\nDuring the back-to-school season in September, Rednote launched an \"AI Guide\" campaign, inviting 20 professors to join a discussion on the app.\n\nRednote has gained more international users thanks to its AI translation feature, which enables users to translate posts from Chinese to English or other languages with a single click. And while most of the content that appears on Rednote is in Chinese, the app is increasingly featuring English content, including an AMA, or Ask Me Anything, event with Thomas Wolf, cofounder and chief science officer of Hugging Face.\n\nAn atmosphere of \"sincere sharing\" has fueled a trend of AI-themed AMAs on Rednote, said San Bing, Rednote's senior director of tech community.\n\nThe AMAs are popular because Rednote users are eager to learn about cutting-edge technology, said Peng, the founder of Recode China AI.\n\n\"For AMAs, you can get firsthand answers to tell you, what is the next frontier?\" Peng said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Tech stocks have driven a disproportionate share of the market's gains in recent years. Now, it might be time for them to share the limelight.",
    "fullText": "Tech stocks have driven a disproportionate share of the market's gains in recent years. Now, it's time for them to share the limelight, says Joe Quinlan, the chief market strategist at Bank of America.\n\n\"There's plenty of places to put money to work better other than, say, Mag 7,\" he said, referencing the largest stocks in the S&P 500 by market capitalization.\n\nSpecifically, cyclical stocks should start to look attractive next year, Quinlan said, calling the theme his highest-conviction investing idea right now, and recommending a barbell approach between tech and cyclical shares.\n\nCyclical stocks are those that rebound when the economy is recovering from a downturn or is expanding. Quinlan highlighted sectors like industrials, materials, and financials as places to look for opportunities.\n\nCyclicals may seem like a curious recommendation at the moment. The labor market appears to be softening, with rising layoffs and weaker job growth fueling concerns about a consumer-led slowdown. But Quinlan said that the job market is just learning to adjust to the new environment, not entering a downward spiral.\n\n\"The labor market is weakening in some parts, but it's strengthening in others, so it's really a mixed bag,\" he said. \"But the key is, companies are learning to live with the technology that comes with artificial intelligence, they're learning immigration constraints. It's just going to make us more productive, say, 18-24 months out.\"\n\nQuinlan pointed out several drivers that should propel economic growth in 2026 and boost cyclical stocks.\n\n\"It's continued consumer spending, particularly among higher income households; capital investment not just in data centers but also refurbishing, building out more factory capacity; a weaker dollar helps our exports; global growth is picking up, so that's good for multinational earnings,\" he said.\n\n\"And then you've got the fiscal and monetary stimulus: fiscally you're going to see a lot more money dropped in bottom lines because of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" Quinlan continued, adding that he sees two Federal Reserve interest rate cuts coming in 2026, starting mid-year, in addition to the cut that is widely expected in December. Rate cuts stimulate economic activity by encouraging borrowing and spending.\n\nStrategists at JPMorgan and HSBC have also said cyclical stocks are one of their preferred areas of the market to invest in next year amid robust projections for economic growth.\n\nYear-to-date, the industrials, materials, and financials sectors have returned 17.4%, 4.5%, and 10.8%, respectively. The S&P 500, by comparison, has risen 16.4% in 2025.\n\nSo far in 2025, cyclicals have outperformed defensive stocks, which get a boost from economic uncertainty, around the world. That recent rally has US cyclical stocks trading at a valuation premium relative to defensive stocks, as the below chart from Goldman Sachs shows.\n\nExamples of funds that offer exposure to cyclical stocks, particularly in Quinlan's preferred sectors, include the iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ), the State Street Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB), and the Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH).",

    "fullText": "Worried about how AI is affecting your job? You're not alone.\n\nEveryone from the board to management to employees has concerns about the new technology, said Joe Atkinson, PwC's global head of AI, in an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box Asia on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a complex time in the world of AI implementation,\" said Atkinson. The pace of AI change is \"overwhelming to everybody\" and there's a \"mismatch\" between how quickly organizational change can keep up with it, he said.\n\nGlobal companies routinely look to PwC, one of the industry's leading consulting and accounting firms, for answers to their most consequential business questions. With AI rapidly transforming how businesses operate, guidance on reorganizing for an AI-first future is becoming one of the most sought-after offerings.\n\nAtkinson said that the next phase of implementing AI inside companies is scaling the technology's capabilities, and companies that move quickly will see the most reward.\n\n\"We've talked for the last year about proofs of concept and experimentation, and frankly, those days are over. We now have to scale the impact of AI in organizations,\" Atkinson said.\n\n\"The good news for employees is if we scale the impact of AI for organizations, I truly believe we create and unlock growth,\" he added.\n\nAccording to PwC's data, organizations that adopt AI more quickly have seen three times the revenue per employee compared to those that proceed more slowly.\n\n\"That opportunity means that it's not only a big upside for organisations. It is a big upside for employees who lean in and use these tools to help create greater productivity, outputs, and creativity,\" Atkinson said.\n\nPwC and other leading consulting firms have embraced AI, pitching themselves as client zero for the solutions they offer to clients and implementing AI solutions across all operations.\n\nNew hires at PwC will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years because of AI, Jenn Kosar, PwC's AI assurance leader, told Business Insider in August.\n\nThe technology is also affecting the firm's hiring plans. In August, Business Insider obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years, in part due to \"the impact of AI.\"\n\nHave a tip?

If you buy something via one of our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nWhile Black Friday and Cyber Monday have been over for weeks now, there are still many amazing deals for anyone looking to invest in flashy new tech. Whether you're buying for yourself or someone on your holiday gift list, Walmart is currently selling a surprisingly awesome Android tablet for the unbeatable price of just $86.\n\nThe Aeezo 10.1-Inch Android 15 Tablet typically retails for $160, but it's 47% off right now — a deal that feels like the kind reserved just for shopping holidays. If you want the convenience of a big screen without having to shell out hundreds for one of the overpriced name brands, you're going to want to jump on this sale while you still can. Plus, it comes with all the accessories you could need, including a wireless keyboard, mouse, and stylus.\n\nFor a tablet of this price, the specs are fairly impressive. At the heart of this device is an octa-core CPU, which not only optimizes performance but also keeps your tablet from overheating, even when you're really clocking out its specs. With 24 gigabytes (GB) of RAM, you'll be able to multitask with ease and jump from app to app in seconds. There's also 128 GB of space available to play with, so there's plenty of room for a whole host of apps, as well as photos and even important documents you may want to keep on hand.\n\nWith Android 15 pre-installed, you'll be able to surf, stream, and even game.

    "fullText": "Gen Z are the first generation to have grown up with social media, they were the earliest adopters, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. Now they are fighting back\n\nLate one night in April 2020, towards the start of the Covid lockdowns, Shanley Clémot McLaren was scrolling on her phone when she noticed a Snapchat post by her 16-year-old sister. “She’s basically filming herself from her bed, and she’s like: ‘Guys you shouldn’t be doing this. These fisha accounts are really not OK. Girls, please protect yourselves.’ And I’m like: ‘What is fisha?’ I was 21, but I felt old,” she says.\n\nShe went into her sister’s bedroom, where her sibling showed her a Snapchat account named “fisha” plus the code of their Paris suburb. Fisha is French slang for publicly shaming someone – from the verb “afficher”, meaning to display or make public. The account contained intimate images of girls from her sister’s school and dozens of others, “along with the personal data of the victims – their names, phone numbers, addresses, everything to find them, everything to put them in danger”.\n\nMcLaren, her sister and their friends reported the account to Snapchat dozens of times, but received no response. Then they discovered there were fisha accounts for different suburbs, towns and cities across France and beyond. Faced with the impunity of the social media platforms, and their lack of moderation, they launched the hashtag #StopFisha.\n\nIt went viral, online and in the media. #StopFisha became a rallying cry, a safe space to share information and advice, a protest movement. Now it was the social media companies being shamed. “The wave became a counter-wave,” says McLaren, who is now 26. The French government got involved, and launched an online campaign on the dangers and legal consequences of fisha accounts. The social media companies began to moderate at last, and #StopFisha is now a “trusted flagger” with Snapchat and TikTok, so when they report fisha content, it is taken down within hours. “I realised that if you want change in your societies, if you come with your idea alone, it won’t work. You need support behind you.”\n\nFour years later, this strategy is playing out on an even larger scale. McLaren and other young activists across Europe are banding together against social media and its ruinous effects on their generation. Individually, young people are powerless to sway big tech, but they are also a substantial part of its business model – so, collectively, they are powerful.\n\nThis is the first generation to have grown up with social media: they were the earliest adopters of it, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. The array of problems is ever-expanding: misogynistic, hateful and disturbing content; addictive and skewed algorithms; invasion of privacy; online forums encouraging harmful behaviours; sextortion; screen addiction; deepfake pornography; misinformation and disinformation; radicalisation; surveillance; biased AI – the list goes on. As the use of social media has risen, there has been a corresponding increase in youth mental health problems, anxiety, depression, self-harm and even suicide.\n\n“Across Europe, a generation is suffering through a silent crisis,” says a new report from People vs Big Tech – a coalition of more than 140 digital rights NGOs from around Europe – and Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, their youth-led spin-off. A big factor is “the design and dominance of social media platforms”.\n\nCtrl+Alt+Reclaim, for people aged 15 to 29, came about in September last year when People vs Big Tech put out a call – on social media, paradoxically. About 20 young people who were already active on these issues came together at a “boot camp” in London. “We were really given the tools to create the movement that we wanted to build,” says McLaren, who attended with her partner. “They booked a big room, they brought the food, pencils, paper, everything we needed. And they were like: ‘This is your space, and we’re here to help.’”\n\nThe group is Europe’s first digital justice movement by and for young people. Their demands are very simple, or at least they ought to be: inclusion of young people in decision-making; a safer, healthier, more equitable social media environment; control and transparency over personal data and how it is used; and an end to the stranglehold a handful of US-based corporations have over social media and online spaces. The overarching principle is: “Nothing for us, without us.”\n\n“This is not just us being angry; it’s us having the right to speak,” says McLaren, who is now a youth mobilisation lead for Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim. Debates over digital rights are already going on, of course, but, she says: “We find it really unfair that we’re not at the table. Young people have so much to say, and they’re real experts, because they have lived experience … So why aren’t they given the proper space?”\n\nMcLaren’s work with #StopFisha took her on a journey into a wider, murkier world of gender-based digital rights: misogynist trolling and sexism, cyberstalking, deepfake pornography – but she realised this was just one facet of the problem. What women were experiencing online, other groups were experiencing in their own ways.\n\nA fellow activist, Yassine, 23, is well aware of this. Originally from north Africa and now living in Germany, Yassine identifies as non-binary. They fled to Europe to escape intolerance in their own country, but the reality of life, even in a supposedly liberal country such as Germany, hit them like a “slap”, they say. “You’re here for your safety, but then you’re trying to fight not only the system that is punishing the queerness of you, but you also have another layer of being a migrant. So you have two battles instead of one.”\n\nAs a migrant they are seen as a threat, Yassine says. “Our bodies and movements must be tracked, fingerprinted and surveilled through intrusive digital systems designed to protect the EU.” For queer people, there are similar challenges. These include “shadow-banning”, for example, by which tech platforms “silence conversations about queer rights, racism or anything that is challenging the dominant system”, either wilfully or algorithmically, through built-in biases.\n\nMeasures such as identity verification “are also putting a lot of people at risk of being erased from these spaces”, says Yassine. There can be good reasons for them, but they can also end up discriminating against non-binary or transgender people – who are often presented with binary gender options; male or female – as well as against refugees and undocumented people, who may be afraid or unable to submit their details online. Given their often tenuous residency status, and sometimes limited digital literacy and access, migrants tend not to speak out, Yassine says. “It definitely feels like you are in a position of: ‘You need to be grateful that you are here, and you should not question the laws.’ But the laws are harming my data.”\n\nOn a more day-to-day level, Yassine says, they must “walk through online spaces knowing they could do harm to me”. If they click on the comments under a social media post, for example, they know they are likely to find racist, homophobic or hateful attacks. Like McLaren, Yassine says that complaining is futile. “I know that they will come back with, ‘This is not a community guidelines breach’, and all of that.”\n\nThese are not mere glitches in the system, says Yassine, who now leads on digital rights at IGLYO, a long-running LGBTQ+ youth rights organisation, founded in Brussels, with a network of groups across Europe. “The systems we design inherit the very structures they arise from, so they inevitably become systems that are patriarchal and racist by design.”\n\nAdele Zeynep Walton’s participation in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim came through personal experience of online harm. In 2022, Walton’s 21-year-old sister, Aimee, took her own life. She had been struggling with her mental health, but had also been spending time on online suicide and self-harm forums, which Walton believes contributed to her death. After that, Walton began to question the digital realm she had grown up in, and her own screen addiction.\n\nWalton’s parents made her first Facebook account when she was 10, she says. She has been on Instagram since she was 12. Her own feelings of body dysmorphia began when she was 13, sparked by pro-anorexia content her friends were sharing. “I became a consumer of that, then I got immersed in this world,” she says. “Generations like mine thought it was totally normal, having this everyday battle with this addictive thing, having this constant need for external validation. I thought those were things that were just wrong with me.”\n\nIn researching her book Logging Off: The Human Cost of our Digital World, Walton, 26, also became aware of how little control young people have over the content that is algorithmically served up to them. “We don’t really have any choice over what our feeds look like. Despite the fact there are things where you can say, ‘I don’t want to see this type of content’, within a week, you’re still seeing it again.”\n\nAlycia Colijn, 29, another member of Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, knows something about this. She studied data science and marketing analytics at university in Rotterdam, researching AI-driven algorithms – how they can be used to manipulate behaviour, and in whose interests. During her studies she began to think: “It’s weird that I’m trained to gather as much data as I can, and to build a model that can respond to or predict what people want to buy, but I’ve never had a conversation around ethics.” Now she is researching these issues as co-founder of Encode Europe, which advocates for human-centric AI. “I realised how much power these algorithms have over us; over our society, but also over our democracies,” she says. “Can we still speak of free will if the best psychologists in the world are building algorithms that make us addicted?”\n\nThe more she learned, the more concerned Colijn became. “We made social media into a social experiment,” she says. “It turned out to be the place where you could best gather personal data from individuals. Data turned into the new gold, and then tech bros became some of the most powerful people in the world, even though they aren’t necessarily known for caring about society.”\n\nSocial media companies have had ample opportunities to respond to these myriad harms, but invariably they have chosen not to. Just as McLaren found with Snapchat and the fisha accounts, hateful and racist content is still minimally moderated on platforms such as X, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. After Donald Trump’s re-election, Mark Zuckerberg stated at the start of this year that Meta would be reducing factcheckers across Facebook and Instagram, just as X has under Elon Musk. This has facilitated the free flow of misinformation. Meta, Amazon and Google were also among the companies announcing they were rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, post-Trump’s election. The shift towards the right politically, in the US and Europe, has inevitably affected these platforms’ tolerance of hateful and racist content, says Yassine. “People feel like now they have more rights to be harmful than rights to be protected.”\n\nAll the while, the tech CEOs have become more powerful, economically, politically and in terms of information control. “We don’t believe that power should be in those hands,” says Colijn. “That’s not a true democracy.”\n\nEurope’s politicians aren’t doing much better. Having drafted the Digital Services Act in 2023, which threatened social media companies with fines or bans if they failed to regulate harmful content, the European Commission announced last month it would be rolling back some of its data privacy laws, to allow big tech companies to use people’s personal data for training AI systems.\n\n“Big tech, combined with the AI innovators, say they are the growth of tomorrow’s economy, and that we have to trust them. I don’t think that’s true,” says Colijn. She also disagrees with their argument that regulation harms innovation. “The only thing deregulation fosters is harmful innovation. If we want responsible innovation, we need regulation in place.”\n\nWalton agrees. “Governments and MPs are shooting themselves in the foot by pandering to tech giants, because that just tells young people that they don’t care about our future,” she says. “There’s this massive knowledge gap between the people who are making the decisions, and the tech justice movement and everyday people who are experiencing the harms.”\n\nCtrl+Alt+Reclaim is not calling for the wholesale destruction of social media. All these activists say they have found community, solidarity and joy in online spaces: “We’re fighting for these spaces to accommodate us,” says Yassine. “We’re not protesting to cancel them. We know how harmful they are, but they are still spaces where we have hope.”\n\nColijn echoes this. “Social media used to be a fun place with the promise of connecting the world,” she says. “That’s where we started.” And that’s what they want it to be again.\n\nWill big tech pay attention? They might not have a choice, as countries and legislators begin to take action. This week Australia will become the first country to ban social media accounts for under-16s on major platforms including Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok and X. Last week, after a two-year deliberation, X was fined €120m (£105m) by the EU for breaching data laws. But these companies continue to platform content that is hateful, racist, harmful, misleading or inflammatory, with impunity.\n\nMeanwhile, Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim is just getting started. Other discussions on the table include campaigning for an EU-funded social media platform, an alternative to the big tech oligopoly, created by and for the public. Another alternative is direct action, either protest or consumer activism such as coordinated boycotts. “I think it’s lazy for us to be like: we don’t have any power,” says Walton. “Because we could literally say that about anything: fast fashion, fossil fuels … OK, but how do we change things?”\n\nThe other alternative is simply to log off. “The other side of the coin to this movement of tech justice, and a sort of liberation from the harms that we’ve experienced over the past 20 years, is reducing our screen time,” says Walton. “It is spending more time in community. It is connecting with people who maybe you would have never spoken to on social media, because you’d be in different echo chambers.”\n\nAlmost all the activists in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim attest to having had some form of screen addiction. As much as social media has brought them together, it has also led to much less face-to-face socialising. “I’ve had to sort of rewire my brain to get used to the awkwardness and get comfortable with being in a social setting and not knowing anyone,” says Walton. “Actually, it would be really nice to return to proper connection.”\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Campaign urges PM to show independence from US and push to rein in development of superintelligence\n\nMore than 100 UK parliamentarians are calling on the government to introduce binding regulations on the most powerful AI systems as concern grows that ministers are moving too slowly to create safeguards in the face of lobbying from the technology industry.\n\nA former AI minister and defence secretary are part of a cross-party group of Westminster MPs, peers and elected members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures demanding stricter controls on frontier systems, citing fears superintelligent AI “would compromise national and global security”.\n\nThe push for tougher regulation is being coordinated by a nonprofit organisation called Control AI whose backers include the co-founder of Skype, Jaan Tallinn. It is calling on Keir Starmer to show independence from Donald Trump’s White House, which opposes the regulation of AI. One of the “godfathers” of the technology, Yoshua Bengio, recently said it was less regulated than a sandwich.\n\nThe campaigners include the Labour peer and former defence secretary Des Browne, who said superintelligent AI “would be the most perilous technological development since we gained the ability to wage nuclear war”. He said only international cooperation “can prevent a reckless race for advantage that could imperil us all”.\n\nThe Conservative peer and former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said that “even while very significant and senior figures in AI are blowing the whistle, governments are miles behind the AI companies and are leaving them to pursue its development with virtually no regulation”.\n\nBritain hosted an AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023, which concluded there was “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional” from the most advanced AI systems. It set up the AI Safety Institute, now called the AI Security Institute, which has become an internationally respected body. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on the summit’s call to address risks through international cooperation.\n\nGoldsmith said the UK should “resume its global leadership on AI security by championing an international agreement to prohibit the development of superintelligence until we know what we are dealing with and how to contain it”.\n\nThe calls for state intervention in the AI race come after one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI scientists told the Guardian humanity would have to decide by 2030 whether to take the “ultimate risk” of letting AI systems train themselves to become more powerful. Jared Kaplan, the co-founder and chief scientist at frontier AI company Anthropic, said: “We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like: Oh, wow, AI is a big deal.”\n\nLabour’s programme set out in July 2024 said it would legislate “to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models”. But no bill has been published and the government has faced White House pressure not to inhibit commercial AI development, mostly pioneered by US firms.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI is already regulated in the UK, with a range of existing rules already in place. We have been clear on the need to ensure the UK and its laws are ready for the challenges and opportunities AI will bring and that position has not changed.”\n\nThe bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who is backing the Control AI campaign, called for an independent AI watchdog to scrutinise public sector use and for AI companies to be required to meet minimum testing standards before releasing new models.\n\n“There are all kinds of risks and the government doesn’t seem to have adopted a precautionary principle,” he said. “At the moment there are significant risks: the mental health of children and adults, the environmental costs and other big risks in terms of the alignment of generalised AI and [the question of] what is good for humanity. The government seems to be moving away from regulation.”\n\nThe UK’s first AI minister under Rishi Sunak, Jonathan Berry, said the time was coming when binding regulations should be applied to models that present existential risks. He said rules should be global and would create tripwires so if AI models reached a certain power their makers would have to show they had been tested, designed with off switches and were capable of being retrained.\n\n“International frontier AI safety has not gone on in leaps and bounds as we had hoped,” he said. He cited recent cases of chatbots being involved in encouraging suicides, people using them as therapists and believing they are gods. “The risks, now, are very serious and we need to be constantly on our guard,” he said.\n\nThe chief executive of Control AI, Andrea Miotti, criticised the current “timid approach” and said: “There has been a lot of lobbying from the UK and US. AI companies are lobbying governments in the UK and US to stall regulation arguing it is premature and would crush innovation. Some of these are the same companies who say AIs could destroy humanity.”\n\nHe said the speed with which AI technology was advancing meant mandatory standards could be needed in the next one or two years.",
