    "fullText": "Patrick Vallance says robots would take away ‘repetitive’ tasks, but Sadiq Khan warns AI will usher in ‘new era of mass unemployment’\n\nAdvances in AI and robotics will transform human jobs, starting with roles in warehouses and factories, the UK science minister has said, as the government announced plans to reduce red tape for robot and defence tech companies.\n\nPatrick Vallance said technological progress was creating a “whole new area” for robots to work in. “What’s really changing now is the combination of AI and robotics. It is opening up a whole new area, particularly in the sorts of things like humanoid robotics. And that will increase productivity, it will change the human job,” he told the Guardian.\n\nLord Vallance spoke as a government unit helping to deploy new technologies in Britain announced robots and defence as new sectors receiving its support.\n\nHe said factories and warehouses, already at the forefront of robot deployment, will undergo further change as a result of the new generation of humanoid robots.\n\n“Activities that require movement around warehouses and factories, or those sorts of things that can be made robotic, will be made robotic. I think they will be made robotic in many cases and therefore, will change the nature of those jobs. That’s going to be the first wave,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has warned that AI could “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nSpeaking in his annual Mansion House speech on Thursday, Khan said artificial intelligence could destroy a significant amount of jobs in London unless ministers act to help replace jobs taken over by the technology.\n\nAsked to comment on Khan’s speech, Vallance said robots would take away “repetitive” tasks. “You take away some of the things which are less interesting, repetitive things that can be done in another way,” he said.\n\nVallance, formerly the government’s chief scientific adviser, added that the example of robotics assisting in surgery showed how the technology can enhance jobs.\n\n“Robotics is not displacing surgeons, it’s radically improving how those surgeons work and allowing things to be done with more precision,” he said.\n\nThe government announced on Friday that the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO) is expanding its remit to defence tech and robotics, with the aim of slashing red tape for companies operating in those spaces.\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is also releasing £52m for new hubs to drive robotics adoption in British businesses. These hubs will offer companies advice on using robots and live demonstrations. “The RIO will aim to streamline overlapping requirements to bring products to market safely, but more quickly, to improve lives and grow our economy,” it said.\n\nThe department added that autonomous drones could benefit from the wider RIO remit. Such technology could require separate approvals for aviation, data protection, and sector-specific safety rules, in an expensive process that could take months.\n\nVallance was speaking during a visit to Humanoid, a UK-based robotics company that has already deployed its prototypes in a factory operated by German industrial group Siemens.\n\nAdam Kelsall, Humanoid’s head of product management, said the company welcomed “anything that gets us into the real world and testing [robots] sooner”.",

    "fullText": "Move comes as calls for Australia-style social media ban for under-16s grow around world\n\nTikTok will begin to roll out new age-verification technology across the EU in the coming weeks, as calls grow for an Australia-style social media ban for under-16s in countries including the UK.\n\nByteDance-owned TikTok, and other major platforms popular with young people such as YouTube, are coming under increasing pressure to better identify and remove accounts belonging to children.\n\nThe system, which has been quietly piloted in the EU over the past year, analyses profile information, posted videos and behavioural signals to predict whether an account may be belong to a user under the age of 13.\n\nAs well as analysing information the account holder provides about themselves, the technology looks at behaviour such as the videos a user publishes, and “other on-platform behaviour”.\n\nTikTok said accounts flagged by the system would be reviewed by specialist moderators rather than face an automatic ban, and may then be removed.\n\nIt also said users would have an opportunity to appeal against the removal of an account if an error had been made.\n\nOptions for age identification offered by TikTok during the appeal process include facial age estimation by the verification company Yoti, credit card authorisation or government-approved identification.\n\nThe European pilot led to the removal of thousands of accounts.\n\nThe rollout of the system comes as European authorities scrutinise how platforms verify users’ ages under data protection rules.\n\nTikTok said its system complied with data and privacy laws. “The prediction of the likelihood that someone is under the age of 13 is not used for purposes other than to decide whether to send an account to human moderators and to monitor and improve the technology,” the company said in a blogpost.\n\n“By adopting this approach, we are able to deliver safety for teens in a privacy-preserving manner. We take our responsibility to protect our community, and teens in particular, incredibly seriously.”\n\nIt said other features to protect younger users on its service included not allowing under-16s to direct-message, while under-18s have a 60-minute screen-time limit and do not receive notifications “after bed time”.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also uses Yoti to verify users’ ages on Facebook.\n\nIn December, Australia implemented a social media ban for people under the age of 16. On Thursday, the country’s eSafety commissioner revealed that more than 4.7m accounts had been removed across 10 platforms – including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snap and Facebook – since the ban was implemented on 10 December.\n\nEarlier this week, Keir Starmer told MPs he was open to a social media ban for young people in the UK after becoming concerned about the amount of time children and teenagers were spending on their smartphones.\n\nThe prime minister told Labour MPs he had become alarmed at reports of five-year-olds spending hours in front of screens each day, as well as increasingly worried about the damage social media was doing to under-16s.\n\nStarmer has previously opposed banning social media for children, believing such a move would be difficult to police and could push teenagers towards the dark web.\n\nEarlier this month, Ellen Roome, whose 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong, called for more rights for parents to access social media accounts of their children if they die.\n\nThe European parliament is pushing for age limits on social media, while Denmark wants to ban social media for those under 15.\n\nTikTok told Reuters the new technology was built specifically to comply with the EU’s regulatory requirements. The company has worked with Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, its lead EU privacy regulator, while developing the system.\n\nIn 2023, a Guardian investigation found that moderators were being told to allow under-13s to stay on the platform if they claimed their parents were overseeing their accounts.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - India has issued a final warning to Apple that it will proceed in an antitrust case ​against the U.S. tech giant as the company has delayed responses to ‌officials for over a year and undermined the investigation, a confidential order shows.\n\nApple has said it fears ‌it could be fined up to $38 billion if India's competition watchdog uses its global turnover calculation for penalties, after an investigation found it had abused its position on its app store. Apple, which denies the allegations, has challenged the penalty rules in ⁠an Indian court, and the ‌matter is pending.\n\nWhile the Delhi High Court is still hearing that challenge, a confidential December 31 order from the Competition Commission of ‍India (CCI) shows Apple privately sought to pause the entire case while the penalty‑rules dispute is before the court. The CCI rejected the request.\n\nThe watchdog said it asked Apple in October ​2024 to file objections to the investigation’s findings and provide financial details typically ‌used to assess penalties, but the company has received \"repeated extensions\" since then.\n\n\"The Commission is of the considered view that repeated extensions, despite unambiguous directions, undermine procedural discipline and impede the timely conclusion of proceedings,\" CCI noted in its order, seen by Reuters.\n\n\"Such indulgence cannot be continued indefinitely,\" it added, giving Apple a final warning ⁠that it will proceed in the case unilaterally ​if no response is received by next week.\n\nApple ​did not respond to Reuters queries.\n\nA source familiar with the matter said Apple views CCI's December order as a move to preempt the ‍ongoing court proceedings and ⁠the company was not likely to respond to it before the judges hear it next on January 27.\n\nSince 2022, Tinder-owner Match and Indian startups ⁠have been locked in an antitrust battle with Apple. Investigators in 2024 issued a report saying the ‌U.S. smartphone company engaged in \"abusive conduct\" on the iOS apps market.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Aditya Kalra, Editing by Louise Heavens)",

    "description": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson said AI isn't going away, but it's not quite at the level it needs to be to bring about major changes.",
    "fullText": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson says he's hopeful about AI in the long term, but right now, he's just not seeing enough to meaningfully change his approach.\n\n\"I feel like it's a little bit like a flickering light bulb,\" Hansson said during a recent episode of \"Next Token.\" \"You're in total darkness and then it'll flicker on and you go like, 'I can see everything.' And then two seconds later, boom, pitch black.\"\n\nHansson said when he asked AI to write lines of code, the output is not \"as good as a job as most junior programmers I've had to deal with.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling that we're falling behind at 37 Signals in terms of our ability to produce, in terms of our ability to launch things or improve the products,\" he said. \"And this is why I'm a little skeptical about the claims that AI is already now at a place where you can take your standard SaaS business and then fire half the programmers and still go faster.\"\n\nHumans coded 95% of the code for Fizzy, 37 Signals' Kanban-inspired organization product, Hansson said. They've experienced with AI-powered features for the product, but for now, they've ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nHansson said he doesn't see his business losing ground because he's focusing on writing his own code. For the time being, he can still \"care about the beauty of it.\"\n\n\"That's a luxury that perhaps is akin to what a modern saddle maker enjoys when you go, \"Oh, the letter's just right, and the stitching is just right.' And you're like, 'Okay, but you're no longer part of the main production for transportation,'\" he said. \"And I'm like, 'Well, so what?' I'll continue to make my handwritten code saddles as long as I can for my enjoyment.\"\n\nAlternatively, Hansson said he's seen the promise of AI in the type of tools Shopify uses, where he serves on the board.\n\n\"Some of the things that they've done with SiteKick, the AI agent they have helping merchants set up their shop and optimize their shop is truly incredible,\" he said. \"And there's some real tangible benefits in that that I think are undisputable.\"\n\nOverall, Hansson said he's excited about the promise of a new era that could upend development, just as the iPhone's 2007 release ushered in a focus on mobile optimization.\n\n\"This is the first one where we, in real time, know the world is going to look totally different, and we don't know what the final result is going to be,\" he said. \"So I think the best thing you can just do is accept that A, we don't know, B, that it's really exciting, and C, just try to hold onto your hat, jump on there cowboy and ride it and see where it goes.\"\n\nHe also said AI isn't going away, no matter what some people may hope.\n\n\"That power does not exist. You don't get to roll these things back. Now, you could personally choose that you're not going to use gen AI,\" he said, adding that some people may also try to avoid buying products that were aided by AI.\n\nHansson said he's amazed by just how much of the US economy is based on large bets that AI will break through its current limitations and reach something akin to Artificial General Intelligence, the theoretical moment where AI reaches capabilities akin to humans.\n\n\"The entire American economy right now is one big bet that that's going to happen,\" he said. \"And I, as AI positive as I am, still marvel at that. The conviction of an entire economy to just combined go like 'Whatever takes 100 trillion, a thousand trillion. I don't care. We will get there.' I go like, 'That's why America is fucking number one.'\"",

    "description": "Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch said European governments and firms want AI they can control, deploy locally, and run independently of US tech giants.",
    "fullText": "As the race to dominate AI accelerates, Europe's most prominent AI startup is betting that geography — not just technology — can be a competitive advantage in its home market.\n\nArthur Mensch, the CEO and cofounder of French AI company Mistral, said the company's edge in Europe over Silicon Valley rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic isn't about having dramatically smarter models.\n\nInstead, he said that many European governments and regulated enterprises are seeking AI systems they can control, customize, and operate independently, rather than relying on a small number of external providers.\n\n\"European governments are coming to us because they want to build the technology and they want to serve their citizens,\" Mensch said on the \"Big Technology Podcast\" on Wednesday.\n\nMistral, founded in 2023 and now valued at roughly $14 billion, develops large language models that rival those of leading US systems.\n\nBut Mensch said that frontier AI models are rapidly converging in performance as research spreads and training techniques become widely available.\n\nAs a result, the real battleground is shifting away from raw intelligence and toward deployment, control, and trust — a shift that plays directly into Mistral's pitch in Europe.\n\nMensch said governments, banks, and heavily regulated industries want AI systems they can customize, deploy locally, and operate independently — without fear that a single vendor could change the rules or shut off access.\n\nThe approach has already paid off. France's military recently selected Mistral for an AI deal that keeps sensitive systems running on French-controlled infrastructure.\n\nMensch pushed back on the idea that the company benefits merely from EU regulation or protectionism.\n\nInstead, he framed the demand as geopolitical and operational.\n\nEuropean governments, he said, want AI that they can govern themselves and use to serve citizens without depending on foreign platforms.\n\nThe same logic applies to regulated enterprises that need tighter control over data, compliance, and security.\n\nMistral's embrace of open-source models is central to that strategy.\n\nOpen source allows customers to run AI on their own infrastructure, build redundancy, and avoid vendor lock-in — a sharp contrast to the closed, centralized platforms favored by many US firms.\n\nThe appeal isn't limited to Europe. Mensch said Mistral also works with US and Asian customers who want to reduce dependence on a small group of American providers and retain more autonomy over how AI is used inside their organizations.\n\nThat approach is already extending beyond the West. Mistral recently deepened a partnership with Morocco's government to co-build locally tailored AI models and launch a joint research and development lab aimed at strengthening the country's technological autonomy.\n\nLong term, Mensch said he doesn't believe AI will be dominated by a single winner or country. Instead, he expects multiple regional centers of expertise shaped by local needs, industries, and political realities.\n\nIn that future, he suggested, Mistral's biggest advantage may not be the models it builds — but where, and how, it builds them.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

    "title": "Fatal Fury Fans Spot Strange Detail In New Trailer, Igniting Generative AI Controversy",
    "description": "The use of generative AI in video games has been controversial to say the least, but when it comes to art, the blowback has been even stronger. One game currently being accused of using the technology is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, as the new trailer for the fighting game's upcoming second season of DLC characters is being picked apart online. Viewers and commenters have pored over the trailer, claiming that the character designs are inconsistent and that certain visual elements contain generative AI. The biggest smoking gun, according to viewers, is a quick shot of series antagonist Geese Howard, who appears to be missing an entire foot.\nOther instances of generative AI pointed out include Blue Mary's motorcycle missing several vital components--and being a completely different model from what she normally rides--and Kim Jae Hoon having noticeably different wardrobes between his cinematic and gameplay character models.",

    "fullText": "First came efficiency. Then came intensity. Now it's accountability.\n\nA new year means a new mantra for Silicon Valley, and this time it's all about showing your work, writes BI's Tim Paradis.\n\nFrom Amazon helping managers track employees' time spent in the office to Meta keeping tabs on workers' AI usage, tech's corporate overlords are no longer going to take your word for it.\n\nThere's a not-so-subtle reason for this sudden interest in documentation. You might have heard me say this before, but companies are investing lots into AI, and the benefits aren't entirely clear. (JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon literally told analysts to just \"trust me.\")\n\nSo with investors breathing down execs' necks about their tech budgets, they're now looking for the humans to give them something to show for it. Add this to the growing list of ways AI ends up creating more work for employees.\n\nThis isn't just a Big Tech phenomenon. Citi CEO Jane Fraser, who is in the midst of her own \"Transformation,\" told workers in a recent memo that old habits won't fly anymore and everyone needs to step up their game.\n\nThere's a slightly less cynical way to look at this whole thing, one expert told Tim. Collecting all this data will help bosses better justify their workers' existence. (I only said it was slightly less cynical.)\n\nIt reminds me of an old coach I had. He'd tell us you shouldn't worry about getting yelled at. You should only panic when he stops yelling at you. That means he thinks you're a lost cause.\n\nThat might be true, but it sure didn't make wind sprints after practice easier.\n\nMetrics aren't a complete disaster for workers, but they could pose a risk to innovation.\n\nA clear sense of what your company expects from you can be beneficial, especially when you're looking for a raise. You asked me to produce X. I delivered X+1. Time to pay up. (Results may vary on that pitch.)\n\nGuidelines can be limiting though. Let's say you crack the code on hitting your assigned number. Are you willing to deviate from that strategy? Is the risk of not hitting your number worth the reward of trying something new?\n\nCreativity is rarely born from repetition. You often need to understand what doesn't work to figure out what will work. But if you're constantly being asked to show your worth, putting up a bunch of Ls, even if a W is around the corner, is a dangerous game.\n\nBesides, the executives are already taking enough risks for all of us.",

    "fullText": "The most recent global market forecasts from Boeing and Airbus project demand for more than 43,000 new commercial aviation airplanes over the next two decades. But according to Aleksey Matyushev, co-founder and CEO of Natilus, the manufacturing titans may struggle to meet it.\n\nMatyushev estimated that Boeing and Airbus have the capacity to produce about 11,000 and 15,000 planes, respectively, in that timeframe. That leaves a gap of more than 17,000-one the Natilus CEO believes could be filled by the company's fuel-efficient, blended-wing body (BWB) design, Horizon.\n\nThis Article First Appeared in FLYING Magazine\n\nIf you're not already a subscriber, what are you waiting for? \n\n\"I think the airlines are now more than ever interested in new ways of thinking, both from a manufacturing and a fuel efficiency perspective,\" Matyushev told FLYING.\n\nHorizon, which Matyushev said will have capacity for about 200 passengers, is one of a handful of regional jet concepts that developers position as solutions to airlines' anticipated capacity crunch. Natilus claims it will burn 30 percent less fuel than traditional aircraft and slash emissions and operating costs in half.\n\nAnother BWB design, JetZero's 250-passenger Z4, promises fuel burn reductions as high as 50 percent.\n\nFor now, these are simply promises.\n\nFew BWB aircraft have advanced beyond the prototype and demonstration phase, and none have been developed to fly passengers. But major U.S. carriers such as United Airlines and Alaska Airlines-which have invested in and placed conditional orders with JetZero-are already exploring the technology.\n\nDelta Air Lines is even aiding JetZero's development of the Z4, a prototype of which is expected to fly for the U.S. Air Force in 2027 under a $235 million contract award.\n\n\"Airlines need to refleet to more efficient aircraft and buy planes to support growth,\" JetZero said. \"Passenger demand is forecasted to double from 2019 levels by 2040, and the industry has pledged to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It will take innovation to meet this demand.\"\n\nThe BWB is an offshoot of the tailless, all-wing aircraft concept, or flying wing, which dates back to the early days of aviation.\n\nIn the 1910s, German engineer Hugo Junkers patented a pure flying wing design-a board-like airframe that would house engines and crew. The U.S. military used tailless biplanes for training around the time of World War I. Later flying wing designs, such as Northrop's B-2A Spirit bomber, became well known.",

    "description": "In Mansion House speech, mayor will talk of opportunities technology offers but highlight mass unemployment risk",
    "fullText": "In Mansion House speech, mayor will talk of opportunities technology offers but highlight mass unemployment risk\n\nSadiq Khan is to warn in a major speech that artificial intelligence (AI) could destroy swathes of jobs in London and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” unless ministers act now.\n\nIn his annual Mansion House speech, the London mayor will say the capital is “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.\n\nThe mayor will argue that “we have a moral, social and economic duty to act” to ensure that new jobs are created to replace those that will disappear, with entry-level and junior jobs the first to go.\n\nIn the speech on Thursday night, Khan will highlight research that suggests 70% of skills in the average job will have changed by 2030.\n\nHowever, he also sees huge potential benefits from AI for public services and productivity across the economy.\n\nWhen he addresses business leaders and bankers at Mansion House, the London mayor will say: “AI could enable us to transform our public services, turbocharge productivity and tackle some of our most complex challenges,” but used recklessly, will “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”. He will warn that the impact on the labour market will be “nothing short of colossal”.\n\nBut he will say that there is a clear choice: “seize the potential of AI and use it as a superpower for positive transformation and creation or surrender to it and sit back and watch as it becomes a weapon of mass destruction of jobs.”\n\nCity Hall is launching a London taskforce on AI and the future of work, with expertise from the government, businesses and the AI sector, to assess the potential impact of the new technology on London’s jobs market. It will also offer free AI training for Londoners.\n\nMore than half of workers in London expect AI to affect their jobs in some way in the next 12 months, according to City Hall polling.\n\nAcross the UK, up to 3m low-skilled jobs in trades, machine operations and admin roles could disappear by 2035 because of automation and AI, a report by the charity National Foundation for Educational Research found in November.\n\n“We can shape this next technological revolution and, if we are bold in our efforts, ensure AI makes us richer, not poorer, stronger, not weaker, more connected and more confident, and more capable of building a fairer, safer and more prosperous London for everyone,” Khan will say.\n\nHe will argue the UK and others have been too slow to respond to new technology in the past and that the growth of social media has led to a youth mental health crisis, a surge in online abuse and a dangerous rise in misinformation.\n\nSeparately, Susan Langley, major of the City of London, said on Thursday morning she had noticed that some finance workers were wary of coming to London from abroad because they worry about their safety.\n\nHowever, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The City of London is one of the safest cities in the world. There’s this perception that you’re going to step out of your office and be swept away in a tsunami of crime.\n\n“It’s completely wrong. Competition for investment is really fierce at the moment, and I think any kind of unfounded negative sentiment that’s being pushed out there really risks undermining the UK on the global stage, and we just can’t let it happen.”",

    "fullText": "Marc Benioff shared what he thinks is the darkest aspect of AI.\n\nOn an episode of the \"TBPN\" show streamed on Wednesday, the Salesforce CEO said that he couldn't \"believe what he was watching\" when he saw a \"60 Minutes\" documentary on chatbot-building startup Character.AI and its impact on children.\n\n\"We don't know how these models work. And to see how it was working with these children, and then the kids ended up taking their lives,\" he said, \"That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nCharacter.AI allows users to build custom chatbots that can emulate the behaviour of a close friend or romantic partner. The startup did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment about Benioff's remarks.\n\n\"Tech companies hate regulation. They hate it,\" Benioff said. \"Except for one regulation they love: Section 230. Which means that those companies are not held accountable for those suicides.\"\n\nSection 230 of the 1996 US Communications Decency Act protects social media companies from liability for user-generated content while also letting them moderate posts. Tech giants use Section 230 as a common defense strategy, saying they are just platforms and not responsible for what users say and do on them.\n\n\"Step one is let's just hold people accountable,\" he said. \"Let's reshape, reform, revise Section 230, and let's try to save as many lives as we can by doing that.\"\n\nExecutives, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, have repeatedly defended the regulation in Congress, asking for it to be expanded rather than removed.\n\nLast week, Google and Character.AI agreed to settle multiple lawsuits from families whose teenagers died by suicide or hurt themselves after interacting with Character.AI's chatbots.\n\nThese negotiations are among the first settlements in lawsuits that accuse AI tools of contributing to mental health crises and suicides among teenagers. OpenAI and Meta are facing similar lawsuits as they, along with others, race to build large language models that sound more friendly and helpful, ultimately keeping users coming back.",

    "fullText": "Showing the value of great design over visual impact, this faithfully resurrected home computer seamlessly integrates modern tech with some wonderful additional touches\n\nThe emotional hit was something I didn’t expect, although perhaps I should have. The Commodore 64 Ultimate, a new version of the legendary 8-bit computer, comes in a box designed to resemble the original packaging – a photo of the machine itself on a background of deep blue fading into a series of white stripes. Then when you open it, you find an uncannily accurate replica of what fans lovingly referred to as the breadbox – the chunky, sloped Commodore 64, in hues of brown and beige, the red LED in one corner above the row of fawn-coloured function keys. It’s like 1982 all over again.\n\nMy dad bought us a C64 in late 1983. It was our second computer after the ZX81 and it felt like an enormous leap into the future with its detailed colour graphics, advanced sound chip and proper grown-up keyboard. We unpacked it on our dinner table, plugging it into a small portable TV and loading the one game we had, a very basic Donkey Kong clone named Crazy Kong. My life would never be the same again. This contraption was my obsession for the next four years – my friendships and free-time would revolve around games such as Bruce Lee, Paradroid and Hyper Sports. To this day, I treasure the memories of playing golf sim Leaderboard with my dad. The sound effects, speech samples and graphics conjured by that computer have lived rent free in my head for, god, almost 40 years.\n\nCommodore was a huge success for a decade. It followed the 64 (which sold somewhere between 12-30m units) with the Amiga, another great gaming machine. But with the rise of the PC came a long painful decline – the company eventually filing for bankruptcy in 1994, the brand kept semi-alive for years afterwards by a series of intellectual property buyouts. In August 2025, however, retro YouTuber Christian “Peri Fractic” Simpson, backed by a board of Commodore veterans, bought the brand and promised to reinvigorate it.\n\nThe result is the Ultimate, a faithful reproduction, not just in looks (although you can opt for a Starlight edition with lots of LED lights and a transparent case), but in tech specs. Instead of running a software emulation of the C64, it’s built around an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) – an integrated circuit programmed to simulate the actual hardware. You can plug in an original C64 Datasette or disk drive and it will run original software (a wonderful touch is that if you’re running a disk file, the computer simulates the noise of a disk drive complete with whirs, tics and bleeps). It even has a cartridge port that will run old game carts such as International Soccer. To complete the scene, you can plug your old Quick Shot II into one of the two joystick ports. Then simply load up a copy of Daley Thompson’s Decathlon and immediately break it.\n\nBut it’s not just a machine for playing old games. Turn it on using the authentic power switch on the side and it boots into the original Commodore 64 start screen, complete with the words, “Commodore 64 Basic V2, 64K Ram system, 38911 Basic Bytes free. Ready.” And the flashing cursor. You can programme it just as you could back then, using Basic or, if you’re feeling advanced, assembly language. Obviously I tried everyone’s first program in the 1980s:\n\n10 print “keith is cool”;\n\n 20 goto 10\n\nIt worked. After that, I dug out an old program listing from Computer & Video Games magazine and have been typing it in – although it’s a challenge as the print is small, faint and smudged after 30 years in my attic. On top of this, you can click the power button upwards and it switches to an alternate menu crammed with new options. You can plug in a USB thumb drive and load C64 games and apps that you’ve acquired online. The computer also comes with a sample USB drive (shaped like a cassette tape) that is filled with demos and games to try. Even better, it’s easy to connect it the internet via a wired or wireless connection, which gives you access to a community archive of games, as well as old school bulletin board systems, basically the 1980s equivalents of Reddit forums.\n\nWhat I love about the machine is this seamless integration of modern tech into a retro environment. You can plug it into a modern monitor via HDMI, but the menus and inputs are all redolent of the 1980s era – lists of text, Ascii art, cursor keys or W, A, S, D for navigation. The memories of interacting with this ancient hardware came flooding back. Everything you did on the C64 required some effort and expertise, whether that was loading a game or writing little programs – there was no drag-and-drop, no plug-and-play; you were a computer user not a platform consumer. In its press release announcing the product, Commodore referred to itself as “the Digital Detox Brand – a bold stand against today’s toxic tech”. And while that’s a little polemical and self-aggrandising, there’s some truth in it. Exploring the C64 these last few weeks has given me more pleasure than downloading an app on to my phone ever has.\n\nSet to be priced at £260.50 ($349.99/AU$524), it’s not cheap and begs the question – is there value to this machine beyond its appeal to original owners? I think there is. In a more accessible way than the incredible PDP-10 replica I wrote about last year, it’s a living historical relic, a way to reconnect with the original concept of a desktop home computer – as something we learned and coded for. The excellent user’s guide it ships with is filled with useful information on how to get it to make music and display graphics; I sincerely hope that an alternative indie gaming scene thrives here as a result. There is intrinsic value in understanding computers at a fundamental level beyond slick user interfaces; there is value in developing a knowledge of how programs work, however simple.\n\nAnd even the machine’s nostalgic impact has worth. It has been fun to show my sons this fossilised contraption – no curated walls of games to buy, no ads, no pop-ups, no social media notifications. Meanwhile, playing those old games again has proven the value of great design and clever programming over hype and visual impact. It’s a lesson we could all afford to learn.",

    "description": "The killing of George Floyd in 2020 prompted a wave of statements from tech companies and CEOs. Today, pushback against ICE is largely coming from employees, not executives.",
    "fullText": "returned to the White House last January, the biggest names in tech have mostly fallen in line with the new regime, attending dinners with officials, heaping praise upon the administration, presenting the president with lavish gifts, and pleading for Trump’s permission to sell their products to China. It’s been largely business as usual for Silicon Valley over the past year, even as the administration ignored a wide range of constitutional norms and attempted to slap arbitrary fees on everything from chip exports to worker visas for high-skilled immigrants employed by tech firms.\n\nBut after an ICE agent shot and killed an unarmed US citizen, Renee Nicole Good, in broad daylight in Minneapolis last week, a number of tech leaders have begun publicly speaking out about the Trump administration’s tactics. This includes prominent researchers at Google and Anthropic, who have denounced the killing as callous and immoral. The most wealthy and powerful tech CEOs are still staying silent as ICE floods America’s streets, but now some researchers and engineers working for them have chosen to break rank.\n\nMore than 150 tech workers so far have signed a petition asking for their company CEOs to call the White House, demand that ICE leave US cities, and speak out publicly against the agency’s recent violence. Anne Diemer, a human resources consultant and former Stripe employee who organized the petition, says that workers at Meta, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, TikTok, Spotify, Salesforce, Linkedin, and Rippling are among those who have signed. The group plans to make the list public once they reach 200 signatories.\n\n“I think so many tech folks have felt like they can’t speak up,” Diemer told WIRED. “I want tech leaders to call the country’s leaders and condemn ICE’s actions, but even if this helps people find their people and take a small part in fighting fascism, then that’s cool, too.”\n\nNikhil Thorat, an engineer at Anthropic, said in a lengthy post on X that Good’s killing had “stirred something” in him. “A mother was gunned down in the street by ICE, and the government doesn’t even have the decency to perform a scripted condolence,” he wrote. Thorat added that the moral foundation of modern society is “infected, and is festering,” and the country is living through a “cosplay” of Nazi Germany, a time when people also stayed silent out of fear.\n\nJonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, added a “+1” to Thorat’s post. Shrisha Radhakrishna, chief technology and chief product officer of real estate platform Opendoor, replied that what happened to Good is “not normal. It's immoral. The speed at which the administration is moving to dehumanize a mother is terrifying.” Other users who identified themselves as employees at OpenAI and Anthropic also responded in support of Thorat.\n\nShortly after Good was shot, Jeff Dean, an early Google employee and University of Minnesota graduate who is now the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, began re-sharing posts with his 400,000 X followers criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, including one outlining circumstances in which deadly force isn’t justified for police officers interacting with moving vehicles.\n\nHe then weighed in himself. “This is completely not okay, and we can't become numb to repeated instances of illegal and unconstitutional action by government agencies,” Dean wrote in an X post on January 10. “The recent days have been horrific.” He linked to a video of a teenager—identified as a US citizen—being violently arrested at a Target in Richfield, Minnesota.\n\nIn response to US vice president JD Vance’s assertion on X that Good was trying to run over the ICE agent with her vehicle, Aaron Levie, the CEO of the cloud storage company Box, replied, “Why is he shooting after he’s fully out of harm’s way (2nd and 3rd shot)? Why doesn’t he just move away from the vehicle instead of standing in front of it?” He added a screenshot of a Justice Department web page outlining best practices for law enforcement officers interacting with suspects in moving vehicles.",

    "fullText": "You might have heard recently that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS. It’s called Grid Lanes.\n\nCSS Grid Lanes adds a whole new capability to CSS Grid. It lets you line up content in either columns or rows — and not both.\n\nThis layout pattern allows content of various aspect ratios to pack together. No longer do you need to truncate content artificially to make it fit. Plus, the content that’s earlier in the HTML gets grouped together towards the start of the container. If new items get lazy loaded, they appear at the end without reshuffling what’s already on screen.\n\nIt can be tricky to understand the content flow pattern as you are learning Grid Lanes. The content is not flowing down the first column to the very bottom of the container, and then back up to the top of the second column. (If you want that pattern, use CSS Multicolumn or Flexbox.)\n\nWith Grid Lanes, the content flows perpendicular to the layout shape you created. When you define columns, the content flows back and forth across those columns, just like to how it would if rows existed. If you define rows, the content will flow up and down through the rows — in the column direction, as if columns were there.\n\nHaving a way to see the order of items can make it easier to understand this content flow. Introducing the CSS Grid Lanes Inspector in Safari. It’s just the regular Grid Inspector, now with more features.\n\nSafari’s Grid Inspector already reveals the grid lines for Grid Lanes, and labels track sizes, line numbers, line names, and area names. Now it has a new feature — “Order Numbers”.\n\nYou might be tempted to believe the content order doesn’t matter. With pages like this photo gallery — most users will have no idea how the photos are ordered in the HTML. But for many users, the content order has a big impact on their experience. You should always consider what it’s like to tab through content — watching one item after another sequentially come into focus. Consider what it’s like to listen to the site through a screenreader while navigating by touch or keyboard. With Grid Lanes, you can adjust flow-tolerance to reduce the jumping around and put items where people expect.\n\nTo know which value for flow tolerance to choose, it really helps to quickly see the order of items. That makes it immediately clear how your CSS impacts the result.\n\nOrder Numbers in the Grid Inspector is an extension of a feature Safari’s Flexbox Inspector has had since Safari 16.0 — marking the order of Flex items. Seeing content order is also helpful when using the order property in Flexbox.\n\nOrder Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector works for CSS Grid and Subgrid, as well as Grid Lanes.\n\nThe Grid and Flexbox layout inspectors might seem similar across browsers, but the team behind Safari’s Web Inspector has taken the time to finely polish the details. In both the Grid and Flexbox Inspectors, you can simultaneously activate as many overlays as you want. No limits. And no janky scrolling due to performance struggles.\n\nSafari’s Flexbox Inspector visually distinguishes between excess free space and Flex gaps, since knowing which is which can solve confusion. It shows the boundaries of items, revealing how they are distributed both on the main axis and the cross axis of Flexbox containers. And it lists all the Flexbox containers, making it easier to understand what’s happening overall.\n\nOur Grid Inspector has a simple and clear interface, making it easy to understand the options. It also lists all Grid containers. And of course, you can change the default colors of the overlays, to best contrast with your site content.\n\nAnd Safari’s Grid and Flexbox Inspectors are the only browser devtools that label content order. We hope seeing the order of content in Grid Lanes helps you understand it more thoroughly and enjoy using this powerful new layout mechanism.\n\nOrder Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector shipped today in Safari Technology Preview 235. Let us know what you think. There’s still time to polish the details to make the most helpful tool possible. You can ping Jen Simmons on Bluesky or Mastodon with links, comments and ideas.",

    "description": "Never underestimate the power of financial incentives. Even for tech billionaires.",
    "fullText": "\"You get what you measure\" is one of my favorite concepts in modern business. It means people and organizations tend to focus their behavior on whatever metrics get tracked and rewarded.\n\nThis even applies to tech billionaires.\n\nThis week, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will make its FSD service subscription-only and remove the option to buy it outright.\n\nOn social media, Elon stans theorized and argued with Elon-haters over the reason for this change. As usual, the debate was devoid of nuance. Fans took this as another sign of the Tesla CEO's genius. Critics argued this proves FSD doesn't work and is doomed.\n\nAs usual, the truth lies elsewhere. Here's my theory, which my Business Insider colleague Tom Carter nodded at earlier.\n\nI think Tesla is getting what it measures. Musk's new compensation package, approved by shareholders late last year, has several tough targets the company must hit before he gets $1 trillion.\n\nAccording to Tesla's proxy filing, there are four product goals. Number 2 on the list is this: \"10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions.\"\n\nOne way Tesla can reach this milestone more quickly is to remove the option to buy FSD outright. By mid-February, anyone considering this option will need to subscribe instead.\n\nWhy would Tesla's board make this a goal for Musk? Subscriptions are a steadier business. Investors prefer continuous income generated by subscription businesses, versus lumpier operations that rely on large, one-time purchases. A pure FSD subscription also gives Tesla more flexibility to change pricing in the future.\n\nI think this is the main lesson, though: Never underestimate the power of financial incentives.\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the FSD change.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft is promising to cover the costs of electricity needed to power its rapidly growing fleet of data centers in suburban and rural communities across the US.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, Brad Smith, the president and vice chair of the Big Tech giant, said that going forward, Microsoft will \"pay utility rates that are high enough to cover our electricity costs.\"\n\nIt's a bold pledge to make at a time when AI is fueling a historic surge in demand for power in the US, and electric bills are surging for the average American utility customer.\n\nIt is also one that state regulators have heard before as utilities, their data center customers, and consumer advocates argue over who will bear the cost of new infrastructure needed to serve AI's enormous appetite for power.\n\nBut as the impact of data centers on electricity rates becomes an increasingly hot political flashpoint, Microsoft may have no other choice but to follow through, and the rest of Big Tech might not be far behind.\n\n\"There is no free lunch for tech players, and Trump is watching,\" said Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities.\n\nIves expects other Big Tech companies to follow Microsoft's lead and make similar pledges addressing local concerns around major data center buildouts sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" President Trump wrote Monday night in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nTrump wrote that his administration had collaborated with Microsoft on the company's pledge to cover its electricity costs, and alluded to future announcements by other companies.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, the White House Press Office pointed to President Trump's post on Truth Social.\n\nMicrosoft's four-part plan to ensure it is paying its fair share of electricity costs was laid out in a blog post this week. The plan consists of asking utilities and regulators to set their rates high enough to cover their data center costs, collaborating with utilities to cover the costs of new infrastructure, looking for ways to operate data centers more efficiently, and advocating for affordable, reliable power at the state and federal levels.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, a spokesperson for Microsoft pointed to the company's blog post.\n\nConsumer advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to pay its fair share, but eager to see more details — especially from the utilities that serve the data centers.\n\n\"These are only rough concepts that don't get at the root of the problem, which is the scale and speed at which the industry is moving,\" said Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at Virginia's Piedmont Environmental Council.\n\nDominion Energy, Virginia's largest public utility, has said it is in contract talks with data center customers for 47 gigawatts of new demand — double Dominion's current peak load.\n\nBolthouse is concerned about the legitimacy of that demand — and who might end up footing the bill if it never comes to fruition.\n\n\"The current process of unreviewed contracts between utilities and data centers has broken the planning process and threatens the reliability of the system,\" said Bolthouse.\n\nCharles Hua, founder and director of Powerlines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility regulation reform, said that data centers can be \"good grid citizens\" if local utilities prioritize investment in grid-enhancing technologies and energy efficiency over building new power plants.\n\n\"Doing so will require states to reimagine our outdated system of utility regulation and make necessary changes to center consumers going forward,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Musk attempts to recast AI tool’s misuse. Plus, tech billionaires plot against a proposed California tax on their fortunes\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, US tech editor for the Guardian. Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.\n\nThe firestorm over the Grok AI tool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

The quiet concerns that started last year regarding massive AI investments are escalating into loud protests in 2026.\n\nDimon wasn't just asking for blind faith from his shareholders. He discussed the threat posed by his peers and fintechs, and said spending on technology and AI is far more important than trying to \"meet some expense target.\"\n\n(For what it's worth, JPMorgan is actually top of the class when it comes to AI maturity across Wall Street, according to Evident's AI index.)\n\nThe players might be different, but other businesses will likely defend their AI spend with a similar argument: Every dollar I don't spend is one my competitor is willing to, and that could be the difference between winning and losing.\n\nI'm not endorsing FOMO-inspired spending, but I see the rationale. I'd rather go down swinging in the AI wars than not enter the fray at all.\n\nThere's another fight JPMorgan isn't interested in getting into.\n\nThe bank's CFO said the credit card rate cap proposed by President Donald Trump could force JPM to rethink its business entirely.\n\nIt's the latest company to weigh in on Trump's proposal, and it's a biggy. JPMorgan's card services sales totalled roughly $360 billion last quarter.\n\nOpponents of Trump's pitch say capping credit card rates will backfire. If lenders can't charge higher rates to riskier borrowers, they'll just limit the credit they offer them instead of lowering their rates.\n\nAnd it's not like people will stop borrowing. (This is America, after all.) They'll just look for alternatives, which could lead them to take out more personal loans, making 2026 potentially a big year for lenders like SoFi.",

    "description": "When my husband was laid off from his tech job, we sold our house and decided to travel for a year in our 40s. It changed how we view happiness.",
    "fullText": "We lived with our two greyhounds in an over-3,000-square-foot home outside Boston that we owned. We were both hustling and climbing the corporate ladder — he in the tech industry, and I at a law practice.\n\nThen, in 2022, Dave got laid off, and we lost our two dogs to cancer.\n\nThat's when we had the harrowing realization that the life we'd spent years building no longer fit us. Our home now felt far too big, and we felt lost and restless. We desperately needed a change — but first, a change of scenery.\n\nSo, we sold our house and decided to spend a year traveling the world as we contemplated our next move.\n\nBefore hitting the road, I figured out a plan to work remotely. That income, plus Dave's severance and the money made from the sale of our home, would allow us to enjoy some time away without financial strain.\n\nOur travel goals were simple — see a lot of places, think about what to do with our lives when we returned to the US, and spend time with animals along the way.\n\nThough we're ambitious, we've always found that spending time around animals forces us to slow down. It's a lesson we'd learned after adopting our dogs, who always seemed happy just to be, sans any hustle.\n\nSo, we started our trip on a farm about an hour south of Dublin, where we were able to really mellow out.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to find a note from Dave that said he was joining the husband-and-wife farmers to scan the bellies of the pregnant sheep on-site.\n\nI cradled a warm cup of coffee in my hands as I stood behind my husband while he helped the farmers. His smile was the biggest I'd seen in a long time.\n\nOver the next nine months, we visited other countries in Europe including Croatia, Portugal, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nWe traveled slowly and established home bases in each place, which allowed us to really relax into the environment. We were able to explore at our own pace, and we also had time to consider what our future looked like back in the US.\n\nWhatever was next, we knew it would involve less hustle and more time in the natural world.\n\nAfter nine months, our hunger for travel felt more than satiated.\n\nWe returned to the US with a clear understanding that the life we'd left behind in the States — with a giant home and a constant desire to climb the corporate ladder — wasn't the one we wanted to cultivate again.\n\nDuring our travels, some of our most cherished memories included spending time on the farm in Dublin and sinking into the hot springs in Iceland. It was moments such as these that helped us realize the life we wanted was slower and more intentional.\n\nSo, we downsized to an 800-square-foot home on a lake in central Massachusetts. We even adopted another greyhound — one who's always eager to sit lakeside with his dads, watching the birds fly by.\n\nA little more than a year after we returned, I retired from my law practice to focus on writing, and Dave left the tech industry behind to start a whole new career at a mom-and-pop company.\n\nIf traveling for that year taught us anything, it's that our joy is better accessed with less stuff, less chasing of bigger-and-better opportunities, and more chances to be with the natural world.\n\nThis story was originally published on June 17, 2025, and most recently updated on January 14, 2026.",

Ives suggested that impeding the industry's progress now could compromise the broader US AI agenda.\n\n\"We believe this will be a continuous back and forth battle between Big Tech players and the Trump administration with data center buildouts an important aspect of fueling the AI Revolution over the coming years,\" Ives added.",

    "fullText": "Silicon Valley is raising its standards for talent.\n\nAdrien Friggeri spent over a decade combined at Meta — including back when it was called Facebook — with stints at Michael Bloomberg's Hawkfish and Clubhouse as well. Now, he works as a partner software engineer at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe consequences of underperforming are \"more drastic\" now than they were 10 years ago, Friggeri said on \"The Peterman Pod.\"\n\nIn an email to Business Insider, Friggeri wrote that there is less \"organizational 'slack'\" and higher expectations for tech employees.\n\n\"That means performance gaps are identified and addressed faster, and if someone is not meeting clearly defined expectations over time, the path to a formal performance-management process (and potentially a role change or exit) can be shorter than it used to be,\" Friggeri wrote.\n\nMeta has been especially strict with its performance expectations. The tech giant laid off roughly 3,600 employees in February, labeling them low performers.\n\nThere are also benefits to being above the pack. Meta is introducing higher bonuses for top performers, Business Insider reported on Monday.\n\nIn his email, Friggeri clarified that the trend was not specific to Meta. Rather, it was industry-wide and reflected the state of the market. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFriggeri shared four tips with Business Insider to stay ahead and avoid underperformance.\n\n1.) Workers should make expectations explicit.\n\n\"Align with your manager on priorities and what 'great' looks like for the next 30/60/90 days,\" Friggeri wrote.\n\n2.) Employees should seek out feedback.\n\nThey shouldn't wait for review cycles, Friggeri wrote. Feedback should be sought out \"early and often.\"\n\n3.) Focus on \"visible, high-leverage work.\"\n\n\"Pick projects tied to clear outcomes and communicate progress, risks, and tradeoffs,\" he wrote.\n\n4.) Keep investing in your skills\n\nFriggeri wrote that employees should \"treat learning as part of the job, especially as teams and priorities shift.\"\n\nOn the podcast, Friggeri advocated for being independent and building new projects — and not being silent about them. It's not helpful to \"lock yourself in a room,\" build for three months, and show up with the finished product.\n\n\"Overcommunicate is really the strategy I would recommend,\" he said.",

    "description": "The company wants to plow more money into its wearable tech.",
    "fullText": "Meta is laying off more than 1,000 workers, signaling a partial retreat from the company’s much-derided metaverse ambitions.\n\nThe layoff, the Bay Area tech industry’s first big job cut of 2026, was announced Tuesday morning in an internal post from Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, according to a Bloomberg report that Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed to SFGATE. The cuts won’t touch Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp; they’re within Meta’s Reality Labs arm, an operation that’s poured investment into the “metaverse” idea and also sells the company’s virtual reality headsets and Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” Clayton wrote in an emailed statement. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”\n\nAs of Tuesday at 9:15 a.m., the Menlo Park company had not filed a WARN document with California officials announcing the local scope of the layoffs.\n\nMeta’s pullback from its metaverse goals has been a long time coming. When Mark Zuckerberg changed his company’s name from Facebook in October 2021, he expounded on the idea of a virtual world where people could work, learn, play and shop together, calling it an “embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it.”\n\nHe wrote, “Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology.” His ambitions were, like the rhetoric, grand: “Our hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.”\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBut hype around the idea of a metaverse — at one point, people were buying virtual land on other companies’ versions of the metaverse — quickly faded into derision. Meta was mocked for its legless virtual avatars, and failed to turn its Horizon Worlds metaverse product into a hit.\n\nRather than renewing the company, the ambition instead has served as a drag on Meta’s finances. In 2024, the company reported spending 21% of its costs on the Reality Labs segment, even as it lost more than $17.7 billion in the division. Quarter after quarter, the long-term bet has eaten into Meta’s vast social media ad profits. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the division has turned a $71 billion loss since the start of 2021.\n\nZuckerberg’s choice to move that investment toward Meta’s wearables, rather than the metaverse, is a bet on products that Meta has been actually able to find large audiences for. The company’s Quest headsets are well-reviewed and far, far cheaper than Apple’s Vision Pro offering. Bloomberg reported that Meta is considering doubling its output of its new artificial intelligence-embedded glasses, thanks to high demand.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAs SFGATE reported, Zuckerberg is imagining a future where anyone not wearing high-tech frames will be at a “cognitive disadvantage.” Moving money from the metaverse toward wearables means he’s swapping one lofty ambition for another.\n\nWork at a Bay Area tech company and want to talk?

    "fullText": "If you handed Mark Cuban $100,000, he wouldn't run to Wall Street or some hot tech startup. He'd grab a shopping cart.\n\nIn a 2010 Forbes interview, the billionaire was asked what he'd do with a lump sum of $100,000. His response wasn't flashy. It wasn't cryptic. And it didn't involve crypto. It involved…toothpaste.\n\n\"First I pay off all my credit card debt and evaluate paying off any other debt I have. What I have left I put in the bank,\" he said. But he didn't stop there.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nMissed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs? This Platform Lets Everyday Investors Access Private Tech Early\n\nThen comes the part that sounds less like a billionaire's financial strategy and more like a Costco coupon haul: \"I try to create as much transactional value as possible from that cash. I look at my annual budgets for everything and anything, and I look to see where I can save the most money on those items. Saving 30% to 50% buying in bulk—replenishable items from toothpaste to soup, or whatever I use a lot of—is the best guaranteed return on investment you can get anywhere.\"\n\nLet's break that down. Cuban isn't saying go hoard hand sanitizer like it's 2020 again. He's saying if you already use toothpaste, toilet paper, canned soup, shampoo—things you're going to buy anyway—you might as well stock up when prices are lower. That's the ROI: buying stuff now to avoid paying more later. His version of \"investing\" isn't tied up in risk—it's about locked-in savings.\n\nLet's say you usually buy a four-pack of toilet paper for $6, but a bulk box of 30 rolls goes on sale for $20. That's about 67 cents a roll vs. $1.50 a roll. Over the year, you're not just wiping away inconvenience—you're saving real cash. Multiply that across your grocery staples and, like Cuban says, you're looking at a \"guaranteed\" ROI no stock or bond can promise.\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd what about the rest of that $100,000? Don't expect a fancy ETF recommendation from Cuban.\n\n\"Whatever I have left I keep in the bank and let it earn nothing,\" he said in the interview.\n\nYes—\"let it earn nothing.\" Why? Because then it's ready. Cuban's not parking money in the bank out of laziness—he's waiting for the moment he can pounce. In his world, flexibility beats short-term yield.",

    "description": "What could be a better avenue than utility stocks that pay dependable, often large, dividend payments every quarter? These five stocks could be perfect for Boomer and Gen X investors.",
    "fullText": "Big tech companies are increasingly striking direct deals with utilities to secure reliable, long-term energy supplies as their power needs surge, driven mainly by data centers, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. These agreements often include power purchase agreements for renewable energy, such as wind and solar, allowing tech firms to lock in stable prices while helping utilities finance new generation and grid upgrades. In some cases, companies are also partnering with utilities on energy storage, transmission expansion, and even next-generation sources like small modular nuclear reactors to ensure around-the-clock power. For utilities, these deals provide guaranteed demand and investment capital. At the same time, tech companies offer energy security, cost predictability, and progress toward sustainability goals—making the partnerships strategically crucial for both sides.\n\nGrowth and income investors looking for a safer way to play the AI and data center explosion have found an avenue with utility stocks.\n\nMany top U.S. utility companies have already cut landmark deals with big-tech giants.\n\nPaying dependable dividends and offering long-term safety for investors, top utility stocks make sense in a growth and income portfolio.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nWe decided to screen our 24/7 Wall St. utility stocks research database to identify the top companies in the sector that have already struck substantial deals with some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent players. Surging demand for electricity, which will only continue to grow, has made some of America’s oldest and best utility companies one of the best investments for growth and income investors who would like to participate in the AI/data center revolution but would rather play it from a safer angle. What could be a better avenue than utility stocks that pay dependable, and in some cases large, dividend payments every quarter? Five top companies that we have covered for years may be perfect stocks for Boomer and Gen X investors, and all are rated Buy at the top Wall Street firms we cover.\n\nThis off-the-radar utility stock is an ideal choice for growth and income investors, with its hefty 3.93% dividend yield. Brookfield Renewable Corp. (NYSE: BEPC) operates renewable power platforms and sustainable solutions. The company has signed a framework with Microsoft to develop over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity from 2026 to 2030, and also has a hydro framework agreement with Google.",

That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.\n\nWhile several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll need an iPhone running iOS 26 – iPhone 11 or later – to use one. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.\n\nBest Apple Watch for most people:\nSE 3\n\nBest mid-range Apple Watch: \n\n Series 11\n\nBest Apple Watch for battery: \n\n Ultra 3\n\nI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time, I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting-edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.\n\nWe conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.\n\nWe change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.\n\nWe test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.\n\nThe recently updated entry-level Apple Watch SE 3 offers almost everything its more expensive siblings do, but at a discount.\n\nIt’s light and comfortable to wear, and arrives in a choice of 40mm and 44mm case sizes. Available in either starlight or midnight aluminium, with many different strap colours and types, it should fit most wrists and styles.\n\nThe big upgrade for the SE this year is the always-on display, as well as the rapid S10 chip and 64GB of storage from the Series 11. It runs the latest watchOS 26, which comes with super-handy double-tap and wrist-flick gestures to clear notifications, alarms and scroll through your widgets hands-free. Siri runs locally, so you can quickly set timers, dictate messages and other basic features without an internet connection. And the SE 3 has all the deep integration with the iPhone that makes Apple Watches great, including Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos, music control and many other features. Battery life is about one and a half days.\n\nThe SE 3 sports an older design than the current Series watch line, with chunkier bezels, a slightly smaller and dimmer screen and a 1mm thicker body, but otherwise it looks very similar to all other Apple Watches. Only those comparing them side by side are likely to spot the difference.\n\nWhile you get most of Apple’s class-leading health-tracking features, this entry-level model can’t take ECGs of your heart, record blood oxygen saturation or notify you about any potential hypertension. It still has an optical heart-rate monitor for recording throughout the day and night, though. Its skin temperature sensor allows for retrospective ovulation estimates in the cycles tracking app, too, alongside other features.\n\nIt tracks all your usual sleep, standing, steps and movement goals, and the GPS makes it a decent running and workout tracker. It supports Apple’s new AI Workout Buddy coach, but this requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later with Apple Intelligence to be carried with you on runs.\n\nNote that 5G models are available, but require a plan linked to your phone provider. And if you’re looking for a cellular-connected watch, I’d recommend the Series 11 with 5G instead.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe SE 3 offers all the essential bits of the Apple Watch experience, including an always-on screen, but in an older-looking body with a few more advanced health features removed. That leaves a great smartwatch for iPhone users that does most of what people want at a good price.\n\nDon’t buy if: you want ECG or hypertension alerts.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch SE 3 review: the bargain smartwatch for iPhone\n\nSize: 40/44mm\nThickness: 10.7mm\nScreen brightness: up to 1,000nits\nTested battery life: 1.5 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 50 metres \nSensors: HR (2nd gen), skin temperature, GPS\n\nThe biggest, boldest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 3, which builds on the Series 11 with a supersized screen and body, and adds a bunch of adventure-ready features – ready for life in the wilderness, or just work in the city.\n\nIt’s available only in titanium and at 49mm, although there’s a choice of a natural or black finish. It has the biggest and brightest screen on an Apple Watch, protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. Similar to the Series 11, the display is much brighter off-angle, making it easier to read at a glance.\n\nOn the inside, it’s similar to the Series 11: an S10 chip, 64GB storage, and 5G support as standard with a compatible phone plan. It runs the same watchOS 26, including the double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, but battery life is three days plus with general use. This will see you through a long weekend, or up to 14 hours of tracking workouts at the highest accuracy settings.\n\nOn the outside, the Ultra 3 has an extra action button, with which you can start a workout and light up the screen as a torch, plus other features. There’s a chunkier crown and a loudspeaker that doubles as a siren to attract attention in emergency situations. New for this year is satellite connectivity for free SOS messaging to the emergency services, if things go awry when you’re out of cellular signal range.\n\nThe Ultra 3 also has dual-band GPS, making it one of the most accurate running, cycling and sports tracking watches available. It offers a good suite of tracking metrics, plus Workout Buddy for motivation, if you carry your iPhone with you. The watch can also track dives to 40 metres’ depth and at least 22 other activities.\n\nSize-wise, it’s big for an Apple Watch – but the Ultra 3 still fits under shirt cuffs, and is relatively compact compared with adventure watch rivals from the likes of Garmin. This is a good choice should you want an Apple Watch that stands out – although it costs about twice as much as the Series 11.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, boldest, longest-lasting, and most capable Apple Watch. It’s ready for daily life, workouts or the odd adventure into the wilderness.\n\nDon’t buy if: you need a compact model or have smaller wrists.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhone\n\nSize: 49mm\nThickness: 12mm \nScreen brightness: up to 3,000nits\nTested battery life: 3 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 100 metres \nSensors: HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, dual-band GPS\n\nSeries 10 \n\n The same design as the Series 11 with the same chip and screen, but with a slightly smaller battery, less scratch-resistant glass and 4G rather than 5G. Worth buying at a discount.\n\nSeries 9 \n\n Thicker and with a slightly smaller screen than the Series 10 or 11, but worth buying refurbished if you don’t want the SE 3.\n\nUltra 2 \n\n 2023’s Ultra Apple Watch was great, and is only missing a few small upgrades to screen, battery, 5G and satellite SOS compared with the current model.\n\nWearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.\n\nGreater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, although options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges at least £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteries costs £95.\n\nBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.\n\nThere are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes and sells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.\n\nSeveral third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chain CeX, online stores such as musicMagpie, and marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Back Market.\n\nMake sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:\n\nGrade A or excellent – virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.\n\nGrade B or good – in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.\n\nGrade C or fair – in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:\n\nBattery health – the battery in the Apple Watch is designed to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check the battery health under battery via the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?\n\nCharging cable – the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck, which costs £29 on its own, to charge. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.\n\nButtons – check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.\n\nSensors – the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?\n\nSpeakers – check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.\n\nWifi – the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.\n\nWater resistance – the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50-metre water resistance?\n\nWarranty – what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?\n\nAny Apple Watch Series 7 or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches – tested\n\n The best fitness tech and gadgets, according to experts\n\nSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

    "fullText": "Despite internet blackout, a small number of Iranians are risking their lives to share messages as protests continue\n\nFor most of Iran, the internet was shut off on Thursday afternoon – the most severe blackout the country has seen in years of internet shutdowns, coming after days of escalating anti-government protests.\n\nFor a very small sliver of the country, it is still possible to get photos and videos to the outside world, and even to make calls. The Telegram channel Vahid Online on Monday posted photos of dead bodies lying next to a street in Kahrizak, on the southern outskirts of Tehran; on Sunday, it shared a video of Iranians chanting “death to Khamenei” at a funeral.\n\nSome of these videos and messages are transmitted through an ecosystem of online tools designed to bypass censorship – among them Telegram proxies, a decentralised messaging service called Delta Chat, and a browser called Ceno, said Amir Rashidi, an Iranian digital rights expert.\n\nThere are about 50,000 Starlink terminals now in Iran, said Rashidi; other reports put this number at up to 100,000. The users of the service – which is part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX – are a tiny fraction of Iran’s overall population of more than 90 million people.\n\nWhile multiple people – even a whole apartment block – might be able to connect to the internet via a single Starlink terminal, the number of total users in the entire country is at most in the hundreds of thousands, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a network observability and intelligence platform.\n\nThey hold Iran’s last tenuous link to the outside world. Very little information, at least electronically, appears to be leaving the country, except for minimal traffic from businesses and individuals whitelisted by the regime.\n\nAcross Iran, authorities are hunting for Starlink terminals – jamming whole neighbourhoods using tools developed for electronic warfare, and flying drones over rooftops to search for telltale satellite dishes, say sources. Under a law passed in 2025, possessing a Starlink terminal in Iran can be interpreted as espionage for Israel and is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\n“They have basically criminalised Starlink to the extent that they’re saying in the law [that] if you use Starlink it’s the equivalent of conducting espionage operations for Israel and the American CIA,” said Rashidi.\n\nIt is unclear how many terminals are still operating, and how many have been confiscated, he added.\n\nThe tools Iran appears to be using to jam the terminals are military-grade, similar to those used to jam drones on the frontlines of Ukraine, said Rashidi. They are expensive and energy-intensive, capable of knocking out a certain radio frequency within a given area, but can only be used locally and cannot blanket the country.\n\n“It’s not cheap. It’s something you’d find in a military arsenal, and there’s only a few types of suppliers,” said Madory.\n\nFor now, the few who have smuggled Starlink terminals can connect online, although in neighbourhoods with heavy jamming it is nearly impossible to do more than send messages. The tech-savvy among them are using VPNs to disguise their presence; others are simply hauling their terminals from place to place to avoid detection.\n\nWhile Starlink users can communicate for now, Iran could choose – though it would be difficult – to track them down.\n\n“Depending on how much effort the Iranian government wanted to put into it, they could trace the signals that use the particular frequency those terminals have to use,” said Madory. “You’re kind of announcing yourself.”\n\nFor those without a terminal, an announcement on a state-linked Telegram channel has given a preview to the potential future of the internet in Iran. The IRIB news agency yesterday published a list of all internet sites that would now be available in Iran.\n\nThese included domestic search engines, domestic maps and navigation services, domestic messaging apps, and even a domestic streaming service – an Iranian version of Netflix, said Rashidi, with only government-approved videos.\n\nAll of these sites are part of Iran’s effort to create a national internet, said Rashidi: a skeleton version of the web that is significantly more restricted than even China’s, managed by the government and virtually unconnected to the outside world. That effort has been under way since the Rouhani administration, and now appears to be working, he said.\n\nWhat this could mean, said Madory and Rashidi, is that Iran’s internet as it was may not come back.\n\n“There are rumours,” said Rashidi. “Some people are saying that if things go back normal, there won’t be the internet. There will be only the national internet.”\n\n“They’re gearing up for the long run, for this to be the way things are for an extended period of time,” said Madory.",

As of 2026, at least one data center under the project is already underway in Texas.\n\nSuch buildouts are energy-intensive. OpenAI's data center plans will cost $400 billion and require seven gigawatts of power, Business Insider previously wrote, more than that of the entire New York City.\n\nSome tech companies are also moving their planned facilities off the grid entirely for easier permitting and less community resistance. To shield residents and small businesses from rate hikes, utilities in states like Indiana and Ohio have also started enforcing tariffs on power-hungry tech facilities.",

    "description": "\"We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening, and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad.\"",
    "fullText": "Pioneering computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” said artificial intelligence will spark a surge in unemployment and profits.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times last year, the former Google scientist cleared the air about why he left the tech giant, raised alarms on potential threats from AI, and revealed how he uses the technology. But he also predicted who the winners and losers will be.\n\n“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said in September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”\n\nThat echoed comments he gave to Fortune in August 2025, when he said AI companies are more concerned with short-term profits than the long-term consequences of the technology.\n\nLayoffs haven’t spiked, but evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level where recent college graduates start their careers.\n\nA survey from the New York Fed at the time found that companies using AI were much more likely to retrain their employees than fire them, though layoffs are expected to rise in the coming months.\n\nHinton said earlier healthcare is the one industry that will be safe from the potential jobs armageddon.\n\n“If you could make doctors five times as efficient, we could all have five times as much health care for the same price,” he explained on the Diary of a CEO YouTube series in June 2025. “There’s almost no limit to how much health care people can absorb—[patients] always want more health care if there’s no cost to it.”\n\nStill, Hinton believes jobs that perform mundane tasks will be taken over by AI, while sparing some jobs that require a high level of skill.\n\nIn his interview with the FT, he also dismissed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s idea to pay a universal basic income as AI disrupts the economy and reduces demand for workers, saying it “won’t deal with human dignity” and the value people derive from having jobs.\n\nHinton has long warned about the dangers of AI without guardrails, estimating a 10% to 20% chance of the technology wiping out humans after the development of superintelligence.\n\nIn his view, the dangers of AI fall into two categories: the risk the technology itself poses to the future of humanity, and the consequences of AI being manipulated by people with bad intent.",

    "description": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin studied graduate computer science at Stanford—but admits Gen Z no longer needs a degree to land a high-paying job at the tech giant.",
    "fullText": "Whether it’s Nike’s Phil Knight, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, or Google’s Sergey Brin, many of the world’s most influential business founders can trace part of their success back to Stanford University. Nestled in the foothills of Silicon Valley, the school has long functioned as a launchpad for tech’s elite.\n\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. As tech reshapes entry-level work and companies rethink traditional hiring pipelines, the payoff of a four-year degree—especially from elite institutions—is increasingly up for debate.\n\nStill, Brin doesn’t regret his own academic path. Speaking to Stanford engineering students last month, he said his decision to study computer science was not driven by a fixation on credentials.\n\n“I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he said. “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”\n\nEven in an era when AI can write code, Brin cautioned students against chasing—or abandoning—fields of study based solely on automation fears.\n\n“I wouldn’t go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,” he said. “The AI is probably even better at comparative literature, just to be perfectly honest anyway.”\n\nBrin met Google cofounder Larry Page in 1994 during his second year of graduate studies at Stanford. Together they developed PageRank, an algorithm they later renamed Google and would become a company in 1998.\n\nGoogle’s hiring practices today reflect how dramatically the industry has shifted. The tech giant is now embracing workers without college degrees.\n\n“In as much as we’ve hired a lot of academic stars, we’ve hired tons of people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees,” Brin said. “They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.”\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, the share of job postings at Google requiring a degree dropped from 93% to 77%, according to analysis from the Burning Glass Institute. And Google isn’t alone: companies including Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco have reduced degree requirements in recent years, signaling a broader industry shift toward skills-based hiring.\n\nThat’s forcing a broader reckoning over what a degree actually signals and whether it’s still a reliable proxy for talent.\n\n“I don’t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you’re going to be a great worker or great person,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in 2024. For many roles, skills matter far more than credentials, he added: “If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn’t show up in their resume.”",

    "description": "Apple goes with Google's tech despite using OpenAI's ChatGPT elsewhere in iOS.",
    "fullText": "The “more intelligent” version of Siri that Apple plans to release later this year will be backed by Google’s Gemini language models, the company announced today. CNBC reports that the deal is part of a “multi-year partnership” between Apple and Google that will allow Apple to use Google’s AI models in its own software.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” reads an Apple statement given to CNBC.\n\nToday’s announcement confirms Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting late last year that Apple and Google were nearing a deal. Apple didn’t disclose terms, but Gurman said that Apple would be paying Google “about $1 billion a year” for access to its AI models “following an extensive evaluation period.”\n\nBloomberg has also reported that the Gemini model would be run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, “ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s infrastructure,” and that Apple still hopes to improve its own in-house language models to the point that they can eventually be used instead of relying on third-party models.\n\nAlthough Apple’s iPhones and iOS compete with Google’s Android operating system and the many smartphones that use it, the companies still cooperate in plenty of other areas. Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (though that deal has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years).\n\nApple’s announcement is a blow to OpenAI and the many versions of its ChatGPT model, which Apple has used elsewhere in iOS and macOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple also tested OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude models before deciding to go with Gemini. ChatGPT came out ahead of Gemini in tests that Ars ran using earlier versions of the models, but Google’s models have apparently improved enough (and amassed enough users) to worry OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” last month and pushed back several planned ChatGPT features so that the company could better respond to Google’s Gemini 3 release.\n\nApple originally promised the improved, AI-powered Siri for 2024’s iOS 18 release, but ultimately delayed the feature because it didn’t work reliably enough. The new version of Siri should arrive in an update to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe later this year.",

    "description": "Michael Burry, the investor from \"The Big Short,\" said return on invested capital is the \"measure to beat all measures\" when looking at AI companies.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short,\" says the era of Big Tech turning relatively small investments into huge profits is ending.\n\nIn a recent Substack exchange with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Burry said the most important metric AI industry investors should be watching isn't revenue growth, hiring, or even market size, but return on invested capital, or ROIC.\n\nROIC is a measure of how efficiently a company turns the money it puts into its business into profit.\n\n\"The measure to beat all measures is return on invested capital (ROIC), and ROIC was very high at these software companies. Now that they are becoming capital-intensive hardware companies, ROIC is sure to fall, and this will pressure shares in the long run,\" Burry wrote.\n\nAI, Burry said, is pushing companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta away from their historically asset-light software models and toward a far more capital-intensive future defined by data centers, chips, and energy.\n\nEven if AI expands Big Tech's addressable market, he said, falling ROIC could pressure stock prices for years to come.\n\nBurry rose to fame after his bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled in \"The Big Short.\" Outside the occasional cryptic social media post, Burry, for a long time, spoke publicly only rarely.\n\nThat changed late last year when he closed his hedge fund to outside cash and began writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nPerhaps most notably, he has recently compared the AI boom to the late-1990s dot-com bubble, calling OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time.\" Netscape's IPO marked the beginning of dot-com hype in 1995. Five years later, the bubble burst.\n\nBurry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, has made large bets against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, two darlings of the AI era, according to a regulatory filing released in September last year.\n\nLeading AI companies, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, are spending big to build out the infrastructure they need to support their energy- and data-intensive chatbots and other AI applications. Debt and equity investors have lined up to back these projects.\n\nSo far, however, those companies have not shown significant profit returns on their AI products, leading investors like Burry to sound the alarm that AI is a bubble on the verge of bursting.\n\nAgreed. And still, return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off. Will it be the Panic of 2026? 2027? Does not have to be. https://t.co/VBWjh26vnc\n\n\"At some point, this spending on the AI buildout has to have a return on investment higher than the cost of that investment, or there is just no economic value added,\" Burry wrote in the Substack post.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Louise Allen, the chief product officer at Planview, who's in her 60s and is based in Austin. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the chief product officer at Planview, an AI-driven portfolio management platform. Planview helps people organize and manage their workloads by providing teams with visibility into tasks in progress, who's responsible, and how everything connects.\n\nI've been the CPO since June 2021. I spent 13 years as the company's senior vice president of product management and solutions marketing.\n\nBefore entering the tech industry, I was a professional tennis player for 11 years.\n\nI was a decorated athlete and fortunate to have played in all four Grand Slam tournaments, finishing third at Wimbledon in 1983. I'd ranked 60th in the world and trained alongside some of the fiercest competitors the sport has ever seen. I earned six figures in prize money throughout my career.\n\nI'd also faced significant obstacles — most notably, back-to-back ACL injuries, which put me on medical rest for the better part of two years.\n\nAfter just over a decade of intense training, global travel, and high-stakes competition, I knew my time on the circuit had to end. I couldn't tell you why, exactly; I just felt called to try something new.\n\nTech offered me the opportunity to challenge myself and use the skills I'd honed on the court: Vision, planning, adaptation, and relentless commitment to improvement. I was excited by the pace of innovation, the potential to create something new, and the opportunity to solve real problems.\n\nWhen I hung up my racket, I returned to school and earned my MBA at 34. My first role in tech was secured thanks to a reference from Billie Jean King, which helped me land a product marketing internship at a small startup.\n\nThe hardest part of starting a corporate job was my schedule not being my own — working hard and learning were all pretty natural to me, but starting at the bottom of the totem pole and having a lot of my time directed by others was a big adjustment.\n\nI was relatively late to making a career change into tech by most professional standards, but I had come to tennis relatively late, too, and that never stopped me.\n\nIt was a much smaller company back then, with just one product line. Product management was just getting started, and I was able to get in on the ground floor of that.\n\nAs the company grew and evolved, so did my role. I moved from tactical roles to more strategic leadership.\n\nToday, Planview is a very different company with broader offerings and a transformed value proposition. I'm in more C-level conversations in a week than I used to have in a year.\n\nI see hyping up teams as a key part of the role; it's what gets everyone excited about and aligned with the overall vision. People need to walk away being fired up about what we do, and my days are often filled with high-level conversations across teams, customers, and other C-suite leaders.\n\nA typical day includes strategy meetings, product road map reviews, and customer-facing discussions, both in-person and virtual. All of these conversations are focused on steering the ship in the right direction.\n\nI've also learned to become more selfish with my time as I've risen in the company. Putting in 12-hour days just isn't what I want to be doing at this point in my career, and I don't want my teams to feel like they need to, either.\n\nMaintaining the flexibility of a hybrid schedule is a priority for us at Planview, which we prioritize across our teams. I try to lead by example, modeling the work-life balance that's so critical to preventing burnout and maintaining productivity and creativity.\n\nAs for older professionals, I'd like to emphasize that businesses do — really — see a lot of value in curating intergenerational teams. With age comes historical knowledge and insight into why certain processes are structured as they are; with youth, fresh eyes, ideas, and insights.\n\nTake it one step at a time, and through the route that feels right to you. That might mean taking an internship or contract role, joining a professional network in your field of interest, or finding a mentor who can vouch for you, as Billie Jean King did for me.\n\nIt's also critical to focus on your skills rather than your work history. All of your experiences, no matter how unrelated they may seem, can add value. Many of the more technical or field-specific details can be taught, but core capabilities such as relationship-building, time management, presentation and communication skills, and teamwork are more challenging to learn.\n\nTennis taught me risk management, strategic planning, and resilience, all of which I use every day in my work. Those soft skills are often what set you apart, especially in leadership.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - India proposes requiring smartphone makers to share source code with the government and make several software changes as part of a raft of security measures, prompting behind-the-scenes opposition from giants like Apple and Samsung.\n\nThe tech companies ​have countered that the package of 83 security standards, which would also include a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, ‌lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents.\n\nThe plan is part of Prime Minister Narendra ‌Modi's efforts to boost security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the world's second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones.\n\nIT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that \"any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind\", adding it was \"premature to read more into it\". A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.\n\nONGOING TUG OF WAR OVER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nApple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian ⁠industry group that represents the firms, did not respond ‌to requests for comment.\n\nIndian government requirements have irked technology firms before. Last month it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security ‍cameras over fears of Chinese spying.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung - whose phones use Google's Android operating system - hold 19% and 15%, respectively, of India's market share and Apple 5%, Counterpoint Research estimates.\n\nAmong the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code - the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly ​tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.\n\nThe Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to ‌block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to \"avoid malicious usage\".\n\n\"Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,\" said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.\n\nThe security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.\n\nCOMPANIES SAY SOURCE CODE REVIEW, ANALYSIS 'NOT POSSIBLE'\n\nSmartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China's request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and U.S. law enforcement has also tried and failed to ⁠get it.\n\nIndia's proposals for \"vulnerability analysis\" and \"source code review\" would require smartphone makers to perform a \"complete ​security assessment\", after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and ​analysis.\n\n\"This is not possible ... due to secrecy and privacy,\" MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. \"Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.\"\n\nMAIT asked the ministry last ‍week to drop the proposal, a source ⁠with direct knowledge said.\n\nThe Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.\n\nMAIT's ⁠document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone's battery and seeking government approval for software updates is \"impractical\" as they need to be issued promptly.\n\nIndia also wants the phone's logs - digital records ‌of its system activity - to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.\n\n\"There is not enough room on device to store ‌1-year log events,\" MAIT said in the document.",

    "title": "I'm a CEO who built a fantasy board of directors with AI versions of leaders like Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett",
    "description": "A tech CEO put together a dream board of directors with AI representing famous leaders. Here's how he uses it.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Matt Blumberg, a four-time technology CEO who now leads Markup AI, maker of an AI platform designed to help brands safely scale AI-generated content. He is based in New York City. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSince I run an AI company, I try to build AI agents and use AI as much as I can. In October, I got an idea to build what I call a fantasy board of directors from another CEO, and with his permission, I made a version of my own to use as a personal thought partner.\n\nWe have an actual human board, and it's fantastic. I get really good advice from them. But I wanted to use AI to create a fantasy board because mine is limited by the five people who are on it and the experiences that they have in life.\n\nSo the first thing my executive team and I did was create a fantasy draft. It's a bit of a play on fantasy football and fantasy basketball. But instead of it being a competitive thing, where each of us would draft our own teams, we drafted just one together.\n\nWe started by making a spreadsheet of essentially famous people, largely but not entirely, from the business world. We divided them into categories, including iconic business leaders, tech CEOs, VCs, authors, and thought leaders. We also had a category for different voices, such as Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.\n\nNext, we had something like a draft where we picked a couple of people from each category that we wanted on the board. We settled on about 15 names, including Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThere are also two people on it that I know. One is me. The other is Fred Wilson, a VC I've worked with for the past 25 years at other companies.\n\nFrom here, we had AI build 5,000-word profiles for each person, and we gave the AI a certain template to follow. We wanted the fantasy board members to be able to react to things as real board members would, with actual things they've said about how companies and boards perform.\n\nNext, we built the agent. We loaded all these profiles in and then wrote a really long instruction set about what we were trying to accomplish and what our company does. We also loaded materials from past board meetings, our quarterly business review decks, and other things that real board members would have at their disposal or in their heads.\n\nAll of this took maybe an hour or two.\n\nSo now the fantasy board exists, and I use it as a thought partner. For example, I will provide a draft of a board book before sending it to my actual board, and I'll say: These are materials for an upcoming meeting. What do you think of them? Are there topics you would have expected me to cover that I didn't? What questions am I likely to get back from our board? In return, I'll get really useful commentary.\n\nOne thing we put in the instruction set is that when I ask the board for its opinion, very generically, I want it to tell me the consensus opinion and notable outlying dissent with quotes of things that the fantasy board members have actually said.\n\nI'll also ask it for help with internal projects. I'll say things like: Hey, I'm doing a presentation for our kickoff meeting next week. What do you think are the top three themes I should hit?\n\nRecently, I asked my fantasy board to give me a performance review for 2025. It nailed it. The board called out the things that I would have said are my strengths and things that I would have said are problems. I sent the review to my executive team just as an FYI, and they all came back to me and said it was pretty impressive.\n\nI don't use the fantasy board every day, but I'm probably using it at least every other week for something. There are two big limitations. \n\nOne is that anything agentic is only as good as its inputs. My fantasy board only knows what I've told it about my business, or what's publicly available. It doesn't actually know what happens every day in the company. Even though I'm pretty good about feeding it information, it just doesn't have all the context.\n\nThe other limitation is that they're not real people. When you have a real board of directors, you have a real thought partner as a strategic advisor. If you have a board meeting, people are in a room together. They have body language. They have facial expressions. You can tell when they lean in, when they lean back. You can tell when they roll their eyes because they don't believe something you said. You can call them out on that.\n\nWith any AI agents, you need to be really careful not to believe the bullshit. They're predictive, and they're good, but not perfect. They're not human, and they miss a lot of cues.\n\nI told my real board about my fantasy board at our last meeting, which was in November, right after we built it. I explained what it was and how I've been using it. They thought it was great. A couple of them asked me afterward how I built it. They asked for a road map and said that they'd like to do something like it.\n\nThey viewed the fantasy board the same way I do, which is that it's a nice add-on, a sort of augmentation of thought partnership, but that it's never going to be a substitute for a real board.",

    "fullText": "Helen Mirren, 80, isn't buying into the fantasy of eternal youth.\n\nIn an interview with Elle published on Sunday, Mirren spoke about the tech industry's obsession with living forever and why trying to hack aging misses the point.\n\n\"To me, the word longevity is being active, proactive, and productive over a long period of one's life,\" Mirren told Elle. \"Living has to do with enjoying the physical elements of life; the beauty of nature; the excitement of professional success, if you're lucky enough to have it; and family and kids.\"\n\nTo her, longevity means \"contributing in as many diverse ways as possible, for as long as possible,\" she said.\n\nAt the end of the day, trying to beat aging becomes a distraction from living fully. Accepting life's limits, Mirren said, is simply part of growing up.\n\n\"Life is finite. There is no fighting that — as much as people like to put themselves into ice, hoping that they might wake up in 50 years. It's a dream and a fantasy. It's very strange to me. I don't call it growing old. I call it growing up. You constantly grow up through life. But the tech bros who cannot face the idea that they will get old and die just can't deal with it. I think it's so funny. They just haven't grown up yet,\" she said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Mirren has spoken about her views on aging. In October, she told Allure that she loves \"everything\" about growing older.\n\n\"Fuck it, I'm alive and I'm working and I can drink a glass of wine and I can wear makeup and I can listen to music and I can watch a beautiful sunset and I can go to the theater and I can watch a movie and I can binge Netflix and I can live life. It's a beautiful thing,\" she said.\n\nTo stay healthy, Mirren has long championed a 12-minute military workout developed in the 1950s by the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\nShe's also said that it's never too late to start moving, particularly for people in their 50s and 60s.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be joining a gym. It can be small changes like taking a short walk or practicing yoga, which I still enjoy,\" Mirren said.",

    "fullText": "Yet another data center will soon emerge near the Far Westside of San Antonio, according to a recent Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) filing. It's set to further the Lone Star State's reputation as a tech cluster.\n\nThe quaint town of Castroville, with a population of just over 3,000, will soon house a $400 million development owned by Microsoft. Online records show that the project, named SAT 82, will take up roughly 195,000 square feet in Medina County.\n\nAlthough it's only a one-story building, it will take nearly two years to build, according to the TDLR. Construction at the spot, 3580 FM 471 North, will begin on Thursday, August 13, 2026. A visit to the property revealed that equipment and a welcome poster were already on site. An open field, a two-lane road, and residential properties sit nearby.\n\nIn time, the structure will likely take on the look of a windowless warehouse. It may be hard for residents to get a clear glimpse of the center, as each contains extensive fencing around its perimeters for safety and security purposes, Microsoft's website states.\n\nSAT 82 joins six others in Medina County, according to the TDLR: SAT 80, SAT 81, SAT 89/90, SAT 93, SAT 94, and another with the title SAT 82, but with a different address.\n\nThe centers provide the infrastructure needed to open a phone application, join a virtual Zoom meeting, play an online game, and more. According to the company's website, they also allow the company's Azure cloud platform, AI, and collaboration tools to continue operating as normal.\n\nEarlier this fall, community members in a private Redbird Ranch neighborhood Facebook group voiced concerns over Microsoft's presence in the area. A few users worried the company's projects would worsen traffic. Others highlighted the massive amount of water that data centers use.\n\nIn a 2024 sustainability report, Microsoft said that its water consumption in 2023 - which includes but is not limited to data centers - increased by 1.7 billion gallons from the previous year, coming in at 2.1 billion gallons. The company attributed the increase to its business growth.\n\n\"Improvements as part of our Redmond campus modernization project are estimated to yield over 50% reduction in water use for new facilities,\" it continued in the report.\n\nConstruction on the property is expected to wrap up by 2028, according to the TDLR.\n\nThis article originally published at Microsoft bets $400M on tiny Texas town with new massive data center.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're discussing the proposed tax on billionaires that's dividing the tech elite.",
    "fullText": "California's billionaires are at a crossroads.\n\nOne of the biggest business stories kicking off the year is the proposed wealth tax in California. The state's rich and powerful, worth more than $1 billion, would face a one-time 5% tax on their assets if the plan gets approved.\n\nThe proposal, which aims to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit, has prompted plenty of grumbling among the California elite.\n\nAs Business Insider first reported, some have already taken action, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nPage converted his secretive family office out of California in late December and incorporated it in Delaware, according to my colleague Hugh Langley's exclusive reporting. Page also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures. He lists principal office addresses outside of California for those entities.\n\nSeparately, an entity tied to both Brin and Page moved out of California at the end of 2025.\n\nThe timing of these moves is crucial. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. Hence, the rush to move assets before the end of the year.\n\nBrin and Page are two of the richest people on the planet, with a combined net worth north of half a trillion dollars, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a very different tone. He said he's \"perfectly fine\" with the tax and gave no indication he plans to leave Silicon Valley, even if it costs him.\n\nOthers are more pessimistic. LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman called the proposal \"horrendous\" for innovation, warning that poorly designed wealth taxes don't raise reliable revenue — they push money and talent elsewhere.\n\nAlex Spiro, the celebrity lawyer who represents several billionaires, sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom last month warning that the tax would drive capital and innovation out of California.\n\nEarlier this month, White House AI Czar David Sacks predicted Austin would overtake San Francisco as the American tech hub. His social media post ricocheted throughout tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from traditionalists.\n\nWhere do you stand on the proposed billionaire's tax in California?

    "fullText": "Swedish producer is trying to to accelerate the process of extracting the elements vital for hi-tech products\n\nIt is deep winter with temperatures dropping to -20C. The sun never rises above the horizon, instead bathing Sweden’s most northerly town of Kiruna in a blue crepuscular light, or “civil twilight” as it is known, for two or three hours a day stretching visibility a few metres, notwithstanding heavy snow.\n\nBut 900 metres below the arctic conditions, a team of 20 gather every day, forgoing the brief glimpse of natural light and spearheading the EU’s race to mine its own rare earths. Despite identification of several deposits around the continent, and some rare earth refineries including Solvay in France, there are no operational rare earth mines in Europe.\n\nAcross the globe, the scramble for rare earths has become the source of huge geopolitical tension, with China accused last year by the EU of “weaponising” its near monopoly on raw materials and end products, essential for everything from smartphones, to electric cars, to fridges, music speakers and military jets.\n\nChina’s willingness to slap export bans on rare earths led to the vicious trade war with Donald Trump last year and is partly driving his current bid to take over Greenland, which is rich in these materials, now among the most precious in the world.\n\nEvery day the team at LKAB mine in Kiruna drive 4km (2.5 miles) down an impressive network of tunnels to get closer to what is known as the Per Geijer deposit of magnetite-hematite-phosphate named after the Swedish geologist who identified it more than 100 years ago.\n\nThe team are now operating at two levels – 900m and 1.3km deep underground as they try to connect the existing vast iron ore mine in Kiruna with Per Geijer about 2km away.\n\nUsing remote technology they drill a fan of 84 holes in the rock face; pump them with explosives which are then blasted between 1.15am and 1.45am every night, sometimes disturbing the inhabitants overground, and causing subsidence that has led to the state-owned compamy moving parts of the town and its church.\n\nLess than four hours later the team are back.\n\n“At 5am in the morning, when we have ventilated out the blasting fumes, we start the mucking out,” says 37-year-old Kiruna native Jim Lidström, who leads the tunnelling to what is one of Europe’s largest deposits of rare earths.\n\nOnce cleared, a separate team of men and women, sitting in a modern console centre 1.3k below ground, “scale” the rock, remotely controlling machines that break the detritus into transportable chunks for onward transport to a driverless train.\n\nLidström’s team then set about making the tunnel stable and usable, drilling bolts into the freshly made walls and then spraying it with a layer of concrete or “shotcrete” before the whole process starts all over again.\n\n“We do about five metres a day,” Lidström says.\n\nThe hunt for rare earths is slow.\n\nThe 17 rare earth elements – all found in Kiruna – include neodymium and praseodymium, critical materials for the powerful permanent magnets needed for everything from electric cars to household appliances and military jets.\n\nAlthough geological surveys show large ore bodies across the west – including the Fen complex in Norway, thought to be Europe’s largest deposit – from mine to refined end production could take 10 to 15 years, say experts.\n\n“I think people often miss the point. They say ‘why don’t we just produce rare earths in Europe?’. But you have to have the entire supply chain to do that,” says Nigel Steward, a professor at Imperial College London, a materials scientist and a former executive in the US mining industry.\n\nThe experience in Kiruna shows just how challenging it is to reduce the EU’s dependency on China, which is now the core supplier of rare earth magnets and willing to choke supplies, as it did last year, if politically desirable.\n\nState-owned LKAB is now trying to accelerate the process of mining, extraction, and separation of the crumbs from the ore, to help the EU de-risk as quickly as possible.\n\nJan Moström, the chief executive of LKAB, explains that it could take “years and years” if the company tried to expose the entire length of the Per Geijer deposit for mining purposes.\n\n“But that is not what we are going to do. What we are going to do is to open up incrementally,” he says.\n\nHe refuses to give a timeline because of its sensitivity, instead explaining the complex task ahead in the vast network of tunnels circling the deposit.\n\n“The main focus for us now in the Kiruna system is to find a mine design to deal with the mining of the present reserves down to the main level, at 1,365 metres , then to work out how we go beneath that and develop that resource into reserves, and also how to connect the Per Geijer deposit into the [existing iron ore mining] system. We will start to develop it incrementally, and that is the huge difference [from previous approaches],” he says.\n\nFor Moström, who has spent his career in mines, the last 11 with LKAB, the stranglehold Beijing has built in rare earths was no accident, and something he has been pressing home in Brussels repeatedly.\n\nAs the US and Europe started to regulate against toxic waste in the 1980s, China which had none of the environmental concerns, ploughed on charring the landscape as it went building a chokehold on raw materials now critical for modern life.\n\n“I’ve been talking in Brussels the past two or three years about the huge disadvantages we created in the 1970s and the 1980s when we closed the mining industry and started importing metals from South America, Africa, Australia,” he says.\n\nAsked why it has taken the EU so long to wake up to the dangers of dependency on China’s rare earth supply, he is blunt: “Politicians will never be more courageous than the voters.”\n\n“Nobody saw any future in mining, then the super-cycle started and China started to consume enormous volumes of metals,” he says referring to the boom at the turn of the century when China drove a huge commodities boom on the back of urbanisation.\n\n“I have the perception that the European Commission, the commissioners, really understand the importance of domestic mining and some sort of self-sufficiency,” Moström says.\n\nAs part of the acceleration efforts, LKAB has put €80m (£69m) into a new “demonstration” plant in nearby Luleå to test the process of separation before mining even begins. It has also taken a stake in the Norwegian company REEtec to develop an environmentally friendly way of refining the extract.\n\nContrary to what the name suggests, rare earths – a group of 17 soft metals with unique properties such as strong magnetismor high temperature resistance – are not rare.\n\nSpeckled like crumbs in the earth’s crust, the tag “rare” stuck because of the difficulty accessing them, mining them, and separating them from the ore in which they are found, a process that can take a decade.\n\nLKAB has already been visited by a line of Brussels dignitaries, including industry commissioner Stéphane Séjourné in September, because is represents the EU’s best current hope of weaning itself of a dependency on Chinese supplies that has left Europe vulnerable to increasing geopolitical tensions.\n\nDespite the rhetoric in Brussels, London and Washington over the need to wean industries off China, Beijing will hold the rare earth cards for years to come.\n\n“Right now China controls 85% of the final processing of light rare earths and it control 100% of the heavy rare earths,” says Darren Wilson, the chief executive of LKAB’s industrial minerals division.\n\nAccording to senior European Commission officials in December the EU uses 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets, a year of which 17,000 to 18,000 come from China, creating an unbalanced and high-risk trade relationship.\n\nLast April, in retaliation against Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, China imposed global export restrictions on rare earths, hitting Europe’s car industry. It threatened to impose more restrictions in October, until a 12-month truce was agreed with Trump at in Korea the same month.\n\nAs George Riddell, a senior adviser at Flint Global and a trade expert, says: “China has not just got the capacity to weaponise its trade but shown it has the willingness to do so.”\n\nAll hopes rest on LKAB now being the first to reduce the EU’s reliance on China, with a pre-existing highly developed mining operation employing about 2,000 workers directly and double that indirectly.\n\nMagnetic properties of some metals were discovered by the Greeks 4,000 years ago.\n\nPermanent magnets, found in speakers, headphones, toys, cars and military equipment are typically manufactured from a neodymium-iron-boron alloy.\n\nThe process begins by melting suitable raw materials, placing them into a mould that is then chilled, resulting in a powder. All the particles have then to align in the right direction to create a powerful magnetic force. The powder is sintered in a furnace, bonding the particles together into a mass that is then cut for final use.\n\nPermanent magnets were developed in the research department of the General Motors Company in the US and by the Japanese materials scientist Masato Sagawa in the 1980s.\n\nBut making these powerful magnets generates radioactive byproducts that can contaminate water and soil.\n\nAs the west introduced environmental regulations in the 1980s, US rare earth suppliers “started exporting their product to China because they were willing to process it,” says Imperial College London’s Steward.\n\nGM is now working with Mountain Pass, the only operational rare earth mine in the US, which is thought to be about two years away from producing products for the American market.\n\n“There is no reason why we can’t remake magnets. They were our inventions, in the west. That is the crazy thing,” Steward says.",

    "fullText": "Zurich-based firm taps into latest robot tech to ‘fibre-spray’ high-end sports shoes worn by the likes of Roger Federer\n\nA robot leg whirs around in a complex ballet as an almost invisible spray of “flying fibre” builds a hi-tech £300 sports shoe at its foot.\n\nThis nearly entirely automated process – like a sci-fi future brought to life – is part of the gameplan from On, the Swiss sports brand that is taking on the sector’s mighty champions Nike and Adidas with a mix of technology and chutzpah.\n\nThe brand is expanding rapidly after teaming up with the former tennis pro Roger Federer to create shoes suitable for the Swiss star’s sport and a mix of fashion-led collaborations including with the luxury brand LOEWE, actor Zendaya and singers FKA twigs and Burna Boy. In China, sales have doubled year-on-year. Growth has been strong in the US and mainland Europe and this month On will open its fourth London store, in Kensington.\n\n“We’re an innovation brand at heart,” says its co-founder, David Allemann, “because we are really going for the long run.”\n\nHe’s speaking from On’s Zurich head office, which has the vibe of a tech firm or luxe gym with light-filled spaces and quirky design features from the spiral staircase and workout room to a hanging fossilised tree.\n\nAllemann says the company’s inspirations are disruptors such as Apple and Dyson. These two brands were on the “mood board” when On was set up as they combine “unique design” with “innovation in terms of user-experience or technology”.\n\nAllemann, a former McKinsey consultant, ditched his job in 2010 as marketing boss of the furniture brand Vitra to start On with a former McKinsey colleague, Caspar Coppetti, and the Swiss Ironman world champion and triathlete Olivier Bernhard.\n\nBernhard’s idea was for a shoe that would protect his body from the impact of long-distance running but also promote speed. The original prototype, developed by Bernhard, an inventive individual as well as a committed sportsman, started out with sections of hose-pipe glued to the bottom of an old pair of trainers.\n\nThe three friends, all keen runners, tried out early versions together and put about £600,000 of their life savings into launching the company. They ordered 1,200 pairs of shoes, which they sold at running meets before convincing some specialist retailers to place orders.\n\nIn 2021, the trio floated the brand on the New York Stock Exchange at a value of $8bn (£5.95bn) , raising almost $750m for the business and netting them about $120m in cash while keeping a large stake in the business. This year they expect to sell 30m pairs. The brand is now worth $16bn.\n\nAfter their innovative design took off, On developed the LightSpray flying fibre technology after a team member met a young student, Johannes Voelchert, at a design fair in 2019. The company decided to fund him for a year to develop his vision, which was inspired by a glue gun used to make Halloween spider-web decorations.\n\n“We said: hey, he’s crazy, but we like that because Olivier was crazy as well,” says Allemann.\n\nVoelchert is now part of a team of hundreds of research and technology experts, from more than 90 countries and numerous industry backgrounds, helping to develop new ideas for On in Zurich with a particular eye on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\n“We call that the explorer spirit,” says Allemann.\n\nThe idea is to foster innovation and creativity so that, even as a bigger company employing 4,000 people around the world, the whole business, from designers to manufacturers, can take risks on ideas without necessarily knowing the final outcome. “We’re still able to set sail without exactly knowing where we’re arriving without calling home the next day,” Allemann says.\n\nAllemann adds that On is now seeing the benefit of “many little sprouts that now are growing up”, from its move into different sports – such as outdoor training and tennis – to its development of apparel and the opening of retail stores.\n\nThe small brand may control just 1% of the $450bn global sportswear market, according to GlobalData, but it is expanding rapidly.\n\nOn plays in the premium market with its shoes starting from about £120, excluding seasonal promotions, up to £495. That compares with Nike, which runs from £60 to £290, and Adidas, from £40 to £450.\n\nDespite high-end purchases coming under pressure from cost of living increases, sales for the brand are on track to increase by just over a third to hit nearly 3bn Swiss Francs (£2.8bn) this year. On says it has grabbed as much as a fifth of the running shoe market in the UK and other European countries.\n\nIt faces some heavyweight competition. On is just one-tenth the size of Nike, which holds about 14% of the global sportswear market, according to industry analysts GlobalData, with Adidas on 9%. However, both have faced difficulties in recent years, creating space for new challenges including On, Hoka and revitalised old brands such as New Balance or Onitsuka Tiger, now owned by ASICS.\n\nThe company also faced a class action lawsuit last year in the US, where customers claimed its shoes make a “noisy and embarrassing squeak”. Its “CloudTec” trainers, designed with holes to feel like “running on clouds” – were criticised on social media over the noise. On said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.\n\nOn’s Cloudboom Strike LS laceless shoe, which is made by just nine robots in Zurich and costs £310, has already won the attention of running enthusiasts after the Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri won this year’s New York and last year’s Boston marathon. She also took a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in a pair.\n\nIn Zurich, the robots in their lab-like room are still outnumbered by humans, who monitor their work and complete the final process. Most of the brand’s footwear is made in traditional factories in Asia. But this year On is aiming to open its first robot-led factory to create a more accessible version of the shoe, the upper half of which is made from a single nearly one mile-long filament of thermoplastic polyurethane in just three minutes. Traditionally, a shoe takes several humans hours of work.\n\nThe factory’s location has not yet been decided, but will be close to one of its main retail markets, with the long-term aim of producing on every continent. That would be a dramatic change from today’s industry, which is largely based in Asia, particularly Vietnam and China.\n\nAllemann says local manufacturing is attractive as it has “a huge advantage from a sustainability point of view, because you don’t have to ship shoes around the world, but also from an agility to market point of view – you can produce much faster, according to what people want”.\n\nHe says LightSpray shoes have a 75% lower CO2 footprint than an ordinary sports shoe, which plays to On’s aim to create more sustainable and recyclable kit.\n\nRetail expansion is also a big part of the story. The latest London opening will make the UK capital its biggest retail centre, with plans for as many as seven in future. It is now part of a global portfolio of 60 outlets, with plans for up to 25 more a year despite the rise of online selling.\n\n“We feel there’s still a lot of potential in retail, if done right. City centres are still a very important place for society, and shopping and sports are an important ingredient to that.”\n\nWith those in their late teens, 20s and 30s keen on sport, particularly training and running, Allemann says the shops “are not just stores but also community hubs where running clubs start”.\n\nHe believes On will continue to expand because participating in sport brings people together in a way the online world cannot.\n\n“Running and sports, that’s such an important part of your life that we see consumers are willing to invest in great performance, innovation and better feel, but also in great design and what that tells us about them.”",

    "description": "Below are key security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, prompting opposition from tech",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Below are key security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, prompting ​opposition from tech companies, according to four sources, as well as industry and government ‌documents seen by Reuters.\n\nManufacturers must test and provide proprietary source code for review by government-designated labs to ‌identify vulnerabilities in phone operating systems that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nIndustry group MAIT, which represents Apple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi, has told the government this is \"not possible\" due to corporate secrecy and global privacy policies.\n\nBACKGROUND PERMISSION RESTRICTIONS:\n\nApps cannot access cameras, microphones or location services in ⁠the background when phones are inactive. ‌Continuous status bar notifications are required when these permissions are active.\n\nManufacturers say this lacks any global precedent and there is no specific test method ‍prescribed.\n\nDevices must periodically display warnings prompting users to review all app permissions, with continuous notifications. Companies say notice should be limited to \"highly critical\" permissions.\n\nDevices must store security audit logs, including ​app installations and login attempts, for 12 months.\n\nMAIT argues consumer phones lack the storage capacity ‌for a year of data.\n\nPhones must periodically scan for malware and identify potentially harmful applications.\n\nManufacturers warn that constant on-device scanning significantly drains the battery and slows hardware performance.\n\nOPTION TO REMOVE PRE-INSTALLED APPS:\n\nAll pre-installed apps bundled with the phone operating system, except those essential for basic phone functions, must be deletable.\n\nCompanies argue many apps are critical system components that cannot be ⁠removed.\n\nINFORMING GOVERNMENT OF MAJOR UPDATES:\n\nPhone makers must notify a ​government organisation before releasing any major updates or security ​patches.\n\nManufacturers argue this is \"impractical\" because security fixes must be released quickly to protect users from active exploits, while government delays could leave users vulnerable.\n\nDevices ‍must detect if phones have ⁠been rooted or \"jailbroken\", where users bypass built-in security restrictions, and display continuous warning banners to recommend corrective measures.\n\nCompanies say there is no reliable mechanism to detect jailbreaking.\n\nPhones ⁠must permanently block installation of older software versions, even if officially signed by the manufacturer, to prevent security ‌downgrades.\n\nThere is no global standard related to this requirement, manufacturers say.",

By targeting core digital infrastructure, our investments scale across many sectors and benefit a broad range of users. Improving the security, stability, and reusability of open software components directly enhances the productivity, competitive edge, and capacity for innovation of startups and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe open source ecosystem, while incredibly successful, is also increasingly fragile. Many more people are using the software than contributing to it. It is time to invest in digital commons, volunteer communities and the open source ecosystem to build the digital world we want to see. We are working to strengthen the self-determined use of digital technologies and systems by individuals, industry, and governments.\n\nTo prepare an application, we ask that you review and consider all information regarding the selection criteria and the subsequent process. Applications are accepted exclusively through our application platform.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot provide prior advice on whether a project generally falls under our objectives. If you would like to apply for support for a project, please first check thoroughly whether all the criteria listed below apply.\n\nSubmission through our application system: submissions must be completed through the online application portal. No supplemental materials should be sent via email or any other form of communication at this time.\n\nCompleteness: applications must be completed in German or English. The questions must be answered to a degree that allows us to assess and evaluate the applications.\n\nProposed activities: the activities listed in the application must be related to developing or maintaining open digital base technologies. Development is our primary focus, although security audits, conference attendance, and other community-based events can be included in the application should they be necessary.\n\nEstimated costs: The cost of the work described in the application must exceed €50,000 (current minimum).\n\nPublic financing: Projects are not eligible to receive financing or work commissions from the Sovereign Tech Fund if other public entities are already making or have made grants or investments for the same proposed activities.\n\nFOSS: all code and documentation to be supported must be licensed such that it may be freely reusable, changeable, and redistributable. OSI-approved or FSF Free/Libre licenses are acceptable for code. Creative-Commons-like licenses for documentation may not include non-commercial or “no derivative” clauses.\n\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund invests in open digital base technologies that are vital to the development of other software or enable digital networking. We invest in projects that benefit and strengthen the open source ecosystem. Examples include libraries for programming languages, package managers, open implementations of communication protocols, administration tools for developers, digital encryption technologies, and more. We do not finance the development of prototypes. Our currently funded projects show the range and type of technologies that characterize open digital base technologies.\n\nWe are currently not looking for user-facing applications, such as messaging apps or file storage services. If this changes, we will announce it here.\n\nThese are the criteria we use to review all projects that fulfill the basic requirements:\n\nA technology is prevalent when it is widely used for or within other technologies.\n\nA technology is relevant if it is significant for one or more important societal sectors, e.g., education, health care, energy sector, industry.\n\nA technology is vulnerable if important work – to keep the quality of the project or to enhance it – is not (sufficiently) funded by other actors or cannot be completed for other structural reasons.\n\nThere are benefits for society or critical sectors of society (e.g., education, health care, energy, industry) by funding the technology.\n\nWe evaluate the work that is planned in the proposed project. For example, we examine the feasibility and overall impact of the activities described in the proposal.\n\nThe applicants, their organization, or community demonstrate that they have the necessary knowledge, insight, and technological skills to do the proposed work. They are either a recognized part of the community around the technology, or they have the endorsement of that community or the maintainer.\n\nLastly, the evaluation is guided by our strategy and mission. That is, from start to finish, we look at how the project fits into the Sovereign Tech Agency’s mission and contributes to the goal of sustainably strengthening the open source ecosystem in the public interest.\n\nCreate an account to submit an application. Please note that you will only receive a submission confirmation from us if you agreed to receive emails or SMS from us when you registered.

    "title": "I review TVs for a living, and these are the new models and display trends I'm most excited about in 2026",
    "description": "Samsung, TCL, Hisense, and LG all revealed new TVs at CES 2026. Here are the top display models and tech advancements announced at the show.",
    "fullText": "The CES trade show is the premier event for showcasing extravagant new consumer tech concepts and prototypes. This year's show, held in Las Vegas from January 6 to 9, was no different. But mixed in with all the spectacle were plenty of announcements for products you'll actually be able to buy, including an assortment of brand-new TVs.\n\nI've been reviewing home theater gear for over a decade, so I know that not every display breakthrough sticks. With that in mind, I've separated the real upgrades from the marketing fog to find the top TVs and display trends from CES. And this year, one takeaway is clear: TV brands are pushing Micro RGB. This type of display promises a significant upgrade in color performance. At the same time, OLED makers are coming out swinging with brighter panels, and brands are continuing to expand their extra-large screen offerings with TVs as big as 130 inches.\n\nBelow, I've detailed the top five TV advancements I'm most excited about from CES, outlining a few clear themes that could shape what you'll be shopping for in 2026. Though exact pricing and release dates are still pending, all of the TVs highlighted below are expected to be available this year. For more display recommendations, be sure to visit my complete guide to all of the best TVs you can buy right now.\n\nIf I had to pick one trend to represent the TV industry's biggest push for 2026, it would be Micro RGB. Samsung, Hisense, LG, and TCL are all offering some variation of this technology, and it dominated the announcements out of CES.\n\nMicro RGB TVs, also called RGB Mini LED TVs by some companies, are a type of LED TV that use a new kind of backlighting system designed to offer a big boost in color performance. Rather than using a backlight with white or blue light and then relying on a filter to produce colors, Micro RGB TVs have individual red, blue, and green LEDs. Hisense is taking this approach even further by adding cyan to certain models. Using a backlight system like this enables purer color production and a wider range of hues. At the end of the day, this should translate to a more colorful and brighter image than you'd see on a typical LED, QLED, Mini LED, or OLED TV.\n\nThe first two Micro RGB TVs from Samsung and Hisense actually hit the market last year, but they were limited to a 116-inch and 115-inch model that cost a staggering $30,000 each. Though pricing hasn't been confirmed yet, brands are releasing a bigger lineup of Micro RGB TVs this year, with sizes starting at 55 inches. This is exciting since it should translate to much more affordable options. Most notably, shoppers should keep an eye on the Samsung R85H series, the Hisense UR8 and UR9 series, and the TCL RM9L Series, which have the best chance of featuring this new tech at consumer-friendly prices.\n\nAlthough most brands are promoting Micro RGB as the next big thing in TV technology, TCL is taking a different approach. The company is still releasing Micro RGB models this year, but it's positioning a different kind of TV as its flagship offering. TCL refers to this display type as \"SQD,\" which stands for Super Quantum Dots.\n\nIn essence, SQD TVs are an evolution of QLED TVs. They still use white or blue backlights but incorporate a layer of super quantum dot crystals, which are larger than the standard type, along with an Ultra Color Filter. That's a lot of tech jargon, but in practice, TCL says this combination results in colors that rival or surpass those of Micro RGB TVs while avoiding potential flaws that RGB backlight systems can introduce. SQD TVs can also get incredibly bright, with TCL stating that its premium model can reach up to 10,000 nits, which would match the highest brightness that any consumer TV has achieved.\n\nTCL's first SQD TV, the X11L, is already available for preorder in an 85-inch size ($8,000). A 75-inch ($7,000) and 98-inch ($10,000) size are also set to launch soon. Though far from cheap, those prices aren't unreasonable for a new high-end TV technology, and TCL is known for offering huge discounts throughout the year. Likewise, SQD technology will also be used on the brand's step-down QM8L and QM7L, which are expected to be released later this year and will likely cost substantially less.\n\nI'll be reviewing the X11L soon, so check back for full details on its performance.\n\nThough I'm excited to check out new Micro RGB and SQD TVs this year, it's important not to forget about OLEDs. The best OLED TVs remain some of the most impressive displays you can buy, and I don't see that changing in 2026. Both LG and Samsung announced new flagship OLED models that promise boosts in brightness and new design perks.\n\nThe LG G6 will succeed the G5, which was my favorite high-end TV of 2025. LG says the G6 can get 20% brighter than the G5. Since the G5 was already the brightest OLED available, that's a notable improvement. The G6 will also boast improved reflection handling via a new polarizer filter, which LG says will cut reflections in half while maintaining deep black levels. Reflections have been a pain point for some LG OLED buyers, so this could be a big perk. LG is also bringing back its striking Wallpaper OLED in the form of the new LG W6. This ultra-thin TV is only 9mm thick and uses a wireless connection box to keep your wall free from cables.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung is launching the S95H as the successor to its S95F. Samsung says this new model can get 35% brighter than the S95F, which could make it even brighter than the G6. In addition, the TV uses a new metal art-style bezel that gives it a look \n\nUltimately, I expect new Micro RGB and SQD TVs to have an edge in color and brightness over top OLEDs, but the G6 and S95H will deliver higher contrast, which could still result in better overall image quality. Time will tell, but I'm excited to see how the latest premium OLEDs stack up against 2026's other new TV offerings.\n\nOver the last few years, TV brands have been expanding their extra-large screen offerings, with an increasing number of 75-inch and larger options. In 2025, we saw more 98-, 100-, 115-, and 116-inch models than ever before. That trend will continue in 2026, and some brands are taking it even further with massive 130-inch screens.\n\nSamsung's 130-inch R95H is the most notable super-sized TV set to be released this year. This is Samsung's flagship Micro RGB model, so it should offer some of the most impressive brightness and color capabilities of any TV in 2026. And it will offer that incredible performance in an absolutely massive screen size. It also boasts a unique stand that Samsung calls its \"Timeless Frame\" design, which makes it appear as though the TV is floating within the stand that surrounds it. Pricing details have not been revealed, but I expect this one to be exclusive to luxury buyers.\n\nAlso of special note is a new 98-inch Samsung LS03H Frame TV, the largest Frame TV the brand has ever produced. Frame TVs are popular for their art-style designs with thin wall mounts and magnetic bezels. However, unlike previous Frame models, this new 98-inch option will have its ports built into the TV, rather than using a separate box. It will also come with a bezel rather than requiring buyers to purchase one separately.\n\nSamsung's Frame TVs are popular displays for design-focused shoppers, and brands like Hisense and TCL both offer their own take on art-style TVs. At CES 2026, LG revealed its own entry into the frame TV market with the new Gallery TV.\n\nThe Gallery TV features all the essentials that other art-inspired sets offer, including the ability to mount flush on your wall, an anti-glare screen to help mimic the look of canvas, and support for magnetic bezel attachments, allowing you to alter the frame style. LG is also launching a new Gallery+ service with access to more than 4,500 works of art, pieces of animation, and other images. The Gallery TV will use a Mini LED panel, but it's not clear if it will have any kind of dimming capabilities. Based on what has been announced so far, it appears poised to compete with Samsung's higher-end Frame Pro model.\n\nAlthough the Gallery TV with frame is unlikely to substantially outperform any existing frame-style TVs in overall image quality, the arrival of another art-focused TV is an exciting development for design-focused shoppers seeking more options. Pricing is still pending, but the Gallery TV with frame will be available in 55- and 65-inch sizes later this year.",

    "fullText": "China has a message for US tech firms: Hands off our AI talent and tech.\n\nThat's what Beijing is signalling by announcing a probe into Meta's acquisition of Manus, analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThe probe, confirmed by China's Ministry of Commerce in a Thursday press conference, will investigate whether the acquisition complies with the country's laws and regulations concerning export controls, according to a statement translated by Google.\n\nManus was launched in China last March by the AI product studio Butterfly Effect and drew global attention after saying it had designed a \"general-purpose\" AI agent that can conduct tasks with limited human supervision. In mid-2025, the startup relocated to Singapore.\n\nIn December, Meta announced that it would acquire Manus and sever its ties with China completely. The deal reportedly exceeds $2 billion. Meta did not respond to a request for comment for this story from Business Insider.\n\nWhile China and the US have long engaged in tit-for-tat regulatory exchanges involving their tech companies, analysts told Business Insider this probe is notable because it appears to be aimed at discouraging so-called \"Singapore washing\" — the process of moving a company from China to Singapore to reduce regulatory scrutiny.\n\nTikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and fast-fashion giant Shein are among those that have shifted their headquarters from China to Singapore.\n\nThe probe is also a means to discourage Chinese AI startups from choosing the US, analysts said.\n\n\"I see Beijing's probe as an effort to prevent the loss of AI technology and talent to foreign acquisition, especially to the US,\" Wendy Chang, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta said it plans to bring over Manus' top leadership and will continue to run its AI agent platform separately, alongside integrating the technology into Meta's own products.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company, has been the subject of US export controls for years, which limit the sale of its advanced chips to China. The Manus probe shows how the battleground has moved from beyond chips to \"models, agents, talent, and enterprise deployment,\" Murthy Grandhi, a company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, told Business Insider.\n\nHanna Dohmen, senior research analyst at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, told Business Insider that while the probe \"isn't entirely surprising,\" the approach regulators are taking is \"more novel\" because it \"appears to focus on the movement of talent and IP.\"\n\nTalent has become a focal point of the AI race, with companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google offering huge pay packages to entice the best and brightest. Last year, Meta invested $14 billion in AI training startup Scale AI, bringing its CEO, Alexandr Wang, over to run the tech giant's AI efforts.\n\nChina's Manus probe could signal that it was policing \"outbound AI technology transfer with greater rigor,\" said Grandhi, adding that it could accelerate the \"bifurcation of AI ecosystems.\"\n\nThe US and China have been taking diverging approaches to AI, with Chinese companies tending to favor AI models that are more open, such as DeepSeek.\n\nIt's not clear how long China's probe will last, should it progress into a full investigation. Other investigations from China's Ministry have taken more than a year.\n\nGrandhi said that in his view, the most likely outcome is that the deal will be approved \"with constraints, rather than an outright block.\"\n\n\"Whatever the outcome may be, this certainly sends a signal to other US or foreign companies that are considering similar acquisitions,\" added Dohmen.",

    "description": "Michelle Hu, owner of Étoile, shares how learning from her failed beauty tech app led to Étoile's over $9 milion revenue last year.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michelle Hu, a 30-year-old business owner based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy first business died as quickly as it started.\n\nIn 2017, I was working as an investment banking analyst at Citi when I launched Mei, a beauty app where users could filter through and book appointments with makeup artists, hair stylists, and more. It was a one-year process of trying to scale and pouring in about $30,000 in the process, but we ultimately never launched.\n\nIn the meantime, I was selling handmade acrylic makeup holders online under the brand name Étoile. Mei failed, but I saw Étoile gaining traction on its own. I realized it could take off — and it did.\n\nTwo years later, I quit my job and went all in on Étoile. I transformed it into a world for beauty enthusiasts, crafting accessories that elevate daily rituals. We made over $9 million in revenue last year and recently launched our products in nearly 30 Anthropologie stores across the US.\n\nHere's what I learned from my failed business that helped me the second time around.\n\nI was so in love with the beauty industry that I jumped right in with Mei, but I had no tech background and no idea what really went into building an app. I remember thinking the idea of creating this techy business app sounded cool, but it just wasn't a fit for my skill set or interests. I had no business creating an app.\n\nWhen time's got hard, and the app required more time, energy, and money than I bargained for, I didn't have the passion for my product to drive me. Starting Étoile, a consumer product business, felt a lot more aligned with me.\n\nI learned it's important to start a business in an industry you love, because when things get difficult, you need the passion to fuel you. I'm not passionate about tech, but I am passionate about designing products. That passion fuels me to work through the hurdles.\n\nI now realize that I never had product-market fit with Mei. Most people text or DM to book makeup artists or hairstylists, and I learned the hard way that it's difficult to change consumer behavior.\n\nMy initial vision for Étoile was for it to be an \"everything store\" for beauty, featuring items such as ring lights and vanity tables. However, our customer base was fragmented.\n\nThat's when I took what I learned from Mei and scaled back on items that weren't driving a significant amount of revenue, focusing on what worked: our travel range of products. Since then, we've developed a strong customer base that's excited about our product. I can feel the difference between having headwinds in the business versus having tailwinds.\n\nWhen we hit that product-market fit magic, everything seemed to move a lot more efficiently in the business.\n\nI think the biggest financial mistake I made was not vetting the people we chose to build the app. It sounds silly because it seems so obvious, but I think I was just so new to the world of business and thought, \"If they've made one app before, then they can make any app.\"\n\nWe hired college students from around the world and basically threw money at them without meeting them or vetting them. We couldn't afford people with a strong portfolio, so we just filtered through others who were just as scrappy as us. I didn't realize there was such a big scope of different app developers.\n\nI've always lived by the saying, \"move fast and break things,\" but when you're spending so much money to hire people, do more research.\n\nI think hiring is still a tricky one. The thing that helps is that we have a much bigger budget than we did with Mei. The people we choose to work with have a strong portfolio of brands that they've previously worked with. I think bigger budgets have allowed for better opportunities.\n\nWhen I shut down Mei, I had to admit that things weren't working and even learn to be OK with failure.\n\nAt the start of Étoile, I held onto our product strategy so tightly, even when it wasn't working. My thought process was that we had our products ready to go, stored in a warehouse, and marketed to our audience, so I thought it would be a bad look to pull back on them, even when they weren't working.\n\nWhen I finally made the shift and pulled back on items like mirrors and tables, the business made a complete 180. It reaffirmed that it's important to admit when things aren't working and not to have so much pride when it comes to my business.\n\nDo you have a story to share about lessons learned from a failed business?

    "description": "From a lollipop that lets you taste sound to a Tamagotchi style AI pet that physically grows, here are the coolest tech you could get your hands on.",
    "fullText": "This lollipop lets you taste your favorite music — literally.\n\nUsing bone induction technology, Lollipop Star made a candy that can transmit sound through vibrations in the jaw and skull while it's in the mouth. For those without synesthesia, this may be the closest you can come to experiencing it.\n\nAccording to Lollipop Star's website, the candy is designed with a standard lollipop on top of a thicker handle at the bottom, which houses the electronics. Users could bite down lightly on the candy to activate the vibrations. Earplugs are included to help isolate the sound in noisy environments.\n\nBased on photos from Lollipop Star's booth at the CES, each candy is tied to a specific artist and flavor. For example, Ice Spice's version comes in peach, Akon's is blueberry, and Armani White's is lime.\n\nOn its website, the company says that the novelty candy will come at an affordable price of $9 each.\n\nThe Tamagotchi of the AI era is here.\n\nA new AI pet from Chinese startup Takway AI, called Sweekar, debuted in the US at CES. Unlike most AI companions that exist entirely virtually, this creature has a physical form that appears to grow.\n\nBased on demo videos, the Sweekar starts out as a palm-sized, egg-shaped device with glowing ears. After an incubation period that can last up to two days, the shell appears to crack open, revealing a newborn digital creature.\n\nFrom there, Sweekar moves through a series of life stages. The baby phase lasts roughly five to seven days, followed by a teenage stage that can stretch from about three to six weeks. Eventually, the pet reaches adulthood, developing greater intelligence and a more defined personality, as well as more independence.\n\nEarly in its life, the pet requires frequent attention, including regular care and help learning basic language. Just like a Tamagotchi, Sweekar can die from neglect.\n\nTakway AI said in a press release that it plans to launch Sweekar on Kickstarter later this year. The company expects the device to be priced at around $150.\n\nVacuum cleaning robots are taking a major step up.\n\nRoborock's Saros Rover prototype became the first robot vacuum to climb stairs at CES. Based on demo videos, the prototype robot vacuum uses a pair of articulated wheel-legs that lift and lever its body up, before folding away and redeploying for the next step.\n\nThe process isn't fast, according to demo videos, but the Rover cleans the stairs as it goes. Roborock said in a press release that the system works on traditional, curved, and carpeted staircases, as well as ramps, thresholds, and other household obstacles.\n\nThe Saros Rover remains an early prototype, and Roborock hasn't shared pricing or a launch timeline. The company has said in a press release, however, that it plans to bring the stair-climbing robot vacuum to market.\n\nLenovo showcased numerous concept devices at CES 2026, but one of its boldest ideas was a gaming laptop featuring a screen that physically expands wider.\n\nThe Legion Pro Rollable, as Lenovo described in a press release, is built around a 16-inch flexible OLED display that can expand sideways to two larger sizes. From photos, the device appears to have a screen screen stretches from a standard 16:10 aspect ratio to 21:9 or an ultra-wide 24:9, effectively turning a compact gaming laptop into a widescreen display better suited for immersive games.\n\nAccording to Lenovo, the Legion Pro has the same lower chassis, ports, and supports high-end graphics, just like some of Lenovo's other products. The rollable device was named Best Gaming Product in the Official Best of CES 2026 Awards, though Lenovo has not announced plans to turn it into a retail device.\n\nAI-Tails is betting that AI can spot health issues in cats long before their owners do.\n\nAt CES, the Swiss startup has unveiled a smart feeding and drinking station that uses AI, cameras, and pattern-recognition software to analyze a cat's behavior and facial expressions, signals that are often too subtle for humans to notice without veterinary expertise. The company's website said that the goal is to monitor a pet's well-being continuously and flag potential problems in real time.\n\nVideos of a live demo at CES show that the system features separate bowls for food and water. with built-in sensors and cameras, analyze consumption patterns, body temperature, and facial cues.\n\nThe feeding station is currently available for preorder and is expected to ship worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2026, according to the company's website. The models are expected to be priced between $199 and $299.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says saving for retirement will be \"irrelevant\" if he's right about what the future holds.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO predicted AI would help create an \"abundance\" of resources for all.\n\nPeople would have \"whatever stuff they want\" and access to superb healthcare and education, he said.\n\nSaving for retirement has been a cornerstone of personal finance for well over a century. It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said. That would mean \"better medical care than anyone has today, available for everyone within five years,\" he continued. \"No scarcity of goods and services. You can learn anything you want about anything for free.\"\n\nHowever, the serial entrepreneur warned of a \"bumpy\" transition to this utopian world, marked by jarring change and social unrest. He also flagged a potential loss of purpose.\n\n\"Now, if you actually get all the stuff you want, is that actually the future you want?\" he asked. '\"Because it means that your job won't matter.\"\n\nMusk is known for transforming the auto sector with Tesla's electric vehicles, and revolutionizing the aerospace industry with SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nHis companies are developing self-driving cars, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces, AI assistants, and other innovations as he paves his way to becoming the first trillionaire in history.\n\nDespite his track record, Musk's latest prediction clashes hard with the reality faced by many Americans. Years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and anemic wage growth have created an affordability crisis.\n\nMillions of people feel priced out of getting a college degree, accessing quality healthcare, owning a home, or having children. A comfortable retirement also feels out of reach, with surveys showing the majority of Americans aren't saving nearly enough.",

    "description": "Robotaxi reporter Lloyd Lee breaks down what he saw — and heard — on the ground at the world's largest consumer tech show, CES, in Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The race to dominate the robotaxi space may not be as close as some companies suggest.\n\nLloyd Lee, Business Insider's reporter covering robotaxis and emerging mobility tech, went to CES for the first time to check out the autonomous service from Zoox, Vay, and other providers. Lee, who has taken a few rides with robotaxis recently entering the market, said the experience sharpened his view that one company appears to be significantly ahead — and that the industry still faces major hurdles before the vehicles can truly go mainstream.\n\nIn the Q&A below with BI News Chief Steve Russolillo, Lee breaks down his biggest takeaways from CES, the most impressive tech he saw, and how the experience will shape his coverage in the year ahead.\n\nSteve Russolillo: Lloyd, this is your first time at CES. What are your impressions and biggest takeaways from the event?\n\nLloyd Lee: First, CES is a massive event. It is humanly impossible to stop by every booth no matter how militant you are with your time. Second, I was struck by how much space the convention was dedicated to automobility. I agree with what Paul Costa, a 25-year Apple veteran who worked on the company's self-driving car project and is now at Ford, told me: CES has become a car show as much as it remains a tech show.\n\nRussolillo: What's the craziest and wildest piece of new technology that you saw?\n\nLee: Hyundai Motor Group's booth had a really impressive display of how far it's trying to take autonomy — from EV charging stations and robotaxis to robotic arms and humanoid robots. Boston Dynamics, a Hyundai unit, demoed its Atlas humanoid robot at the booth. Just the way it activates and stands up is terrifying and awe-striking at the same time.\n\nRussolillo: You cover robotaxis for BI and had the opportunity to test drive two different robotaxis this week. What stood out to you the most?\n\nLee: I tried two robotaxi services for the first time, including Amazon's Zoox. There are obviously a lot of smart people working on this technology. But I have to say: Trying those services only made me realize 1.) how far ahead Waymo is or at least appears to be, and 2.) just how difficult it is to make a profitable business case for robotaxis right now.\n\nGetting autonomous driving right is only part of the challenge. There's also the operations side — like fleet scaling and management — that Waymo has had to build up to help make robotaxis feel like a real autonomous ride-hailing service you can use in your day-to-day. (That is if you live in the city Waymo operates.) And even then, we know Waymo is burning money on its service.\n\nRussolillo: What are some of the predictions you've heard from sources about tech, AI and business?\n\nLee: Chris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte with expertise in software-defined vehicles, had a few interesting points.\n\nRussolillo: What startup you never heard before really stole the show and impressed you?\n\nLee: Perhaps less stole the show, but I thought Vay, a German startup developing a driverless car rental service, reminded me that there's still room for some contrarian voices in the driverless space. Remote driving is the big bogeyman for robotaxi companies. You don't want to be caught using it. This startup's entire business model is built around it. Vay is using remote driving — with a potential to pursue autonomy in the future — for a small fraction of the overall driving experience: Getting the car delivered to a renter without a human inside. It was a \"Huh, I never thought about that\" moment.\n\nRussolillo: What did you learn that might change how you go about your tech coverage for BI?\n\nLee: Broadly, emerging technologies like humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and, more generally, AI, contain a lot of unknowns and uncertainties. And company leaders in those spaces can be evasive when you ask for specifics, or they simply don't know the answer. Possibly both. My instinct is to resolve that ambiguity, which in this space, will not always be realistic. Instead, I should write to the uncertainty, not through it. Name the ambiguity, build the story around it.",

Mistral was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant win for Mistral, which was founded in 2023 and is valued at roughly $13.6 billion, following a 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) funding round announced last year.\n\nThe startup has positioned itself as a European alternative to US AI heavyweights, such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, pitching its models as powerful yet more compatible with Europe's sovereignty and data control ambitions.\n\nIn its statement, translated by Business Insider, the defense ministry said the partnership is intended to strengthen France's \"technological sovereignty\" and ensure the armed forces maintain control over critical AI tools used across military operations and administration.\n\nBertrand Rondepierre, director of the ministry's defense AI agency, said the agreement represents \"a major step\" in strengthening the ministry's generative AI capabilities and preparing the armed forces for future challenges, while maintaining sovereign control over the technologies used.\n\nThe deal comes as European governments reassess their dependence on US technology in strategic sectors ranging from cloud computing to semiconductors and now AI.\n\nThe French ministry's move mirrors that of the US government, which has increasingly inked major contracts with domestic AI companies to develop tools for military and national security use, including recent deals with OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other defense-focused startups.\n\nAs generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in military planning, logistics, and analysis, Mistral's latest win helps to position the startup as one of Europe's key players in the race to develop sovereign alternatives to American tech giants.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

    "fullText": "Robot vacuums that can climb stairs and device for BlackBerry lovers also on display at annual Las Vegas tech show\n\nThis year will be filled with robots that can fold your laundry, pick up objects and climb stairs, fridges that you can command to open by voice, laptops with screens that can follow you around the room on motorised hinges and the reimagining of the BlackBerry phone.\n\nThose are the predictions from the annual CES tech show in Las Vegas that took place this week. The sprawling event aims to showcase cutting-edge technology developed by startups and big brands.\n\nMany of these fancy developments will be available to actually buy, moving from outlandish concepts to production devices, although some are still limited to costly prototypes.\n\nThe rise of the humanoid robot continues, with the show floor filled with myriad prototypes, some of which operated autonomously rather than being remotely controlled or performing set routines this year.\n\nNot one but two different robots promised to do your laundry, make breakfast and serve drinks. In demos LG’s CLOiD home robot, which is reportedly due to undergo real-world testing next year, looked like a disembodied torso on a rolling platform, slowly and autonomously doing chores linked with various LG kitchen appliances.\n\nThe Chinese company Switchbot’s Onero H1, however, looks more like a security bot crossed with a robot vacuum with articulating arms ready to do chores. The company says it should go on sale later this year for an undisclosed sum. It joined impressive demos from many other Chinese robotics outfits, including Unitree, Booster Robotics and X-Humanoid, the recent winner of Beijing’s humanoid robot half-marathon.\n\nThis also promises to be that year that Boston Dynamics’ long-tested Atlas robot finally goes from awkward prototype to polished product, with a new design unveiled during the parent company Hyundai’s CES show.\n\nThe South Korean firm is partnering with Google’s DeepMind for robotic AI research and plans to deploy the Atlas robots, which are water resistant, can lift 50kg and automatically swap their batteries, to its manufacturing plants in the next couple of years.\n\nRobot vacuums are the more prevalent home robot for now, but even they have new tricks. Dreame’s Cyber10 Ultra arm-equipped robovac can lift up to 500g and use brushes and other nozzles while cleaning your floors. It will reportedly go on sale around August for about €1,800 (£1,560), although it was the company’s Cyber X concept with four legs and tank-like tracks that had attenders captivated because it might help it finally vanquish the mortal enemy of robot vacuums: climbing stairs.\n\nHowever, if actually cleaning the stairs is the goal, Roborock’s first two-wheel-leg robovac might be better. The Saros Rover is in development, shown off in prototype form, and can raise, lower and jump its way to each step, cleaning as it goes.\n\nNot even the humble fridge was safe this year from the march of robotics. Samsung debuted its new Family Hub fridge, which includes a screen on the front but its party piece is voice-controlled doors you can open and close hands-free.\n\nLess novel but potentially just as useful, GE built a barcode scanner into its new Profile fridge, which is designed to scan things as you discard them to automatically add them to a shopping list ready for when you need it. A camera inside the fridge lets you check remotely to see if anything’s finished or rotten.\n\nScores of new laptops were on show from all the major manufacturers including Acer, Dell, Samsung and others. But Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept was the start of the show: a regular-looking 16in laptop with a OLED screen that unrolls horizontally to a full-size 24in monitor for gaming and productivity on the go. Meanwhile, the company’s new ThinkPad Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist is going from concept to actual product with a motorised rotating hinge that automatically turns the screen to face you or your audience if you are presenting.\n\nSamsung used CES to show off its cutting-edge trifolding flexible screen Android phone-tablet hybrid, which takes the book-style folding design and adds another section that unfolds again like a pamphlet to reveal a large wide-screen tablet. Having gone on sale in South Korea just before the end of 2025 the Galaxy Z TriFold is expected to reach the US and other markets in the first half of this year for a big sum.\n\nBut for those who long for the days of physical keyboards on phones, the accessory company Clicks is bringing back the BlackBerry with its new Communicator: an Android phone with a physical keyboard. Designed as a “communication companion” with custom software that puts messaging above doomscrolling on social media, the Communicator can be used as a primary phone or as a partner to your existing iPhone or Android. It has a notification LED around the power button and a fingerprint scanner in the space bar. Reservations are open and the phone is due to ship later this year.\n\nClicks already sells keyboard cases for the iPhone, Pixel and other devices for those that don’t want to replace their phone completely with a BlackBerry. But it also had a new slide-out keyboard Bluetooth that doubles as a magnetic wireless charging battery pack on show at CES. The Power Keyboard magnetically sticks to the back of the phone and will be compatible with iPhones and Androids supporting Qi2, shipping in the spring.",

    "title": "Why Tech Launches Stopped Feeling Magical",
    "description": "People used to camp out to buy new phones. Wild!",
    "fullText": "You can pinpoint the exact minute of the high-water mark for tech-based enthusiasm: January 9, 2007, 9:41 AM PST, the moment Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone to the world.\n\nCell phones weren’t new—neither were cellphones with touch screens—but this one was different: so high-tech it seemed like it couldn’t be real, but so perfectly designed, it felt inevitable. And people were hyped. Not just tech nerds: normal people. The crowd at the 2007 Macworld Conference & Expo broke into rapturous applause when Jobs showed off the iPhone’s multi-touch—an ovation for a software feature!—because it seemed like Jobs was touching a better future.\n\nThe iPhone, people said, was like something out of Star Trek. But unlike communicators or tri-corders, it was obtainable (if you had $500) evidence of a future where technology would finally free us from the drudgery of our lives so we could boldly go—wherever, it doesn't matter.\n\nSteve Jobs mentioned Star Trek as an inspiration for the iPhone all the time; apparently the show is quite popular among tech people. Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek, and thus was the spiritual father of the iPhone. He spent the 1960s lounging poolside in Los Angeles, dreaming of a post-scarcity tomorrow where the wise, brave men of The Federation kept the Romulans at bay and there were hot alien chicks on every Class-M planet. At the same time, the future’s real prophet, Philip K. Dick, was huddled in a dank Oakland apartment, a stone’s throw from Silicon Valley, popping amphetamines like breath mints and feverishly typing dystopian visions of corporate surveillance states and nightmare techno-realities into his Hermes Rocket typewriter.\n\nRoddenberry's Federation promised technology would help humanity evolve beyond its baser instincts. Dick saw technology amplifying our worst impulses.\n\nSo what happened? How did we go from a Roddenberry future where each new product release seemed like another step closer to collective utopia to our Dick-esque present, where the first question we ask of any new technology is “How is this going to hurt me?\"\n\nVisionary heads of start-ups like to blather about \"paradigm shifts\" and \"world-changing technology\" but people don’t get excited for tech products that are going to, say, cure cancer. Most of life (for pampered Westerners, anyway) is dealing with routine annoyances, and tech promises a way out. Remember printing MapQuest directions before leaving the house? It was a pain in the ass. People were excited for the iPhone because it solved the MapQuest problem and so many other small, intimate problems, like “I can't instantly send a photo to my friend” or “I get bored while I’m riding the bus.” Products that do this flourish, and ones that fail are discarded like a Juicero.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how great the iPhone was back in 2007 in terms of solving annoyances. Buying one meant you no longer had to carry a notepad, camera, laptop, MP3 player, GPS device, flashlight, or alarm clock. It was all crammed into a single black mirror. But speaking of black mirror ...\n\n\"We’re in an era of incremental updates, not industry-defining breakthroughs,\" says Heather Sliwinski, founder of tech public relations firm Changemaker Communications. \"Today's new iPhone offers a slightly better camera, marginally different dimensions or AI features that no one is asking for. Those aren't updates that go viral or justify consumers shelling out thousands of dollars for a device that's only slightly better than what they already own.\"\n\nIn economics, \"marginal utility\" is the additional satisfaction or benefit a consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good or service. The marginal utility leap between a flip phone and the first iPhone was huge. But economics teaches us that marginal utility diminishes with each additional unit consumed. Each new iPhone release provided progressively less additional satisfaction compared to what users already had. Slightly faster chips, slightly better cameras, USB-C instead of Lightning, titanium instead of aluminum—who cares?\n\nIf we were merely bored with tech products, it would be one thing. But increasingly, devices that were desired because we want to make our lives easier or more enjoyable are making them harder and worse.\n\n“When you buy a new tech product today, you're not just buying one physical product. You're committing to downloading another app, creating another account and managing another subscription,\" Sliwinski says. \"Consumers are exhausted by the endless management that comes with each new device.\"\n\nIn economics, you’d call that “diseconomies of scale”: what happens when a business becomes so large its bureaucracy costs outweigh efficiency gains. In personal terms, it’s when the time and energy it takes to sync, charge, and coordinate your “time-saving” device makes you the middle manager of your own life.\n\nThen there’s the kipple. In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Philip K. Dick defines “kipple” as useless objects that accumulate: ”junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers or yesterday's homeopape.” That drawer full of orphaned power cords and connectors, your broken earbuds, the extra game controllers, the Roku, Chomecast, and old Fitbit are physical kipple, but the virtual kipple is worse. “Personally, I have at least four different apps that I need to download and manage just to live in my apartment complex—smart lock system, community laundry, rent payments, maintenance requests,” Sliwinski says.\n\nAccording to Dick, kipple doesn't just accumulate; it metastasizes, growing constantly until the Star Trek lifestyle you envisioned becomes a Dick-esque swamp of dependencies, and The future goes from being a place you want to live to somewhere you’re trapped.\n\nThe door refused to open. It said, “Five cents, please.”He searched his pockets. No more coins; nothing. “I’ll pay you tomorrow,” he told the door. ― Philip K. Dick, Ubik\n\n\"Corporations have spent years trying to manufacture excitement around relatively low-importance features instead of genuinely useful developments, and consumers have learned to recognize that pattern,\" says Kaveh Vahdat, founder of RiseOpp, a Fractional CMO and SEO firm based in San Francisco.\n\nNowhere does this consumer indifference seem greater than with AI. \"Consumers are testing Sora or testing Grok and all of that, but there’s really not been a single use case or product for AI that I think consumers are excited about,\" says Sliwinski.\n\nThis will not stop tech companies. Even without excitement, artificial intelligence is everywhere in tech, from toothbrushes to baby strollers (I think PKD would have found the AI stroller darkly funny: it's self-driving, but it won't work if you put a baby in it.) \"There’s a lot of buzz around AI but we’re missing the 'so what?'\"\n\nBeyond \"so what?\" consumers have started asking \"How will this hurt me?\" \"Is AI going to encourage my child to take their own life? Is it going to steal my job? Is it destroying everything pure about humanity?\"\n\nTech companies don't seem like they're scaling back on AI or doing an effective job of explaining its benefits, and if the recent past is an indicator, if they can't make our lives easier, they'll try to imprison us instead, employing psychologists, neuroscientists, and \"growth hackers\" specifically to make products harder to put down. The innovation isn't in new products that make life easier, but in encouraging addiction through variable reward schedules, social validation metrics, parasocial relationships, and other dark arts until eventually we end up like the half-lifers in Ubik, husks in cryopods, living in a manufactured reality where we still have to pay for the doors to open. That's the PKD take, anyway.\n\n\"Maybe 10 to 20 years down the road we will have another huge step change like the iPhone that can condense all these different devices that we’re using or apps that we’re using —but the tech isn’t there yet,\" Sliwinski says.\n\nIn Star Trek, humanity doesn’t abandon scarcity. Technology eventually makes scarcity indefensible, and that's only possible after a planet-wide war. From that Roddenberry-esque perspective, enshittification is what happens when old economic systems try to survive in a world where technology keeps eroding their justification, and each tiny \"I don't care\" iteration to tech products is a small step closer to Star Trek's promised land of holodecks, abundance, and hot aliens.",

    "description": "Love it or hate it, Lego's Smart Brick has elicited strong reactions from its adult fanbase as they process the analog toymaker's embrace of tech.",
    "fullText": "Small speakers hum as two \"Star Wars\"-themed Lego lightsabers clash. Lights beam from the top of a Lego-built airplane. A roaring engine sound kicks in as multiple vehicles race across the floor.\n\nIt's all part of a high-tech — and polarizing — update from Lego called Smart Play that the toymaker unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this week in Las Vegas.\n\nLego says its new line of chip-based bricks is \"one of the most significant evolutions\" since the launch of figurines in 1978.\n\nAt the center of the system is what Lego calls a Smart Brick. It's the same size as the classic two-by-four Lego piece — a design that has remained largely unchanged since the company began producing plastic bricks in the early 1930s — but it contains sensors, lights, and a tiny speaker.\n\nThe move pushes the famously analog toy deeper into the world of embedded technology. Among adult fans of Lego — known as AFOLs — the reaction has been mixed.\n\nOnline, some longtime builders and parents have voiced concern about what they see as the growing \"tech-ification\" of toys traditionally more reliant on one's imagination.\n\nIn interviews with Business Insider, Lego purists, toy enthusiasts, and industry watchers said they're intrigued by the technology — but some worry the added electronics will push Lego's prices even higher.\n\n\"I've loved the creativity involved without Smart Bricks,\" Jake Doll, 33, a Lego enthusiast who posts to AFOL communities on TikTok, told Business Insider. \"I think they'll put more investment in tech as it can increase the overall purchase price.\"\n\nThe bricks can sense what's happening around them, including light detection, player movement, and proximity to other figurines. When multiple Smart Bricks are used together, they communicate wirelessly with one another, allowing Lego sets to react in coordinated ways.\n\nLego says the system doesn't rely on AI or a constant internet connection. The bricks charge wirelessly, don't require disposable batteries, and play pre-programmed sounds directly from built-in speakers.\n\nThe company plans to debut the technology in three \"Star Wars\"-themed sets: a $70 Darth Vader set with 473 pieces, a $100 Luke's Red Five X-Wing set with 584 pieces, and a $160 Darth Vader's Throne Room Duel & A-Wing set with 962 pieces. They will hit store shelves on March 1.\n\n\"This isn't changing direction from what the Lego brand has always been,\" Tom Donaldson, the head of Legos's Creative Play Lab, told Business Insider in a statement. \"It's an expansion — we're staying true to our brand while innovating to meet how kids play today. The Lego brick our fans know and love isn't going anywhere; we're just making our play even more magical.\"\n\nBob Friedland, 50, a toy expert and former Toys R Us executive, told Business Insider he isn't planning to buy the Lego Smart Play sets when they launch.\n\nRight now, he owns 115 sets, according to his Lego app. That includes collections themed around \"Hocus Pocus,\" \"Stranger Things,\" and van Gogh's Starry Night. In a phone interview, Friedland said he's more interested in a $28, fully analog Lego DeLorean DMC replica from \"Back to the Future.\"\n\nHe said that Lego — which launched a 9,000-piece Star Wars-themed build for $999 in September — risks alienating already inflation-strained customers with increasingly expensive sets.\n\n\"These bricks will definitely bump up against the already-existing feeling that Lego is too expensive,\" he said.\n\nSmart Play isn't Lego's first attempt to blend bricks with technology.\n\nIn 1998, the company launched Lego Mindstorms, a line of programmable robotics kits that allowed builders to create machines that responded to sensors and computer code. More recently, Lego introduced the Lego Super Mario line in 2020, which featured interactive figures that triggered sound effects when placed on certain blocks.\n\nFriedland said that much of the online concern around toy \"tech-ification\" is attributable to other companies focusing on launching AI in teddy bears and dolls.\n\nMattel, for example, has partnered with OpenAI to put AI tech in some Barbie dolls. Child development researchers have warned that AI-enabled plushies aren't meeting basic safety standards. Online chatbots have appeared on children's iPads.\n\nBut other parents said they aren't sure their Lego-loving kids are even going to be interested in the company's new tech.\n\n\"As an adult fan, my joy stems from the building process and sharing that experience with my kids,\" Reid Exley, 43, a father of two and Lego enthusiast with more than 50 sets, said. \"My kids would likely enjoy the novelty of the sounds and interactivity. However, I suspect that novelty would quickly wear off and Lego play would remain largely unchanged.\"\n\nSome fans see Lego's launch of the Smart Play system less as a distraction — and more as an intriguing puzzle with potential.\n\n\"Are dolls that cry less creative than dolls that don't? Not really,\" Friedland said. \"I can already see myself trying to figure out Easter eggs that are unlocked by placing the Smart Brick in the right place or tapping it in the right sequence while it's next to the right colored brick.\"\n\nHe also told Business Insider that the current state of childhood play needs some new tech disruption. The Lego set, in his mind, could fit that bill.\n\n\"Parents who are wary of tech will likely look at this as a better alternative than a phone or iPad,\" he said. \"I think this is a much better solution than the AI toys out there.\"",

    "description": "Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk described a future where technology creates an abundance of resources so \"anyone can have whatever stuff they want.\"",
    "fullText": "Saving for retirement has been a cornerstone of personal finance for well over a century. It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said. That would mean \"better medical care than anyone has today, available for everyone within five years,\" he continued. \"No scarcity of goods and services. You can learn anything you want about anything for free.\"\n\nHowever, the serial entrepreneur warned of a \"bumpy\" transition to this utopian world, marked by jarring change and social unrest. He also flagged a potential loss of purpose.\n\n\"Now, if you actually get all the stuff you want, is that actually the future you want?\" he asked. '\"Because it means that your job won't matter.\"\n\nMusk is known for transforming the auto sector with Tesla's electric vehicles, and revolutionizing the aerospace industry with SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nHis companies are developing self-driving cars, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces, AI assistants, and other innovations as he paves his way to becoming the first trillionaire in history.\n\nDespite his track record, Musk's latest prediction clashes hard with the reality faced by many Americans. Years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and anemic wage growth have created an affordability crisis.\n\nMillions of people feel priced out of getting a college degree, accessing quality healthcare, owning a home, or having children. A comfortable retirement also feels out of reach, with surveys showing the majority of Americans aren't saving nearly enough.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Musk's blue-sky vision of an abundant future may seem like wishful thinking — or even dangerous advice if it leads people to stop saving, but the world doesn't change as he expects, leaving them short in retirement.",

I’m Ron Minsky. It is my\ngreat pleasure to introduce Richard Eisenberg. Richard’s a senior\ncontributor to the Haskell ecosystem. He’s worked on Haskell’s type\nsystem in a lot of different ways over the last eight years. He’s on\nthe GHC Steering Committee. He’s the Chair of the Haskell\nFoundation. One might wonder, what’s he doing here? Well, it turns out\nRichard has joined Jane Street. He’s working on our Tools and\nCompilers team, and in particular, working on the team that works on\nthe front end of the OCaml compiler. So, thanks for joining me,\nRichard.\n\nSo, maybe a good place to start out with is to talk about your\nbackground. You’ve done all this exciting work in the Haskell\necosystem. Maybe tell us a little bit more about how you got involved\nin Haskell and what kind of work you’ve done there.\n\nYeah, sure. I first really encountered Haskell when I went back to\ngraduate school. I’d been a high school teacher for a little while and\nthen I thought, ‘oh, you know, it’s time to get a Ph.D. in programming\nlanguages,’ kind of, as you do.\n\nIn the process toward that, I discovered dependent types. I didn’t\nwanna just show up in grad school and not know anything. So I did some\nbackground reading and I discovered that, you know, these fancy type\nsystems have so much expressiveness, and so much of a way of being\nable to sort of define what it is that you’re programming before you\neven write a line of code, that you can just express your ideas so\nmuch more clearly and then get the compiler to check that you actually\ndid it correctly. This was just sort of, you know, my brain exploded\nwhen I learned about this.\n\nI feel like, you know, I kind of pretend to know something about\nprogramming languages on TV, but like, actually my academic background\nis distributed systems, not programming languages, and there’s lots of\ngaps in my knowledge. And so, I kinda don’t really know what dependent\ntypes are. Can you give a suitably beginner-friendly explanation of\nwhat dependent types are?\n\nSure. And I’m gonna start by avoiding the trap of trying to define the\nterm, ‘dependent type.’\n\nAnd instead, just sort of describe ‘a language with dependent types\nallows you to do this thing.’ And that thing is to essentially encode\na proof of correctness into your program such that every time you\ncompile your program, that proof is checked. And so you know—if you’ve\nset things up the right way—that your program does what you think it\ndoes. And so, I’ll give a concrete example.\n\nAnd that is, to imagine a sorting function. So normally we think of a\nsorting function, let’s just say, it’s a function from a list of\n‘ints’ to a list of ints, right? It takes this list of ints’ input,\nand then does some transformation, and then produces a list. But\nactually, that’s a very loose description of a sorting function. We\ncan do better than that.\n\nI wanna say that a sorting function takes in a list of ints, and it\nproduces a list of ints in, I’m gonna say, non-descending order\n(because maybe there’s duplicates, so I don’t want to say ‘ascending\norder’ because someone out there might say that’s wrong). So we get\nthis list out that’s in non-descending order. Okay, that’s closer, but\nthat’s still not quite right because maybe my function just always\nreturned to the empty list. That’s a list in non-descending order.\n\nSo instead, I really want to say that it’s a function that takes in a\nlist of ints, and returns a result that is in non-descending order,\nand is a permutation of the input list. And that’s a rather glorious\ntype that I can assign to a sorting function. But it accurately\ndescribes what that sorting function does.\n\nAnd then I can implement that in any number of ways, using any of the\ncommon sorting algorithms that you learn in computer science, and any\nof those different algorithms will meet that specification, and then,\nif I’ve encoded this, my compiler will check that my algorithm\nactually does sorting and doesn’t do some other thing. And so now,\nhaving sort of explained that, I can return back and actually say what\nI mean by ‘dependent type.’\n\nA dependent type is a type that can depend on some input that you give\ninto a function, essentially. So, in this case, the output of the\nfunction, not just a list of ints, but the output depends on the\ninput. The output must be a permutation of the input. And so, that’s\nthe dependent type.\n\nSo when I started grad school, then I saw Haskell, and here was a\nlanguage that had this fancy type system and had all this\nexpressiveness. Didn’t quite have dependent types, but it had a lot of\nthat stuff. That just got me excited. And then, through that I started\nworking with Stephanie Weirich at University of Pennsylvania. She was\ndoing a lot of Haskell work. She collaborated a bunch with Simon\nPeyton Jones, who then I started collaborating with, and things just\nsort of took off from there. It was a pretty fast introduction into\nthat world.\n\nI wanna go a little deeper on that. I feel like we’ve started with\nthe, like, ‘Well, of course I got a Ph.D. in PL and was interested in\ndependent types.’ Like, how do you even get there? Where does your\ninterest and background in programming languages come [from] in the\nfirst place?\n\nSo, once upon a time, I wanted to program. I don’t know why I wanted\nto program. I was too little to have that level of introspection.\n\nSo I guess, uh, I learned Basic when I was, I think, five\nsomehow. There was a friend of my parents that decided I should learn\nBasic and so that happened.\n\nBut I then got more into it, I guess, when I was in 7th grade, so this\nwas, probably I was 12 years old. And someone told me that Pascal was\na good language to learn. So, you know, I pleaded with my parents and\neventually they bought me the Pascal compiler ‘cause back in those\ndays, you actually had to pay for compilers. At least on, sort of—we\nhad a Macintosh. If I had some kind of Unix system, maybe it would’ve\nbeen different.\n\nWell, which Pascal compiler did you use?\n\nUm, THINK Pascal? Was that a thing?\n\nTHINK Pascal, so not Borland. I guess Borland was \nDOS side of the world.\n\nYeah, yeah. Borland, yes, Borland was for like, ‘real programmers.’\n\nSo I got this, and somewhere along the way, I had decided that every\npiece of software should be, like, if you read the instruction manual,\nthat should tell you everything you need to know about that piece of\nsoftware. I don’t know why I assumed that, but that was my starting\npoint. And so, it came with these two big books and most of the books\nwere just like on compiler flags and setting up projects and none of\nthis stuff about programming. At the end of one of the books was a\nsyntax reference with no glosses, no further information, just a\nsyntax reference using those, sort of, block and line diagrams to\nrepresent recursive loops in the syntax. And I was like, ‘Okay, well,\nif my assumption is that this book defines how to program, and this is\nthe only thing it has, then all the information must be here.’\n\nSo I just stared at these syntax diagrams probably for hours and\nhours. Like, ‘Okay, what does all of this mean?’ And then eventually\nsort of bootstrapped my way into learning how to program Pascal. And\nso, that being my first ‘real programming experience,’ somehow that\nbuilt the structures in my brain just around syntax and languages, and\nit kind of went from there.\n\nAnd then fast-forward 10 years or so, and I took a PL course as an\nundergrad from Norman Ramsey and it just lit me up. It was just like,\nthis is really cool stuff. I really enjoy this kind of thinking. And\nit turned out, I took that at the end of my senior year of undergrad,\nand so it was sort of too late to immediately go into grad school at\nthat point and I had this whole machine going toward high school\nteaching. So I did that for a while, but then I ended up returning.\n\nI love that your entrée into programming was, roughly speaking, a\ntraumatic experience with syntax. That seems… (laughs)\n\nBut it wasn’t traumatic. It was fantastic. Somehow, this was just what\nI needed. This was what my 12-year-old-self needed: big syntax blocks.\n\n(laughs) Okay. So, you went off, you got your Ph.D., you started\nworking on Haskell. Where did it go from there?\n\nWell, I was working on my Ph.D. It was basically, Stephanie and I had\nthis idea about how to encode dependent types, but it required some\nmore support from the Haskell compiler. And so, I was pleading [with]\nthe Haskell people to create this for me. And then, eventually Simon\njust wrote and said, ‘Why don’t you just do it?’ And that was a new\nconcept for me. I was like, ‘I could influence this language? Well,\nyou know, I’m just this random person.’\n\nBut between Stephanie and Simon mentoring me, I got to a point where I\ncould contribute and then it just grew from there. So, [I] did a bunch\nof that as a Ph.D. student. Then after leaving my Ph.D., I was a\nprofessor for a few years at Bryn Mawr College. What was great about\nthat experience was, they were open to the idea that open source\ncontributions were a form of publication, right? A lot of professors\nhave a lot of pressure to keep producing papers. That was definitely\nthere for me, too. But alongside papers, I couldn’t just do\nsoftware. But I could do, sort of, traditional scholarly publications\nand software. So that gave me a chance to continue my implementation\nwork, remain a part of this open source community, while still doing\nthe high-level scholarly research that I had been doing. So that was a\nreally nice part of it.\n\nIt turned out that, to my great surprise, that—well, this wasn’t to my\ngreat surprise—it turned out that this was a lot of work. That\nmaintaining a research program with a bunch of papers every year, and\ndoing these open source contributions, and teaching, there was just\nmore than could comfortably fit into one job, especially during term\ntime. And to my own surprise, I realized that the teaching part was\nthe part that maybe I could pause on. I had done that full-time as a\nhigh school teacher for eight years, now I was back doing it. It was\nfun, but I thought it was time to sort of push in a slightly different\ndirection.\n\nSo after a couple years at Bryn Mawr, I left to join Tweed which is a\nsoftware consultancy based in Paris. They do a ton of Haskell\nwork. And they hired me, basically just to continue my contributions\nin the Haskell space. So, I continued doing research there, continued\ncontributing to the compiler there. And, you know, after a few years\nof that, that was fun, and I got to a point where I was looking to be\npart of a cohesive team all working together, and realizing that after\nso many years just working in one language, I was really ready to see\nwhat things were like in a different space. And so the timing worked\nout really well when you, Ron, reached out to me and started the\ndiscussions that led to me joining Jane Street.\n\nRight. And often in these interviews, I’ll ask someone, like, ‘so how\ndid you get here?’ But actually, I was part of the dramatis personae\nof how you actually arrived.\n\nYou were the—the dramatis personae, yeah. (laughs)\n\n(laughs) Right, which is, at some point, I was like, ‘oh, it would be\nreally good if Richard worked here,’ and I started reaching out and\ntrying to convince you to come. Which took, it’s important, I\ncalculated, 11 months from (laughs) when I started.\n\nYeah, yeah. That’s right. I mean, you know, of course the story [of]\nme coming to Jane Street starts with you asking me, and me saying\n‘No.’\n\nAnd again, it was a matter of timing. I’ve been aware of Jane Street\nfor a long time, been sort of wondering what was happening over there,\nand somehow when you first reached out, it just wasn’t the right time\nfor me yet. And then the second time, it was sort of a better time. I\ncouldn’t even tell you why. It’s just, this is the way that life\nflows.\n\nBut, you know, one of the barriers which we’ve joked about is that I\ngrew up in the New York area and actually ended up going to high\nschool in New York and commuting from New Jersey. So every day I was\ngoing back and forth across the George Washington Bridge, and swore to\nmyself then that I would never commute to and from New York City. And\nalso just sort of had this negative vibe from the financial industry,\nand I was just like, ‘I don’t know. Like, I want to be creating\nsomething that other people use,’ right?\n\nBut actually, this is fantastic. I’m having great fun. Part of it is\nthat I’m working as part of this larger ecosystem. It’s not just a\nclosed thing where I’m only doing stuff that’s internal to Jane\nStreet. But instead, contributing to this open source ecosystem,\nworking on an open language, OCaml, and really continuing some of\nthese research trends that I started 10 years ago. Now that I’m here,\nit just all fits very naturally together.\n\nI feel like, in general, one of my takeaways is that there’s lots of\ninteresting work in lots of different places and the preconceptions\nyou have when you are young often (laughs) don’t work out over\ntime. So a thing you talked about earlier is a topic that I feel like\nI should know something about, but don’t. I like your first high-level\ndescription ‘cause it actually lines up with the very little bit I\nknow about dependent types.\n\nAnd there’s also something that’s always made me a little nervous\nabout them because a basic fact about proofs is—proofs seem pretty\nhard to construct. People go to great trouble to build automated\nproving systems where you have tactic libraries, like, little tiny\nprograms that you can run to, like, ‘try this way or try that way’ of\ncoming up with a proof of a thing. And it all sounds really hard and\nwhen you talk to people who do kind of theorem proving on large scale\nsoftware systems, it sounds like a pretty challenging operation where\nthis is kind of a lot of engineering work that just goes into just\nconstructing the proof. So I’m curious how you think of the\npracticalities of that? Like, how convenient can you make it? And if\nyou make it a deeply embedded part of the programming process, does\nthat work well with the other things you might wanna do? Does it\ninterfere with the ordinary process of programming? How do you see the\npragmatics of that working out?\n\nYeah, that’s a great question. And this is a question that doesn’t\nhave an answer yet. This is, I think, still something that the\nprogramming languages community is grappling with. I have my own\ntakes, but this is still sort of an open question out there.\n\nI think, first of all, that for a programming language to be\neffective, everything needs to be opt-in, right? If you have a\nlanguage that supports dependent types—and there’s a bunch out\nthere. So actually, OCaml’s module system is a dependent type\nsystem. It’s missing one or two key features that makes it really sort\nof go. But that definitely has aspects of dependent types in\nit. Haskell has aspects of dependent types.\n\nThere are other languages, Coq, Agda, Idris, Lean, these are the ones\nthat really have embraced dependent types. But in any of these\nlanguages, you don’t have to use these dependent types. You can just\nwrite a sorting function that is described as ‘a list of ints to a\nlist of ints.’ That’s fine. And I think that’s a key aspect of any\nkind of system that’s gonna be using this dependent types feature,\nbecause not everyone wants to prove everything all the time. As you\nsay, proofs are expensive. And so, what you need is, you need the\nability to only prove the parts that you think are worthwhile proving.\n\nSo let’s say we have an important part of the system that might be\neasy to get wrong that we want to prove something about. How do we do\nthat? Is that still worth it? And one thing to think about is, what’s\nyour cost-benefit analysis, right? If you do this proving, can you\nspend less time on testing? Can you spend less time on debugging? Can\nyou spend less time on catastrophic failure because you missed\nsomething when debugging?\n\nIt is a lot harder to do these programs with proofs. But sometimes,\nthat’s really worth it. It’s a matter of applying good taste, like it\nis everywhere in programming, right? Any programming language gives\nyou a ton of tools to work with, and it takes time and experience and\ntaste to figure out when it’s time to use which tools.\n\nRight. And I do really like that, kind of, pay-as-you-go kind of\nattitude of, like, you want some kind of base language that’s\nrelatively simple to work with, and then the ability to add on more\nfeatures that give you more power of various kinds, and not be forced\nto pay for that complexity constantly in everything you do. Which is,\nI think, actually a really hard thing to get right in the design—of\nlike, not having these more powerful features leak in and corrupt the\nrest of your experience within the language.\n\nThat’s right. It’s a very careful thing. And my push in Haskell has\nbeen to try to increase or add new features to help support dependent\ntypes, and there’s been a large community of people really excited for\nthis. And in my measurement, my biased measurement, a smaller\ncommunity of people who have been saying, ‘No, no, no. Don’t do this\nbecause it’s gonna make it impossible to write simple programs.’ And\nmany, many, many times, I’ve had to reassure people, ‘No, no. All\nthose simple programs will continue to exist, they’ll continue to\nwork. You can do what you want.’ But I also wanna give power to people\nwho want to use the fancy dependent types.\n\nGreat. Okay. So let’s leave Haskell and dependent types behind for the\nmoment because that’s not primarily what you’re working on here. Maybe\nyou can tell us, what are you working on here? Like, what is the\nmission that you are on here, working on OCaml?\n\nSo, I’ll start more broadly and then I’ll get narrower. My broad\nmission is my belief that type systems are a fantastic way to\nstructure thought and structure programs. So by being able to write\ndown what you intend to do before doing it, then you can check what\nyou’ve done, and you can also help formulate your thoughts. And when I\nsay, ‘write down what you intend to do before doing it,’ I mean, write\ndown a specification in types.\n\nThe flip side of that, is that it must be the case that you can do\nthat without paying a one-time cost. It’s gonna be problematic if you\nwant to write an efficient program, and yet, by defining your program\ncarefully ahead of time, now it’s no longer as efficient at\nruntime. This checking and this writing of a specification should all\nhappen at compile time. This should be happening in front of the\nprogrammer and not in front of any users. If any of those details leak\ninto user land by slowing your program down or somehow interfering\nwith the operation of your program, then there’s a misdesign in the\nlanguage.\n\nSo coming down to what I’m actually working on here at Jane Street, so\nthe feature I’m working on is something called unboxed types. There’s\nvarious different ways of characterizing it, but one way to do so is,\nit allows inlining of type definitions. So what we might want to have\nin our design is to have a structure that has four fields that\ndescribe some aspects of a trade. And then maybe we store that\nstructure in some larger structure, and maybe that’s stored in some\nlarger structure.\n\nWell, if you do that the naïve way in OCaml, every time you store one\nstructure inside of another, it’s stored by a pointer. And it means\nnow when I wanna access the price of this trade that’s all the way\ndown (it’s a nested structure) I have to follow this pointer, then\nthat pointer, then that pointer, then that pointer, each time I have a\ncache miss, each time I have to load into memory. This is really bad.\n\nRight. And this highlights a kind of basic fact about OCaml, that it\nhas a very fancy, at least on the scale of modern language that people\nmight use, a very fancy type system and a brutally simple memory\nrepresentation. OCaml’s internal implementation might have been like a\nScheme or Lisp written in the mid-‘60s or something, which is to say,\neverything looks like either some immediate value, it’s no bigger than\na word that fits in a register, or a heap-allocated value, which is\nlike one header word and then one full word for every slot inside of\nit, and we have all the fancy, like, type goo on top of it that you\nwant, but all of the physical representation looks just like that.\n\nExactly. Exactly. It means that we’re building this beautiful type\ndiscipline in our software to try to avoid errors, and try to express\nourselves, and try to communicate more clearly among developers—and\nwe’re paying for that at runtime! This is ridiculous. To me, every\ntime a type system feature slows down your program or otherwise\ninterferes is just a misdesign. And so, the fact that this is our\ncurrent state of play is problematic. The task I’m working on is\ncoming up with a new design for OCaml’s type system, or this aspect of\nOCaml’s type system, that allows us to have this rich type structure\nwithout paying for it at runtime.\n\nThat’s right. Although it’s not that you can pick a type structure\nthat’s kind of oblivious to the performance details, right? In some\nsense it’s the opposite. The idea of the unboxed type work and a lot\nof the work that we’re doing now is really about taking design\ndecisions that have to do with performance and making them explicit at\nthe level of types.\n\nYes, that’s right. Because you can’t, I mean, in the end, we need to\nexecute this somehow. There needs to be an execution model. And so, if\nwe try to ignore all of these execution details in the type system,\nthen there’s not gonna be a way of making it fast. And so, the work\nis, in some sense, taking some of these execution-oriented details,\nmaking them manifest in the type system, getting programmers the\nability to write types that take these into account, so that we can\nthen execute fast.\n\nRight. In some sense, I think of this as really being about enabling\nperformance engineering, right? There’s kind of two different lines of\npeople thinking about how to optimize programs via compilers. One is,\nyou make your compiler smarter so it can do more and optimize things\nfor you. So the user can write kind of an ordinary program that just\nreflects, ‘what do they want to achieve and what’s the logical\nstructure,’ and then the compiler will, like, do something good. And\nthen, the other direction is trying to give a lot of precise\nunderstanding to the programmer so they can know exactly what they’re\ndoing and they can optimize their program. And these are both\nimportant.\n\nBut, like, in some sense the scale of optimizations are very\ndifferent. Like, if you come up with a way of making your compiler\nfaster that, like, takes most user programs and makes them 20% faster,\nthat’s an enormous win. Like, that’s a shockingly good\noutcome. Whereas, if you give people good performance engineering\ntools, the idea that they can think hard about a particular program\nand make it five, or 10, or 100 times faster is like, in some sense,\ntotally normal. And so, there’s a kind of extra power of giving\nindividuals the ability to optimize. It obviously misses out on scope\nand there’s something great about being able to go and in one swell\nfoop (laughs) make 20 different, or 100 different, or all the\ndifferent programs faster. But you can’t get the same kind of order of\nmagnitude of improvements that you can get from giving one programmer\nthe ability to really carefully engineer their system.\n\nWell, there’s a real tension because what in the end we’re doing in\nprogramming languages is, we’re trying to find a way for humans to\ncommunicate precisely to computers. And we have at our disposal our\ntool, one of our tools is the fact that this is happening on a\ncomputer. So we can write computer programs to try to sort of help\ncover this distance, right?\n\nIn the early days, humans were just completely at a disadvantage and\nthe humans wrote in assembly code. And this was kind of terrible. And\nwe’ve come some way since then, and so now instead of writing sort of\ninstruction-by-instruction that’s gonna be executed by the processor,\nwe can write in a high-level language and have a compiler translate\nthat high-level language to something that the computer can\nexecute. Hopefully along the way, it can actually make that\nfaster. But sometimes, we’ve gotten ourselves sort of too\nhigh-level. If we abstract away too many of the details of execution,\nit’s exactly as you were saying. It means that the programmer can no\nlonger do the performance engineering. And so, we need to expose just\nenough to the programmer so that now there’s some more details that\nthey can think about. Now they can do that performance engineering.\n\nBut still, I think the burden sits on the compiler to take those few\nhints that the programmer gives to make blazingly fast code come out\nthe other end. And it’s just really about this interplay between how\nmany details do we wanna expose? Certainly not all the details because\nthat’s too hard for the programmer. But we need to expose some. And\nso, it’s about, over time, programming languages developing more and\nmore features that sort of figure out the right line and the right\nbalance between this desire for high-level languages, closer to human\nthought, and low-level details, easier to execute.\n\nSo, before when we were talking about dependent types, we were talking\nabout how it’s important to have this kind of pay-as-you-go\nphenomenon, like, it gets harder as you try and get more power. It\nfeels like the same kind of thing shows up here.\n\nSo, when you try and get more control over the shape of data in the\nway that you described, what are the trade-offs? And how do you think\nabout designing the language in such a way that you don’t have\nwhatever extra complexity is there infect everything that you do?\n\nWell, we have to be really careful. So, with unboxed types, one of the\nchallenges is gonna be that unboxed types interfere with\npolymorphism. So, in a language like OCaml, you can write a function,\nsay, that computes the length of a list. And that’s gonna work over a\nlist, no matter what the list contains. And so the way that we say\nthat, is that in the type of the length function, there’s a type\nvariable. We say that it’s an ‘alpha list’ where alpha can stand for\nany type that you might wanna put in there. Once we introduce unboxed\ntypes, that no longer works out. Some of these types won’t be suitable\nreplacements for alpha. And so it means that, by having these unboxed\ntypes in the system, now this really powerful feature of polymorphism\nbecomes constrained. And so, algorithms that people are used to being\nable to use everywhere, no longer work so well.\n\nSo one of the challenges that we have is, how can we recover that? How\ncan we still keep this nice feature of polymorphism and without having\nunboxed types interfere? And so, one of the things that we’re thinking\nabout doing is some amount of essentially what could become runtime\ncode generation. It comes down to building experience with the\nfeature. As we start understanding this language feature better, we’re\ngoing to create programs using these unboxed types, recognize areas in\nwhich the current programming paradigms that we engage in no longer\nwork, and then figure out ways around them. It’s this give and take as\nwe’re doing the language design.\n\nAnd just to focus in on this code generation thing for a second, the\nbasic issue here is that the way you make in OCaml today, separate\ncompilation of work, and make the ability to write a function in one\nplace and use it polymorphically on lots of different types is, again,\nyou’re just kind of taking advantage of this rock stupid memory\nrepresentation. Like, what’s a list? A list is a collection of\nheap-allocated values, every one has, like, two slots. One is a place\nto put the data and the other is a place to have a pointer to the next\nthing on the list. And when you iterate over it, that thing always has\nthe same shape, it always has the same number of bytes, and so you\ncould just write one piece of code that kind of uniformly walks over\nit. And what happens in the unboxed types world is, suddenly you want\nthe system to contemplate multiple different possible shapes of the\ndata. And so, kind of at a mechanical level, you need different\nmachine instructions in order to do the walking of the data structure,\ndepending on what that structure is.\n\nAnd so, that’s how you might end up with wanting code generations. The\nway to kind of claw back the polymorphism is to generate the\ncode. Maybe you can generate the extra code at compile time, maybe you\nhave to generate the extra code at runtime. But you somehow now have\nto generate code for multiple different scenarios that essentially\nrepresent different physical shapes of the data.\n\nExactly. And right now, our best thought is that this will happen at\ncompile time, that we’ll be able to figure out what code we need to\ngenerate at compile time. That will prevent a few programming idioms\nthat someone might potentially want. I don’t think anyone will ever\nwant those (laughs) idioms in practice so I think we’ll be able to get\naway with it. But it does mean we’re thinking carefully about this\ndesign and it’s a hard thing. I’m not aware of another language that’s\nreally tackled the problem in the way that we expect to tackle it over\nthe next few months.\n\nSo another language I think is interesting to compare to, in all of\nthis, is Rust.\n\nSo Rust is a language which tries really hard to do two things at the\nsame time which are not trivial to do at the same time. One is to give\nstronger sense of type safety so that you can write programs that\nyou’re confident aren’t going to crash, so you get lots of protection\nfrom bugs from the type system. And also give the user a lot of\ncontrol over low-level details over how memory is managed. And we’re\nessentially trying to push OCaml in some sense at that high level of\ndescription in the same direction.\n\nHow do you think the Rust approach differs from the approach you see\nus trying to take with OCaml?\n\nThis is a good comparison. This takes us a little bit away from\nunboxed types and polymorphism because I think the way that that\nappears in Rust is quite different. But the notion of this sort of\nfiner level of control is definitely accurate. But Rust gives up\nsomething really big to do what they do. They give up garbage\ncollection. Within Jane Street and generally in programming, I think a\nlot of the time garbage collection is fantastic, right? It allows us\nto program without worrying about these low-level details that for\nmost programs, we don’t need to.\n\nSo, for instance, when I’m writing the OCaml compiler—which is written\nin OCaml, of course—I do want it to be performant, but I don’t really\ncare about microsecond latency. And so, I’m happy to write my compiler\nin a way that allocates a bunch of memory and then when it’s done with\nthat memory, the garbage collector comes and gets rid of it. This is\nreally, really convenient. In Rust, we don’t have that. In Rust, we\nare forced to think about memory, allocation, and deallocation at\nevery point in time. And this gives us this fine level of control, but\nit comes at a real cost, and it means now we’re sort of fighting\nagainst this ‘pay-as-you-go principle’ that we were talking about\nearlier. In Rust, for memory, you don’t pay as you go. Everyone has to\npay all the time for Rust fine memory control. So we wanna keep the\nhigh-level, garbage-collected OCaml for most applications, and then\nwhen we really want to have this fine level of control, we wanna have\nthat, too.\n\nAnd so, some of the work that we’re doing is around adding that finer\nlevel of control, but just where we need it.\n\nSo, one thing I wonder is whether this pay-as-you-go principle really\napplies in general or whether it’s like itself a kind of trade-off? I\nthink, if you’d asked the question of like, ‘well we should think of\ntypes in general as pay-as-you-go.’ Maybe your baseline should be by\ndefault untyped, and then when you want some extra control, you should\nadd types to it and lock it down more.\n\nThat seems in principle reasonable. But all the languages that I’ve\ndealt with that have pay-as-you-go types or what you might call\ngradual type systems, actually inherit quite a lot of complexity and\nproblems from that choice. It’s often simpler and better, at least for\nsome kinds of problems, to have a uniform approach where you sort of\nfigure out what trade-offs you wanna do and you kind of apply those\ntrade-offs uniformly. And I think, at least from my perspective, the\nbase choice you make in a language like Haskell or OCaml of like,\n‘actually, even though it has some ups and downs, we’re just going to\nhave types everywhere and that’s just how it’s gonna be,’ I think is\nat least a reasonable place in the trade off space of designs.\n\nAnd I wonder if the same is true about this kind of thing about\npay-as-you-go control? Whereas, I can imagine for some kinds of\napplications, you would want the property that, ‘yeah, I am explicit\nabout memory everywhere. I kind of have a hard guarantee that anywhere\nI look I have all of this extra information.’ I don’t know. How do you\nthink about this question of where pay-as-you-go is the right way or\nthe wrong way to think about designing something?\n\nI think that’s a great question and I agree. I mean, pay-as-you-go\ntypes, people have wanted that for some time. It hasn’t ever really\nhappened. And, I mean, you could almost say that C++ and C have\npay-as-you-go types and that they have type systems, but the type\nsystems are sort of completely broken.\n\n(laughs) Pay-as-you-go but then what do you get? I like that.\n\nWell, right, but, I mean, just to clarify for our listeners. What I\nmean by ‘completely broken’ is that at any point in time in C and C++\nyou can just say, ‘Oh, ignore the type system. And I’m gonna just take\nthis thing and change its type to be something else.’ And the\nlanguages, you know, they take this stance of, trust the programmer,\nthat when the programmer decides to do this, that this is a good\nidea. But we lose the guarantees that one would want from a type\nsystem like that when you dereference a pointer that there’s actually\nsomething there when you dereference it.\n\nSo, getting back to memory control, I like the idea of pay-as-you-go\nthere, or maybe it’s not even pay-as-you-go as much as a language that\ncan have multiple different modes of use with very easy interop. In\nthat we can have a system where there’s not fine memory management,\nthat you just sort of use the current OCaml’s system of uniform memory\nrepresentation, and then another part where maybe this particular team\nor this particular file says, ‘No, no. Here I really want careful\nmemory management.’ This is a different kind of pay-as-you-go. It’s\nsort of at the file level or something like that, or the package\nlevel, I suppose. And then as long as one piece of code can easily\ncall the other, that also works well.\n\nWe also see this kind of idea coming out in polyglot systems where we\nactually have multiple languages all calling one another because maybe\nthis part of the system is easier to write in some language, that part\nof the system is easier to write in some other language. It’s all a\nway of, these sort of different approaches to attack the same problem\nthat we don’t wanna have all of this complexity. We want to sort of\nnarrow down what complexity we have, where.\n\nRight. So there’s almost a notion of different dialects within the\nsame language?\n\nWith a really high quality FFI that really captures all of the\nimportant details so you can kind of interoperate, right? In fact, the\nwork of polyglot stories are actually really challenging to\nengineers. There’s like, a ton—\n\n… of hard work. I mean, we’ve done a bunch of work trying to get the\nPython-OCaml interop story working just right. We’ve made good\nprogress there but it’s actually quite challenging. And I feel like\nthe work is quadratic in the number of different (laughs) languages\nthat you need to hook together ‘cause it’s often unique, weird issues\nthat come with every pairing of things that you wanna make all one to\nthe other.\n\nI think that’s right. And that’s one of the appeals of having one\nlanguage that maybe is flexible enough to operate in multiple\ndifferent modes. So, in particular, in our design for unboxed types,\nwe are planning to make a box operation explicit. And the box\noperation is going to be ‘the spot’ that allocates memory. And so,\nnormally, you’ll be able to get uses of this box operation for\nfree. Programmers won’t ever notice it, they won’t write it. It just,\nall the existing code will have all the boxes inserted. But it would\nbe really easy to imagine some kind of compiler setting that turns\nthat feature off. Meaning that every time you wanna allocate memory,\nyou have to explicitly ask for it.\n\nSo this doesn’t bring you all the way to Rust, in that there’s still a\ngarbage collector operating, you still don’t have to manually\ndeallocate memory. But if I wanna write a program that absolutely,\nwhere every allocation is known, we haven’t designed this out. Maybe\nwe’re gonna go there, maybe we’re not gonna go there. Nothing is for\ncertain. But it turned out that in our design, it just naturally fell\nout that we could just add this compiler flag that just turns off\nboxing and it would be super easy to implement and we could experiment\nto see how easy it is to work with.\n\nSo, here we’re talking about a lot of very ambitious changes to\nOCaml. One uncomfortable fact about all of this is, like, we don’t own\nOCaml, we are not the (laughs) primary upstream developers. Every time\nwe wanna make a change to OCaml, there’s a bunch of people who we have\nto convince that it’s a good change. So one of the things that you’re\nthinking about in particular is, the kind of relationship of the work\nthat we’re doing here and our connection to the larger OCaml\ncommunity. Say a little bit more about how you think about this whole\nprocess.\n\nSo, I wanna start by pushing back against ‘unfortunate fact.’ I don’t\nsee that as an unfortunate fact at all. So OCaml was born as a\nresearch project out of Inria in France and still is there. That’s\nsort of its beating heart. And we are really significant benefactors\nof that work that others have done, that others continue to do. And\nso, Jane Street has chosen to work in part of this open source\nlanguage community where we’re taking others’ ideas and we’re\ncontributing our ideas back.\n\nSo in this podcast and in our work, we have these grand ideas. ‘Oh,\nwe’re gonna add this to OCaml. We’re gonna do this, we’re gonna do\nthat. Of course, what I really mean is, we’re going to experiment with\nthis idea internally. And then as that experiment unfolds, as we gain\nexperience and become more sure that it’s a right—I shouldn’t say a\nright idea. There’s many right ideas. But as we gain more confidence\nin a particular design, we can then work with the rest of the OCaml\ncommunity to try to make this part of everyone’s OCaml and not just\nJane Street’s.\n\nAnd in that way, we’re giving back to that community. At the same\ntime, we’re continuing to reap rewards from other work happening in\nthat community. So the biggest example of which is the multicore\nsupport that’s coming in OCaml 5. Still gonna be some time before Jane\nStreet’s ready to upgrade to OCaml 5. But that was a huge pile of work\ndone mostly outside, or maybe entirely outside of Jane Street’s walls,\nand we benefit by being part of this open source ecosystem. And so, I\nthink that this is a really great place to be where we’re\nparticipating, we’re getting new input of technical content, like\nmulticore OCaml, as well as design ideas. And I’m even thinking of\nsomething just a few weeks ago where I found an infelicity in the\ncompiler, made an improvement, pushed that upstream, and then we got\nfresh ideas from folks outside of Jane Street’s walls about, ‘Here’s\nactually an even better way to do it,’ and that was great. And then we\ncould incorporate that here. Without being part of this open source\necosystem, we wouldn’t have gotten that insight and we would be poorer\nfor it.\n\nSo, in the Haskell world, you spent a lot of time working on exciting\nnew type system features for Haskell and now you’re doing, in\nsubstance, similar kinds of work here. But I think that work flow is\npretty different, right? I think then, in the Haskell world, it was\nlike the primary work and ideation and evaluation was all deeply\nintegrated from the beginning in the open source world. And here,\nwe’re doing this work where we’re still open source, still, you know,\nyou can go look at the results on GitHub. But we are mostly iterating\ninternally, and then, over time, as we gain experience, as we gain\nmore confidence that the things we’ve built are good ideas, working to\nsee what subsets of these we can get upstreamed. I’m curious how that\nhas changed your feeling about the work, how it changes the texture of\nthe work that you do?\n\nSo working within the context of Jane Street gives us a lot more\nopportunity for experimentation. So a real big challenge of doing\nlanguage design is that, by necessity, you come up with an idea and\nmaybe you think it’s a good idea and you experiment with it on a few\nsmall programs on your own machine or you get your friend to sort of\nexperiment. You bounce the idea. Maybe, you know, you’re even\nproactive and you convene a committee of experts on this idea and now\nyou have, you know, five people thinking really hard about this one\nidea and trying to come up with the absolute best design.\n\nBut then, once you come up with the design, if you’re just in an open\nsource environment—without the context of a place like Jane Street—you\ndevelop the idea, implement it, and release it, and then now you have\nthousands or hundreds of thousands of programmers using it, and maybe\nit was a bad idea. But by the time you discover that it was a bad\nidea, it’s a little bit too late because maybe you have 90,000\nprogrammers who think it’s a bad idea, but you have a thousand who\nthink it’s a fantastic idea and will be very, very, very upset if you\nbreak their programs by changing it. And now you’re in a bad way.\n\nAnd even the people who think it’s a bad idea, who would like to get\nrid of it, don’t necessarily want you to break their programs in the\ninterim before they’ve (laughs) stopped relying on the feature.\n\nThat’s right. And so, it’s really, really hard to make changes to a\nproper open source programming language. In the context of Jane Street\non the other hand, it’s—I don’t wanna say dead easy. There’s work\ninvolved, but it is tractable and somewhat easy in that we can develop\nan idea, push it out there, get other programmers in the firm to start\nusing it, and then as that happens, we can say, ‘Mm. This isn’t quite\nworking out the way that we thought it would.’ That, you know, theory\nmeets reality, and theory loses.\n\nAnd so, then we can make a change to the feature and we have sort of\nan operation that we use internally called a ‘tree smash,’ where some\nJane Street engineers work together to come up with a big diff that\nhappens to all of Jane Street’s code, all at once, and we can change\nthe spelling of a keyword if we want to. And in fact, we’re imagining\nthis now. So Jane Street has been working on a feature called ‘local\ntypes’ or ‘stack allocation.’ These two things are kind of the same\nthing. And we’re realizing that one aspect of the design was just a\nbit wrong. And there’s already a ton of code written using the old\ndesign, but we’ve invented a new keyword and a new place for the\nkeyword to appear, and all this stuff.\n\nAnd so, it’s gonna be some work to fix it, but there’s no part of us\nthat’s saying, ‘Oh no. Now we need to think about a migration plan and\nwe need to make sure that no one is too unhappy with this.’ We’re just\ngonna go do it. And so, it means by the time we get to upstreaming,\neverything is battle-tested. And so, it just increases the level of\nconfidence in the design when we go through that process.\n\nOne of the concerns I could see people having about this kind of\nprocess is, it’s going to do a lot of training on, ‘What are the\nrequirements within Jane Street?’ But there are all sorts of ways in\nwhich you could imagine the requirements in Jane Street and outside of\nJane Street being different. I’m curious how you think about the\ndesign process in a way where you end up with language features that\nare likely to be of quite general utility, ‘cause I think, in the end,\nthe only ones you’re gonna get accepted upstream are the ones that\npeople think are more broadly useful than just being useful for us.\n\nSo that’s indeed a challenge, right? It’s a challenge of overfitting,\nright? We have a very particular style of code within Jane Street and\na very particular use case that we’re working on. I think that is sort\nof a harder question to answer in some sense. I think one way that we\naddress that is by seeking outside feedback from the very\nbeginning. So, the plan that we have for unboxed types, another Jane\nStreet engineer, Stephen Dolan, he made a presentation about this\ndesign for unboxed types, I think in 2019. We’ve been thinking about\nthis for a long time. The local types and stack allocation feature,\nthis has also been featured in a number of presentations that we’ve\nmade to the OCaml community, out in public.\n\nAnd so, by incorporating that process early, we can get broad\nfeedback. That’s not the kind of feedback that tells us, ‘Oh, should\nthe keyword go here, or should it go there?’ Right? That’s the kind of\nthing that we develop internally. But I think that, by giving these\npresentations, by involving the broader community, even from the very\nbeginning, that helps to prevent some of this overfitting problem.\n\nSo, another interesting aspect of your background is, you’ve spent a\nlot of time, years really, working in the Haskell community and\nworking on Haskell. And now, you’re working on a totally new\nprogramming language using it both as the surface language in which\nyou write your programs, and also helping to design that language. I’m\ncurious, what struck you about difference? I’m curious, what are the\ndifferences that have struck you about Haskell and OCaml at multiple\ndifferent levels?\n\nIt’s been really fun over the past, I guess, six months now being part\nof these two language communities. So, I should say, I’m still quite\nactive in the Haskell world. I have not left the Haskell world. I’m\nliving both Haskell and OCaml on a daily basis. So let me think of a\ncouple of interesting points of comparison.\n\nSo, one is, it seems kind of simple, but actually I think it affects\nthe way that we program. The approach toward interfaces. In Haskell,\nyou tend to write your type signatures sort of right next to the\nfunction and Haskell uses a lot of type signatures. OCaml doesn’t so\nmuch. And so, OCaml there’s these separate interface files where you\ndefine the interface to your whole module, but it’s kind of apart and\nit means, in my experience, looking at a bunch of OCaml code. OCaml\ncode tends to be rather less documented than similar Haskell code, and\nI think that’s in part because in Haskell, you put your types right\nthere and that’s a form of documentation. And once you put your types\nin, then you can also put more documentation there and it becomes part\nof the habit of the Haskell programmer to put those comments right in\nthere.\n\nA flip side of this, is that Haskell has this feature called\ntypeclasses. And typeclasses allow you to use essentially one\nfunctioning to mean a variety of different things. OCaml doesn’t have\nthat feature. And so, what that can mean sometimes is that Haskell\ncode can become quite a bit harder to understand because if you have a\nbunch of these function names, any of which can mean a variety of\ndifferent things, all strung together, then it takes a lot of work on\nthe part of the reader to try to understand what on earth is going on\nthere. And that problem just doesn’t arise in OCaml. OCaml is much\nmore explicit about what operations it’s taking.\n\nSo maybe I can even, taking these two examples, generalize that a\nlittle bit and say, I find Haskell to be somewhat more explicit about\nwhat’s happening at compile time. Whereas, OCaml is somewhat more\nexplicit about what’s happening at runtime. So another place where\nthat comes into play is that, the Haskell compiler—and this connects\nwith a topic we were talking about earlier—the Haskell compiler\noptimizes much more aggressively than the OCaml one does. And that’s\nbecause in Haskell, Haskell’s a lazy language which means that if you\nsay, ‘Let X equal some big computation,’ we’re not gonna compute the\nbig computation until we need the value of X. In OCaml, if you say,\n‘Let X equal a big computation,’ we just compute that thing right\naway.\n\nAnd so, that means, on the one hand you might say, ‘Oh, well maybe\nHaskell is more efficient,’ because maybe some code path never uses\nthe value of X and so it means that we can discard that whole big\nthing. But it also means that it’s much harder to predict in Haskell\nhow fast your program is going to run or what its performance\ncharacteristics are gonna be. In OCaml, it’s much easier to predict\nthat. You can just sort of read your file top to bottom and, within a\nfunction, it just performs the operations that you see roughly in the\norder that you see them. And that means, OCaml again is more explicit\nabout what happens at runtime, but without some of the type\nannotations that we see in Haskell, a little less explicit about\nwhat’s happening at compile time.\n\nYou mentioned a couple of things that are different that I wonder if\nthey’re really language differences, or just cultural differences. If\nyou look at the tendency to do fewer type annotations on the\ndefinition of functions, you could put more type annotations. And I\nthink there are some people who write OCaml who do, but there’s\ncertainly a tendency not to and I think the Jane Street house style\ncertainly is one that does not have lots of type annotations, outside\nof interface files where those are essentially required everywhere.\n\nAnd the documentation thing, too, like, the interface files are a very\nnatural place to put documentation and I am constantly dissatisfied\nthat I think we put way too little documentation in the (laughs)\nplaces that we could. And I don’t know that there’s anything exactly\nabout the language that forces that. Like, I’m not sure that I buy\n‘the need to put type annotations right on functions’ is the thing\nthat really makes that difference.\n\nThat may be true. It’s hard to say. I do think that form follows\nfunction, function follows form a little bit, in that, when you’re\nused to describing the specification of a thing right next to that\nthing, that, to me, is going to encourage you to write\ndocumentation. Whereas, in OCaml, you write the specification over\nthere, in that other file, nowhere near where you write your\nimplementation. And sometimes I think that means that you’re less\nlikely to put those comments on the implementation when you need them.\n\nIt’s funny. My intuition is the opposite of, like, ‘Oh, I’ve written\nthis very bare interface file that just has types,’ and I think\nempathetically about the person who’s reading it. It’s like, ‘How will\nthey have any idea what this means? I had better put a comment here.’\n(laughs)\n\nRight. So the comment and the interface files are good, but I think\nit’s not just that. I mean, and this could also be, I have a bias in\nthat, most of the OCaml that I’m reading and writing is in the OCaml\ncompiler itself. Maybe this is different than everything else at Jane\nStreet. In fact, I’m sure it is. And it has been striking for me after\nspending so many years working in Haskell’s compiler, that Haskell’s\ncompiler has many, many, many more comments than OCaml’s compiler\ndoes. Maybe I’m overfitting on this particular piece of software\ninstead of just the language in general.\n\nI do think looking at the innards of a compiler is always a weird\nplace to think about how one should write code for the\nlanguage. Because, like, one of the facts about OCaml—as it is often\nthe case for many languages—is that OCaml was written by people who\ndidn’t yet really know how to program in OCaml kind of by\ndefinition. And lots of the code that’s there now has been there for a\nlong time and you can sorta see that. I think if you went to those\nsame people today and been like, ‘How would you write this now?’\nThey’d all be like, ‘Oh, really very differently.’ But, you know,\nparts of it just kind of haven’t been rewritten and have the shape\nthat they did years ago and are harder to understand than kind of\nanyone would exactly like it to be today.\n\nAnd to be fair, that exact same thing is true in the Haskell\ncompiler. There are stretches of that that no one would write it that\nway today. But it was written that way before anyone really knew how\nto program in Haskell.\n\nSo another difference that’s always struck me about Haskell is the\ndifferent approach to language extensions. And I think about this in\ntwo different ways. One is, OCaml is just massively more\nconservative. There was a period in time early in OCaml’s development\nwhere you could almost see the process of Ph.D. students\ngraduating. It’s like someone graduates, they write some language\nfeature, and it gets added to the language. And that stopped pretty\nearly in OCaml. OCaml got pretty conservative about making changes. It\nwas like, ‘No, no, no, we’re gonna add things that are like, really\ngood, and it was pretty restrictive about what would go in. And\nthroughout that time, it kind of had one language, pretty much. OCaml\nworked in one particular way and that was kinda that.\n\nHaskell on the other hand, has had a lot of glorious experimentation\naround language features and those experimental language features were\noften hidden behind pragmas, right? There’s lots of different things\nyou could turn on and off. And so there kind of isn’t one Haskell or\ntwo Haskells, but there’s like 10,000 different Haskells, depending on\nwhich collection of flags you wanna turn on or turn off. You have 10\ndifferent pragmas and now you have two of the 10 different possible\narrangements of the language features. I’m curious how you think about\nthose different sets of choices?\n\nYeah. I mean, that’s a great question. So I do have to push back\nagainst your sense of scale. So Haskell has, when I last counted, and\nthis was a few years ago, 150 or so extensions. So Haskell has\nactually 2150 languages.\n\nOuch, indeed. So I think that this comes from the origin of Haskell\nversus the origin of OCaml so actually you probably know more about\nthe origin of OCaml than I do. But I know Haskell was started by\ncommittee. There was a committee that met starting in, I think, 1989\ninto 1990, coalescing these ideas around a lazy functional programming\nlanguage. And then this eventually became a Haskell standard and there\nwere multiple different compilers for Haskell that all implemented the\nsame standard Haskell. And then maybe one compiler would think, ‘Ooh,\nwouldn’t it be fun if we had X?’ And so, then they would add that\nfeature, but everyone still wanted to make sure that it was a Haskell\ncompiler and not this other special language based on Haskell\ncompilers. So there was an idea of language extension. So you could\nhave base Haskell plus these various extensions.\n\nSo, in other words, OCaml is like Python and Haskell is like Scheme?\n\nSure. Yes. In that OCaml has a manual for the language, but there is\nnot a standard. There are not multiple different software artifacts\nthat all compile some OCaml language that exists beyond a single\ncompiler. But, in any case, going back to Haskell, that was the early\ndays of Haskell and there were multiple Haskell compilers. As time has\ngone on, all of the other ones have either died off or there are still\na few other Haskell compilers out there, but there’s not really an\nattempt to stay current with the newest features. And there’s really\nnow just one: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, or GHC. And that’s the one\nthat, when I say that there’s 150 language extensions, the GHC is\nsupporting that.\n\nAnd so, when you have multiple different things, if you wanted to find\na common core that all of these different compilers can interop with,\nit makes a lot of sense to have individual extensions when you say\nyou’re deviating from this common core. Now there’s really just one\ncompiler.\n\nI think that the current system, the current plan at Haskell, is not\nvery well motivated. And instead, the feedback that I hear from users\nis that they find the whole language extension system very heavy and\nit means that, to get much done in Haskell, you need to now start your\nfile with the list of 20 extensions that you’re using. And newcomers\ncan’t tell the difference between brand new experimental extensions\nthat might change from one compiler to another, or extensions that\nhave been around for 20 years, or there are some extensions that have\nbeen around for 20 years but actually we know are dangerous and you\nreally shouldn’t use.\n\nAnd when I say, ‘We know,’ I mean, like, I know this and a couple of\nother Haskellers know this, but someone just picking up the language\nwon’t know that. And I personally find that quite problematic. And so,\nthere’s a debate going on right now within the GHC Steering Committee\nwho is a body chosen to sort of help evaluate the evolution of the\nlanguage to reimagine all of this. And I’m hoping that we end up with\na structure that looks quite different from what we have today, while\nstill retaining backward compatibility.\n\nSo if you have your 20 language extensions at the top of your file,\nthat will continue to work in this new vision. But I am hoping that we\ncan reorganize it in a way that’s a little bit more user-friendly.\n\nDo you think in the end it would make sense to move toward something\nwhere there’s closer to one standard language that includes most of\nthe extensions, and so that most users end up not thinking about that\n‘two to the whatever’ configuration space?\n\nI do think settling on one standard language would be good. I think we\ncan get 80% of the way there and go from 150 extensions to maybe seven\nor something like that. I don’t think we’ll be able to get all the way\nthere because there’s just too many different use cases for Haskell,\nthere’s too many different people who have slightly different ideas of\nwhat that core should be. So if we just sort of got rid of the\nextensions mechanism, I think that that would cause too much of a rift\nin the community and probably not be tenable. But we can get close.\n\nSo, throughout this conversation, I feel like there’s been a\nparticular kind of vision and idea of what programming is that’s\nmotivated a lot of your thinking. And that has something to do with\nhaving a language that’s simultaneously expressive, it lets you say\nwhat you wanna say, but also has real tools for reasoning, in both\ntype systems and, you know, more sophisticated mode-dependent types,\nor essentially automated tools for reasoning about your program. So in\nthe last, I don’t know, few months, couple of years, there’s been an\nenormous amount of motion in a totally different direction for making\nprogramming better, which is various AI-assisted ways of making\nprogramming easier. With all of this kind of recent work on large\nlanguage models, things like ChatGPT, Codex, all of that, making an\nenormous difference to how people are programming on a regular\nbasis. I’m curious how you think about this and how it fits into your\nbroader way of thinking about programming?\n\nI see this evolution of sort of AI-assisted programming as not quite\nthe sea change that maybe others have seen it to be. I see it as a big\nstep. It’s not a small step change. But it doesn’t remove the need to\ncommunicate precisely. In that, to me, the interesting thing about a\nprogramming language is that it’s a mode of communication that is\nprecise. In a sense, that’s almost the definition of what makes a\nprogramming language a programming language, as opposed to some other\nkind of language. There’s a precise semantics to everything that is\nsaid in that language. And that language is used as a medium of\ncommunication, both from human to computer. That’s how we often think\nof it. But also from human to human.\n\nWith the advent of AI-assisted programming, now we have sort of a new\nmethod of communication in that it’s a communication from computer\nback to human. In that, you might have something like ChatGPT\nproducing the code, but a human still has to read that code and make\nsure that it does what you think it does. And as a medium of precise\ncommunication, it’s still very important to have a programming\nlanguage that allows that communication to happen.\n\nAnd so, this new mode of communication is going to put different\npressures on language design than what we’ve had in the past. But I\ndon’t think it removes the need for programming language design. But\nlike I said, it does create different pressures and these have been\nevident for some time in that one little maxim I’ve had in my head for\nyears now about language design is that you wanna optimize for\nreading, not for writing. Code gets read much more often than it gets\nwritten.\n\nAnd so, when designing a new language feature, maybe you’re thinking,\n‘Okay, I could do this very cleverly with, like, a nicely placed\ntwiddle in this spot in the code. And I could use that twiddle to mean\nsomething very important about my program. And maybe that’s very\nconcise, but it’s hard to read, it’s hard to search for, it’s hard to\ntrain new people to understand. Instead, it tends to be better to\nwrite out words in your design and programming language, that’s easier\nto search for, and easier to learn, and just easier to organize in\nyour brain. If we end up getting to a mode where humans are doing even\nless and less writing, and computers are doing more and more of it,\nthen those pressures just increase. And we wanna make the language\neasier to read and maybe even harder to write. Maybe we even get to a\npoint where if computers are doing all of the code generation, it’s\njust kind of, you know, symbolic and structured. It’s not just text.\n\nSo we get these richer programming languages but I just don’t see it\nas, there was yesterday and then there’s tomorrow and it’s gonna be\ntotally different and let’s just start from scratch. I see this as\njust one phase in evolution of this precise communication medium.\n\nOne of the things that’s really striking about these AI assistants, at\nleast in their current form, is they’re really surprisingly powerful,\nright? They can really do a kind of stunningly good job of taking a\nquery and understanding it and providing a piece of code that tries to\ndo what it is that you asked for it to do.\n\nBut they’re also strikingly fallible. They make lots of mistakes. And,\nyeah, the reading thing is pretty important because you ask ChatGPT\nor, you know, whatever your favorite large language model is, to write\na piece of code and look at the result. And it’s super easy for the\nresult to just be wrong in all sorts of different ways. And I can sort\nof see the rising requirement of making things more readable. I’m\ncurious how you think things like dependent types fit into this story?\n\nSo, dependent types in their essence are a way of writing precise\nspecifications. So the sorting example that I gave earlier, I\ndescribed that, you know, you could have a function instead of going\nfrom ‘a list of ints to a list of ints’ to something more\nglorious. Well, before dependent types, or you know, language without\ndependent types, you could just do that in comments. But probably in\nyour comments, you’re not going to be as precise as you could be if\nyou really wrote it in types, right? You say, you know, return to the\ninput list in ascending order, or something like that. But what does\nthat really mean?\n\nWe need a language where we can precisely specify what this function\nis doing. So as I said earlier, ascending isn’t quite right. I mean,\nif you write in a comment, ‘This returns the input list in ascending\norder,’ well, what if the input list has duplicates? Now you can’t\neven meet that specification. Where actually, that specification\ndoesn’t make any sense at all because the input list isn’t in\nascending order. What does that mean to say to put the input list in\nascending order? That’s a contradiction in terms, because the input\nlist isn’t in ascending order.\n\nAnd so, there’s some amount of interpretation that humans can provide,\ninterpretation that a large language model can provide, but in the\nend, it’s gonna come down to precise communication and\nspecification. And so, where do dependent types fit in? Well, they can\nbecome the input to the large language model. Maybe now we have\nprogrammers who are well-versed in precise communication of\nspecifications, not implementations, and we can say, ‘ChatGPT, give me\na function of this type.’ And then you have your nice type that takes\nan input list, and it returns an output list that is a permutation of\nthe input list in non-decreasing order and we specify that.\n\nAnd then now, that gives a nice specification for ChatGPT to go off\nand say, ‘Okay, here’s an implementation that meets that. Oh, and by\nthe way, it has this asymptotic running time because I’m a nice large\nlanguage model and I’m gonna tell you that.’ And then, now we actually\nhave a model by which we can check that the result meets its\nspecification if it is in this precise language of dependent types.\n\nAlthough I have to say, I think I am more pessimistic about the idea\nof people actually going off and writing down the specifications\neven. ‘Cause those are actually pretty hard to write.\n\nI wonder if a more plausible model is, you go to your large language\nmodel and say, ‘Please write me a specification for a function that\nsorts a list.’ And then it, like, spits something out. And then you\nlook at it and think, yeah, that seems about right. And then you go\nfrom there to next stages. But the role that this kind of concise\nspecification has, it’s like a smaller and maybe more readable thing\nthat you can use as part of verifying whether the later pieces in fact\ndo what you think they’re supposed to do.\n\nYes, but I think there’s a real danger here. I agree with what you say\nin that, writing a precise specification is hard. And humans are\nlazy. So if it’s hard, we’re gonna ask the computer to do it. If we’re\nasking the computer to write the specification of the function that\nit’s going to write, now we’re getting into thin ice. Because if we’re\nworking in a system where the human is not expert enough to be able to\nread the specification and know that it’s the right specification, now\nwe’ve lost. Now the computer can just sort of go off and do whatever\nit wants and we have no way of knowing whether it’s right or wrong\nbecause we’ve lost that ability to sort of have that precise\ncommunication.\n\nI think one of the tricky things here is, people are often pretty bad\nat the reading part of this, right? The idea if something gets written\nand now you have to read it, especially if it wasn’t written in a\nreally clear way, reading some piece of code that is not really\nwell-structured is actually really challenging. Like, one of the\nactually most important parts of the process of code review I find, is\nnot so much that, like, one person writes the code and someone else\nreads it to validate that it’s done the right thing. It’s more like,\nsomebody writes the code and the other person says, ‘Oh, man. This is,\nlike, too messy for me to even read.’ And then there’s some kind of\nback and forth process where you try and get something that’s actually\nsimple enough to be understood. And I think it’s an interesting open\nquestion of, like, as we start using more of these AI assistants, how\ngood they will be at generating things that are actually simple.\n\nAlthough, if we have precise specifications, the simplicity of the\nimplementation becomes less important.\n\nThat’s fair. I mean, in some sense there’s a kind of open\ntechnological question of, like, how good will large language models\nbe, acting as tactics for theorem provers?\n\nRight. Yeah. I mean, but if we’re in an environment where there is a\ntight correspondence between the specification and the implementation,\nand what I mean by ‘tight correspondence’ is this dependent type’s\nmodel where you can—and there’s other models, it’s not just dependent\ntypes, there’s refinement types, there’s other ways of checking an\nimplementation against a specification. But if we’re in an environment\nwhere we can check an implementation against a specification, the\nspecification is simple enough and communicated precisely whether\nthat’s in very careful natural language or probably not just natural\nlanguage ‘cause natural language is very, very squishy. But probably\nin some specification language, you could call that specification\nlanguage ‘dependent types’ if you want or you could call it something\nelse. But if we can communicate that specification, check the\nimplementation against the specification, now suddenly there’s not all\nthat much incentive to ever read the implementation.\n\nRight. It becomes a little bit like, you know, reading the output of\nthe compiler.\n\nYeah. It’s interesting. I do wonder whether a whole potential kind of\ndirection for innovation here, which you more or less have pointed in\nthe direction of, is designing languages that work usefully in this\nkind of intermediate things to generate in the process of working with\nsome kind of AI assistant. The thing that’s generated as an\nintermedium really affects the overall process of working on the\nsystem and generating confidence it’s doing the right thing. It’s not\na totally new problem, I guess, in the context of language design. But\nit does put new kinds of pressure and maybe changes the trade-offs\nthat show up.\n\nYeah, that’s right. I mean, you know, it’s too early, I think, to\nstart to design a programming language around this kind of\ninteraction. We’ve only been having these interactions with these\nassistants for a few months. And they’re changing fast. So I think now\nwould be the wrong time. In two years, maybe one could start thinking\nabout designing a language from scratch to do this. That sounds\nplausible to me. But I think a good starting point would be languages\nthat we have now because they’re designed for precise\ncommunication. That’s, in the end, what we need. And, again, maybe\nthere’s less pressure on the writing piece and more pressure on the\nreading piece. But I don’t think that they’re so divorced from each\nother that it means that we throw out everything we have and start\nfrom scratch. That seems, to me, pretty unlikely.\n\nThat makes sense. Well, thanks so much for joining me. This has been a\nlot of fun.\n\nYou’ll find a complete transcript of the episode, along with links to\nsome of the things that we discussed at signalsandthreads.com.

In that span, Paramount went through several corporate changes, from a ViacomCBS merger to the Paramount Skydance merger that closed in the summer of 2025.\n\n\"What we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message. \"But we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver.\"\n\nHou's Slack message was received warmly, with 118 \"care\" emojis, 67 classic \"red heart\" emojis, and 43 \"thank you\" emojis, among other signals of support as of early Thursday afternoon.\n\nSince Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison took over in early August, he's made several noteworthy moves, like landing UFC rights in the US and hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News.\n\nSeveral top executives have left the company as Ellison has taken control, including co-CEOs Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins, streaming head Tom Ryan, and international markets head Pam Kaufman.\n\nEllison is now focused on buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which has rejected its takeover offer eight times.\n\nParamount did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead Hou's Slack message to colleagues announcing the move:\n\nAs Dane shared in his note, I'll be transitioning out of my role and leaving the company at the end of January. After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next.\n\nWhat we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy — but we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver. Yet again and again, this team showed grit, creativity, and passion. Whether you came from Pluto or another part of Streaming, the story is the same: we took on impossible problems and innovated our way through.\n\nThe culture we live — being curious about everything, feeling that hunger to solve problems, caring deeply for others, iterating constantly, and innovating in everything we do — belongs to all of you now. You should be proud of what you've achieved, and you should be confident that this is a team that can handle anything thrown its way.\n\nAs to the future, I have a lot of confidence in Dane and the vision and strategic pillars he's laid out for the year ahead. They set a strong foundation for where this organization can go over the next several years, and I'm excited to see what you all do together under his leadership.\n\nI plan to hold my last open office hours next Friday so anyone who wants to drop in, ask questions, or just say hello/goodbye has a space to do that together. In the meantime, if you'd like to stay in touch beyond my time here, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\nServing alongside you has been one of the great privileges of my life, and I'll be proudly cheering you on as you write the next chapter together.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

While CES 2026 is (predictably) being dominated by AI shoehorned into various products this week, the show still has a few surprises up its sleeve. Between iterative gaming laptop upgrades for 2026 and flashy new OLED TVs, the event is also serving as a hub for interesting and weird technology.\n\nSome of this gear--like Razer's holographic AI companion tube--is already scheduled to be released later this year, while more experimental stuff, like brain-scanning headphones, are still a long way from being seen on store shelves. In case you couldn't make it to Las Vegas this year, here's a quick look at the technology that caught our eyes.\n\nAsus and XReal have teamed up for a new set of extended reality glasses, and on paper, these have some seriously impressive tech inside. Scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses and a dock that lets you connect them to a console or PC via HDMI and DisplayPort.\n\nWhat's better than one 3K 16-inch OLED screen on a gaming laptop? Two 3K 16-inch OLED screens, of course. While this isn't the first time Asus has experimented with a multi-monitor display on one of its ROG laptops, this new take on the Zephyrus Duo looks like a wild approach to dual-screen gaming.\n\nHolograms make everything cooler, and Asus is leveraging this technology to create a seriously cool PC gaming case. The Asus ROG GM1000 can use its case fans to project holographic images, and users can upload their own GIFs and short MP4s to create custom effects.\n\nGameSir might be onto something, as the idea of a gaming controller with a dedicated steering wheel right in the center sounds like a fun idea. You've got all the inputs you'd require from modern gaming, a direct drive motor, and up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering, the company claims (via The Verge). Pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed.\n\nGameSir's other big controller reveal was the X5 Alteron, a Swiss Army knife of a peripheral designed for iPad, iPhone, Android, and Nintendo Switch. HyperX is helping develop it, and the modular system lets you customize the controller with various modules. This means that you can customize it extensively with different D-pads, thumbsticks, and buttons to create your dream controller.\n\nA gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port, the 8BitDo FlipPad borrows heavily from the design of the classic Nintendo Game Boy. The company says it'll reveal more details on the Android and iOS controller ahead of its launch in Summer 2026.\n\nIt might look visually inspired by Nespresso coffee machines, but the new mid-tower case unveiled by CyberPowerPC at CES has an elegant quality. It has everything you'd expect--tempered glass panels, mesh ventilation, and ports--but the real showstopper here is a selection of knobs for controlling the LEDs on this sleek case.\n\n8BitDo makes some of the best controllers, and at CES 2026, it unveiled the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E wireless modular controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple devices, and Android. Just don't expect this to be a budget-friendly option, as the Ultimate 3E will retail for $150 at launch in Q2 2026.\n\nIf you're a fan of Kojima Productions--the studio headed by famed game developer Hideo Kojima--then you'll want to check out these new peripherals from Asus. This special-edition hardware features hand-drawn illustrations by Yoji Shinkawa--the art director for the Death Stranding games--and it'll launch on February 4.\n\nThe newly revealed Corsair Galleon 100 SD mechanical keyboard doesn't have a numpad, but it does have a built-in Elgato Stream Deck Plus. This part of the keyboard features 12 customizable buttons, a five-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and rotary dials. It launches on January 29 and it's priced at $350.\n\nRazer's Project Ava is aiming to be a holographic AI desktop companion that can fulfill several roles. From lifestyle reminders to gaming wingman, the device will come with several AI personalities and is expected to launch within the first half of 2026.\n\nWe're skeptical about this concept for a \"non-invasive\" gaming headset that supposedly improves your skills in competitive games, but at least Neurable and HyperX's protoype looks like a comfy set of brain-scanning cans.\n\nUltrawide monitors have become a popular option over the years, but laptop users can't enjoy them on the go--unless they want to lug a spare monitor around. That's where this concept for a rollable screen comes in: Lenovo is courting \"athletes who need pro-level performance\" with its gaming laptop. The screen can unfurl to 16, 21.5, and 24 inches.\n\nHyperX isn't the only company with AI-powered headphones at CES 2026, as Razer also showed off its Project Motoko concept. The idea behind this wireless headset is that it uses a ton of tech--including two 4K cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, near and far field microphones, and built-in AI--to serve a similar function to other AI wearables, like taking photos, translating foreign text, or conversing with an AI assistant.\n\nIt's not gaming tech, but this $399 ultrasonic chef's knife from Seattle Ultrasonics is the closest thing we have to owning a high-frequency blade in real life. Can it effortlessly cut through a Metal Gear mech? Probably not, but the vibrating piezoelectric ceramic crystals will let you slice through fruit and vegetables easily.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't have a new GPU to show off this year, the company did reveal its DLSS 4.5 upscaling technology. The company claims it can dynamically boost performance in compatible games, enabling up to 240+ frames per second with path tracing on 50-series GPU cards.",

    "fullText": "Wall Street remains bullish on AI, but the investment chief of a $12 billion firm thinks investors need to be careful not to pin all of their hopes on the technology.\n\nPeter Boockvar, the chief investment officer of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners, thinks greater opportunities lie outside of the AI trade despite the stellar gains it delivered for the market in 2025.\n\nMany of the tech sector's most dominant players, including Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, have stumbled out of the gate in 2026. Boockvar says the industry's previous growth isn't sustainable and that its days of dominance are numbered.\n\nIn his view, the AI trade won't function as the market-driving force that investors have come to know in recent years. While there will still be growth opportunities, being selective will be of much greater importance.\n\n\"Investors need to not just blindly rely on that AI tech trade as the leadership group, and understand that there are a lot of other parts of the market that can do well now.\"\n\nThe CIO said on CNBC that he believes market tides are slowly shifting in a direction that doesn't favor prominent AI stocks. In his view, the market has been showing signs of fatigue that some investors may be ignoring.\n\n\"I do think in 2026 the AI tech trade is losing some steam in terms of its dominance,\" he said. \"We've seen the market response to Nvidia's report a couple of months ago. We've seen the market punish Meta for its excessive spending.\"\n\nBoockvar pointed to the struggles of other top AI companies like Oracle, whose lackluster Q3 earnings prompted concerns of AI overspending, and also flagged CoreWeave, a stock that surged 90% in 2025 but still drew consistent concerns of excessive debt and potential lack of profitability.\n\n\"I think that entire trade is becoming more differentiated, that we've reached a point where investors are realizing they're going to be winners and they're going to be losers,\" Boockvar added.\n\nBoockvar highlighted surging capex in 2025 as part of his bearish thesis for this year, arguing that companies should diversify their spending beyond data centers.\n\n\"All the capex growth in 2025 was the data center building\" he said. \"Hopefully in 2026, with the tax incentives in terms of immediate expense, other parts of the economy can take that baton.\"",

    "fullText": "State residents worth more than $1bn could face one-off, 5% tax to help fund education, food assistance and healthcare\n\nA battle is brewing in California over a plan to tax billionaires – with tech titans divided over whether they should pay up, or flee the state.\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\n“We chose to live in Silicon Valley,” Huang said. “And whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with Google co-founder Larry Page, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they’re leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nThe tax proposal is being led by the labor union Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. If passed, the tax would retroactively apply to residents as of 1 January, and billionaires would have five years to pay it.\n\nThis means Huang would pay roughly $7bn and Page and Thiel would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $1.3bn, respectively, based on their current net worth.\n\n“What remains undeniable is the underlying unfairness of the current system,” Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for SEIU-UHW, said in an email. “Regular working people pay higher effective tax rates than the wealthiest Americans … Asking those who have benefited most from the economy to contribute more – particularly to stabilize health care systems under direct threat – is a reasonable step.”\n\nThe proposal is still in the beginning phases. Under California law, it needs to collect 874,641 signatures to qualify for the state ballot in November. It would also need to be signed by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who has said he opposes the wealth tax.\n\n“You can’t isolate yourself from the 49 others,” Newsom said when asked about wealth taxes during the New York Times DealBook Summit last month. “We’re in a competitive environment.”\n\nThis puts Newsom at odds with Ro Khanna, the California representative who represents Silicon Valley and who has championed the idea of a wealth tax. Khanna says tech billionaires will likely stay in the state, despite a tax, because California is where the larger industry, innovation and talent pool are located. “A billionaire tax is good for American innovation,” Khanna said, adding that it would spread the wealth to other sectors.\n\nWhen Thiel indicated he was leaving California because of the proposed tax, Khanna posted to X: “I echo what FDR said with sarcasm of economic royalists when they threatened to leave, ‘I will miss them very much.’”\n\nThis is not California’s first billionaire exodus. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, famously departed for Texas in 2020, which stood to save him millions in taxes. He has also shifted several of his companies’ headquarters there. Most recently, in 2024, Musk announced he was moving SpaceX to Texas because of a California law that aimed to protect transgender children in schools. He called the law a “final straw”.\n\nOther tech billionaires have also decamped to Texas, which has no state income tax. Citing a better tax environment, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale moved to Austin in 2020, and Larry Ellison transitioned Oracle’s headquarters there in 2020 (he has since said he’s moving the company to Nashville). Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, has long lived in Texas.\n\nSacks made his announcement on 31 December, posting an image of the Texas flag on X and saying: “God bless Texas.” In a separate post the following day, Sacks wrote: “As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.”\n\nMusk, Lonsdale and Dell all responded with hearty welcomes. “No one will fight harder for the independent and free spirit of Texas than people who know [sic] it’s like when that’s taken away,” Musk wrote.\n\nPage has not publicly said where he’s moving, but in December companies associated with the Google co-founder filed documents to incorporate in Florida, according to the New York Times. Thiel, who owns a home in the Hollywood Hills, also seems to have set his sights on Florida. His investment firm, Thiel Capital, announced on 31 December that it had opened an office in Miami. The firm said Thiel has maintained a personal residence in the city since 2020.\n\nOn X, tech investors and other billionaires have blasted the proposed wealth tax. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook executive, said that without billionaires, California’s “budget deficit will only get bigger”, and Vinod Khosla, another investor, said that under the proposed tax, “California will lose its most important taxpayers and net off much worse”.\n\nSome have indicated they’d work to oust Khanna from Congress. Martin Casado, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote that Khanna had “devolved into an obnoxious jerk” and that his support of the wealth tax had alienated him from moderates. In response, Garry Tan, the CEO of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote: “Time to primary him.”\n\nThe SEIU’s Jimenez said states like Massachusetts and Washington, which have other forms of wealth taxes, have seen billions of dollars raised to help the state. At the same time, she said, high-income residents have continued to see their portfolios grow. Jimenez added that the union is “heartened” by Huang’s recent comments and is hopeful that more billionaires will follow suit.\n\nAs for Huang, he said Nvidia is in Silicon Valley because that’s where the engineers are and he’s not worried about a billionaire tax.\n\n“Not this person,” Huang said. “This person is trying to build the future of AI.”\n\nRepresentatives for Page, Thiel, Sacks and Newsom did not return requests for comment.",

IWF analysts said the images would be considered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under UK law.\n\nThe UK-based Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said users of a dark web forum boasted of using Grok Imagine to create sexualised and topless imagery of girls aged between 11 and 13. IWF analysts said the images would be considered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under UK law.\n\n“We can confirm our analysts have discovered criminal imagery of children aged between 11 and 13 which appears to have been created using the tool,” said Ngaire Alexander, the head of the IWF’s hotline, which investigates reports of CSAM from members of the public.\n\nX, Elon Musk’s social media platform, has been deluged with images of women and children whose clothes have been digitally removed by the Grok tool, sparking public outcry and condemnation from politicians.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, the House of Commons women and equalities committee said it would no longer use X for its communications, saying it was no longer appropriate to do so given preventing violence against women and girls was among its key policy areas.\n\nThe decision marks the first significant move by a Westminster organisation to exit X in response to the misuse of Grok. While the decision concerned only the committee’s account, some individual members, including the Labour chair, Sarah Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.\n\nAlexander said the imagery viewed by the IWF has been used to create even more extreme material – known as Category A, which includes penetrative sexual activity – using a different AI tool.\n\n“We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material. Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream. That is unacceptable,” Alexander added.\n\nMusk’s xAI, which owns Grok and X, has been approached for comment.\n\nDowning Street said “all options were on the table”, including a boycott of X as ministers backed the UK regulator, Ofcom, to take action.\n\nOn Wednesday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “X needs to deal with this urgently and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users.\n\n“It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law.”\n\nRequests for Grok to manipulate images of women to “put her in a bikini” continued to flood in on X on Wednesday. Despite the warnings of EU and UK regulatory action, there was no evidence that the platform had installed tighter safeguards, and pictures of teenage girls continue to be stripped down digitally at the request of X users, to show them in small, revealing items of underwear, or positioned in sexually explicit poses.\n\nSome users have demanded more extreme content, asking the chatbot to decorate bikinis with swastikas, or requesting alterations to photographs of women so they appear to be victims of abuse. The chatbot has obliged by adding cigarette burns, facial bruising, and blood to some images of women.\n\nThe UK’s data watchdog – the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) – said it had contacted X and xAI “to seek clarity on the measures they have in place to comply with UK data protection law and protect individuals’ rights”, adding people have “a right to use social media knowing their personal data is being handled lawfully and with respect”.\n\nX has said it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, “by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary”.",

    "fullText": "Ford said it's developing autonomous capabilities, such as eyes-off driving, that will be ready for public roads by 2028.\n\nThe legacy automaker said in an announcement on Wednesday that it will be cheaper to develop self-driving technology in-house than to seek an outside supplier.\n\n\"Because we own the technology behind our driver assistance systems, we can deliver significantly more capability at a 30% lower cost than if we bought it from outside suppliers, which makes advanced driver assistance scalable,\" Ford announced during CES in Las Vegas.\n\nChris Morse, a spokesperson for Ford, told Business Insider that the cost is compared to \"the supplier system that we have on-road today.\" A specific supplier was not named.\n\nKey team members behind Ford's ADAS ambitions gave Business Insider a broad overview of some of the advantages of an in-house approach.\n\nSammy Omari, head of ADAS and infotainment at Ford Motor Company, said the company can have greater oversight over how the sensors are utilized and integrated into the vehicles.\n\n\"How can we now combine the information from all these sensors in the most cost-effective way to get to the highest performance?\" he said. \"These are some of the key reasons why we can get to that price point.\"\n\nPaul Costa, a former Apple employee who now leads Ford's electrical engineering team, told Business Insider that the company can reduce the number of separate computer modules inside its vehicles — an ADAS computer, an infotainment system, an audio system, and a networking computer — into one computer without having to compromise performance.\n\nCosta said Ford has \"great suppliers,\" but seeking third parties doesn't allow for integration of modules, and the size of the computers themselves is larger.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" he said. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nThere are several players in the business of licensing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for car makers, including Nvidia, Waymo, and Wayve, among others. Ford previously announced a partnership with Mobileye in 2020 to develop its ADAS software, called BlueCruise.\n\nA spokesperson for Mobileye declined to comment.\n\nLeading EV companies in the US — namely Tesla and Rivian — have taken an in-house approach to developing their own self-driving technology. Rivian announced earlier in December that it designed its own silicon chip to power the autonomous driving computer inside its future vehicles.\n\nCosta told Business Insider that Ford isn't interested in making its own chip and the automaker is happy with its current suppliers.\n\n\"We're not interested in a TOPS war,\" Costa said, referring to a metric chipmakers commonly like to tout.\n\n\"Honestly, I don't want custom silicon,\" he later added. \"If I can get other people's volume on silicon that I need, that is good for democratization.\"",

    "description": "The 'Best of CES' award winners are official, highlighting the best new tech that CES had to offer.",
    "fullText": "In the middle of the Las Vegas Convention Center, amidst the world's largest tech trade show, an awards show was taking place. The audience included nominees ranging from large companies like Nvidia to scrappy startups introducing themselves to the world, alongside journalists, tech insiders, and enthusiasts gathering to watch the Best of CES 2026 awards. After days of scouring showroom floors, speaking with innovators about their new technologies, and deliberating for six hours, finalists and winners were chosen by experts from CNET, PCMag, Mashable, ZDNET, and Lifehacker. I had the privilege of helping to judge and present several awards, and aside from my gratitude for the experience, my takeaway was simple: There's a lot of new technology worth being excited about.\n\nCNET Group, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association, awarded winners across 22 categories, plus a 'Best Overall' award. To qualify for a Best of CES award, a product or service had to be an official exhibitor at CES 2026 and either include a compelling new concept or idea, solve a major consumer problem, or set a new bar in performance, design, or quality. The official Best of CES 2026 winners were announced live Wednesday, Jan. 7, at 4 p.m. PT. Here are all the finalists and winners of Best of CES 2026.\n\nTombot's Jennie has been capturing hearts at CES for years, but the realistic robot puppy is finally launching in 2026. Designed to comfort seniors with dementia and help combat loneliness, Jennie is packed with sensors and motors, allowing it to move its head to look at you, raise its eyebrows, wag its tail, and bark when you ask if it wants a treat. Seniors at a memory care facility we visited loved Jennie.\n\niGuard is a smart stove shutoff that helps older adults age in place.

This alternative to Bluetooth and WiFi is still a concept, but it has some upsides to conventional data protocols such as less power drain and less potential for clogged signal.\n\nLenovo Legion Pro Rollable Concept (Winner)\n\nRollable OLED displays have been a thing for a couple years, but they’ve been limited to enterprise laptops, if they ever even come out. The Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept uses this tech to bring ultrawide gaming to a laptop for the first time. Is the future rollable? We don’t know, but either way it’d be the perfect portable battlestation.\n\nA gaming PC with multiple monitors has become the norm, and while portable monitors have been around for a while, there haven't been many ways to have this experience built-in to a laptop. The Asus Zephyrus Duo takes the multiple-display idea Asus has been playing with since the original Zephyrus Duo and expands it to something actually useful: a full second display.\n\nXreal’s AR glasses are some of the best, and now PC company ASUS is partnering with Xreal to make them better, especially for gamers. These AR glasses have everything even the pickiest player needs, giving you a virtual 171-inch screen right on your face. That screen is OLED and 1080p, but the real kicker is the 240hz refresh rate. It’s smooth big-screen gaming, on the go.\n\nThe Ecoldbrew combines a portable grinder and brewer into a compact gadget that whips up a batch of cold brew coffee in five minutes. The cleverly designed device slots onto its own thermos, but it's a common size so you can easily attach it to the top of your own thermos if you have one that you love. Slated to launch on Kickstarter soon, it starts at an affordable $99.\n\nSeattle Ultrasonics' C-200 UltraSonic Chef's Knife has a Japanese steel blade that vibrates about 30,000 times per second. Its movement is so subtle that you can't see or hear it move, but you will notice how effortlessly it slices through food without clinging to it. The C-200 retails for $399, a similar price point as other nice knives. The first batch ships this month.\n\nWe've covered our fair share of smart ovens at CES but Apecoo has boiled it down to the essentials. This compact cooker uses a camera above and scale below to ID food type and size and then deploys a precise cooking program pulled from a deep AI algorithm. Perfectly cooked steak, anyone? This machine can determine the exact thickness of meat or volume of veggies like no oven before it. The oven even recognizes multiple types of food at once and uses appropriate cooking times and temps for each. Best of all, it's about half the size of a typical smart oven.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 Aura Edition (Winner)\n\nModular laptop designs for greater serviceability and sustainability are a definite trend at CES 2026, and the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best example of it. Lenovo’s flagship business laptop introduces its Space Frame design that lets you access and replace individual parts when something breaks instead of needing to buy a new laptop.\n\nYes, it's clearly inspired by the MacBook Pro, but MSI's big, redesigned Stealth pours on the special sauce. This thin rig deploys Intel's Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) CPUs and GeForce graphics up to a roaring RTX 5090, alongside amped-up cooling and airflow. Plus, a new, subtler MSI design and a 240Hz Gorilla Glass panel will excite gamers and prosumer creators alike.\n\nAsus' Zenbook Duo is a niche device, but it's the most elegant expression of a dual-screen laptop we've seen yet. The 2026 Zenbook Duo has matured on its design with notable improvements from last year: thinner bezels, a more sturdy kickstand, and a better hinge. Powered with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 386H CPU, it’s well-equipped for diverse creative workloads.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold (Winner)\n\nThe culmination of Samsung's efforts to make a sleeker and more versatile folding phone. It's a true hybrid gadget that's a standard phone when closed and opens up to a sprawling 10-inch display, making this a practical, two-in-one device that fits securely in your pocket.\n\nThe Motorola Razr Fold is a solid entry in the book-style folding phone category thanks to its large screens, clean software, and powerful cameras. Together with stylus support, it's a fine option for those who need a device that's focused on productivity\n\nThe OhSnap Mcon is a Bluetooth controller with a slide-out plate to mount your iPhone (via MagSafe) or Android phone (via magnets) for a portable gaming experience. The pocketable accessory can be used in three ways: as a mounted handheld device, a wireless gaming controller, and a docked gaming console when your phone is connected to an external monitor.\n\nCoro feels like a product that should have existed for years. It solves the problem of measuring how much your baby is eating in a simple and meaningful way. I wish it was around when my babies were young.\n\nEarflo is a medical device designed to look and work like a sippy cup for kids as young as two. When you sip from the cup, a small mask forms a seal on your nose, and with each swallow, air flows through the nose. The pressure on the nasal cavity helps releasing trapped fluid in the ear. In a peer-reviewed study, after four weeks of Earflo use, 90 percent of children did not need ear tube surgery three months later.\n\nKids and parents already spend quality time building with Lego. Now, in Lego's CES debut, the company is launching its new Smart Bricks as part of its new Smart Play platform, which brings Lego creations and characters to life. Lego Smart Brick includes a tiny chip inside that enables Legos to tell color, direction, distance, sound and more. Now Lego creations can interact with families, enabling more time together.\n\nSatellai's new collar (Satellai Collar Go) and software (Petsense AI) are proactive tools that could flag subtle behavioral shifts in your dog before they become obvious health problems. It can also warn you when your dog has left your yard, and retails for a reasonable $79.\n\nPawport launched its smart pet door in late 2025. The pet door uses ultra-wideband technology, which can detect how close your dog is to the door. That lets you customize how close your dog needs to be before the door opens, both coming in and out of the house. It also extends the collar tags’ battery life from 12 to 18 months.\n\nOne of the devices debuting is the Yumshare Daily Feast, an automatic wet cat food feeder Petkit describes as its first entry into robotic wet feeding. The unit can dispense scheduled meals over seven days while monitoring consumption through an integrated camera, and can automatically discard spoiled and leftover food.\n\nOf the many humanoid robots to have made their debut at CES 2026, it's Boston Dynamics' Atlas that stands out as the best of the bunch. The prototype version demoed at the show impressed us with its naturalistic walking gait, meanwhile the sleek product version is ready to be deployed into Hyundai manufacturing facilities from this year, where it might just be working on your next car.\n\nThe Solar Mars Bot may never make it to Mars, but it solves several problems with portable generators. It's far easier to move wherever you need and it can chase the sun without intervention.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nThe Roborock Saros Rover can traverse the biggest obstacle for robot vacuums: stairs. It's the first model that can navigate to different floors on its own without the help of a separate attachment. It pulls off this feat thanks to a pair of bendable legs that it controlls independently to avoid obstacles, and it can even clean stairs as it climbs.\n\nThe Lockin V7 Max is a new smart lock that doesn't require recharging or replacing its batteries. Instead of using a removable battery, the V7 Max uses Lockin AuraCharge, an external device that you plug in approximately four meters away, sending a light beam to a receiver on the lock. The lock converts the light into energy to charge its battery.\n\nThe Robotin R2 is the first robot vacuum that can wash and dry a carpet, just like a carpet cleaner. It comes with a core module and two modular attachments that let it switch from vacuuming and mopping to carpet washing and drying. It takes about one hour to clean a 300-400 square foot room and two hours to dry. There's also an absolutely massive base station with two clean water tanks, a large dustbin and a dirty water tank.\n\nThis might save lives. A French startup has created a $200 portable device to test food samples for allergens. The startup, Allergen Alert, only had mock-up devices at CES, but it's licensing the tech from French biofirm bioMérieux. If the startup can pull off the food testing, the impact could be huge. Expect it to arrive in this year's second half.\n\nIf the name sounds familiar, it's because Pebble was the first company to popularize smartwatches in 2010s. After several company moves, the brand is back as a startup with a new lineup of affordable watches with battery life improvements and improved form factors. It also has a new AI ring.\n\nThe Nirva AI jewelry is a startup that aims to continuously learn from your real-world behavior by recording your audio throughout the day. From those recordings, it offers advice on work, relationships and everyday decision-making. Nirva positions itself as a personal AI companion, designed to understand your life as you live it. Think of it as \"audio journaling\" after a long day.\n\nClear Drop Soft Plastic Compactor (Winner)\n\nAnxious about plastic waste? Clear Drop's Soft Plastic Compactor can mash them into dense bricks to send off to be recycled into products like patio furniture. Clear Drop's product and subscription ensures none of your recycled soft plating ends up in a landfill.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nCambridge Consultants Ouroboros smartwatch\n\nUshering in the new age of right-to-repair legislation is this concept smartwatch design from Cambridge Consultants. It's proof that you can make a smartwatch that allows for self repair without compromising on design or user experience.\n\nThere's plenty of talk about autonomy in cars, but Stutt brings the next-generation technology to an accessible application. The Ev1 mobility scooter can map and then navigate spaces autonomously, allowing people to get around via voice commands. It can also autocorrect manual navigation to prevent bumping into obstacles. This is the rare device that combines mobility, accessibility and autonomy, and it's hard not to be impressed.\n\nDolby Atmos adds a literal new dimension to car audio. However, not everyone can buy a new luxury car just to upgrade their listening experience. Pioneer’s Sphera receiver allows almost anyone to add Dolby Atmos via Apple CarPlay to the car they already own with the speakers already installed and immerse themselves in spatial audio.\n\nPromising huge improvements in energy density, charging speed and safety, solid state battery tech is a holy grail for electric cars, home energy, drones and a host of other applications. Donut Lab is first to market with a solid state battery in a production EV which can be found in partner Verge Motorcycles’ TS Pro Gen 2.\n\nWheelchairs are available at airports, hotels, resorts, theme parks, and cruises, but standard wheelchairs require ongoing effort, and they can struggle through difficult terrain. WheelMoves is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are.\n\nThe Jitlife JS07i is a rideable suitcase that travelers can use to drive long distances through airports. It's the size of a standard cabin bag but carries up to 250 pounds, has a maximum speed of 8 miles per hour, and can travel six miles on a charge. Already popular overseas, rideable luggage is making its way to the US, and Jitlife is the best we tried.\n\nThe Samsung S95H is the most impressive TV we saw at CES for a number of reasons, firstly, it’s 35 percent brighter than before. Secondly, it’s a wired TV which is great for gaming, but it has a wireless option for a cleaner look and which enables more connections. Thirdly, it’s the first OLED that can show artwork from the Samsung Art Store — the S95H has anti-burn-in technology that enables it to work like a Frame TV, but with even better image quality.\n\nThe 116UXS builds on the still very new and promising RGB LED TV concept by adding even more color to the mix. Its mini-LED backlight array uses red, green, and blue LEDs, then adds a fourth sky blue (cyan) LED that Hisense says lets it cover 110 percent of the BT.2020 color range.\n\nThe W6 is LG's \"wallpaper\" TV, an OLED TV only 9mm deep that can be mounted nearly flush against a wall. It's one of LG's brightest OLEDs yet, and it's almost completely wireless thanks to its Zero Connect box you can place up to 30 feet away to send it video and its Dolby Atmos FlexConnect-powered LG Sound Suite support for building a spatial audio system around it.\n\nHaving a tiny animated girl living on a small screen inside a physical cylander case is certainly very weird. Lepro's new AI companion Ami is exactly that. Its not quite an AI assistant meant to help with actual tasks. Its an AI meant for a loney person looking for some interaction. The characters dance and gyrate inside the case and can do so at the user's request as well, upping the weirdness factor.\n\nSuck on this lollipop and listen to a song directly from your mouth to your ears using bone conduction technology, so you can \"experience music you can taste.\" I tried it out, and though you had to bite down on it a bit to hear the music, it did work. It's a weird, fun novelty item. It costs $8.99.\n\niPolish touts itself as the \"world's first digital color-changing nails.\" They take the form of press-on nails that you can individually put into a little wand to instantly change the color via a selection of over 400 shades on an app.\n\nPerimenopause affects people transitioning to menopause, and is commonly marked by symptoms such as anxiety, hot flashes, and night sweats. Peri is a wearable designed to track those symptoms, and help you make informed decisions about how to manage them — whether that's through lifestyle changes and supplements alone, or hormone replacement therapy.\n\nA majority of those who menstruate report severe period pain. This wearable neurostimulation device aims to reduce period symptoms and cramps. By attaching near the ear and delivering gentle neurostimulation, the device targets the auricular branches of the trigeminal and vagus nerves to regulate menstrual cycle symptoms and help the body return to a rested state.\n\nFood allergies are common and can cause a wide range of unpleasant symptoms. Severe reactions can be deadly. Allergen Alert is a mini, portable lab that allows you to test food for common allergens on the spot at a restaurant, school, or anywhere you dine out. A single-use pouch analyzes the food sample inserted into the device and displays results within minutes.\n\nBeatbot AquaSense X ecosystem (Winner)\n\nBeatbot has introduced the world's first self-emptying pool robot cleaner. In addition to its industry leading navigation and suction, the AquaSense x Ecosystem removes the worst chore associated with robot vacs — cleaning the debris baskets filled with soggy leaves, slime and bugs. The standalone cleaning dock empties debris into a disposable bag in a bin waiting below. Next, it rinses the internal mechanisms with fresh water fed from an attached hose, keeping the filter, debris baskets and vents clear and clean.\n\nThe Luba 3 AWD stole the show at CES 2026, easily climbing slopes up to 80 percent thanks to its four-wheel drive design. This smart mower also offers wire free navigation enhanced by LiDAR and AI vision, plus adjustable cutting heights. This attractive robot lawnmower can also overcome and avoid obstacles in your yard, from tennis balls to rogue hedgehogs.\n\nBirdfy's smart 4K hummingbird feeder has a beautiful, unique design that more closely resembles an actual flower. Most importantly, it captures slow-motion video at 120 frames per second, letting you see the flap of hummingbirds' wings as they flit through your backyard. Using AI and its 8MP camera, the Hum Bloom will identify 150 different species of avian visitors.\n\nSamsung Galazy Z Trifold (Winner)\n\nA vanguard in melding eye-catching design with genuine utility, the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold achieves CES's highest honor, Best Overall. This slim device lives up to the promise of a foldable, full size tablet-phone hybrid that's as functional as it is pocketable. Its futuristic allure and seamless practicality elevate the tech while keeping it within reach.",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Kings captain is the latest in a high-profile list of partners and investors in the high-tech SoCal golf team.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles Kings center and captain Anže Kopitar will retire at the end of the 2025-26 season and like many retirees he’ll be devoting his time to a different passion: golf.\n\nKopitar is the newest investor and limited partner in the Los Angeles Golf Club, one of five teams in the TGL golf league, a newly formed team golf league in its second season that hosts matches inside an arena and features a fusion of virtual courses and high-tech, rotating greens that aims to attract a new generation of golfing fans and provide an innovative arena experience.\n\n“Myself being a pretty passionate golfer and really loving the game, following stuff and seeing the TGL getting some traction and how fun it was to watch, I didn't really think about getting the opportunity, but when the opportunity presents itself, I just kind of jumped on it,” Kopitar said.\n\nThe Kings captain said that he was approached by LAGC president Neil Hubman about becoming an investor and he was eager to be on board.\n\nKopitar’s personal experience with golf is uniquely tied to his time in Los Angeles. Hailing from Slovenia, he didn’t have much experience with golf growing up, but after his decades-long transplant to sunny SoCal, he found himself playing it more and more, especially in charity games put on by the Kings.\n\nThe competitive drive that has made him one of the best hockey players of his generation also played into getting him into golf  as well after a disappointing charity tournament performance left a sour taste in his mouth.\n\n“I wasn't really into it until I severely embarrassed myself my second year on that charity golf tournament. So I figured I’d just work at it a little bit. And then I hit the seven iron right in the sweet spot and then I was hooked,” Kopitar said.\n\nKopitar joins an investor group that includes several other notable athletes and figures in entertainment like primary owners Alexis Ohanian, Serena Williams and Venus Williams and an extended investor group that includes Giannis Antetokounmpo, Alex Morgan and Shonda Rhimes.\n\nWhile he plans to move his family back home to Slovenia when the NHL season is done, taking a stake in LAGC gives Kopitar and his family a new way to stay connected to the community that he’s called his home and left his mark on for two decades.\n\n“It'll be a great excuse for me to come here and see everybody and be a part of this community like I've been for 20 years… Both of my kiddos were born here. We have friends outside of hockey here. Now this thing that popped up with LA Golf Club,” Kopitar said. “It’ll be very fun to come back here and maybe not be as stressed as I am during the season.\"\n\nLAGC's season kicked off with a Jan. 2 match against Boston Common Golf at SoFi Center in Palm Springs, Fla. that ended in a 7-5 victory for Boston Common, the first match of many that Kopitar will have the chance to watch as a new member of the organization.\n\n“Anže represents everything we value at LAGC, elite competition, leadership and a deep connection to Los Angeles. He’s a world-class athlete, a passionate golfer, and someone who understands what it means to represent this city at the highest level. We’re proud to welcome him into our investor group.” Hubman said in LAGC’s official announcement.",

    "description": "The world's biggest technology trade show is here, and Jordan Calhoun, Beth Skwarecki, Jake Peterson, and Michelle Ehrhardt are on the ground in Las Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "fullText": "Jan 7 (Reuters) - Beijing has asked some Chinese tech companies to halt orders for Nvidia's H200 chips this week, and is expected to mandate ​domestic artificial intelligence chip purchases, the Information reported on Wednesday, citing people ‌familiar with the matter.\n\nNvidia has been caught between Washington and Beijing, as the United States tightens controls ‌on exports of advanced semiconductors used in AI, while Chinese companies seek to reduce reliance on U.S.-designed chips.\n\nTensions over technology trade have been a central feature of broader U.S.-China conflicts, with semiconductors emerging as a strategic flashpoint.\n\nChina's directive to suspend orders was issued ⁠as the government considers whether, ‌and under what conditions, to allow access to Nvidia's high-performance chips.\n\nBeijing is aiming to discourage local technology companies from rushing to stockpile ‍U.S. chips before a decision is reached, the report said.\n\n\"China is committed to basing its national development on its own strengths, and is also willing to maintain dialogue and cooperation with ​all parties to safeguard the stability of global industrial and supply chains,\" said ‌Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment and China's Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately return calls outside business hours.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the Consumer Electronics Show this week that demand in China ⁠for its H200 chip was strong and the ​company is viewing purchase orders as a signal ​of approval rather than expecting any formal announcement from Beijing.\n\nU.S. export licenses for the chips are still being processed, with no set timeline.\n\nLate ‍last year, U.S. President ⁠Donald Trump's administration approved the export of H200 chips to China, a significant reversal of previous bans on advanced AI hardware.\n\nThe approval was based on a ⁠condition that the company pay a unique 25% revenue-sharing tax to the U.S. government.\n\nThe H200 is ‌the predecessor to Nvidia's current flagship \"Blackwell\" chips.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — China on Tuesday banned exports of dual-use goods that can serve military purposes to Japan, a move that comes at time of heightened tensions between the two countries over Taiwan, a self-ruled island Beijing claims as its sovereign territory.\n\nThe Chinese commerce ministry said in a statement that exports of such items, which can serve both civilian and military purposes, to Japanese military users and all other end-users that could help enhance Japanese military power are prohibited.\n\nAny individual or organization that violates the rule by transferring or providing these made-in-China products to Japanese groups and people would face legal consequences, regardless of where they are from, it said.\n\nThe notice did not identify or describe specific items, but some exports — particularly in the technology sector such as drones and navigation systems — could be adapted for military use.\n\nMasaaki Kanai, the Japanese Foreign Ministry's head of Asia Oceanian affairs, “strongly protested” to Chinese deputy consul Shi Yong, according to a statement from the Japanese ministry. Kanai said a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable and demanded it be retracted.\n\nRelations between Japan and China worsened late last year after Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan.\n\nIn December, Japan said Chinese military aircraft locked radar on its fighter jets even though there was a safe distance between them. Tokyo is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending.\n\nLast week, China launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan for two days to warn against what it calls separatist and external forces.\n\nAt that time, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi slammed both Japan and Taiwan’s “pro-independence forces.” Wang said Japan's current leaders openly challenge China’s territorial sovereignty and the postwar international order. Japan was defeated in World War II by the United States and its allies.\n\nIn his meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in Beijing on Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping mentioned China’s and South Korea’s historical rivalry against Japan, calling on the two countries to “join hands to defend the fruits of victory in World War II and safeguard peace and stability in northeast Asia.”",

    "description": "The who, what, why, when, and where of 2026's Consumer Electronics Show.",
    "fullText": "It's CES week, when the tech world gathers in Las Vegas to check out the latest gadgets, prototypes, and innovations that will shape the future. Lifehacker's tech team is on the ground at the convention, tracking down big stories and cool gear.\n\nBilling itself as \"The Most Powerful Tech Event in the World,\" CES (short for \"Consumer Electronics Show\") is the Consumer Technology Association's trade convention. It began in 1967 as a small showcase for televisions and radios, but over the decades CES has become a gathering of the tribes for tech culture. Everyone is there, from huge companies like Samsung and Sony, to scores of journalists, to scrappy startups with big dreams. From innovative AI tools to electric vehicles, laptops, e-readers, and robotic dogs, CES is where tech companies show off their wares, journalists dig up the next big story, and tech insiders network and sneak a look into the future.\n\nCES is held in Las Vegas from Jan. 6-9. The Las Vegas Convention Center hosts the main show floor, but there are CES-related events at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, The Sphere, and other locations across Las Vegas.\n\nMost major electronics and technology companies are attending CES 2026 in some form. Here are some of the most vital exhibitors:\n\nSamsung Electronics: Samsung's theme this year is \"Your Companion to AI Living,\" and the focus is how artificial intelligence can enhance people's day-to-day lives.\n\nLG Electronics: Describing it as \"innovation in tune with you\" and \"affectionate intelligence,\" LG is showing off its take on AI designed to power robots, appliances, vehicles and TVs.\n\nSony: Sony's main focus this year is mobility. It's unveiling the Sony Honda Mobility (SHM) and showcasing the AFEELA electric vehicle Prototype.\n\nTCL: It's not CES without new TVs, and TCL is showing off a gigantic set with a SQD-Mini LED display.\n\nPanasonic: Under the banner \"The future we make,\" Panasonic promises it is \"leveraging the power of AI to amplify the impact of our human-centric technologies, services and solutions.\"\n\nNVIDIA: The chip-maker is showcasing its new Vera Rubin AI supercomputer platform, the Alpamayo reasoning model for self-driving vehicles, and more.\n\nAMD: AMD is unveiling the Ryzen AI processors for PCs and the Ryzen 7 9850X3D for gaming.\n\nIntel: Intel launched its new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors, codenamed \"Panther Lake.\"\n\nUber: Transportation firm Uber wants you to know about its new robotaxi.\n\nThe LEGO Group: Lovable toy makers LEGO announced \"Smart Bricks,\" packed with a tiny processor that \"brings play to life.\"\n\nIkea: Making its first appearance at CES, Swedish furniture retailer Ikea unveiled 21 new smart home products.\n\nIn fact, so many brands exhibit at CES, it's more notable which ones aren't there. This year's list of no-shows includes Apple (which never really does CES), iRobot, and Tesla. Big brands with a more limited presence include Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nAlong with the expected innovations in televisions and laptops, CES 2026 is crammed with artificial intelligence, robots, and mobility devices, and health-focused wearables. Here are some of the biggest announcements at CES 2026 so far.\n\nAt its keynote, NVIDIA unveiled Alpamayo, \"the world's first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI.\" This could be serious competition for Tesla.\n\nHP showed off a new mini desktop computer, The Eliteboard G1a. You just plug the keyboard into any monitor and go to town. Only time will tell if this is a gimmick or a new form factor.\n\nHyundai and Boston Dynamics showed off humanoid robot Atlas. But Hyundai didn't show off any new electric vehicles, suggesting a cautious outlook for the near future.\n\nBroadcom showed off Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips, providing a practical look into the future.\n\nBelow is a guide to some of the major events at CES 2026.\n\nSunday, January 4: Media Day 1 at Mandalay Bay\n\nMonday, January 5: Media Day 2 at Mandalay Bay. C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nTuesday, January 6: Show Floor Press Conferences, Exhibits: 10 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nWednesday, January 7: Show Floor Press Conferences, Exhibits: 9 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nThursday, January 8: Exhibits: 9 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nFriday, January 9: Exhibits: 9 AM-4 PM\n\nCES Unveiled Las Vegas – The Official Media Event of CES 2026 with innovative product previews – 4:00-7:00 PM\n\nAMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su, 6:30 PM, The Venetian\n\nSiemens President and CEO Dr. Roland Busch, 8:30 AM, The Venetian\n\nLenovo Chairman and CEO Yuanqing Yang, 5:00 PM, Sphere\n\nCaterpillar CEO Joe Creed, 9:00 AM, The Venetian\n\nCES is a trade-only event, so it's not open to the general public, but if you're affiliated with the tech industry in some way, you can register at CES's official site. If you're not a tech insider, you can check out the official CES livestream and read Lifehacker's CES 2026 live blog.",

    "fullText": "Fifa plans to create AI-enabled 3D avatars of every player at the 2026 World Cup to enhance the tournament's semi-automated offside technology.\n\nThis will mean creating a digital scan of all 1,248 players in the 26-man squads of the 48 teams.\n\nEach player will enter a chamber to be scanned, a process that should take just one second and only needs to be done once during their pre-tournament photo shoot.\n\nFifa says the scan \"captures highly accurate body-part dimensions\" to make more accurate offside decisions.\n\nIt expects this to mean tournament officials will be able to \"track players reliably during fast or obstructed movements\" and says final decisions will be \"displayed more realistically and in a more engaging way\".\n\nThere was controversy in the Premier League earlier this season when a Newcastle goal against Manchester City was allowed to stand.\n\nRuben Dias appeared to be jumping in the semi-automated offside graphic. This did not match the television pictures of the game.\n\nFifa hopes that by taking accurate scans of each player it can improve how these decisions are shown to supporters.\n\nThe technology was tested in Fifa's Intercontinental Cup, with Flamengo and Pyramids FC players scanned ahead of their match in December.\n\nFifa announced last month it was testing new technology which can determine if the ball goes out of play before a goal is scored. It has also developed 'real-time 3D recreation' to make line-of-sight offside decisions.",
