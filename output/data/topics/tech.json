    "title": "Trump's trade advisor says Big Tech must 'internalize the cost' of AI data centers",
    "description": "Peter Navarro says the White House may force Big Tech to cover electricity and grid costs tied to AI data centers.",
    "fullText": "The White House is signaling it may force Big Tech to foot the full bill for America's AI boom.\n\nCompanies building data centers \"need to pay for all of the costs,\" and taxpayers should not shoulder the impact of the AI boom.\n\nThe White House has to \"make sure the American people are not hurt,\" he added.\n\nNavarro's comments come as the AI data-center boom faces mounting scrutiny over rising utility bills.\n\nTech giants are pouring hundreds of billions into infrastructure to power artificial intelligence. In November, Meta pledged $600 billion to expand AI technology, infrastructure, and its workforce. Apple said in August it would boost its US infrastructure plans by adding another $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion.\n\nAt the same time, energy costs are rising. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate hikes from regulators last year, more than twice the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many power providers have cited surging electricity demand from large-scale data centers as a key reason for seeking higher rates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that households should absorb those increases.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote last month in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nNavarro also said on Fox News that the US must keep expanding its data center capacity if it wants to remain \"No.1 on the global stage in terms of AI.\"\n\n\"We have to lead China and others on this,\" Navarro said. \"At the same time, we have to be mindful of the impacts across this nation.\"\n\nThe US must stay ahead \"not just for economic reasons but for national security reasons,\" because AI \"will be one of the most dangerous weapons of war,\" he added.\n\nSome AI companies have moved to reassure policymakers that households won't bear the cost of the industry's rapid expansion.\n\nAnthropic said on Thursday that it will cover 100% of the grid upgrade costs associated with its AI data centers.\n\n\"The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,\" Anthropic said. \"But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.\"\n\nThe pledge follows the company's November announcement that it plans to invest $50 billion in AI infrastructure, starting with facilities in Texas and New York.\n\nMicrosoft has taken a similar approach. Last month, the company said it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the electricity costs tied to its data centers and minimize the burden of data center expansion on surrounding communities.",

    "fullText": "Delivery service Instacart is moving further into new areas, such as advertising and retail tech.\n\nThe company's roughly 600,000 gig workers, who shop and deliver groceries and other retail goods, are its most visible face for many people. But Instacart's business is growing in many directions, CEO Chris Rogers said on a November earnings call.\n\n\"We have the leading online grocery marketplace, a best-in-class suite of enterprise technologies for retailers, and a growing advertising ecosystem,\" Rogers said on the call, his first as CEO after assuming the position in August.\n\nInstacart needs people to make good on its growth plans. The company had about 170 open roles on its careers website as of early February.\n\n\"We're hiring selectively, with priority on roles that support our core marketplace, Instacart Enterprise solutions for retailers globally, and our ads and data platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\n\"We regularly review compensation to ensure it's competitive and aligned with market benchmarks, location, and role,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThat hiring can include some employees from outside the US on H-1B work visas.\n\nBusiness Insider analyzed 157 H-1B visa applications submitted by Instacart and certified by the Department of Labor in the year ending September 30, 2025. These applications provide insight into how much employees in certain roles make. Many of the salaries were for tech roles, including data science, engineering, and product management positions.\n\nThe Trump administration has initiated changes to the H-1B visa system. In September, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new applications. He's also proposed changes to work visa rules that could tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider. However, these changes were largely initiated after this reporting period.\n\nHere's a look at some of the jobs for which Instacart has disclosed salaries in the work visa data.\n\nData Scientist: $125,000 to $210,000\n\nDirector of Engineering, Machine Learning: $320,000 to $380,000\n\nEngineering Manager, Software: $220,000 to $290,000\n\nManager, Machine Learning Engineering: $260,000 to $280,000\n\nPrincipal Software Engineer: $350,000 to $380,000\n\nSenior Computer Vision/AI Engineer: $180,000 to $290,000\n\nSenior Data Scientist: $170,000 to $265,000\n\nSenior Engagement Manager: $235,000 to $285,000\n\nSenior Engineering Manager: $275,000 to $305,000\n\nSenior Engineering Manager, Software: $275,000 to $305,000\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $185,000 to $300,000\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $190,000 to $298,000\n\nSenior Product Manager: $185,000 to $280,000\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $176,000 to $285,000\n\nSoftware Engineer: $165,000 to $215,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $250,000 to $310,000\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood doesn’t give up on her favorite stocks easily.\n\nThe head of Ark Investment Management actively manages her tech holdings, and her timing often links to market movements.\n\nSometimes Wood buys her top holdings on the way down, hoping for a bargain. That’s what she just did.\n\nIt’s been a weak start to the year for Wood. As of Feb. 13, Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) was down 9.79% year to date, while the S&P 500 lost 0.14%, as pressure mounted on growth-focused tech stocks.\n\nWood gained a reputation after her Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. Last year, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF gained 35.49%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 17.88% in the same period.\n\nBut Wood's style also brings painful losses in bearish markets, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\n\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term gains. As of Feb. 13, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -14.67%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 13.33% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar.\n\nWood focuses on high-tech companies across artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics. She thinks these businesses have great growth potential, though their volatility often causes fluctuations in the Ark’s funds.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking. The analyst hasn’t updated the 2025 ranking.\n\nIn a letter published on Jan. 15, Wood says the U.S. economy is storing up energy for a sharp rebound in 2026.\n\n\"Despite sustained real gross domestic product growth during the past three years, the underlying US economy has suffered a rolling recession and has evolved into a coiled spring that could bounce back powerfully during the next few years,\" Wood wrote.\n\nWood also rejects the “AI bubble” talk, saying it \"is years away\" and \"the most powerful capital spending cycle in history\" is coming.\n\n\"What once was the cap in spending seems to have become a floor now that the AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and multiomics sequencing platforms are ready for prime time,\" she said.\n\nNot all investors agree with Wood’s optimism. In the 12 months through Feb. 11, the Ark Innovation ETF saw roughly $1.4 billion in net outflows, according to ETF research firm VettaFi.",

    "description": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah, Feb 15 - The U.S.",
    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah, Feb 15 - The U.S. Departments of Energy and Defense on Sunday for the first time transported a small nuclear reactor on a cargo plane from California to Utah to ‌demonstrate the potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe agencies partnered with California-based Valar Atomics to ‌fly one of the company’s Ward microreactors on a C-17 aircraft — without nuclear fuel — to Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Under ​Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Michael Duffey were on the C-17 flight with the reactor and its components, and hailed the event as a breakthrough for U.S. nuclear energy and military logistics.\n\n“This gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration sees small nuclear reactors as one ‌of several ways to expand U.S. energy production. Trump ⁠last May issued four executive orders aimed at boosting domestic nuclear deployment to meet growing demand for energy for national security and competitive AI advancements.\n\nThe Energy Department in December issued two grants to help ⁠accelerate development of small modular reactors.\n\nProponents of microreactors also have touted them as energy sources that can be sent to far-flung and remote places, offering an alternative to diesel generators which require frequent deliveries of fuel. But skeptics have argued that the industry has not proven that small ​nuclear reactors ​can generate power for a reasonable price.\n\n\"There is no business case for ​microreactors, which — even if they work as designed — will ‌produce electricity at a far higher cost than large nuclear reactors, not to mention renewables like wind or solar,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nThe Energy Department plans to have three microreactors reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain itself — by July 4, Wright said.\n\nThe microreactor in Sunday's event, a little larger than a minivan, can generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, according to Valar CEO Isaiah Taylor. It will start operating in July ‌at 100 kilowatts and peak at 250 kilowatts this year before ramping up ​to full capacity, he said.\n\nValar hopes to start selling power on a test ​basis in 2027 and become fully commercial in 2028. ​Although private industry funds its own development of nuclear technology, it also needs the federal government “doing some ‌enabling actions to allow fuel fabrication here and uranium ​enrichment here,” he said.\n\nFuel for Valar's ​reactor will be transported from the Nevada National Security site to the San Rafael facility, Wright told reporters.\n\nHowever, even small generators result in a significant amount of radioactive waste, Lyman said. Other experts have said designers are not compelled to ​consider waste at inception, beyond a plan for ‌how it will be managed.\n\nAlthough disposal of nuclear waste remains an unresolved issue, the Energy Department is in talks ​with a few states, including Utah, to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal, Wright ​said.",

    "description": "Prime minister says outcomes of consultation on social media ban should be implemented quickly as technology minister says Australia-style ban is not inevitable\nIn his Q&A with journalists, Keir Starmer was also asked to respond to a report by the BBC’s James Landale saying he is looking at plans to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP by the end of this parliament. In the past Starmer has just said that he would like to do this at some point in the next parliament.\nIn his reply, Starmer said that at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend he was arguing that the UK, and Europe as a whole, needs to “step up”.\nWe want a just and lasting peace, but that will not extinguish the Russian threat, and we need to be alert to that, because that’s going to affect every single person in this room, every single person in this country, so we need to step up.\nThat means, on defence spending, we need to go faster.",

But he said he was “open-minded” about whether this would include a full, Austalian-style ban.\n\nStarmer suggested that one option will be to limit the technology that allows “doomscrolling”. He said:\n\nWe’ve taken the powers to make sure we can act within months, not years.\n\nWe also need to act very quickly, not just of the age concern, but on the devices and applications that make the sort of auto-scrolling, the constant glueing to the machine that you can never stop scrolling.\n\nIn a post on his Substack account, Starmer said out in more details the options that could be implemented as a result of the consultation being carried out. He said:\n\nWe will be going to parliament for new government powers, enabling us to act on the findings of the social media consultation where the evidence suggests we need to. This could include:\n\n-Setting a minimum age limit for social media: unlike the Tories, who took years to pass the Online Safety Act, we will take powers that would allow us to implement a minimum age for social media in a matter of months to prevent kids from accessing harmful social media.\n\n-Restricting specific functionalities: that are detrimental to kids’ wellbeing and keep them hooked to their screens like endless scroll or autoplay\n\n-Limiting VPN access for kids: to make it harder for kids to get around age limits of services or certain functionalities.\n\nThis is all designed to put the wellbeing of children first.",

    "description": "Tech titans pour $50 million into super PAC to elect AI-friendly candidates to Congress",
    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names behind the artificial intelligence boom are looking to stack Congress with allies who support lighter regulation of the emerging technology by drawing on the crypto industry’s 2024 election success.\n\nMarc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman are among tech leaders who’ve poured $50 million into a new super political action committee to help AI-friendly candidates prevail in November’s congressional races. Known as Leading the Future, the super PAC has taken center stage as voters grow increasingly concerned that AI risks driving up energy costs and taking away jobs.\n\nAs it launches operations, Leading the Future is deploying a strategy that worked two years ago for crypto advocates: talk about what’s likely to resonate with voters, not the industry or its interests and controversies. For AI, that means its ads won’t tout the technology but instead discuss core issues including economic opportunity and immigration — even if that means not mentioning AI at all.\n\n“They’re trying to be helpful in a campaign rather than talking about their own issue all the time,” said Craig Murphy, a Republican political consultant in Texas, where Leading the Future has backed Chris Gober, an ally of President Trump, in the state’s hotly contested 10th congressional district.\n\nThis year, the group plans to spend up to $125 million on candidates who favor a single, national approach to AI regulation, regardless of party affiliation. The election comes at a crucial moment for the industry as it invests hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure that will put fresh strains on resources, with new data centers already blamed for driving up utility bills.\n\nLeading the Future faces a growing challenge from AI safety advocates, who’ve started their own super PAC called Public First with a goal of raising $50 million for candidates who favor stricter oversight. On Thursday, Public First landed a $20-million pledge from Anthropic PBC, a rival to OpenAI that has set itself apart from other AI companies by supporting tougher rules.\n\nPolls show deepening public concern over AI’s impact on everything from jobs to education to the environment. Sixty-two percent of US adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week, and 58% are concerned the government will not go far enough in regulating it, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nJesse Hunt, a Leading the Future spokesman, said the group is “committed to supporting policymakers who want a smart national regulatory framework for AI,” one that boosts US employment while winning the race against China. Hunt said the super PAC backs ways to protect consumers “without ceding America’s technological future to extreme ideological gatekeepers.”\n\nThe political and economic stakes are enormous for OpenAI and others behind Leading the Future, including venture capitalists Andreessen and Horowitz. Their firm, a16z, is the richest in Silicon Valley with billions of dollars invested in AI upstarts including coding startup Cursor and AI leaderboard platform LM Arena.\n\nFor now, their super PAC is doing most of the talking for the AI industry in the midterm races. Meta Platforms Inc. has announced plans for AI-related political spending on state-level contests, with $20 million for its California-based super PAC and $45 million for its American Technology Excellence Project, according to Politico.\n\nOther companies with massive AI investment plans — Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — have their own corporate PACs to dole out bipartisan federal campaign donations. Nvidia Corp., the chip giant driving AI policy in Washington, doesn’t have its own PAC.\n\nTo ensure consistent messaging across party lines, Leading the Future has created two affiliated super PACs — one spending on Republicans and another on Democrats. The aim is to build a bipartisan coalition that can be effective in Washington regardless of which party is in power.\n\nTexas, home of OpenAI’s massive Stargate project, is one of the states where Leading the Future has already jumped in. Its Republican arm, American Mission, has spent nearly $750,000 on ads touting Gober, a political lawyer who’s previously worked for Elon Musk’s super PAC and is in a crowded GOP primary field for an open House seat.\n\nThe ads hail Gober as a “MAGA warrior” who “will fight for Texas families, lowering everyday costs.” Gober’s campaign website lists “ensuring America’s AI dominance” as one of his top campaign priorities. Gober’s campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn New York, Leading the Future’s Democratic arm, Think Big, has spent $1.1 million on television ads and messages attacking Alex Bores, a New York state assemblyman who has called for tougher AI safety protocols and is now running for an open congressional seat encompassing much of central Manhattan.\n\nThe ads seize on Democrats’ revulsion over Trump’s immigration crackdown and target Bores for his work at Palantir Technologies Inc., which contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Think Big has circulated mailings and text messages citing Bores’ work with Palantir, urging voters to “Reject Bores’ hypocrisy on ICE.”\n\nIn an interview, Bores called the claims in the ads false, explaining that he left Palantir because of its work with ICE. He pointed out the irony that Joe Lonsdale, a Palantir co-founder who’s backed the administration’s border crackdown, is a donor to Leading the Future.\n\n“They’re not being ideologically consistent,” Bores said. “The fact that they have been so transparent and said, ‘Hey, we’re the AI industry and Alex Bores will regulate AI and that scares us,’ has been nothing but a benefit so far.”\n\nLeading the Future’s Democratic arm also plans to spend seven figures to support Democrats in two Illinois congressional races: former Illinois Representatives Jesse Jackson Jr. and Melissa Bean.\n\nLeading the Future is following the path carved by Fairshake, a pro-cryptocurrency super PAC that joined affiliates in putting $133 million into congressional races in 2024. Fairshake made an early mark by spending $10 million to attack progressive Katie Porter in the California Democratic Senate primary, helping knock her out of the race in favor of Adam Schiff, the eventual winner who’s seen as more friendly to digital currency.\n\nThe group also backed successful primary challengers against House incumbents, including Democrats Cori Bush in Missouri and Jamaal Bowman in New York. Both were rated among the harshest critics of digital assets by the Stand With Crypto Alliance, an industry group.\n\nIn its highest-profile 2024 win, Fairshake spent $40 million to help Republican Bernie Moreno defeat incumbent Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, a crypto skeptic who led the Senate Banking Committee. Overall, it backed winners in 52 of the 61 races where it spent at least $100,000, including victories in three Senate and nine House battlegrounds.\n\nFairshake and Leading the Future share more than a strategy. Josh Vlasto, one of Leading the Future’s political strategists, does communications work for Fairshake. Andreessen and Horowitz are also among Fairshake’s biggest donors, combining to give $23.8 million last year.\n\nBut Leading the Future occasionally conflicts with Fairshake’s past spending. The AI group said Wednesday it plans to spend half a million dollars on an ad campaign for Laurie Buckhout, a former Pentagon official who’s seeking a congressional seat in North Carolina with calls to slash rules “strangling American innovation.” In 2024, during Buckhout’s unsuccessful run for the post, Fairshake spent $2.3 million supporting her opponent and eventual winner, Democratic Rep. Donald Davis.\n\n“The fact that they tried to replay the crypto battle means that we have to engage,” said Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Texas who helped launch Public First. “I’d say Leading the Future was the forcing function.”\n\nUnlike crypto, proponents of stricter AI regulations have backers within the industry. Even before its contribution to Public First, Anthropic had pressed for “responsible AI” with sturdier regulations for the fast-moving technology and opposed efforts to preempt state laws.\n\nAnthropic employees have also contributed to candidates targeted by Leading the Future, including a total of $168,500 for Bores, Federal Election Commission records show. A super PAC Dream NYC, whose only donor in 2025 was an Anthropic machine learning researcher who gave $50,000, is backing Bores as well.\n\nCarson, who’s co-leading the super PAC with former Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah, cites public polling that more than 80% of US adults believe the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, and says voter sentiment is on Public First’s side.\n\nPublic First didn’t disclose receiving any donations last year, according to FEC filings. But one of the group’s affiliated super PACs, Defend our Values PAC, reported receiving $50,000 from Public First Action Inc., the group’s advocacy arm. The PAC hasn’t yet spent any of that money on candidates.\n\nCrypto’s clout looms large in lawmakers’ memory, casting a shadow over any effort to regulate the big tech companies, said Doug Calidas, head of government affairs for AI safety group Americans for Responsible Innovation.\n\n“Fairshake was just so effective,” said Calidas, whose group has called for tougher AI regulations. “Democrats and Republicans are scared they’re going to replicate that model.”\n\nAllison and Birnbaum write for Bloomberg.",

    "description": "After a weekend of FA Cup action without VAR, BBC Sport ask managers, fans and pundits whether the game needs technology - and what needs to change.",
    "fullText": "Would football be better without the video assistant referee (VAR) system?\n\nPremier League fans, managers and players got a reminder of what life was like without VAR in the FA Cup fourth round - and it is fair to say this weekend was not without its problems.\n\nFor this season and the previous FA Cup campaign, VAR has not been brought in until the fifth round, with many fans looking forward to a return to football without interruptions from technology.\n\nAfter a season full of controversy, delayed decisions and confusion fuelled by VAR, its very existence has been questioned at times, with many claiming the game would be better without it.\n\nIn fact, after a day full of long delays, mixed messages and irate managers in early February, ex-Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Match of the Day: \"For the good of the game, you'd have VAR gone.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there.\n\n\"Do you want more right decisions or do you want a more free-flowing football experience that is genuine and spur of the moment?\"\n\nAfter a couple of offside goals being allowed, a blatant penalty not being awarded plus various other controversial decisions, the weekend certainly brought the subject back into the public eye.\n\nLong delays, irate managers and mixed messages - is VAR bad for game?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nWhy is there no VAR in the FA Cup third and fourth round?\n\nWe have all heard the arguments against VAR.\n\nDecisions taking too long, celebrations being put on hold while deliberations take place, confusion as goals are given - or ruled out - for marginal reasons, denying referees the ability to use their own common sense.\n\nBut Newcastle's controversial 3-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday could hardly have gone better for supporters of VAR - or worse for those who argue football is better without it.\n\nTammy Abraham's opener was clearly offside, Villa's full-back Lucas Digne inexplicably escaped conceding a penalty for handball and the Frenchman could easily have been dismissed for a reckless challenge as well.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said: \"I'm so torn because the game is better without VAR in terms of excitement and the spectacle for the supporters and us when we're living a moment live.\n\n\"But it does give accurate results. It does make the game more precise in terms of decision making. You have to respect those moments. They're worth their weight in gold, especially us today when we were on the wrong side of it.\"\n\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery went further, saying \"VAR is necessary. It's necessary to help the referees\".\n\nThere was also some controversy at Anfield during Liverpool's 3-0 win over Brighton.\n\nSubstitute Rio Ngumoha, 17, had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside for the hosts, while the Seagulls were furious Mohamed Salah was awarded a penalty.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"In general, I enjoy watching football without VAR because if you then score you're like 'it's a goal'.\n\n\"I like VAR only for the clear and obvious things - I'm not meaning a red card yes or no for Marc Guehi on Mo Salah because I thought it was.\n\n\"So let's stay away from that and only go to offside yes or no, ball over the line yes or no and, for the rest, the referee referees the game.\n\n\"I think we're now so used to VAR that I would prefer to have VAR during a game.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola was unsure whether football was better with VAR, despite seeing Omar Marmoush denied a goal for a debatable offside in his side's 3-0 win against Salford.\n\n\"Sometimes before I thought it was better and sometimes I think VAR helps us to have a more fair game,\" he said. \"To be honest I don't know.\"\n\nFor some though, it is simple - rather than VAR being a solution for wrong decisions, they would argue officials just need to get things right.\n\nWhen asked on Match of the Day Live whether the errors at Villa Park put him in favour of VAR, ex-Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, said: \"No. I would like the officials to do their job properly. It is not too much to ask, is it?\n\n\"If you ever needed any evidence of the damage that VAR has done to referees, I think Saturday is a great example of that.\n\n\"These guys look petrified to make a decision because they didn't have a comfort blanket.\n\n\"For me, [referees' decisions] are actually getting worse.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given added on Match of the Day: \"It shows you why we use VAR. A lot of decisions the officials got wrong at Villa Park. VAR is like a comfort blanket for referees.\n\n\"The decision is taken away from the officials. The linesman has been told all season not to put their flag up, so their brain has been trained. I think it shows VAR is a help even though we complain about it most weeks.\"\n\nWhen asked whether football had become too reliant on VAR, Howe had some sympathy with the argument.\n\n\"There is an argument to say yes,\" he said. \"Because when VAR is there, there is a tendency to think 'oh well I won't give that because VAR is there to check it'.\n\n\"Then your decision making isn't as sharp as it would normally have to be. Maybe there is a difference there. I would probably say you are right in that respect.\"\n\nBut former referee Graham Scott feels it is unfair to claim officials hide behind VAR.\n\n\"I really don't think that's fair,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"Obviously I work with them closely and I know these guys and they're not like that. It's not how their minds work, not how their processes work.\n\n\"I spent half my career with VAR and half without it - the other way around of course, without it first.\n\n\"And then when I was in the Premier League I was still dropping into the Championship quite often. So you're in and out, in and out. And your processes essentially stay the same.\n\n\"What has changed though is with VAR you don't have that spell in a game where you know you've made a really big error and you now have to reset and go again.\"\n\nJames: Football without VAR is real football. Having gone to games for the last 30 years, the last few years have been terrible in comparison. I don't bother cheering goals any more as the officials are far more interested in finding ways of disallowing goals than the entertainment of the match-going fan.\n\nVAR will be the thing that makes me turn in my season ticket, and if West Ham do get relegated the lack of VAR will be a blessing.\n\nFrank: I supported the introduction of VAR, but it was great not having it today. It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many VAR ridiculous errors.\n\nAlan: Much, much better [without]. VAR has ruined the game, thankfully I now support non-league football where there are humans, making human mistakes and getting it right.\n\nStephen: Much better without VAR. No waiting for obvious incidents that everyone can see immediately but takes VAR forever to decide. Time for return of refs and linesman to start refereeing the game again.\n\nMike: Better, even though City probably had a goal chalked off incorrectly. Right or wrong, its so much better to just know immediately if its a goal or not. VAR is a moment-killer.\n\nLes: The game is so much better without VAR. It flows without problem like it used to do. The officials are there to make decisions rightly or wrongly. VAR are always making wrong calls so I can't see the point of it. Offside because someone's toes are on the lines drawn is absolutely pathetic.\n\nBonnie: As a Villa and VAR fan, that is exactly the decision that VAR doesn't get credit for. VAR gets it right 100%\n\nRoger: That was so blatantly offside, have linesman lost their natural ability to spot stuff like this since the introduction of VAR? Whenever you see a defence hold their line like Newcastle did, strikers are more often than not offside. Poor decision.\n\nPeter: There's an easy fix for VAR offsides. If you can watch one TV replay and see the on-field decision is clearly wrong, you intervene.\n\nStephen: That's what you all wanted isn't it? More goals regardless of whether they're actually fair or not?\n\nLiga: It's these types of situations and these types of situation only where VAR should and needs to be used for offsides. Not those hairline millimetre is he on or off line drawing nonsense situations.\n\nCallum: This season is proving 2 things. 1) VAR is a must. 2) Brave, high pressure attacking football is dead.\n\nBen: What are linesman for exactly? Having no VAR is a another shambles, who makes these decisions?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going\n\nTech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).\n\nThe phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.\n\nGavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.\n\nRather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.\n\n“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”\n\nUnlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.\n\nRobert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.\n\n“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”\n\nThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.\n\nWhen the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.\n\nSome opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.\n\nThiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.\n\n“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”\n\nTech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.\n\nJust this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.\n\nAdding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”\n\nJoining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.\n\nMcCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.\n\n“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”\n\nMeta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.\n\nThe social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.\n\nThe crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.\n\n“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”\n\nWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.\n\nThe California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.\n\nSingleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.\n\nBut then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.\n\nMahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.\n\nMahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.\n\nGoogle’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nAs political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That’s for sure.”",

    "fullText": "A marginal VAR offside decision caused a fair amount of controversy for Newcastle in midweek. Joe Willock had a goal disallowed at Tottenham when the semi-automated technology said his forehead was offside.\n\nAbraham's goal was the kind of decision the video review was brought in for - the real howlers.\n\nThe Villa striker was clearly ahead of the defence when Douglas Luiz played the free-kick. With VAR, the goal would have been ruled out.\n\nIt would be easy to blame switching between systems as a defence for the assistant, Nick Greenhalgh. But with or without VAR, he would be expected to raise his flag if he's identified an offside.\n\nShould Digne have been sent off?\n\nWould the VAR have stepped in to show a red card to Digne for serious foul play with his late challenge on Jacob Murphy? It is far from certain from what we have seen in the Premier League.\n\nWe often hear the VAR has referenced glancing contact to uphold the decison of a yellow card. See Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby last month.\n\nDigne did come in at some speed and that would have increased the chance of being sent off on review.\n\nYet the Frenchman did not push through on to the shin of the Newcastle player. That his foot came off quickly probably would have saved him.\n\nIt may well have been one of those where the on-field decision would have stood, whether it was yellow or red card.\n\nSerious foul play or denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity (Dogso)?\n\nReally, this incident could have been either. After all, Bizot brought down Murphy with a knee-high challenge - although it was not with studs leading.\n\nWhen the Dutch goalkeeper fouled the Newcastle forward, the Magpies were left with three attackers up against only Luiz, although Dogso could only be applied to the player fouled.\n\nThe VAR would have taken into account the general run of the ball was not towards goal. They would also consider if Luiz would have been able to get across to prevent the shot.\n\nYou can make a case for a degree of doubt for Dogso. But much like the Digne decision it is one which would likely have stayed with the on-field decision.\n\nRead more analysis on the officiating in Aston Villa v Newcastle here",

    "fullText": "Agentic AI apps first interview you and then give you limited matches selected for ‘similarity and reciprocity of personality’\n\nDating apps exploit you, dating profiles lie to you, and sex is basically something old people used to do. You might as well consider it: can AI help you find love?\n\nFor a handful of tech entrepreneurs and a few brave Londoners, the answer is “maybe”.\n\nNo, this is not a story about humans falling in love with sexy computer voices – and strictly speaking, AI dating of some variety has been around for a while. Most big platforms have integrated machine learning and some AI features into their offerings over the past few years.\n\nBut dreams of a robot-powered future – or perhaps just general dating malaise and a mounting loneliness crisis – have fuelled a new crop of startups that aim to use the possibilities of the technology differently.\n\nJasmine, 28, was single for three years when she downloaded the AI-powered dating app Fate. With popular dating apps such as Hinge and Tinder, things were “repetitive”, she said: the same conversations over and over.\n\n“I thought, why not sign up, try something different? It sounded quite cool using, you know, agentic AI, which is where the world is going now, isn’t it?”\n\nFate, a London startup that went live last May, bills itself as the first “agentic AI dating app”. Its core offering is an AI personality named Fate that “onboards” users during an interview, asking them about their hopes and struggles before putting forward five potential matches – no swiping involved.\n\nFate will also coach users through their interactions, if they desire, a functionality Jasmine described as helpful and another user said was “scary” and “a bit like Black Mirror’.\n\nRakesh Naidu, Fate’s founder, demonstrated its coaching ability in an interview with the Guardian. “I just feel a bit hopeless at the moment in regards to my chats. I feel like I’m not being engaging enough or meaningful enough,” he said into his phone. “I just need some kind of meaningful questions I can ask to really uncover the essence of people.”\n\n“I hear you, Rakesh,” said a synthetic female voice. “Here are a few ideas. One, what’s something you’re passionate about that not many people know?”\n\nNaidu, 28, said he started Fate in order to address shortcomings in the world’s biggest dating platforms – apps such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, which monetise the time users spend on them and “are literally profiting off keeping people lonely”.\n\nOther startups, from Sitch to Keeper, have launched across the US, hoping AI features can provide the novelty to win them a share of a crowded market. Sitch leverages the power of AI to manage vasts amounts of information, inviting users to “give us detailed feedback down to the hair colour, where they want to raise a family, and their fav music”; Keeper says it can find “a match with rare and real soulmate potential”.\n\nPart of the issue, Naidu says, are algorithmic approaches to matchmaking: Tinder at one point ranked users’ desirability through an Elo score, an algorithm originally used to rate chess players. On dating platforms, it’s a Hobbesian proposition – high-scoring users are shown to other high-scoring users, low-scoring users to other low-scoring users. “It’s very superficial,” said Naidu.\n\nAI, in theory, can offer a different way. Awkward as it may be to discuss your dating life with a chatbot, Fate does not rank you based on your responses, but instead uses an LLM to try to find other users who, based on their interview, might be similar to you. That approach, along with the AI dating coach, helps users to focus on authentic connection, said Naidu – “similarity and reciprocity of personality”.\n\nAmelia Miller, a consultant for Match Group (which owns Tinder and Hinge), worries about this approach.\n\nA recent study from the group surveyed 5,000 Europeans about their online dating preferences – and found that while many were interested in AI tools to weed out fake profiles and flag toxic users, most, 62%, were skeptical about using AI to guide their conversations. One obvious anxiety might be the dystopian idea of two agentic AIs steering a conversation, with the humans nominally in charge turning into little more than meatspace mouthpieces.\n\nMiller, however, who coaches people on their relationships with AI, says she sees many clients turn to an LLM for advice in the smaller, uncomfortable moments of building their relationships – asking AI how to craft a text, for example, or respond to an intimate question.\n\n“Often I’m trying to make sure that people aren’t turning to machines because turning to humans demands a level of vulnerability that has become uncomfortable now that there is an alternative,” she said.\n\nThe appeal of an AI coach such as Fate is that revealing yourself to it – your judgments, hopes and idiosyncrasies – involves no risk; it does not remember or evaluate. Friends do, and, says Miller, asking advice from them helps hone the skills for successful relationships.\n\n“Advice is really one of the key ways that people practice vulnerability in a more low-stakes environment – they build up to more vulnerable moments in a romantic context.”\n\nJeremias has been using Fate for several months. He said he doesn’t use the AI coach: “I could see it being helpful, but I mean there are obviously some concerns. Like the new generation are basically not going to have the real world experience of actually trying and failing.”\n\nThe app recently helped him to meet someone after a long period of being single in London. He’s not sure if this is because of the AI matching, or because Fate simply serves up only five matches at a time – no infinite swiping – and, excruciatingly, forces its users to write an explanation when they reject a potential match.\n\n“It makes the swiping more thoughtful. If I’m actually saying no to this person, what are the reasons I’m saying no to them?”\n\nHe and Jasmine both have second dates upcoming, both after being single for several years, they say.\n\n“It is exciting because you get like, you know, the butterflies in your stomach again, going on a date with someone, doing yourself up really nicely, wearing dresses, heels. It’s fun,” said Jasmine.",

    "fullText": "As Nike continues its quest to come back as a dominant retail force, the sportswear giant has continued to invest in tech and design jobs.\n\nPublicly available work visa data, which companies are required to disclose to the US Department of Labor, gives an idea of how much Nike's employees bring home and some of the roles it has invested in.\n\nNike had about 755 open positions worldwide listed on its jobs board as of February 13. In January, the company also said it planned to lay off 775 employees at its distribution centers, citing efforts to accelerate the use of \"advanced technology and automation.\"\n\nNike had several leadership shake-ups in 2025, including promoting at least four insiders to senior roles reporting directly to CEO Elliott Hill.\n\nHill, who rejoined the company in October 2024, has told investors that Nike is aligning its employees around five key action areas: culture, product, marketing, marketplace, and connecting with consumers on the ground in their communities.\n\nThat strategy plays into Nike's efforts to focus its marquee brands — Nike, Jordan, and Converse — on key sports such as running and basketball. It's also pushing a new collaboration, NikeSKIMS, an athleisure brand for women.\n\n\"We are in the midst of realignment at Nike,\" Nike said in a July statement to Business Insider. The realignment and sport strategy aim to \"create sharper distinction and dimension\" for its brands, the company said.\n\nHere's what some key Nike roles can earn, based on work visa data for the year ending September 30.\n\nThe salary data includes information from Nike Inc. and some subsidiaries, such as its retail services arm and Air Manufacturing Innovation division. It reflects US-based roles and, given that it's based on H-1 B visa disclosures, tends to skew more tech-focused.\n\nSoftware Engineer: $124,592 to $203,581 a year\n\nSoftware Engineer I: $120,000 to $144,612 a year\n\nSoftware Engineer II: $152,007 to $178,231 a year\n\nSoftware Engineer III: $139,845 to $180,353 a year\n\nSenior Director, Software Engineering: $301,378 a year\n\nData Engineering: $104,500 to $175,000 a year\n\nData Analytics: $114,600 to $118,398 a year\n\nDirector, Supply Chain AI/ML Engineering: $252,535 a year\n\nMaterials Designer: $100,000 a year\n\nSenior Digital Product Designer: $155,810 a year\n\nSenior 3D Designer: $106,605 a year\n\nDirector, NikeSKIMS Apparel Design: $244,466 a year\n\nSenior Manager, Software Engineering: $273,156 a year\n\nDelivery Excellence, Uniform Operations Manager: $164,439 a year\n\nSenior Product Manager: $153,431 to $169,744 a year\n\nManager, Data Engineer: $168,031 to $213,190 a year\n\nSenior Program Manager: $147,434 a year\n\nSupply Chain Intelligence Manager: $158,311 a year\n\nLead Professional, Sports Marketing: $128,434 to $143,251 a year\n\nVP, Global Brand Marketing, Women's: $425,000 a year\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The U.S. already has special visas for workers in sectors like agriculture and tech",
    "fullText": "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to give special visas to construction workers, given that the Trump administration’s deportation campaign is reportedly causing a labor shortage on construction sites in states like Texas.\n\nThe Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act, introduced in September, would offer non-citizens temporary, renewable visas for up to nine years to work in key industries where employers are struggling to hire.\n\n“That would help us protect and get immigrants legally for those in the construction industry,” Rep. Monica De La Cruz (R-TX) told Nexstar.\n\nDe La Cruz was part of a group of South Texas leaders who met with House Speaker Mike Johnson this week to discuss the proposal, as home builders in the state warn of slowing construction times and difficulty hiring over fears of immigration raids.\n\n“They hear Monte Cielo and say, ‘No, no. You can pay me whatever you want, but I’m not going to go work there,’” Alejandro Garcia, a home builder at work on a development in Weslaco, Texas, that has been raided multiple times, told The Wall Street Journal last week.\n\nA concrete supplier in the region, meanwhile, told the paper that concrete use fell 60 percent between May and November, as builders lost workers and projects stalled.\n\n“A project that was taking maybe four to five months on an average, starter-type home is now taking eight, nine, 10 months, just because of the delays,” Efrain Gomez, treasurer of the South Texas Builders Association, told NewsNation. “It’s a huge ripple effect.”\n\nImmigrants, legal and otherwise, make up more than half the construction workforce in states like Texas, California, Florida, and New York, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nThe Trump administration’s immigration campaign has butted up against key industries like agriculture, hospitality, and construction that rely heavily on the labor of immigrants and undocumented people.\n\nThe administration has pushed to expand the H-2A visa for farm workers, and last year, Trump toyed with a pause on raids on hotels, restaurants, and agriculture, only for the administration to insist days later there would be “no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"\n\nThe administration has faced similar tensions over the H-1B specialist visa program, which is heavily in use by the president’s allies in the tech industry but undercuts his emphasis on hiring American workers.",

    "fullText": "LTK, a Softbank-backed startup and creator economy unicorn, let go of some staff on Thursday as part of a reorganization, a company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe cuts were designed to refocus LTK's business around its revamped brand platform and to account for structural changes to internal teams like marketing, according to the company.\n\nThe job reductions, which hit a variety of roles including software engineers and staffers who worked with creators, affected a low single-digit percentage of LTK's overall head count, which numbers over 550 employees, they said.\n\n\"LTK recently completed a targeted organizational restructure to ensure we are aligned around the skills and priorities required for our next phase of growth,\" the spokesperson said. \"This was not a broad-based layoff, but a strategic realignment focused on strengthening performance and positioning the business for long-term success.\"\n\nLTK, previously known as RewardStyle, was founded around 15 years ago by president Amber Venz Box. The company, which says it's profitable and doubled its EBITDA in 2025, has raised a little over $300 million in its lifetime. Most of that capital came in a 2021 round from SoftBank's Vision Fund 2, which valued the startup at $2 billion.\n\nOver the last decade, LTK has established itself as one of the leading players in affiliate marketing, building a network of influencers who promote products on social media in exchange for commissions.\n\nRecently, the company has made a series of moves to establish itself beyond social media affiliate marketing.\n\nThe company relaunched its app for influencer-driven shopping, called LTK, in early 2025, to add more consumer-facing features as it sought to build its own brand identity with consumers.\n\nIn late 2025, the company announced it was revamping its platform for brands, offering features such as creator discovery and performance tracking at no cost. LTK makes money by collecting a commission on sales. The company said that over 1,000 brands have been onboarded onto the platform.\n\nLTK is one of several creator economy startups that have focused their businesses on e-commerce.

    "description": "The red storm was too much for the ‘Cats to stop in Clearwater.",
    "fullText": "Last night brought a test of epic proportions for Northwestern, as it was tasked with taking down No. 1 Texas Tech in its first game of its long weekend in Clearwater, Fla.\n\nThe start seemed promising for NU, but reality struck early, and the hope for an upset slowly faded as the ‘Cats posted zero after zero in the bottom half of each inning.\n\nThat reality check was the nation’s best returning arm in NiJaree Canady, who pitched five innings of relief for the win, only giving up two hits while striking out eight.\n\nAs for the Red Raiders, it took them an inning to figure out Northwestern starter Emma Blea, crossing the plate twice in the second and never looking back. The two that crossed the plate were the only two earned runs for NU pitchers.\n\nIt was smooth sailing for Blea in the top of the first, as she retired .500 hitter Mihyia Davis on a lineout to center before painting the outside corner to log a backwards K at the expense of Mia Williams.\n\nFirst strikeout of the day for Emma Blea, and we are off at the @ClearwaterInv! 🔥\n\nT1 | NU 0, Texas Tech 0 pic.twitter.com/tEduUMGjTj\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nTaylor Pannell reached on an infield single on the very next pitch before Blea retired the side, doing her own dirty work by scooping up a Jackie Lis grounder.\n\nNorthwestern’s first at-bat was nearly a copy-paste of Texas Tech’s: a K, a popout, a single and a flyout all in succession.\n\nA leadoff walk surrendered to Alana Johnson came back to sting Blea and the ‘Cats later in the second. Lauren Allred laced a one-out double into the right-center gap, scoring Johnson to break the ice. Lagi Quiroga followed with one of her own, this one to the opposite gap, as the Red Raiders swiftly snatched an early 2-0 lead.\n\nNU seemed to kickstart some momentum of its own after Blea got back into her groove to end the inning. Kansas Robinson found herself on base after an error from Red Raiders’ starter Samantha Lincoln. Tru Medina then stood in the box to get plunked by a pitch, and after a Bridget Donahey flyout and an Izzy Cunnea sac fly, Kate Renschen drew a walk to load the bases.\n\nTexas Tech head coach Gerry Glasco then emerged from the dugout to bring out Canady, who cleaned up the mess in two pitches to halt the second-inning rally.\n\nBlea continued to settle back down and sent the ’Cats back to the dish after a 1-2-3 inning in the third, highlighted by a smooth play from Medina.\n\nWe see you, Tru Medina! 👀👏\n\nThe rookie making plays in the hot corner!#SCTop10 pic.twitter.com/GOVeIwi886\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nThe heart of the Northwestern order seemed to have Canady scouted, but luck wasn’t on its side in the frame. Kelsey Nader grounded out after a nine-pitch at-bat, Kaylie Avvisato ripped a line drive only to have it gloved by Pannell and Robinson went down on strikes after working a full count.\n\nBad omens continued to haunt Northwestern as it took the field for the fourth. An error by Donahey at short gave way to another double by Allred, setting up two runners in scoring position for Texas Tech. Quiroga’s sac fly did the job to drive in the run, padding the lead once more.\n\nThe ‘Cats seemed to have spiraled themselves out of the contest, as Canady shoved in the next half-frame, striking out Medina and Dohaney before getting a measly pop-up out of Cunnea to finish the fourth still unscathed.\n\nSigne Dohse’s first full inning of relief went quite smoothly, as she bounced back from an early base hit and induced soft contact to get out of the frame. Canady took note and did the same, also getting in and out of the circle after facing four batters.\n\nMedina’s throwing error to start the sixth opened the door of opportunity for Texas Tech, and it walked straight through. Allred got hit by a pitch to advance Logan Halleman, Hailey Toney laid down a bunt to move both runners and Davis came through to bring them both home on Texas Tech’s fourth two-bagger of the night.\n\nThat would be all for the Red Raiders’ scoring, but that was all Canady needed. She sat down five of the next six batters she faced before Chloe Riassetto’s number was called for the final out and the save.\n\nQuite the jarring welcome from the Panhandle for the ‘Cats to process, but there’s no rest for the weary. After Northwestern’s loss to UCF on Friday morning, NU rounds out the trip with contests against Missouri, No. 17 Georgia and No. 8 Texas A&M.",

    "description": "On the right track to start",
    "fullText": "The first week of the season has Georgia Tech Softball off to a promising start. Already with a 5-2 record under their belts, the team looks ahead to their upcoming weekend in Gainesville, Florida for the Florida Classic, where they will play University of Florida (7-0; 0-0 SEC), Florida International University (FIU) (6-0; 0-0 C-USA), and Marshall University (4-3; 0-0 SBC) throughout the weekend.\n\nThe first matchup of the season was a home series last week versus Villanova as part of the Buzz Classic. The Jackets took home the win in both the Thursday and Friday games 8-0. Thursday’s game was pitched by sophomore Madalyn Johnson and Friday’s by sophomore Tymber Harris.\n\nUnfortunately, that was immediately met with a series of losses against #16 Alabama, where the Crimson Tide took the Friday and Saturday games from the Jackets, resulting in the two losses on the record. Alabama won 9-0 and 7-2 during those games.\n\nTech  ended the weekend with two wins versus East Carolina University (ECU) 13-6 and 6-2 in their Sunday doubleheader. The Jackets used five different pitchers between the two games with  Johnson seeing both games for a total of seven innings pitched against ECU.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Jackets took on the Kennesaw State Owls, adding to their slew of wins with a 10-2, 6-inning victory. Senior Kenley Hilleary started the game against her former school, pitching over half of the game before sophomore Sydnie Watts finished the game to secure the 10-2 win for the Jackets. Senior outfielder Paige Vukadinovich and sophomore outfielder Alyssa Willer shared the most runs scored for the team at three each, with senior infielder Jayden Gailey, freshman outfielder Abby McKinnis, freshman infielder and utility player Madi Duffel, and senior catcher Reese Hunter scoring one each as well.\n\nThis weekend, the team takes on the Florida Classic in Gainesville to face FIU at 1:00pm and Florida at 6:00pm Friday, FIU at 9:00am and Marshall at 11:30am on Saturday, and Florida at 11:30am on Sunday.",

    "fullText": "Tech titans had a Thursday to forget this week.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, and Michael Dell saw a combined $26 billion wiped off their net worths in one day, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nTheir fortunes shrank because their respective stakes in Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and Dell slid in value. The stock prices of those first four companies fell by around 2% on Thursday, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the immense costs of building out AI infrastructure and whether they'd see a return on their spending.\n\nDell shares tumbled 9% after rival Lenovo warned a memory-chip shortage was driving up costs, raising concerns on Wall Street that other hardware manufacturers would also see their profits contract. The sell-off triggered a $5 billion drop in its founder's personal fortune to $135 billion.\n\nMusk saw an unmatched $8 billion wealth decline on Thursday. But the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is still up about $57 billion at $676 billion this year, thanks to the soaring valuations of SpaceX and another of his companies, xAI.\n\nZuckerberg took an almost $7 billion blow to his net worth, fueling a year-to-date decline for the Meta CEO of a little over $3 billion, to $230 billion.\n\nBezos' fortune fell by $4 billion, extending the Amazon founder's wealth decline this year to around $27 billion.\n\nHuang rounded out the tech quintet with a $2.5 billion reduction in the Nvidia CEO's net worth, according to Bloomberg's rich list.\n\nOther tech bosses also saw some of their wealth erased. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin took roughly $1.5 billion hits to their net worths on Thursday as shares of Google's parent company slipped by less than 1%.\n\nIn contrast, Walmart stock climbed nearly 4% to a record high on Thursday, as fears eased over tariffs and investors rotated out of tech.\n\nThe retailer's stock jump added more than $4 billion to the respective net worths of founder Sam Walton's three surviving children: Jim, Rob, and Alice.\n\nThe trio was worth more than $150 billion each at Thursday's close. They only trail Musk in wealth gain this year after notching increases of more than $20 billion apiece.\n\nThe world's 10 wealthiest people together grew nearly $600 billion richer last year, catapulting their combined fortunes above $2.5 trillion — more than Amazon is worth.",

    "title": "I'm a solo founder with AI agents instead of employees. My 'council' of AI agents saves me 20 hours a week.",
    "description": "A defense-tech founder built an AI \"council\" of 15 agents to help him run his company, using ChatGPT and Nvidia tools to replace traditional roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aaron Sneed, a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started my business, as a solopreneur, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nThe council, which is compiled of all AI agents, helps me save around 20 hours a week, and that's a very conservative estimate. Every kind of general corporate chair, HR, legal, and finance AI agent has a seat on the council.\n\nHere's how I use around 15 custom agents, including a chief of staff agent, to manage my workload.\n\nI've worked on autonomous platforms that make decisions independently for at least 10 years. That made me latch onto commercial large language models and AI tools very quickly when they came out.\n\nI primarily use Nvidia's platform as my underlying hardware for technical prototyping and experimentation. I use their GPUs, and they provide free access to their AI software since I purchased their hardware. Additionally, my council is built on OpenAI's ChatGPT business platform using custom GPTs and projects.\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nMy chief of staff agent is important because it's the voice that sets priority based on parameters like risks, issues, and opportunities.\n\nI told my chief of staff which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback because I've learned that they naturally want to agree with me. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish.\n\nI have a roundtable set up with all my AI agents, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nThe training never really stops, because if I don't continuously train the models, I won't get the outputs I want or need. It takes me about two weeks to train my agents to the level of experience they need to be at for me to feel confident in them. Early on, it took me longer to produce a deliverable than if I'd just done it myself because I hadn't focused properly on training.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nAll of the AI companies have different prompt engineering guides. I recommend taking the time to look at them because there's a lot of user error that causes things to slow down when working with AI.\n\nIt takes time to get the agents to a good place. A lot of companies are going to try to jump into using AI too quickly for too much without understanding how to use it properly, and these companies could hurt themselves in the long run.\n\nI'm ill-equipped to handle a lot of these roles and responsibilities, but I'm also forced to do it because I'm bootstrapped.\n\nWith my legal agent in particular, I've learned the bounds of putting AI tools into real-world practice. I have a lawyer, and I use my legal agent to try to do some upfront work before handing documents off to my lawyer for a patent or dispute case, or anything like that.\n\nWhen I was training my model to help me use facts and data to plot a case, I had a lot of information laid out, and I thought what my legal agent created sounded good to me as a non-lawyer. Then I presented all that information to my lawyer, and he said that it was technically and factually correct, but we don't want to express that information because it shows our cards going in.\n\nHis legal skillset helped me realize that, even though I thought my agent was correct and ideal to use, it still won't replace a lawyer with that human context, experience, and skills.\n\nIdeally, I would have an HR person, a legal person, and so on, and each would have their own chief of staff AI agent who would help them out. That's what I think the future will look like.",

    "description": "Lyft software engineers can make as much as $312,000 in base pay, according to work visa data. Explore salary ranges for other tech roles.",
    "fullText": "Lyft is setting itself up for its next stage of growth.\n\nThe service, which relies on about 1 million gig-worker drivers, is breaking into new areas, including launching a service for older riders called Lyft Silver and one for teens. Like rival Uber, Lyft is also experimenting with self-driving cars, a development that CEO David Risher said could be \"transformational.\"\n\n\"A new Lyft is emerging,\" Risher said on the company's August earnings call, after it reported new highs for gross bookings, adjusted earnings, and free cash flow during its second quarter.\n\nThat comeback has hit snags. In February, its stock fell 17% in one day on disappointing fourth-quarter results and a surprise operating loss for 2025.\n\nStill, Risher, who became the company's CEO in 2023, said on a February earnings call that Lyft is on track to meet its 2027 financial goals, which include reaching $25 billion in annual gross bookings as well as targets for free cash flow and EBITDA.\n\nAll of that requires hiring the right people.\n\nAs of mid-February, Lyft had about 150 jobs listed on its website, spanning positions from AI transformation strategist to software engineer.\n\nWork visa data shows that Lyft sought to hire about 140 workers through the H-1B program in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended on September 30, based on filings with the US Department of Labor.\n\nLyft did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nCompanies are required to submit this work visa data, including salary information, to the US Department of Labor for foreign hires. The compensation figures don't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to base pay. However, the salaries in the filings are benchmarked against industry-average pay rates for similar roles and can provide insight into what the company pays for those jobs.\n\nThe process could change if the Trump administration's proposed changes to the H-1B visa system take effect.\n\nOver the last several months, Trump added a $100,000 fee to new applications and proposed changes to work visa rules that could give an edge to the highest-paid applicants. However, these changes were largely initiated after this reporting period.\n\nHere's a look at some of the annual salaries for Lyft jobs included in the disclosures:\n\nData Science Manager: $176,000 to $300,000\n\nData Scientist: $120,000 to $264,000\n\nData Engineer: $130,250 to $222,000\n\nSoftware Engineer: $128,000 to $312,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $181,000 to $300,000\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $144,000 to $207,500\n\nNetwork Engineer: $115,000 to $165,000\n\nEngineering Manager: $148,000 to $264,000\n\nBusiness Systems Engineer: $138,000 to $176,880\n\nData Analyst: $118,000 to $177,000\n\nAnalytics Lead: $114,000 to $150,000\n\nProduct Manager: $148,000 to $264,000\n\nProduct Designer: $124,000 to $155,000\n\nActuarial Analyst: $108,000 to $192,000\n\nSenior Analyst: $123,280 to $207,000\n\nFinancial Data Analyst: $90,000 to $162,000\n\nDo you have a story to share about Lyft?

    "fullText": "Dip-buyers in the retail crowd rushed back into stocks and ETFs after last week's big software-led plunge, JPMorgan says.\n\nJPMorgan quantitative strategists examined trading trends among retail investors, finding that retail investors bought the dip after the sell-off and after some post-earnings stock moves. They also flagged some stocks to watch due to an imbalance between retail and institutional interest.\n\nDuring the software meltdown, retail traders pulled back, with buying hitting a year-to-date low on February 5. From Friday, February 6, to Wednesday, February 11, retail investor flows surged above the daily average seen so far in 2026, largely driven by ETFs, compared to single stocks.\n\nHere is a closer look at some of the themes popular with retail traders following the software-led rout, according to JPMorgan.\n\nAfter the software sector sold off into a bear market, retail investors piled into high-quality AI plays.\n\nJPMorgan highlighted Microsoft as one of the stocks that retail investors bought the dip in, and noted it's one of the bank's \"AI-Resilient\" software stock picks.\n\nPalantir and AppLovin stand out as some of the top software names bought in the retail space in 2026, along with Microsoft. Salesforce, Roper Technologies, and Intuit were some of the most-sold names in the same period.\n\nBeyond the past week, retail traders have broadly preferred buying media and semiconductor stocks while selling software since the start of 2026.\n\nRetail investors shared some of Wall Street's worries about Big Tech's AI spending after earnings, but sentiment was mixed, JPM said, citing Reddit comments.\n\nThe analysts highlighted that retail traders bought the post-earnings dip in Amazon and Alphabet shares, while sitting out on Meta stock's climb.\n\nJPMorgan flagged several stocks popular on social media that saw high retail buying and high hedge fund shorting.\n\nThey noted that this combination of social media interest and conflicting retail and institutional investors signals potential unexpected flows.\n\nIn the last week, stocks with a large imbalance between retail buying and hedge fund shorting include Hims and Hers and Strategy.",

    "fullText": "Leaders at the software company Canva used to wonder whether job candidates were secretly using AI during technical interviews.\n\nManagers saw the company's engineers getting more done with the technology, so they needed to ensure new hires could do the same.\n\n\"We just flipped the script and went, 'OK, we're going to invite you to use AI,'\" Brendan Humphreys, Canva's chief technology officer, told Business Insider.\n\nThe result, he said, has been stronger hires better equipped to wield powerful AI tools to help write code and solve problems.\n\nCanva is one of a growing number of companies — including Meta and McKinsey — that are inviting some job candidates to use AI in parts of the hiring process.\n\nBroadly, when ChatGPT emerged in late 2022, many employers worried that job seekers would use AI to help talk their way past interviewers. Yet as the technology becomes more capable and embedded in daily work, a number of companies are moving from policing it to evaluating candidates' AI know-how.\n\nThat's what happened at Arcade, an IT infrastructure startup. The company has always asked technical candidates to complete a take-home exercise. Yet now, it expects them to use AI in the process, Alex Salazar, the company's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the technology's capabilities surged over the past year or so, he realized that candidates would likely turn to AI regardless of whether Arcade sanctioned it. Ultimately, Salazar said, the company wants its workers, including new hires, to use AI.\n\n\"So why are we creating this artificial test that doesn't even really reflect the work they're going to do when they get here?\" he said.\n\nHumphreys came to a similar conclusion at Canva. To factor in AI, he said, the company reworked its technical interview to make the questions \"complex, ambiguous, and problematic.\"\n\n\"If you just dump the question that we're giving you into an AI, you're going to get a substandard answer,\" Humphreys said.\n\nTo land a job at the company, which has about 265 million monthly users of its graphic design software, technical candidates need to know how to thoughtfully question AI, he said.\n\nOne way to avoid concerns that candidates might be leaning too hard on AI is to have job seekers show their work. In Canva's case, the company asks candidates to share their screen during a technical interview.\n\n\"We want to see the interactions with the AI as much as the output of the tool,\" Humphreys said.\n\nArcade tells candidates to use whatever AI tools they want on their exercise, then include a transcript of their conversations with the AI. The idea is to learn who knows how to do the job and to work with an agent. Doing so, Salazar said, comes with a \"very real learning curve.\"\n\nHe said that the shift to allowing AI use in the exercise meant that Arcade placed greater emphasis on a candidate's \"taste.\" That sensibility is important, he said, because AI can kick out answers, yet the best results often come from repeated iteration with these tools, he said.\n\n\"It's going to show their ability to use the AI, but it's also going to show what they think 'good' is,\" Salazar said of candidates' interactions with AI.\n\nOther companies want workers to demonstrate their AI acumen during the hiring process, too.\n\nIn a June post on an internal message board, Meta said it was developing a coding interview in which candidates could use an AI assistant, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat mode of working, Meta wrote, was \"more representative\" of the environment in which future developers would be operating. It also makes \"LLM-based cheating less effective,\" the company said, referring to large language models.\n\nThe consulting firm McKinsey & Company is piloting a change to its graduate recruiting process, asking candidates to use the company's internal AI assistant, Lilli, during case interviews to assess how they work with the technology, several media outlets reported in January.\n\nThe acceptance of, or even the preference for, AI in some parts of hiring doesn't mean companies will welcome job seekers who use the tools to misrepresent their skills. Even if a candidate gets away with it at first, hiring managers are likely to eventually discover that someone doesn't have the goods, Susan Peppercorn, an executive coach, told Business Insider.\n\nThat's because candidates who complete an assessment, for example, \"are going to have to explain how they arrived at their thinking,\" she said.\n\nUnderstanding that thought process is what Canva seeks in its hiring, said Humphreys, who oversees roughly 2,600 technical employees in roles including software engineering, IT, and machine learning.\n\nIt's a way of seeing whether a candidate makes sound technical decisions when it starts producing code, he said.\n\n\"What we're testing for now in our interview process is an ability to harness that power, to control that power — to kind of ride the dragon,\" Humphreys said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Maker of chatbot with coding ability says annualised revenue grew tenfold in each of past three years, to $14bn\n\nAnthropic, the US AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, has raised $30bn (£22bn) in a funding round that more than doubled its valuation to $380bn.\n\nThe company’s previous funding round in September achieved a value of $183bn, with further improvements in the technology since then spurring even greater investor interest.\n\nThe fundraising was announced amid a series of stock market moves against industries that face disruption from the latest models, including software, trucking and logistics, wealth management and commercial property services.\n\nThe funding round, led by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the hedge fund Coatue Management, is among the largest private fundraising deals on record.\n\n“Anthropic is the clear category leader in enterprise AI,” said Choo Yong Cheen, the chief investment officer of private equity at GIC.\n\nAnthropic said its annualised revenue – an estimate of full-year sales based on recent company data – had reached $14bn, having grown more than tenfold in each of the past three years. A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.\n\nAnthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.\n\nThe staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.\n\nAnthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many of the US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.\n\nSome listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.\n\nShares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid out this month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.\n\n“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies. \n\n “Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.\n\nFounded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.\n\nThe funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this article",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: in 2025 briefing to Wes Streeting, officials warned reputation of tech firm behind US ICE operations would hinder rollout of data system in UK\n\nHealth officials fear Palantir’s reputation will hinder the delivery of a “vital” £330m NHS contract, according to briefings seen by the Guardian, sparking fresh calls for the deal to be scrapped.\n\nIn 2023, ministers selected Palantir, a US surveillance technology company that also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation, to build an AI-enabled data platform to connect disparate health information across the NHS.\n\nNow it has emerged that after Keir Starmer demanded faster deployment, Whitehall officials privately warned that the public perception of Palantir would limit its rollout, meaning the contract would not offer value for money.\n\nPalantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.\n\nBefore he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.\n\nMPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.\n\nIn a private briefing for Wes Streeting before a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.\n\n“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”\n\nThe briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.\n\nThe officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”\n\nDonald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.\n\n“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”\n\nThe BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.\n\nThe briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.\n\nStreeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.\n\nNone mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”\n\nNew figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for the NHS as a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.\n\nThe former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.\n\nHe said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.\n\n“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”\n\nJohn Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.\n\n“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.\n\n“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”\n\nNHS England declined to comment.",

    "description": "The sharpest minds in business and tech are responding to a viral essay on AI's impact on jobs with some approval and a lot of skepticism.",
    "fullText": "Scientists and business leaders are responding to a viral essay warning of AI's impact on jobs with a mix of agreement and skepticism.\n\nThe essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" written by cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI, Matt Shumer, has racked up more than 60 million views on X as of Thursday.\n\nIn the 5,000-word post, Shumer said that AI could upend daily life on a scale \"much bigger\" than COVID, a comparison which drew pushback online. He wrote that the changes already unfolding in the tech sector are likely a preview of disruptions that could soon reach other industries as well.\n\n\"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare,\" Shumer told Business Insider's Brent Griffiths in an interview.\n\nHere's what some of the sharpest minds in AI are saying about Shumer's essay.\n\nHaber, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz specializing in technology investments, posted on X that Shumer's essay contains \"great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\"\n\n\"'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days is going to be the most valuable person in the room.' Not eventually. Right now,\" Haber quotes from the essay. \"Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's possible.\"\n\nThe Reddit founder responded to Shumer's initial post on X with a simple comment: \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\nSince 2023, Reddit has introduced a range of AI-driven tools, from search features that summarize user discussions to AI that sharpens its content recommendations and targets ads, but Ohanian recently emphasized that the platform must retain its humanity to stay competitive.\n\nMarkowitz, the author and managing partner and director of research at Nightview Capital, a long-term-oriented investment firm, responded to Schumer with an essay almost as long, which criticized the practice of chasing speed and replacing the value of humanity simply because it could be done.\n\n\"These two worlds — Wall Street and Silicon Valley — have formed a feedback loop of short-termism so tight, so self-reinforcing, that they've confused efficiency with purpose, growth with meaning, and the elimination of people with progress,\" wrote Markowitz.\n\n\"I have two research assistants. Could I replace them with AI? Of course. But their value extends their weekly output,\" Markowitz added. \"They give meaning to my work and I love seeing the excitement in their faces when they make a new discovery that I, alone, could not have found.\"\n\n\"Let me say it again: we are not our tools. We never have been,\" Markowitz wrote in conclusion.\n\nMcLees, the founder of HumanSkills.AI, wrote on X that Shumer is not wrong, but he said that the advice Shumer provided is akin to \"telling someone the floodwaters are rising and handing them a better bucket.\"\n\n\"As AI grows in ability, our role in defining direction, values, and purpose only becomes more essential,\" McLees said.\n\n\"What do you bring when the machine can do the work? That's the only question that matters when intelligence is abundant,\" McLees added. \"Shumer wrote the alarm. It's a good one. But alarms don't tell you where to go. You have to find that within yourself.\"\n\nMarcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU and founder of AI companies Robust.AI, has some harsh words for Schumer in his newsletter.\n\nMarcuz called Shumer's blog post \"weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech,\" and said he did not provide real data to support the claim that the latest AI can write complicated apps without mistakes.\n\n\"Shumer's presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere,\" Marcus added, after discussing various studies that question the accuracy and productivity gain AI tools actually provide.\n\nMisra, Vice Dean of Computing and Artificial Intelligence at Columbia University, responded in a lengthy Substack article that detailed why he doesn't think AI is as scary as it sounds, at least not right now.\n\nMisra wrote that many strange AI behaviors that make them seem sentient, such as perceived resistance and self-preservation, are simply a result of training data.\n\nAs for the possible elimination of jobs, Misra said he understands the anxiety, but history says we may not need to panic.\n\n\"When the camera was invented, portrait painters had every reason to panic. Their livelihood depended on a skill that a machine could now approximate,\" Misra wrote.\n\n\"What happened? Painters didn't disappear. They were freed from the obligation to faithfully reproduce reality and ventured into impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism,\" Misra added. \"The camera didn't kill painting. It liberated it.\"",

We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",

    "description": "Ring's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies.",
    "fullText": "Ring is terminating its partnership with police tech provider Flock Safety, the Amazon-owned company announced Thursday.\n\nThe partnership between Flock and Ring came under scrutiny after the Amazon doorbell company ran an ad during the Super Bowl that touted a \"Search Party\" feature that uses AI to help locate lost pets. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the feature a \"surveillance nightmare.\"\n\nFlock, meanwhile, operates a network of automated license plate readers, and sells access to that software to customers that include law enforcement agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.\n\nRing's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies. Earlier this week, Salesforce employees pressed CEO Marc Benioff to cancel \"ICE opportunities,\" CNBC reported. More than 900 Google employees also asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nPrivacy and civil liberties advocates called on Ring to drop its partnership with Flock. A protest calling on the e-commerce company to cut its ties with Flock, ICE and CBP is scheduled for Friday, outside of Amazon's Seattle headquarters.\n\n\"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated,\" Ring wrote in a blog post. \"As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration.\"\n\nFlock representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmazon acquired Ring for $839 million in 2018. The home security company is primarily known for its connected doorbell devices, which can record footage and alert users to activity around their home or business via an app.\n\nRing has long sparked controversy about privacy due to its partnerships with police. In recent years, the company had adopted a softer image, positioning its devices as a tool to capture porch pirates and family-friendly hijinks. After founder Jamie Siminoff returned as CEO last year, the company has re-embraced its original mission of fighting crime.\n\nThe Amazon company announced its partnership with Flock last October, giving owners of its video doorbells the option to share footage with law enforcement agencies that use the startup's software to assist with their \"evidence collection and investigative work.\"\n\nFlock's systems have been adopted by thousands of communities and law enforcement agencies across the country, and both ICE and CBP have increasingly accessed Flock's data as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nRing spokesperson Emma Daniels said in a statement that the Flock partnership was never active, and the companies never announced a date for it to go live.\n\n\"No videos were ever shared between these services,\" Daniels said.\n\nThe news was earlier reported by The Verge.",

    "fullText": "Vybe, the startup cofounded by two repeat Y Combinator entrepreneurs, has raised $10 million to bring vibe coding inside large companies.\n\nThe practice of vibe coding has become more widespread as it allows people to use AI and natural language prompts to build an app, rather than traditional programming. The sector has attracted hundreds of millions in venture funding and is blurring the lines for businesses deciding between buying software or just vibe-coding their own tools.\n\nWhile popular vibe-coding products like Lovable and Replit have made it easy for companies to create prototypes and landing pages, Vybe offers stronger security that cannot be modified by AI and also taps into internal data systems, said cofounder and CEO Quang Hoang.\n\nHoang previously founded the engineering mentorship platform Plato and is building Vybe alongside cofounder and CTO Fabien Devos, founder of the security AI startup Wolfia.\n\nVybe lets teams across an organization collaborate on apps. Engineering teams manage access to internal systems like Salesforce, Snowflake, and Databricks, while business teams can build apps for onboarding, performance reviews, customer service, and more.\n\n\"The new SaaS is going to be more like Legos,\" Hoang said, referring to software-as-a-service. \"You can build it exactly how you want.\"\n\nVybe also offers app templates created by high-profile executives, such as former Airbnb product leader Lenny Rachitsky and Front cofounder Mathilde Collin, that users can \"remix\" to suit their needs, including templates for performance reviews and one-on-one meetings.\n\nFirst Round Capital led Vybe's seed round, which featured participation from Y Combinator, the CEOs of Datadog and Grammarly, and product leaders from OpenAI and Meta.\n\nVybe has six employees and dozens of customers, Hoang said. It plans to use the funding to hire engineers. Vybe charges $12 per user a month, plus usage-based credits for app development.\n\nThe round comes as vibe coding continues to attract major funding — with startups like Emergent pulling in tens of millions from Khosla Ventures and SoftBank — even as Barclays analysts warn the initial boom may be cooling.\n\nAt the same time, investors are also weighing how AI and vibe-coding tools can reshape the software sector. Software stocks have entered one of their sharpest downturns in years, shedding roughly $2 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nHere's a look at the pitch deck Vybe used to raise its $10 million seed round. One slide has been removed, and another redacted so that the deck can be shared publicly.",

    "title": "MLB owners crack down on pitch stealing with new rule aimed at first- and third-base coaches",
    "description": "Pitch stealing is allowed as long as players and coaches don't use in-game technology to steal signs.",
    "fullText": "MLB owners want to make it harder for teams to engage in pitch-stealing tactics on the field. Team owners reportedly voted to approve a rule Thursday that would prevent first- and third-base coaches from leaving their coaches' boxes on the field until after a pitcher throws a pitch, according to ESPN's Jesse Rogers.\n\nMLB owners wanted to crack down on the tactic due to concern over first- and third-base coaches moving up and down the foul line to try to get a better view of the pitcher, per ESPN. If those coaches discovered what pitch was coming, they would reportedly relay that information directly to the batter or to a runner on second base, who could signal to the hitter what pitch was coming.\n\nThe league attempted to curb the tactic during the 2025 World Series, when it told both the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays to make sure their first- and third-base coaches stayed in their designated coaches' boxes on the field.\n\nWith the creation of PitchCom, the art of stealing catcher signs is essentially extinct around the league. Because MLB teams will try to exploit any advantage possible, teams and coaches have turned to extensive film study ahead of games, trying to find tells from the pitcher or catcher to determine what pitch is coming next. Unlike the pitch-stealing scandal the Houston Astros engaged in during the 2017 MLB season, this version of pitch-stealing is completely legal since it doesn't rely on the in-game use of technology.\n\nIn 2017, the Astros were accused of using cameras and video monitors to steal signs from their opponents. After MLB conducted an investigation into those claims, commissioner Rob Manfred announced one-year suspensions for then-Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and then-manager A.J. Hinch. Shortly after those suspensions were announced, the Astros fired both men.\n\nBoston Red Sox manager Alex Cora was later suspended for a year for his involvement in the scandal. Cora previously coached with the Astros before being hired by the Red Sox in 2018. The Red Sox fired Cora ahead of the 2020 season, but brought him back for the 2021 MLB season.\n\nPlayers and coaches are allowed to steal signs from pitchers or catchers during games without the use of technology, but MLB reportedly felt first- and third-base coaches were getting too brazen with their tactics, per ESPN.\n\nThe MLB rulebook states the first- and third-base coaches must remain in their coaches' box from the time the pitcher steps on the pitching rubber to the time the ball is caught by the catcher or put in play. Coaches, however, are allowed to leave the coaches' box for safety reasons.\n\nUnder the new rule, first- and third-base coaches will receive a warning for their first violation. After that, coaches could be ejected from games for leaving the coaches' box too early, per ESPN.",

    "fullText": "The S&P 500 will rally for the next year before facing a double-digit correction, Capital Economics says.\n\nThe research firm said it saw the index rising as high as 8,000 before falling back to 7,000.\n\nThat's because investors will realize tech valuations have gone too far, the firm said.\n\nStocks are headed for one last hurrah in the coming year before the AI-fueled rally unravels, according to one research firm.\n\nIn recent client notes, Capital Economics said it believed the S&P 500 would likely rally over the next year before running into a steep correction. It sees the benchmark index rising as high as 8,000 in 2026, before falling to 7,000 next year in a drop of about 13% to a \"more normal level,\" the firm wrote on Monday.\n\n\"A more plausible scenario is that the stock market 'collapses under its own weight' as investors reassess stretched valuations for major tech firms while still believing in AI's long-term benefits for the real economy,\" Jennifer McKeown and William Jackson, two economists at the firm, wrote, adding that as much of a 30% correction was possible in the worst-case scenario.\n\nThere are a few reasons the firm sees a double-digit drop brewing:\n\nValuations are high but not excessive, given how strong corporate earnings are. Yet, tech stocks are pricey and could keep rising, Thomas Mathews, the head of markets at the firm, wrote on Monday.\n\nMathews pointed to the price-to-forward 12-month earnings ratio of the US tech sector, one measure of how highly stocks are valued. That ratio briefly rose to its highest level since the dot-com bubble last year, before easing, per Capital Economics' analysis.\n\n\"We suspect that as the rally progresses, a rise in valuations is more likely than not. Indeed, even though they are, in our view, not yet excessive, it wouldn't be surprising if investors' enthusiasm for AI tech were to push valuations to a level perhaps above what might be sustainable in the long run,\" Mathews said.\n\nWhile the backdrop for earnings is still positive, earnings growth in the S&P 500 has largely been concentrated in the tech sector, a key vulnerability to valuations.\n\n\"Admittedly, it is, perhaps, possible that a 'bubble' could emerge in expectations for earnings, rather than valuations,\" Mathews speculated.\n\n\"It's possible that rapid earnings growth at tech companies will, also, eventually come back to earth, even if that doesn't seem set to happen this year,\" he added.",

    "description": "Wall Street is gearing up for an update on the Fed's favored inflation gauge after the jobs report bolstered the case against cutting rates.",
    "fullText": "US stocks turned sharply lower Thursday, as investors revived a rotation out of megacap tech stocks as they looked ahead Friday's inflation reading to guide rate-cut bets, already dampened by a strong January jobs report.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell roughly 1%, or over 500 points, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell nearly 2%.\n\nThe mixed picture comes as investors scrutinize incoming earnings closely for clues to the sectors vulnerable to AI disruption, which spurred the recent meltdown in software stocks. Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 11% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout.\n\nBig Tech stocks followed suit. Nvidia and Microsoft both fell over 1%, while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steeper losses.\n\nMeanwhile, attention is starting to turn to Friday’s Consumer Price Index report. A softer reading will build hopes that price pressures are easing while economic growth remains intact.\n\nBefore then, the weekly reading on jobless claims — which showed a smaller decline than expected — came in focus after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January. The strength in hiring complicates expectations for Fed policy. A resilient labor market, paired with sticky inflation, is seen as reducing the likelihood of near-term interest-rate cuts — a key driver of recent equity gains.\n\nElsewhere on the earnings front, McDonald’s (MCD) shares nudged higher after the burger giant's earnings beat. Looking ahead, Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are highlights on Thursday's docket, all due after the market close.\n\nApple (AAPL) stock was the worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock on Thursday afternoon, dropping around 5% as part of a broad sell-off across tech.\n\nReports on Wednesday that Apple's highly anticipated upgrade to its Siri voice assistant could be delayed also weighed on shares, which are off by 4% year to date. The new Siri was intended to be launched as part of an operating system update in March, but certain features could be postponed due to issues in testing, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nThe rollout of the revamped Siri, first announced in June 2024, has been riddled with delays, putting investors on edge about Apple's artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nSeparately, US Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson said Wednesday he sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, raising concerns about allegations that Apple News has been censoring content from conservative publications.\n\nMeta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) were also down more than 2% as tech got hit. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) was the lone Magnificent Seven name in the green, up 0.4%.\n\nInflation in electricity prices has more than doubled headline PCE inflation as the AI infrastructure and data center build-out have sent power demand soaring through the US, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client note on Wednesday.\n\nElectricity prices rose by 6.9% year over year through December 2025, the bank wrote, while PCE inflation rose 2.9% over the same period. On an annualized average basis, electricity prices rose by 6.8% since January 2022, while headline PCE inflation rose by 3.4%.\n\nThe rapid inflation in electricity prices is primarily driven by two key factors: the rapid construction of data centers, which demand enormous amounts of energy to operate, and the boom in capital investment by utility companies as they attempt to increase energy supply to meet demand, \"which will raise utility costs and therefore electricity prices.\"\n\nThe analysts also noted several bottlenecks that will prevent energy supply from catching up with demand, including strict regulations and shortages of critical hardware such as transformers and natural gas turbines.\n\n\"The combination of strong demand and sluggish supply will likely increase power prices in regional wholesale markets — where most utilities and other market participants procure electricity before delivering it to final customers,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThough they note that the pressure will likely be \"much more acute in a few markets than the US as a whole because data centers are highly geographically concentrated,\" with \"about 1% of all US counties account[ing] for about 70% of data center capacity.\"\n\nThe largest jumps in electricity inflation are likely to be seen in \"tighter power markets\" in the Midwest, California, and Texas, the analysts wrote.\n\nThe US stock market turned into the red through late morning trading on Thursday, marking a sharp reversal from earlier gains on the major indexes.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down, shedding roughly 1.5%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which snapped a three-day streak of gains on Wednesday, both lost roughly 1%.\n\nThe downturn comes as investors look for any signs of weakness in the earnings reports of companies vulnerable to AI disruption, which has triggered the meltdown in software stocks over the past week-and-a-half. Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 11% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout.\n\nThe tech sector's largest names also dragged the sector down, as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) both fell over 1% while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steeper losses.\n\nWhile investors got a bullish read on the labor market in Wednesday's nonfarm payrolls report, showing that January added twice as many jobs as expected, data published Thursday on initial jobless claims dimmed some of that optimism, showing a smaller decline than expected.\n\nOil prices fell on Thursday as investors weighed a new demand forecast from the International Energy Agency, which predicted a slowdown, and unclear progress in talks between the US and Iran.\n\nFutures on international pricing benchmark Brent crude (BZ=F) and US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) shed roughly 1.8% to trade below $68.20 and $63.50 a barrel, respectively.\n\nIn a new publication on Thursday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said world oil demand would rise by 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, 80,000 bpd lower than the agency's January forecast. The figure is also much lower than that published by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Wednesday, which said demand would rise by 1.38 million bpd this year.\n\nThe IEA also maintained its call that the market will spend 2026 in a deep oversupply glut, which the agency pegged at 3.73 million bpd of excess oil.\n\nWhile market watchers had broadly coalesced around the likelihood of a supply glut through 2026, with prices expected to drop, oil prices have instead gained roughly 10% since the start of the year, following a series of geopolitical events, including the US takeover of Venezuela's oil industry, widespread protests in Iran, and damage to key export terminals on the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn public comments on Thursday, the CEO of commodities trading house Vitol, Russell Hardy, said the global oil market is tightening instead of loosening, especially as the US ratchets up pressure on Russia and Iran, pushing buyers to find barrels in other markets.\n\nVitol is the world's largest independent trader of oil.\n\nThe key swing factor for oil prices right now remains ongoing negotiations between the US and Iran over the Iranian regime's uranium enrichment technology. President Trump on Wednesday deployed more military craft to the region, and analysts say any military action could result in retaliation from Iran, which controls the Strait of Hormuz, a critically important global chokepoint for oil flows.\n\nAs worries around the electricity and water demand of AI data centers have taken root, federal and state lawmakers have begun pushing back, introducing bills to regulate or halt development entirely.\n\nThis week, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced the first bipartisan bill in Congress designed to prevent data center power usage from affecting consumers' electric bills.\n\nA week earlier, on Feb. 6, New York became at least the sixth state to have its legislators propose a bill to pause data center construction within state lines. This legislation would effectively shut out New York as a potential site for new data centers if it passes.\n\nIn doing so, New York's legislators join federal and state congressional leaders across the country in attempting to legislate an industry that has boomed and threatens an already overtaxed power grid.\n\n\"The regulatory framework was not designed for single-sector load shocks, so policymakers are attempting to adjust in real time to the scale and speed at which the load forecasts are changing,\" Didi Caldwell, founder and CEO of site selection advisory firm Global Location Strategies, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"The system is ill-equipped to address the dramatic increase in demand created by AI data centers,\" she said.\n\nAnd lawmakers are trying to catch up.\n\nWednesday's unexpectedly bullish jobs report has all but shuttered the odds of rate cuts under current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and narrowed the path to cuts under a Kevin Warsh-led Fed, Bank of America economists wrote in a client note on Thursday, calling the report \"a feast for the hawks.\"\n\nData released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday showed that the US added 130,000 jobs in January, doubling economists' expectations of 65,000. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.3% from 4.4%, beating expectations that the rate would remain flat.\n\nThe data gave lift to the argument that even as inflation has stayed elevated, the labor market is remaining resilient. These conditions are seen as reducing the odds of rate cuts in the near future.\n\n\"Payrolls surged above all expectations, the downward revisions were minimal, and wages and hours were up as well,\" the analysts wrote. \"The broad-based strength in the Jan jobs report vindicates our view that the Fed won't cut under Powell.\"\n\nFor now, the economists wrote, BofA is maintaining its prediction of two rate cuts under a Warsh-led Fed. But the swing metric for potential rate cuts under Warsh, they wrote, will be the unemployment rate.\n\n\"The key risk to his call for significant cuts is a decline in the u-rate. Therefore, the path to cuts under Warsh (which we don't think the economy needs) now looks narrower,\" the BofA economists wrote.\n\n\"If the u-rate is stable or down even further by June, Warsh might be stuck on hold for the rest of the year.\"\n\nUS stocks rose in the first minutes of trading on Thursday as investors digested the latest string of earnings reports and looked ahead to Friday's inflation reading as the next major signpost for rate-cut bets.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) picked up roughly 0.5% as trading began, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both rose around 0.3%.\n\nThursday's weekly reading on jobless claims — which showed a smaller decline than expected — offered another picture of the labor market after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January.\n\nOn the corporate calendar, earnings from Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are due after Thursday's closing bell.\n\nThe US saw 227,000 initial jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 7, exceeding expectations and marking a decrease from the previous week's 232,000 initial claims, according to data released Thursday by the Department of Labor.\n\nEconomists had expected 223,000 claims for unemployment benefits, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nContinuing claims for the week came in at 1.86 million, also exceeding economists' estimates of 1.85 million and marking an increase over the previous week's 1.84 million continuing claims.\n\nThe Labor Department data comes after investors received a stronger-than-expected read on payroll additions in January.\n\nData released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed 130,000 jobs added in January, compared to estimates of 65,000 jobs. However, 2025 revisions knocked 400,000 job additions off the year's total, bringing the monthly average of payroll additions to roughly 15,000 per month.\n\nEuropean stocks broadly gained on Thursday as earnings results from Siemens, EssilorLuxxotica, and others lifted sentiment.\n\nGermany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 1.3%. The index was lifted by a 6% increase in Siemens stock (SIE.DE) after the industrial company raised its 2026 earnings guidance due to strong artificial intelligence demand.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) advanced another 0.3% after hitting a record high on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 1%. Shares of component EssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA), the maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses, jumped more than 6% after the company sounded bullish on revenue growth from smart glasses in its earnings report. EssilorLuxxotica expanded its partnership with Meta (META) to produce the AI glasses.\n\nUS healthcare company Baxter's (BAX) stock sank 14% before the bell on Thursday following the release of its fourth quarter earnings, forecasting annual profit below Wall Street estimates. The company cited persistent problems from hurricane-related issues at one of its manufacturing plants.\n\nMagnum Ice Cream's (MICC) stock fell 12% during premarket hours on Thursday. The group, which was recently spun off from Unilever (UL) and makes popular ice creams such as Ben & Jerry's and Cornetto, reported a 3% decline in sales for its fourth quarter earnings.\n\nSanofi (SNY) stock fell 6% before the bell on Thursday after the French pharmaceutical company ousted its CEO, Paul Hudson, thanking him Thursday for \"valuable contributions\" but without giving any reason for his surprise exit.\n\nMicron (MU) stock rose 3% during premarket hours on Thursday after its CEO, brushed off concerns on Wednesday about competition growing in the memory chip space. Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) also claimed an early lead in the race to supply AI chips to Nvidia (NVDA). Samsung Electronics is a key competitor of Micron.\n\nAppLovin (APP) shares fell 5% before the bell today following the group's fourth-quarter earnings release on Wednesday, which beat Wall Street estimates. The advertising company's shares have fallen almost 30% over the past month.\n\nSome smaller pharmaceutical companies not targeted by President Trump for deals to lower their US drug pricing are looking to craft their own agreements with his administration, industry sources told Reuters. The moves are a bid to avoid potentially onerous tariffs and new price-setting schemes.\n\nCisco (CSCO) stock fell 7% during premarket hours on Thursday after the networking company issued guidance below Wall Street forecasts.\n\nFor the full year, Cisco raised its guidance for earnings per share to $3.00 to $3.08 on revenue of $61.2 billion to $61.7 billion. However, the Street was looking for earnings guidance of $3.12 on revenue of $62.1 billion.\n\nIn Cisco's second quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $0.80, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates of $0.74 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue rose 10% year over year to $15.3 billion, compared to estimates of $15.1 billion.\n\n\"We see strong, broad-based demand for our technology solutions and remain focused on capturing the significant opportunities we see ahead,\" Cisco CFO Mark Patterson said.",

    "fullText": "It's shaping up to be another tough week for the tech sector.\n\nUS stocks slid lower on Thursday, with the S&P 500 on track to notch its third straight day of losses as investors continued to dump tech and software holdings and rotate into other areas of the market.\n\nMajor indexes were up earlier in the day, but tumbled more than 1% around noon. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which recently entered a bear market and endured brutal selling last week, dropped another 3%.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around 12:30 pm ET on Thursday:\n\nThe market's steepest losses were concentrated in the tech sector, particularly among software and memory stocks. Here were some of the notable moves:\n\nThe continued selling pressure is a sign that investors' concerns about AI haven't ebbed despite a relief rally in tech at the start of this week. Software stocks took a beating last week as traders assessed the threat posed by AI and remained cognizant of high valuations in the broader tech landscape.\n\nA trio of AI-exposed sectors tumbled this week, with shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms dropping on fresh worries about AI disruption.\n\nInvestors are also likely reacting to recent softness in the economic data, according to Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers. He pointed to how most sectors in the economy were losing jobs, despite the US overall adding more payrolls than expected in January.\n\nInvestors are also keyed into the earnings potential of AI and are beginning to be more selective about the companies they invest in, he added.\n\n\"You have dwindling AI hopes coinciding with lackluster economic reports,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Software/services are being repriced as agentic AI pressures pricing power,\" Rosenberg Research wrote in a client note on Thursday, pointing to uncertainty around future cash flows among large tech firms. \"The sustainability of the accelerating investment cycle and the ultimate beneficiaries of the growth story remain highly uncertain,\" the firm added.",

    "description": "A software veteran predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers.",
    "fullText": "Software engineers are getting crushed by AI, and they think you're next.\n\nAI's ability to automate code is simultaneously making developers productive and overworked. One technologist said his job is harder than ever, lamenting that \"AI fatigue\" is real.\n\nThe good news is it won't last forever. The bad news is that's because most of them will be out of a job.\n\nSoftware veteran Steve Yegge predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers. (He wasn't a total drag. Yegge offered advice to software engineers for avoiding the 'vampiric effect' of AI.)\n\n\"Ok, but I don't work in tech. Why do I care?\" you callously ask. (So cold!)\n\nWell, according to the people in the thick of it, AI isn't stopping with them.\n\nMatt Shumer, the CEO of an AI startup, warned AI's disruption will be \"much bigger\" than COVID. The post has racked up more than 69 million views on X, gaining traction outside traditional tech circles. Shumer spoke to BI's Brent D. Griffiths about the post and the fact that he (surprise!) used AI to help him write it.\n\nIt's worth noting Shumer's company specializes in AI personal assistants. He certainly benefits from getting people on board with AI. But that doesn't invalidate a lot of his points about workers needing to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.\n\nThere's a counterargument to the doomsday prophecy.\n\nMaybe engineering jobs are especially ripe for AI disruption?\n\nThe job, after all, is highly digital and requires hard skills, two factors that make it a strong candidate for AI automation.\n\nSoftware engineers have also been somewhat insulated from the tech-based disruptions the rest of us have endured and adapted to during the pre-AI times. A new tool here. A new app there. At some point, many of us have gotten numb to tech disrupting what we do. You just figure out how to adapt.\n\nMeanwhile, software engineers were living on easy street. You don't have to worry about the tools when you're the ones building them. For years, software developers enjoyed healthy salaries, good work-life balance, and fantastic job security.\n\nNow the tables are turned, and suddenly it's everyone's problem?\n\nI'm not suggesting AI won't impact the rest of us. For starters, entry-level jobs across the board appear to be on the chopping block thanks to AI. Consultants also seem ripe for some shakeups. And the legal industry is certainly feeling the heat.\n\n(I could mention journalism, but we were on the extinction list long before AI. When I started college in 2007, my professors all told me the industry was dying. Almost two decades later, we're still here. If anything, it looks like AI has created some high-paying jobs for writers.)\n\nAI might end up being massively disruptive for all of us, but at this point, we're all used to it.\n\nWhere do you stand on the AI doomsday prophecy?

    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

    "title": "AI CEO warns AI's disruption will be 'much bigger' than COVID: 'The people I care about deserve to hear what is coming'",
    "description": "Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that people in tech \"aren't making predictions. We're telling you what already occurred in our jobs.\"",
    "fullText": "It's never a good sign when a CEO warns something more disruptive than COVID is heading our way.\n\nIn an essay titled \"Something Big Is Happening,\" Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer said AI can now do all of his technical work — and he thinks your job could be next.\n\n\"I'm writing this for the people in my life who don't... my family, my friends, the people I care about who keep asking me 'so what's the deal with AI?' and getting an answer that doesn't do justice to what's actually happening,\" Shumer wrote in his nearly 5,000-word post published Tuesday on X.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, his post had 40 million views and 18,000 retweets. Shumer is a cofounder of OthersideAI, which features Hyperwrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\nShumer said that the reason people in tech \"are sounding the alarm\" is that they have already experienced what's coming for everyone else.\n\n\"We're not making predictions,\" he wrote. \"We're telling you what already occurred in our own jobs, and warning you that you're next.\"\n\nShumer said that many people outside tech wrote off AI years ago after a clunky experience with an early edition of ChatGPT.\n\n\"The models available today are unrecognizable from what existed even six months ago,\" he wrote. \"The debate about whether AI is 'really getting better' or 'hitting a wall' — which has been going on for over a year — is over.\"\n\nIt's not the time to panic, Shumer said. Instead, the best thing to do is to become deeply familiar with AI. \"This might be the most important year of your career,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I don't say that to stress you out. I say it because right now, there is a brief window where most people at most companies are still ignoring this,\" he wrote. \"The person who walks into a meeting and says 'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days' is going to be the most valuable person in the room.\"\n\nHe's far from alone in sounding the alarm. Despite disagreement from other tech leaders, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei remains adamant that AI could wipe out up to half of white collar, entry-level jobs in the next one to five years.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk and others have warned that if your job doesn't involve physical labor, it's likely to be replaced by AI much more quickly, a view that dovetails with a growing base of economic research.\n\nShumer's essay struck a chord, especially with those in tech. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian replied, \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\n\"Great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now,\" A16z general partner David Haber wrote.\n\nGreat advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\n\n“I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days\" is going to be the most valuable person in the room. Not eventually. Right now. Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's… https://t.co/cBq5s1AH4Y\n\nWhile the response to the post has been overwhelmingly positive, some X users pointed out the limitations still present in many current AI products, like hallucinations and general inaccuracies.\n\nShumer said that this moment feels like February 2020, when in a short span of time, news of a spreading pandemic gave way to a worldwide upheaval unseen in modern times that continues to reverberate to this day.\n\nThe potential of what AI will change, he wrote, is \"much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nFor Shumer, this moment of realization came with the recent dueling releases of Anthropic's Opus 4.6 and OpenAI's GPT-5.3 Codex. Both models are primarily aimed at software engineering. OpenAI said in its release notes that GPT-5.3 Codex \"is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\n\n\"It wasn't just executing my instructions,\" Shumer wrote of his experience with OpenAI's latest Codex model. \"It was making intelligent decisions. It had something that felt, for the first time, like judgment. Like taste. The inexplicable sense of knowing what the right call is that people always said AI would never have.\"\n\nAI is now so intelligent, Shumer said, that he can tell the agent what he wants and \"walk away from my computer for four hours, and come back to find the work done. Done well.\"\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn Wednesday morning, Shumer addressed his viral X post.\n\n\"Every time someone asks me what's going on with AI, I give them the safe answer,\" he wrote on Wednesday. \"Because the real one sounds insane. I'm done doing that.\"",

    "title": "Death isn't the end: Meta patented an AI that lets you keep posting from beyond the grave",
    "description": "Meta was recently granted a patent for tech to keep your social media accounts running using AI if you take a break or die.",
    "fullText": "Does Meta want to make our social media accounts immortal?\n\nThe company was granted a patent in late December that outlines how a large language model can \"simulate\" a person's social media activity, such as responding to content posted by real people.\n\n\"The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased,\" the patent says.\n\nAndrew Bosworth, Meta's CTO, is listed as the primary author of the patent, which was first filed in 2023.\n\n\"We have no plans to move forward with this example,\" a spokesperson for Meta told Business Insider.\n\nIn the patent, Meta lays out why it thinks people might need this.\n\nIf you're no longer posting online — whether that's because you need a break from social media or … you … die — your followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.\n\n\"The impact on the users is much more severe and permanent if that user is deceased and can never return to the social networking platform,\" the document says.\n\nTo fill that void, Meta would essentially create a digital clone of your social media presence, training a model on \"user-specific\" data — including historical platform activity, such as comments, likes, or content — to understand how you would (or rather, did) behave.\n\nThat clone can then respond to other people's content by liking and commenting, or responding to DMs. For influencers or creators who make their livelihoods on Meta's platforms and need to take a break from social media, such a tool could be useful.\n\nMeta's patent also references tech that would allow the LLM to simulate video or audio calls with users.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said that while it files patents to disclose concepts, a granted patent does not always mean the company will pursue, develop, or implement that tech.\n\nStill, it opens up many questions about the nature of tech — and grief. An AI bot that acts as your understudy while you're on a digital detox is one thing, but imitating people who've died?\n\nEdina Harbinja, a UK-based professor at the University of Birmingham's Law School, has concerns.\n\n\"It does affect not just legal issues, but a lot of very important social, ethical, and deeply philosophical issues as well,\" Harbinja, who specializes in digital rights and post-mortem privacy, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta has thought about managing digital legacies for years.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Facebook launched tools that let people designate a \"legacy contact\" to manage their accounts if they died. And back in the company's metaverse days, in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Mark Zuckerberg discussed virtual avatars for deceased people.\n\n\"If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful,\" Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\nThere are a lot of names for this broader category of tech — death bots, ghost bots, grief tech — that are aiming to help people face the loss of loved ones with eternally memorialized digital versions of them.\n\nSeveral startups have launched around this premise, and many have emerged from founders' own experiences with grief. Replika, an AI chatbot startup, was founded in 2015 by Eugenia Kuyda after the loss of her friend. Then there's You, Only Virtual (YOV), which was founded in 2020 by Justin Harrison when his mother was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"Everybody in the tech world has been thinking about this for a while, as soon as we started having breaks in generative AI,\" Harrison said.\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft patented an AI chatbot that could simulate a deceased person (as well as fictional characters or celebrities).\n\nMeta's patent signals that the technology category is moving more into the mainstream, Harbinja said.\n\nHarrison isn't surprised to see bigger tech companies dipping their toes in the space, and sees it as a sign that people are beginning to \"feel more comfortable with doing this.\"\n\n\"We can only improve on what we offer people,\" Harrison said, adding that the resources for grieving are \"horrible\" to begin with.\n\n\"I think we have a moral obligation, if we have the potential, to do more for those folks than we should be,\" he said.\n\nAI, death, and grief are not easy topics to digest, however. The intersection of all three is a potent brew of taboos ripe for a philosophical debate on ethics, digital rights, and privacy for any dinner table.\n\nMeta has more than helping people process grief as an incentive to pursue the tech it lays out in its patent, especially for accounts taking a break.\n\n\"It's more engagement, more content, more data — more data for the current and the future AI,\" Harbinja said. \"I can see the business incentive for that. I'm just curious to see how they would, when, and if they will implement this innovation.\"\n\nDepending on how a product like this is rolled out, different questions could come up.\n\nFor instance, would this apply across all of Meta's apps? Would it understand the nuance of your WhatsApp presence vs. the candor you have in the Instagram comment section?\n\nJoseph Davis, a sociology professor at the University of Virginia, said he was concerned with the impact that tools like a Meta bot could have on how humans experience grief.\n\n\"One of the tasks of grief is to face the actual loss,\" Davis said.\n\n\"Let the dead be dead,\" Davis added. \"The idea of bringing them back, but you're not really doing that, but in fact, it looks like that. That's the confusion.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at sbradley@businessinsider.com or Signal at sydneykbradley.123.

    "description": "Valuations in the tech sector could rise too high and trigger a double-digit correction in the S&P 500, Capital Economics said.",
    "fullText": "Stocks are headed for one last hurrah in the coming year before the AI-fueled rally unravels, according to one research firm.\n\nIn recent client notes, Capital Economics said it believed the S&P 500 would likely rally over the next year before running into a steep correction. It sees the benchmark index rising as high as 8,000 in 2026, before falling to 7,000 next year in a drop of about 13% to a \"more normal level,\" the firm wrote on Monday.\n\n\"A more plausible scenario is that the stock market 'collapses under its own weight' as investors reassess stretched valuations for major tech firms while still believing in AI's long-term benefits for the real economy,\" Jennifer McKeown and William Jackson, two economists at the firm, wrote, adding that as much of a 30% correction was possible in the worst-case scenario.\n\nThere are a few reasons the firm sees a double-digit drop brewing:\n\nValuations are high but not excessive, given how strong corporate earnings are. Yet, tech stocks are pricey and could keep rising, Thomas Mathews, the head of markets at the firm, wrote on Monday.\n\nMathews pointed to the price-to-forward 12-month earnings ratio of the US tech sector, one measure of how highly stocks are valued. That ratio briefly rose to its highest level since the dot-com bubble last year, before easing, per Capital Economics' analysis.\n\n\"We suspect that as the rally progresses, a rise in valuations is more likely than not. Indeed, even though they are, in our view, not yet excessive, it wouldn't be surprising if investors' enthusiasm for AI tech were to push valuations to a level perhaps above what might be sustainable in the long run,\" Mathews said.\n\nWhile the backdrop for earnings is still positive, earnings growth in the S&P 500 has largely been concentrated in the tech sector, a key vulnerability to valuations.\n\n\"Admittedly, it is, perhaps, possible that a 'bubble' could emerge in expectations for earnings, rather than valuations,\" Mathews speculated.\n\n\"It's possible that rapid earnings growth at tech companies will, also, eventually come back to earth, even if that doesn't seem set to happen this year,\" he added.\n\nThe AI rally could also be jeopardized if the US economy starts to meaningfully slow, Mathews said, though he noted that economic growth looked healthy at the moment and the risk of a recession looked \"remote.\"\n\nThere's also the risk that AI doesn't deliver as much as investors originally anticipated, or that China could start to edge ahead of the US on the technology frontier.\n\nMathews pointed to lingering concern about AI capex, a key issue that has hung over the market and triggered multiple sell-offs in the past year.\n\nConcerns about China's AI innovations, like DeepSeek, also sparked a steep sell-off in early 2025.\n\n\"That, at face value, poses a big threat to the big US tech companies,\" Mathews said of the threat from China, though he pointed to factors like US companies having a \"hardware edge\" that could protect the tech sector.\n\nMarkets have already gotten a taste this year of how geopolitical tensions can dent the market's enthusiasm for AI. The firm pointed to recent market volatility stemming from President Donald Trump's threats on Greenland.\n\nGeopolitical conflict could have a more significant impact on AI trade down the line, considering that Europe is a major market for the US tech sector, it added. The US's allies and partners in Europe make up around 40% of revenue among tech firms, per Capital Economics' analysis.\n\n\"But our sense is that for those to have a lasting effect on the AI rally, they'd have to either have a sizeable effect on the US economy or on tech companies' earnings through some other channel,\" Mathew added of the risk.",

    "description": "The tech giant's internal policy promotes an in-house tool called Kiro over Anthropic's Claude Code. Some Amazon engineers are unhappy about this.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing the startup's AI models and products to customers.\n\nInside Amazon, however, employees aren't allowed to use Anthropic's Claude Code for production work or for live products without formal approval.\n\nThat disconnect became more visible late last year, when Amazon rolled out internal guidance steering teams toward Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant, according to internal messages seen by Business Insider. The guidance encourages using Kiro over non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, for production code.\n\nThe policy prompted criticism across internal Amazon forums. In one discussion thread, roughly 1,500 Amazon employees endorsed the formal adoption of Claude Code, according to the messages.\n\nThe restrictions have been particularly awkward for engineers who help sell AWS Bedrock, Amazon's platform that offers customers access to third-party AI services, including Claude Code. Some questioned how they could credibly promote a product they are not permitted to use themselves in official work.\n\n\"Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,\" one employee wrote.\n\nThe episode highlights the complexity of Amazon's relationship with Anthropic. While Amazon is racing to build and promote its own AI tools, it is also marketing a partner's competing technology. Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors, with a stake valued at more than $60 billion. Anthropic, in turn, is a major AWS customer, committing to use Amazon's cloud services and at least one million of Amazon's Trainium chips.\n\n\"We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.\"\n\nAmazon maintains \"a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,\" and while there's no explicit ban on Claude Code, the company applies \"stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.\n\nAn Anthropic spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one of the internal forums, an Amazon sales engineer flagged the irony of being asked to sell Claude Code even though it isn't formally supported inside the company. The employee wrote that they need to be able to \"use, demo, and build\" with Claude Code to support Amazon's directive to get more customers to use it through AWS Bedrock.\n\nOther Amazon engineers also debated whether the emphasis on Kiro was hindering productivity. Some argued that Claude Code outperformed Amazon's in-house tool and warned that forcing adoption of a weaker product could slow development.\n\n\"A tool that can't keep pace with rivals offers no real innovation,\" one of the Amazon employees wrote. \"And without competitive strength, Kiro's only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.\"\n\nClaude Code has become one of the most widely used AI coding services, and it underpins many other similar offerings from other providers. An Amazon spokesperson said about 70% of the company's software engineers used Kiro at least once in January.\n\nIn one forum thread, a manager overseeing Amazon's internal developer tools said he understood the \"frustration\" and \"significant\" interest in Claude Code, citing about 1,500 internal endorsements calling for its formal adoption.\n\nSome employees said frustration deepened after Amazon had previously indicated that Claude Code had cleared security and legal review for production use, according to an internal guideline and messages reviewed by Business Insider. That language was later edited and removed, employees said.\n\nOthers criticized the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally adopt Claude Code, asking what data informed the decision.\n\n\"The trend is clear,\" one employee wrote internally. \"More and more people would like to start using Claude Code and be officially supported by Amazon.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A new command-and-control system is expected to make planning and decision-making faster and easier.",
    "fullText": "New US Army warfighting software is speeding up and simplifying the command job, a commander said recently, sharing that it lets him scrap the \"hourlong staff meetings\" to make decisions.\n\nThe Army, like other services, believes that future wars will be determined by the speed of decision-making. That's where the new Next Generation Command and Control, or NGC2, program is expected to make a substantial impact and modernize how the service fights.\n\nAt Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army's 4th Infantry Division has been testing NGC2 in a series of exercises. The most recent one, Ivy Sting 4, added more components to the system, with different types of sensors and weapons on the battlefield feeding into one system that everyone can access.\n\n\"So it's all in one place, and it's there very, very quickly, so that the staff can see it across their functional systems,\" said Maj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, commander of the 4th ID, at a recent media roundtable, explaining that \"the fires person can see what the logistician sees, can see what the intel person sees.\"\n\n\"I don't have to have the hourlong staff meeting anymore,\" the general said.\n\n\"If we're actually using the technology as the tool that we're prepping on and that we're also fighting on,\" he said, \"I could sit there, I can look at it, I can make decisions, I can say, 'Hey, here are my priorities for this or that.' We all agree on it, we click save, and that's done.\"\n\nThe Army has facilitated the development of NGC2 with both the 4th ID and 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii and industry teams, including Anduril and Lockheed Martin, pursuing a Silicon Valley-style approach aimed at moving faster and rapidly integrating soldier feedback, delivering fixes immediately rather than months or years later.\n\nOn the heels of Ivy Sting 4, more than two weeks of field testing that involved live-fire exercises and an electronic warfare jamming scenario, Ellis and others said that NGC2 was making planning and executing battlefield missions more effective.\n\n\"We are no longer fighting with the network; we are now fighting using the network,\" Ellis said.\n\nDuring the Ivy Sting 4 testing event, 20 different types of sensors, such as drones, electronic warfare systems, artillery, and Stryker vehicles, were linked together.\n\nData and artificial intelligence capabilities provide real-time information on the sensors. Soldiers can see how much ammunition they've got left or whether a Stryker will need maintenance or fuel soon. Simulations can predict what resources will be needed for certain tactics or actions, including different ways an enemy might attack.\n\nAs different platforms are brought onto NGC2, broadening what the platform can do, Army command and soldiers can see and communicate using the same data. The system is breaking down the silos that have previously hindered information flow.\n\n\"I'm feeling empowered as a commander to make more, better, and faster decisions because I've got access to all that data,\" Ellis explained.\n\nMany NGC2 components are being built with off-the-shelf technology and standard commercial software practices, and the vendor teams involved are working on the ground with soldiers. The closer working relationship means soldier feedback is being incorporated more quickly.\n\n\"We work through these obstacles, and we learn how to do something, and once we run into a roadblock, we figure out a way to solve that problem, and then that problem is now solved for the Army,\" he said. \"We're not relearning these lessons over and over again.\"",

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration has refused to accept an application from Moderna to review its first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine, the company said Tuesday, in another setback for the technology that’s been a target of some Trump administration health officials.\n\nThe agency told Moderna that its application didn’t contain an “adequate and well-controlled” trial because the control arm didn’t reflect the “best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study,” according to a letter dated February 3 that Moderna posted online. It didn’t identify any safety or efficacy concerns, the company said.\n\nModerna said that the refusal was inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency and that it had requested a meeting with FDA officials to understand how to proceed.\n\n“The complete stunner here is at no point in any of this did anybody say that it was not adequate” to run its clinical trial the way it had discussed with the agency, Moderna’s president, Dr. Stephen Hoge, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said “the FDA generally does not comment on regulatory communications to individual sponsors.” It’s rare for the FDA to issue a “refuse-to-file” letter; a 2021 study of almost 2,500 applications submitted to the agency found that only 4% received such letters.\n\nModerna used a standard-dose seasonal flu vaccine called Fluarix as a comparator in a 40,700-person clinical trial to demonstrate the experimental mRNA vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The company said the FDA had agreed with that plan in April 2024 but suggested it also include data comparing its vaccine with an approved high-dose flu vaccine for people over 65, which the company said it did.\n\nModerna added that as recently as August, in a meeting before it submitted its application for approval of the vaccine, the FDA suggested that it would review the filing and assess issues with the comparator during that process. The agency did note that there could be a “significant issue” with the data “during review” of the application, according to written feedback that Moderna shared.\n\nBut last week, the agency refused to do the review at all, according to the letter. It was signed by Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine regulation.\n\nPrasad was an outspoken critic of the government’s response to Covid-19 before he was appointed to the FDA under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He claimed late last year without providing details that Covid-19 vaccines resulted in deaths of 10 children and has said the agency will change its vaccine approval process.\n\nModerna is one of three manufacturers in the US of approved Covid-19 vaccines, along with Pfizer and Novavax. Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines use mRNA technology. Pfizer also has mRNA-based flu vaccines in development.\n\nAlthough the record-speed development of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic was a chief accomplishment of Trump’s first term, his second administration has withdrawn support for mRNA technology in infectious diseases. HHS canceled 22 projects worth about $500 million focused on mRNA vaccine development in August, claiming against evidence that “these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved millions of lives. The hope behind applying mRNA technology to seasonal flu vaccines is that it could improve how well they work, enable tailoring for geographic regions where different strains are circulating and lead to combinations with Covid-19 vaccines so people would need only one shot for protection against both viruses.\n\nWith currently approved technology, experts select flu strains for each fall’s seasonal vaccines during the preceding February. Hoge pointed out that mRNA vaccines can be manufactured much faster; for Covid-19 vaccines, he said, the design is decided in May or June, for shipping by August.\n\nChoosing the strains closer to the start of flu season could potentially lead to a better match with circulating viruses, “and better matching equals, usually, better protection,” Hoge said.\n\nModerna’s phase 3 study showed in results reported in June that the mRNA-based flu shot produced efficacy that was about 27% higher than Fluarix in adults 50 and older. A separate trial that assessed safety and immune response included the comparison with a high-dose flu vaccine for people 65 and older and showed superiority, Moderna said.\n\nImmune response is assessed in the laboratory by analyzing blood samples of people who’ve been vaccinated, while efficacy assessments typically involve seeing how well a vaccine protects against cases of the disease.\n\nModerna had been awaiting the start of the review of its flu shot before it moved its experimental combination flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine into the FDA review process, Hoge said. That’s now on hold as the company awaits a meeting and further guidance from the agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the combination vaccine is moving forward in other countries.\n\n“We do expect that our first approval will be … probably in Europe, and this year,” Hoge said. “So that’ll be a milestone event.”",

    "description": "Dan Ives says Wall Street is underestimating software's role in the AI boom, calling the skepticism \"disconnected.\"",
    "fullText": "Wall Street may be getting the AI trade wrong, says Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and longtime tech bull.\n\nIves said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" published Tuesday that the recent investor pessimism toward software companies is 'the most disconnected call that I've ever seen.\"\n\nWhile much of the AI excitement has centered on data centers, chips, and GPUs, Ives said software will be the \"heart and lungs of the AI revolution.\"\n\nThe infrastructure buildout is still in its early innings and could stretch over the next decade. But software is where the real use cases and monetization will emerge, he added.\n\nIves said it is wrong to assume that big software companies like Salesforce and ServiceNow are \"structurally broken\" or set to be replaced by AI-native tools.\n\nThese companies are deeply embedded in enterprise stacks, with hundreds of thousands of customers, Ives said, adding that their AI use cases could unlock incremental revenue over the next six to 18 months that investors are not yet pricing in.\n\nLarge, entrenched platforms should not be compared to smaller players that serve small and medium-sized businesses. \"You cannot paint all of them with the same brush,\" Ives said.\n\nIves also defended Microsoft's role in the AI revolution. While acknowledging near-term concerns around capital spending and Azure growth, Ives said the broader AI rollout cannot succeed without Microsoft's software and cloud ecosystem.\n\nIves' comments came after software stocks tumbled last week amid investor fears that AI could disrupt large swaths of the industry.\n\nNot all tech and finance leaders think AI will replace traditional software companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed that idea at a Cisco AI event last week.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" Huang said. \"You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself,\" he added.\n\nHuang said AI depends on the tools software offers and pointed to ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis as examples of software firms well-positioned in the AI era.\n\nIves also wrote in an industry note published last week that the \"software armageddon\" can be regarded as a tech stock \"garage sale.\"\n\n\"We believe the market is baking in a doomsday scenario for software companies in the near-term, which we believe is extremely overblown, as many customers won't be willing to put their data at risk to capitalize on AI implementation strategies until there is less risk with these migration projects,\" Ives and his analysts wrote.\n\nIves has long urged investors to buy tech dips, even as critics caution that AI enthusiasm may be running ahead of earnings and real-world adoption.",

    "fullText": "Critics brand deal with regulator as ‘lightweight’ with ‘no legal bite’ as tech giants avoid legally binding measures\n\nApple and Google have committed to avoid discriminating against apps that compete with their own products under an agreement with the UK’s competition watchdog, as they avoided legally binding measures for their mobile platforms.\n\nThe US tech companies have vowed to be more transparent about vetting third-party apps before letting them on their app stores and not discriminate against third-party apps in app search rankings.\n\nThey have also agreed not to use data from third-party apps unfairly, such as using information about app updates to tweak their own offerings.\n\nApple has also committed to giving app developers an easier means of requesting use of its features such as the digital wallet, and live translation for AirPod users.\n\nThe commitments have been secured as part of a new regulatory regime overseen by the Competition and Markets Authority, (CMA), which has the power to impose changes on how Apple and Google operate their mobile platforms after deciding last year that they had “substantial, entrenched” market power.\n\nHowever, the CMA has opted to allow voluntary commitments rather than impose formal changes.\n\nTom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and a former CMA director who represents app developers challenging Apple and Google’s dominance of the mobile platform market, said the changes were “lightweight” and had no legal bite.\n\nThe CMA did not name specific Google and Apple apps that compete with third-party rivals but both firms offer their own music services in the form of YouTube Music and Apple Music. Google and Apple’s app stores are vital shopfronts for app developers because the Android and iOS platforms are used by the overwhelming majority of UK mobile phone users.\n\nHowever, the commitments do not cover a significant bugbear for app developers – the fees of up to 30% that Apple and Google charge developers to sell products via their app stores. The CMA is still considering whether to tackle how Apple and Google charge developers.\n\nThe CMA said if the companies fail to implement the commitments effectively they will impose them formally under new enforcement powers against tech companies. The commitments take effect on 1 April.\n\nSarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “The ability to secure immediate commitments from Apple and Google reflects the unique flexibility of the UK digital markets competition regime and offers a practical route to swiftly address the concerns we’ve identified.”\n\nUnder the commitments, Apple and Google must provide data to the regulator showing the number of apps submitted for review and whether they were approved or rejected, plus the time taken to review those apps as well as the number of complaints received about the app stores and the outcomes of those processes.\n\nThe CMA will also monitor the outcome of applications to use the features and functionality within Apple’s mobile operating systems, such as the digital wallet.\n\nSmith said: “This first batch is so lightweight that it barely exists, and the promises made by Google and Apple are not legally binding in any case.\n\n“The main measures that could help with cost of living and economic growth issues may come later this year, such as forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores on its devices and to allow customers to avoid paying Apple’s commission.”\n\nThe News Media Association, whose members include the Guardian, questioned whether the commitments were “really worth the paper they are printed on”.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson said the company faced “fierce competition” in every market it operates in. “The commitments announced today allow Apple to continue advancing important privacy and security innovations for users and great opportunities for developers. We appreciate the positive and ongoing dialogue with UK officials.” they said.\n\nA Google spokesperson said its mobile ecosystem, including its Google Play app store, was a “driver of growth” in the UK economy. “While we believe Play’s existing developer practices are fair, objective, and transparent, we welcome the opportunity to resolve the CMA’s concerns collaboratively,” they said.",

    "title": "How Harvey picked its first chief product officer: 'Her slope of learning is very high'",
    "description": "Harvey is one of best-known players in legal tech. Now, the $8 billion startup has hired its first chief product officer to help defend its lead.",
    "fullText": "Harvey, the $8 billion legal software startup, is becoming a default vendor in Big Law. Now, with rival startups nipping at its heels and AI model providers moving closer to legal workflows, Harvey is bringing in a new executive to help defend its lead.\n\nThe company tells Business Insider it has hired Anique Drumright as its first chief product officer. In this role, she'll shape what Harvey builds next and how quickly it can ship. Drumright has held roles at Uber, TripActions, Loom, and, most recently, HR software startup Rippling, where she led the company's push into IT management software.\n\n\"Her slope of learning is very high,\" said Winston Weinberg, Harvey's chief executive. He described sending Drumright a lengthy Google Doc on the state of law firm technology and the day-to-day mechanics of legal work. She came back quickly with \"really good product ideas,\" he said.\n\nThe C-suite hire comes at a critical moment for Harvey — and for legal tech more broadly. Law firms are pouring money into new software meant to help lawyers work faster and save costs. Clients are driving much of that spend. After seeing chatbots and virtual assistants transform their own operations, they now expect the same efficiency from outside counsel.\n\nThose tools don't come cheap, and recent moves by the model providers themselves have complicated the picture. Anthropic's release last week of a contract-review tool sent ripples through the industry and led to a major sell-off of legal-research stocks. It raised a pointed question: If a foundation model can review contracts, on top of handling tasks across the rest of the organization, how much specialized legal software will firms still pay for?\n\nHarvey sits at the top of the heap for now. The startup has emerged as one of the best-known and best-funded players in legal tech, with licenses at over half of the 100 largest US law firms. The company said it ended last year with more than $190 million in annual recurring revenue. And job postings reviewed by Business Insider suggest it is pushing into mid-market and smaller firms, a long tail of potential growth beyond Big Law.\n\nEarlier this week, Forbes reported that Harvey is raising a new round of funding that would value the company at $11 billion, citing unnamed people familiar with the deal. A Harvey spokesperson declined to comment on the report.\n\nHarvey's dominance comes with pressure. The company still needs to show lawyers its product can boost revenue, not just save hours. At the same time, competition is intensifying, from legal software startups like Legora and from OpenAI and Anthropic, the same companies whose technology powers Harvey's platform.\n\nWeinberg said Anthropic's latest release doesn't change Harvey's product direction, but it does emphasize the need to move faster on shipping what makes the company distinctive. \"Part of hiring Anique is to accelerate that,\" he said.\n\nIf the next fight is adoption, Drumright has put in the reps. She's spent years building products that ask people to change their habits.\n\nAt Uber, she worked in product and marketing as the ride-hailing giant scaled to billions of trips a year. Later, at Loom, she helped grow a product that nudged office workers away from meetings and long email chains, replacing them with screen-recorded video messages.\n\nDrumright faces a similar challenge at Harvey, where the company has to convince reluctant lawyers, a famously luddite profession, to trade the familiar way of doing things for new tools. Those take time to use effectively.\n\n\"When something is new, even if it's powerful, it's still harder to do than the way you've always done it,\" she said. Her job, she said, is to make those new capabilities feel intuitive.\n\nDrumright is the daughter of two lawyers, and she has seen firsthand how low-tech legal work can be. She remembers her mother siting on the couch, preparing for a deposition by speaking into a tape recorder.\n\nDrumright starts on Tuesday. Her first weeks at Harvey will be spent on a listening tour, meeting lawyers using the product and legal teams deciding whether to buy it. \"Legal is a very specific domain,\" she said, but the work starts with understanding how lawyers actually work today, and designing products that don't slow them down.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The jamming cut soldiers off from commanders and limited what they could see. They located the source and took it out with mortars.",
    "fullText": "Much like the war in Ukraine, future battlefields could be drowning in electronic interference, so the US Army stress-tested new command-and-control tech against that threat.\n\nThe need to maintain connections between command and deployed weapons and crews, or reestablish those links when they're lost, is shaping how soldiers train on the service's Next Generation Command and Control, a new software-driven system that's being developed for the Army.\n\nIn its most recent NGC2 exercise at Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army's 4th Infantry Division put it to the test against electronic warfare. Stressing the system proved difficult, the Army said, because it would \"heal itself.\" The service said it had to disable certain features to really test it.\n\nMaj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, the commander of the 4th ID, said during a media roundtable that after they activated the jamming, the system rerouted internally to keep functioning. \"We had to go back and figure out something else to turn off to actually stress the system to feel that for real,\" he said.\n\nThat further testing saw soldiers in the field lose their connection to satellite services, forcing them to resort to backups like radio for communications while they searched for the source of the jamming.\n\nOnce they found it, they eliminated it with a mortar strike and started the reconnection process.\n\n\"It was quite seamless,\" said Lt. Col. Shawn Scott, commander of the 4th Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, speaking during the roundtable. He added that troops still had to learn how to manage retransmission in complex terrain — an important step in restoring communications when troops are spread out across a wide area.\n\nThe recent exercise put soldiers in a \"denied, degraded, intermittent, and limited\" environment, Scott said, cutting them off from the division's cloud but still allowing the squadron to track the fight and carry out its mission on its own. Once the simulated jamming was removed, \"we were able to reestablish connection back with division and brigade,\" he said, watching data flow back up the chain and back down again \"seamlessly.\"\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine has shown the US military that consistent jamming of communications, weaponry, and intelligence and surveillance capabilities is something it'll need to be prepared for in a future conflict.\n\n\"We don't think the modern battlefield's going to be free of electromagnetic interference,\" Ellis said.\n\nIn this round of testing, the Army fired 155mm rounds from an M777 howitzer at a Marine-provided target. The data from those strikes was then sent back to Marine Corps systems. During the exercise, 20 different types of sensors fed information into NGC2, including drones, electronic warfare systems, and Stryker vehicles.\n\nNGC2 is a major modernization initiative for the Army, changing how soldiers communicate with each other and command, receive intelligence, track locations, and plan warfighting actions like firing artillery or scouting with drones.\n\nJoe Welch, who oversees the Army's command-and-control systems and efforts to counter enemy communications, said that most NGC2 parts are built using off-the-shelf technology and standard commercial software practices, rather than bespoke military-only systems.\n\nData and artificial intelligence capabilities are giving soldiers real-time information, like how much ammo they have left or whether there are casualties to care for, and predictive simulations for what they'll need should enemy forces attack them. The testing at Fort Carson, led by Anduril and an industry team, is continually bringing in more vendors, capabilities, and functions to broaden what NGC2 can do.\n\nWith the new system, the Army is also recognizing what different divisions across the service will need out of it. The process has been driven by implementing soldier feedback quickly, sometimes overnight or within a few days.\n\nIn Hawaii, the Army's 25th Infantry Division is working on a data and applications component of NGC2 led by Lockheed Martin and other companies that, once completed, will also be implemented into what the 4th ID is doing.\n\nFuture exercises are expected to expand what NGC2 can do. One event in May, for instance, will test it against a simulated enemy.\n\n\"We're going to really tests the systems,\" Ellis said, including against cyber, electronic, and kinetic areas to see what vulnerabilities exist. \"We're going to go after all that to learn where we need to make some adjustments.\"",

He said resilience is pivotal and that it's important for people to focus on doing the hard things and being OK when things don't go as expected.\n\nThe senior vice president of business technology said he recently spoke with his daughter about the importance of dealing with situations rather than merely labeling them as \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n\n\"Hard is hard,\" White told Business Insider. \"Hard isn't necessarily bad.\"\n\nExpectations, he said, are the \"destroyer of hope and joy,\" and that when things don't go as planned, it often turns out to be a good thing down the line, even if it doesn't seem that way in the moment.\n\n\"It's when we look back, and it's like, 'Oh man, I'm glad that didn't go the way I expected,'\" White said. \"But when you're in it, it's really hard.\"\n\nThe resilience lesson is one White also thinks is relevant for entry-level workers. While junior hires often arrive ready to use new tools and deliver a \"pretty high output,\" he said, persistence is an area where some still need to grow.\n\nHe described today's entry-level talent pool as \"incredibly capable, very bright, and very driven,\" with a stronger grasp of how to use AI tools to solve problems.\n\n\"They're much more fluent at being able to leverage AI tooling in the flow of their work,\" White said.\n\nHowever, he said the group sometimes struggles when it comes to working through challenges.\n\n\"There's more willingness to give up sooner,\" he said, adding that this trait doesn't apply across the board.\n\nWhite said he's seen AI tools, such as the company's recently upgraded Slackbot, help boost entry-level workers' confidence. He said they could help reduce feelings of imposter syndrome by helping early-career workers navigate challenging situations that arise at work.\n\nWith that said, White added that workers need to stay balanced and not let tools make them \"overly confident.\" He said workers need to bring skepticism to \"any kind of information\" they get, and be diligent about reviewing sources and citations when using AI.\n\n\"If you don't believe something, read the citation, and if it doesn't have a citation, you have to assume it's a hallucination,\" White said, adding that he tells his kids the same thing.",

The cuts wouldn’t affect retail customers, it said.\n\nIn May 2025, Telstra said “AI efficiencies” would allow it to shrink its workforce by 2030.\n\nTelstra’s chief executive, Vicki Brady, said AI would “be a significant unlock when it comes to enabling our workforce”.\n\nAgentic AI – which can work autonomously – would be working alongside Telstra staff, she said.\n\nOptus has previously said AI would have a big role to play in telecommunications but that humans would remain central.\n\nAnnouncing the JV, Telstra said it would drive productivity and growth, “build on Telstra’s work creating a world-class data and AI ecosystem, modernising its data and AI platforms, and embedding responsible AI by design”.\n\n“We are entering a new era of AI-driven reinvention,” the Accenture chair and chief executive officer, Julie Sweet, said at the time.",

    "description": "A super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and other tech leaders has targeted New York Assembly member Alex Bores' congressional campaign, marking its first attack against a lawmaker supporting AI regulation.",
    "fullText": "A pro-AI super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman has chosen New York Assembly member Alex Bores — and his congressional bid — as its first target.\n\nThe PAC, dubbed Leading the Future, formed in August with a more than $100 million commitment to support policymakers with a light-touch — or a no-touch — approach to AI regulation. And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\n\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\n\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature.\n\nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley.\n\nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\n\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\n\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works.\n\n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\n\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act.\n\nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.\n\n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”",

    "description": "The recent tech sell-off spooked Wall Street, sparking a rerating of AI stocks. One analyst shares his criteria for picking winners in the AI race.",
    "fullText": "The tech stock sell-off that rattled Wall Street last week served as a reminder to investors that AI hype works both ways, and endless enthusiasm is no longer lifting all boats.\n\nThe dramatic downturn hit software stocks hardest, but it also spilled into the broader tech sector. Major indexes have broadly recovered from last week's sell-off, but investors are still on edge about what could be the next shoe to drop.\n\nAccording to Futurum Group CEO and chief analyst Daniel Newman, the sell-off was a \"healthy, overdue rotation and a market demanding receipts.\"\n\n\"Ignore hype and look at growth and constraints,\" he told Business Insider. The analyst also shared some tips for picking AI stocks.\n\nHere is the framework Newman says he's using to spot winners and losers as the AI trade evolves.\n\nNot all companies spending on AI are seeing it pay off. While many on Wall Street chalk this up to the early innings of the emerging tech, companies that are seeing AI drive revenue are ones to look for.\n\n\"Companies need to show that the $470+ billion the hyperscalers are spending this year is generating returns. Those that do will be rewarded,\" Newman said.\n\nHe highlights Amazon and Microsoft as examples of AI spending fueling revenue real growth, through the tech giant'' respective cloud businesses, AWS and Azure.\n\nCompanies creating their own silicon chips are better positioned to compete. Capacity constraints control the AI race, with chip demand outpacing supply.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all working on their own custom AI chips.\n\nNewman highlighted that companies with in-house chips benefit from capacity advantages and vertical integration, which set them up for better margins.\n\nCompanies that have been successful in seeing a return on their AI spending have been largely focused on enterprise offerings. These include the cloud hyper scalers, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as Palantir, a favorite among retail traders.\n\nSome software companies are seeing enterprise monetization, despite the worries that sparked this week's sell-off. Newman highlights ServiceNow and IBM as \"companies driving agentic AI workflows and token consumption.\"\n\nElon Musk told Tesla investors on the company's most recent earnings call that its humanoid robot, Optimus, could generate up to $10 trillion in long-term revenue.\n\nNewman said that physical AI is the next multi-trillion-dollar market outside of data centers. He called out Amazon and Tesla as companies bringing AI to the physical world.\n\nThe market zeroed in on the software space for good reason, Newman said. \"I don't believe the AI will eat all software, but AI will eat some software,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe analyst explained that software companies with data running core business applications can survive in an AI era, but they will have to adapt to meet the needs of enterprise customers who want AI insights to fuel productivity gains.\n\nSome software companies partnering with AI factories include Salesforce and ServiceNow.\n\nAs AI-disruption concerns continue to fuel market skittishness, investors should be wary of companies without a clear narrative for how capex will deliver tangible results.\n\nAnother sign that an AI stock is risky may be that a company is using debt to finance AI infrastructure buildouts. Newman clarified that while debt isn't always a bad thing and can be a way to invest in critical growth, it can make a stock more of a risk-on play.\n\nIn a risk-off environment, Newman told Business Insider that there are a couple of things investors should be watching for.\n\n\"Look at the companies that can really afford to keep investing, for businesses that are going to basically create the cash flow that do it with the least risk.\"",

    "description": "Recruiting for SpaceX in South Texas is particularly difficult, he said: “It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”",
    "fullText": "California still has it over Texas in at least one key way, Elon Musk says: Hiring.\n\nAfter moving the headquarters of SpaceX and Tesla Inc. to Texas in recent years because of politics, he said it’s still easier to recruit employees to work in California. With one exception.\n\n“Austin, it helps,” Musk said — while noting that Tesla still has most of its engineering capacity in California. “Getting engineers to move … I call it the significant other problem.”\n\nThat’s what makes engineering recruiting toughest at Starbase, the remote South Texas outpost where SpaceX is developing its Starship mega-rocket.\n\n“For Starbase that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low,” Musk said. “It’s quite difficult. It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”\n\nSpouses, he said, are often unwilling to relocate to the isolated area.\n\nMusk companies also have operations in Robstown McGregor, Bastrop and elsewhere across the state.\n\nHe disclosed the issues on the Cheeky Pint podcast during a chat in which he also accused tech giant Apple Inc. of trying to poach Tesla’s talent when that company was working on its own self-driving electric car, a project it later scrapped.\n\n“They were carpet bombing Tesla with recruiting calls,” Musk said. He claimed their opening offer would be roughly double the compensation at Tesla, indicating what he referred to as a “Tesla pixie dust” factor, in which other companies assume if they could hire someone from Tesla, the employee would put them on track to success.\n\n“When we had the pixie dust problem, we would get relentlessly recruited from,” Musk said. “Also, Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it’s easier for people to just… They don’t have to change their life very much. Their commute’s going to be the same.”\n\nREAD NEXT: Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein had closer ties than disclosed, newly released files show\n\nJohn Collison, co-founder of Stripe and podcast host, asked Musk how he guards against poachers. Musk said there’s not much that can stop it.\n\nMusk has long been trying to draw tech talent to Texas, with a renewed push after last week’s announcement that SpaceX acquired xAI. Days after giving notice of the plan, Michael Nicolls, vice president of Starlink engineering, said the SpaceX-owned satellite company is hiring for critical engineering roles to develop technologies for AI satellites in space at the company’s facilities in Austin and Seattle.",

    "fullText": "Billionaire Mark Cuban has heard every version of \"how would you start over?\" But in a Wired \"Tech Support\" Q&A in 2023, someone finally raised the stakes.\n\n\"You have six months to make as much money as possible,\" he said. \"All you have to start with is a phone and $500 in cash. What are you doing?\"\n\n\"That is the best question I have ever been asked in my entire adult life,\" Cuban said. And then he gave a step-by-step answer that didn't include flipping phones, trading crypto, or launching an app.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nBlue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\n\"I'm going to find a sales job,\" he told Wired. \"Because I already know that if I'm down to my last $500, and all I have is a phone, I am going to get that job and I am going to learn more about that industry than anyone on the planet.\"\n\nHe wasn't joking. For the first three months, Cuban said he'd live on commission — focusing on one goal: becoming the top-performing salesperson in the building. After that, he'd cash in.\n\n\"Three months in, when I've demonstrated that I am the best salesperson in the history of that company, I'm going to walk into my boss' office and I'm going to tell him or her: ‘You're either going to pay me this amount of money to keep me, or I'm going to start my own business selling this stuff,'\" he said. \"That is exactly what I would do.\"\n\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nCuban built his career on this mindset. Before becoming a billionaire, he sold garbage bags door-to-door at 12, launched MicroSolutions out of his apartment, and made $5.7 billion selling Broadcast.com to Yahoo. From cold calls to billion-dollar exits, his pitch has always been his power.\n\nAnd on \"Shark Tank,\" it wasn't the backstory or the business plan that sealed the deal — it was the pitch. Cuban told GQ in 2023, \"You're not trying to convince people. You're trying to help them.\"\n\nNot everyone's built for sales. And not everyone wants to talk their way to the top. That doesn't mean they can't still be part of the next big thing.",

    "description": "Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said there are three big traits the people \"who are wildly successful\" in tech all share.",
    "fullText": "Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said you should treat \"every day\" like a job interview.\n\nIt's why he grows frustrated when he has to interview internal candidates for promotions.\n\nRobbins also has advice for those who would like to take his job one day.\n\nCisco CEO Chuck Robbins says he hates interviewing internal candidates for promotions.\n\n\"I think when we have two or three internal candidates for a promotion, the whole interview process is stupid,\" Robbins said during a recent interview on TBPN. \"What are we going to learn about them when we sit down in a room for 30 minutes and ask them questions when we can watch them work?\"\n\nThis frustration, Robbins said, translates into his belief that \"every day you're working is an interview for your next job.\"\n\nRobbins, who started at Cisco in 1997 as an account manager, said it's also not enough to simply strive to climb higher and higher on the corporate ladder.\n\n\"You also have to have people who care about making sure their peers are successful as well,\" he said. \"The person who is solely focused on getting to the top as an individual, it's probably not going to happen for them.\"\n\nThere's a simple exercise, Robbins said, that people should use when envisioning their promotion.\n\n\"If your peer group would look at your promotion announcement and go, 'that makes perfect sense,' then you've done your job, right?\" he said. \"And if you can't look in the mirror and say, 'OK, those people, would they be happy, would they believe it's the right decision?' And if they wouldn't, you're probably not quite where you ought to be.\"\n\nWhen it comes to those gunning for the C-Suite, or maybe even his job, Robbins said you \"can't underestimate\" the value of EQ.\n\n\"The people who are wildly successful have this really incredible combination — in our industry — understand the technology, have high EQ, and really care about the mission of the team,\" he said.\n\nAs for himself, Robbins said he's always had a way to compartmentalize things he can't control. It's why he said he's nothing that is keeping him awake at night.\n\n\"Look, I've gone home where I've had a really bad day, and I look at my wife, and say, 'You want to hear the good news? I wasn't diagnosed with cancer today,'\" he said. \"And somebody was, and I wasn't. So if my worst day, if I'm not being diagnosed with cancer or some sort of terminal illness, tomorrow I'll get up and fight another fight. You just gotta have perspective.\"",

    "description": "Laid-off tech workers are blaming AI for the loss of their jobs, but connecting the dots on how it led to their firing isn't always clear.",
    "fullText": "That's the question laid-off workers are grappling with in the aftermath of losing their jobs. The No. 1 suspect is often artificial intelligence, but connecting the dots on how that led to their firing isn't always clear.\n\nJacob Zinkula has spoken to dozens of laid-off workers who are trying to piece together why they were let go.\n\nSome might deem those efforts fruitless. (Congrats on figuring it out! You're still unemployed.)\n\nA better understanding helps inform the next career move, and plenty of people could use that. This January saw more layoffs than any January since 2009.\n\nFurther muddying the waters is companies' reluctance to say AI drives layoffs. When Amazon made its first round of deep cuts last fall, many speculated it was due to AI. But CEO Andy Jassy said it was about \"culture,\" not AI or costs.\n\nIt's one thing to lose your job because of tech. It's another to hear you don't have the personality for it.\n\nThe way I see it, AI impacts layoffs in three main ways.\n\nAI took my job: While the most direct, it's also the least common these days. There aren't many examples of AI doing everything a human can at work. In most cases, there's still a need for some human interaction.\n\nAs much as it stinks to lose your job this way, at least it's a clear sign you need to change what you're doing. AI isn't coming for your job. It's already here.\n\nAI makes my job a lot easier: This applies to just about everyone. AI can't automate everything you do, but it can sure carry a lot of the load. At first glance, that seems like a good thing. But if AI enables you to do more with less, your company has the same benefit.\n\nSure, some will position it as an opportunity to supercharge their employees to drive more business. The more likely outcome is that this is an opportunity to reduce headcount.\n\nThe silver lining is that your job is still needed. There are just fewer opportunities out there, and you need to get really good at managing AI to get them.\n\nWe need to pay for this AI somehow: The most frustrating of the three. AI isn't directly impacting your job at all, but those tech bills aren't going to pay themselves. If you fall into this bucket, chances are you weren't driving a ton of revenue for the firm. (After all, why kill a cash cow when money is tight?)\n\nIt's a hard pill to swallow. However, it could serve as a wake-up call for how you approach your next gig. Like it or not, AI is the way forward for most companies. So if you're not helping a business reach that goal, you might need to reconsider what you're doing in the first place.",

    "description": "Surging prices in a corner of the tech market are inflating AI capex. Without that, there could be a \"notable deceleration\" in spending growth: RBC.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech's latest capex projections have shocked investors. Look beneath the headline numbers, though, and spending may actually be growing far more slowly.\n\nThat's according to new research on Monday from analysts at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAmazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are expected to spend almost $600 billion this year on data centers, chips, networking, and other related gear to meet surging AI demand.\n\nOn the surface, this may look like a relentless acceleration, but RBC's analysis suggests these growth numbers are being flattered by an unusual culprit: runaway memory prices.\n\nThe RBC analysts found that soaring prices for data center memory chips — including DRAM, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and NAND flash — could account for about 45% of the dollar growth in cloud capital expenditures for 2026. Crucially, most of that increase isn't coming from companies buying dramatically more hardware, but from paying much more for the same components, the analysts said.\n\nRBC estimates that data center memory spending across the top 10 hyperscalers will jump from about $107 billion in 2025 to roughly $237 billion in 2026. That $130 billion increase would represent about 45% of total capex growth at those companies. Even more striking, around three-quarters of the memory spend increase — roughly $98 billion — is attributable purely to higher prices, not higher unit volumes.\n\nThe price shock is severe. TrendForce projections cited by RBC show DRAM prices more than doubling in 2026, while NAND prices are expected to rise more than 85%. Memory has become one of the most constrained inputs in AI infrastructure, as advanced GPUs require large amounts of high-performance DRAM and HBM, while AI data centers consume massive quantities of flash storage.\n\nWhen RBC strips memory out of the equation, Big Tech's spending surge looks meaningfully different. Excluding memory costs, capex growth is projected to drop to about 40% in 2026, down from roughly 80% growth in 2025. That's still a strong expansion, but far less explosive than the raw capex totals imply.\n\nThe analysts described this as \"a notable deceleration,\" while adding that \"it's not necessarily cause for alarm.\"\n\nRBC argued that underlying AI investment remains robust, but warned that memory pricing is now the biggest wild card for capex trends heading into 2027.\n\nIn effect, Big Tech may be spending vastly more on some equipment — without building proportionally more — as the AI arms race collides with an overheated memory market.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender’s early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase\n\nMillions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDocuments published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.\n\nThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.\n\nEpstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.\n\nDocuments published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.\n\nIn communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.\n\nOn Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.\n\nIn communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.\n\nCharlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.\n\n“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.\n\nAs to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.\n\nCryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.\n\n“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.",

    "description": "OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said specialized AI, not AGI or LLMs, is a better future for the technology.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, many investors, founders, and tech giants often frame AI as an all-powerful force — something approaching omniscience.\n\nThey call it artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical system capable of matching or exceeding human reasoning across virtually all tasks and, beyond that, superintelligence, which would surpass human cognition altogether.\n\nAGI is the thing OpenAI and its competitors are racing to be the first to bring to life.\n\nThe industry isn't a monolith, however, nor are its builders.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, the now-viral personal AI assistant powering the agent-only social network, Moltbook, told the Y Combinator podcast on Saturday that he thinks the best AI is specialized, not generalized.\n\n\"What can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space?\" he said. \"As a group we specialize, as a larger society we specialize even more.\"\n\nHe said the same holds true for AI. Current AI systems are labeled as \"general.\" In practice, however, they are already specialized for particular tasks — like startups building models to solve Erdos math problems or identify gene mutations.\n\nWhile the hype around AI has largely focused on the types of models being built — from large language models to computer vision systems or even world models — some startups and tech giants are also experimenting with more focused, subject-specific forms of intelligence.\n\nAxiom, a startup founded by former Meta researcher Carina Hong and backed by $64 million in seed funding, for instance, is building specialized intelligence to tackle advanced mathematics.\n\nGoogle DeepMind has developed AlphaGenome, a system designed to predict how variants or mutations in human DNA affect a wide range of gene-regulating biological processes.\n\nCompanies are also developing smaller models, which could make it easier to build AI systems tailored to specific subjects or domains. Aidan Gomez, the CEO of Cohere, which builds AI technology for enterprises, told Business Insider in 2024 that there was increasing pressure to build \"smaller, more efficient models\" and to make them smarter with the right data and algorithms, rather than just scaling them.\n\nSteinberger is not the only one to push back against the idea of an all-powerful general intelligence.\n\nTimnit Gebru, a computer scientist who founded and leads the Distributed AI Research Institute, said AGI is a \"fictional thing\" in a November video published by Nature.\n\nShe said the backbone of engineering lies in building well-scoped, testable systems. The pursuit of a \"fictional, undefined 'machine god,'\" she said, is pushing the industry toward deeper labor exploitation and environmental damage.\n\nSteinberger, previously best known for launching the PDF processing company PSPDFKit, came out of retirement to build with AI. He said the technology has come a long way since he started, when his goal was simply to build \"something that could type stuff so my computer could do things.\"",

    "description": "Tech didn't just star in Super Bowl ads this year — it stumbled. While the stakes are high for advertisers, some glitches aren't always a bad thing.",
    "fullText": "A Super Bowl ad is meant to serve as a victory lap for tech companies. But on advertising's biggest night of the year, some brands were undone by the very thing they were supposed to be showcasing: technology.\n\nMr Beast and Salesforce teamed up to offer viewers a $1 million prize if they could be the first to crack clues hidden in a Super Bowl ad, and elsewhere, in an online treasure hunt. However, some hopeful contestants were immediately foiled by delays in receiving their registration emails.\n\nIn a message on the contest website, Salesforce said the glitch was caused by an \"overwhelming response\" to the competition and that it was working with major email providers to resolve the issue.\n\nMarc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, appeared to be pleased with the ad's performance, writing on X that more than 53 million people visited the campaign's landing page. \"Beyond any expectation we could have had,\" he wrote, adding that Mr Beast is \"an absolute genius.\"\n\nElsewhere, an ad that ran in the fourth quarter of the game for AI.com — a new platform launched by Crypto.com cofounder Kris Marszalek — invited viewers to visit the website to create a handle and create their own agents. But social media users said that the site was down for a period after the ad aired.\n\nMarszalek had spent $70 million to acquire the AI.com domain, which the deal's broker confirmed to the Financial Times was the highest-known price paid for a domain.\n\n\"Insane traffic levels. We prepared for scale, but not for THIS,\" Marszalek wrote on X. He later wrote that the site was \"hitting Google rate limits (which are at their absolute global maximum).\" The site was restored shortly afterward.\n\nThe stakes are high for Super Bowl advertisers. This year's broadcaster, NBCUniversal, confirmed that the average price to secure 30 seconds of airtime during the game reached $8 million, with some slots fetching $10 million. Then there's the additional investments in talent fees, production, and supporting ads and social activity beyond the TV ad.\n\nAs one of the few remaining mass-reach advertising vehicles — 127.7 million viewers tuned in last year, per the ratings company Nielsen — Super Bowl advertisers usually want to go out of their way to avoid mistakes. Sometimes brands can frame apparent tech flops as wins.\n\nLoz Horner, strategy partner at the ad agency Lucky Generals, which had previously produced Super Bowl campaigns for Amazon, said that while site crashes could cause some viewers to question the reliability of a company's tech, last night's glitches will likely play out well for Salesforce and AI.com.\n\n\"It builds the sense that this is a good thing that you should \"There probably isn't another advertising moment like the Super Bowl where if you run an ad saying, 'do something now,' you need to be ready for tens of millions of responses.\"\n\nIn 2022, Coinbase captured attention with a 60-second Super Bowl TV spot that simply featured a QR code bouncing around the screen like a DVD screensaver. Shortly after airing, Coinbase's app reportedly crashed for some users, while others showed error screens on the landing page. The company chalked it up as a win, saying the ad delivered 20 million hits to a landing page within a minute of it airing. The spot also won the 2022 Super Clio for best Super Bowl ad, an award judged by a jury of advertising experts.\n\nThis year, Coinbase went minimal again with a 60-second retro karaoke-machine-style ad that encouraged viewers to sing along to the Backstreet Boys' \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back),\" before revealing its logo at the very end.\n\nPrediction market platform Kalshi was another company hit by tech glitches during last night's Super Bowl. While the company couldn't advertise during the Super Bowl itself — prediction markets were placed on the NFL's prohibited advertising list last year — Kalshi had been heavily promoting bets related to the big game. However, the company said Sunday evening that some deposits and transfers on its app were delayed because of the high volume of traffic.",

    "fullText": "Authors, a newsreader, a lawyer and an esteemed colleague: they’re all great – but I’m not married to any of them. Can we really depend on this technology?\n\nRecently, the Rowsons accidentally invented a new game that anyone can play at home. I have yet to come up with a world-beating name for it, so for now let’s just call it “How bloody stupid is AI?” The playing of the game will change from player to player, depending on their circumstances – but essentially the rules remain the same. Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.\n\nIn my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.\n\nIt’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny. As a satirist, I have always been a fool for anything that points up the even greater folly of our leaders, the tools of their techbro masters or the true capabilities of our new robot overlords. Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”\n\nImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overview was “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically is not my wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:\n\nTextile designer Fiona Scott-Wilson.\n\nActor Fiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.\n\nJulia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this is the fantasy author, the illustrator, the late powerlifter or another Julia Mills altogether).\n\nWriter and journalist Emily Rees.\n\nLawyer and academic Siva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.\n\nWriter and journalist Carrie McLaren.\n\nChannel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman.\n\nCNN correspondent Clarissa Ward.\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Rachel Johnson.\n\nThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.\n\nThen it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does he exist?\n\nThere was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. Playwright Lee Hall got a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.\n\nAs for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).\n\nAnother search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalist Ann Widdecombe (his ex-wife), Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author, Polly Toynbee is a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”\n\nFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”\n\nI suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.\n\nWhile my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imagine that family Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.\n\nWe should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?\n\nI wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”\n\nMartin Rowson is a cartoonist and author",

    "title": "This Sci-Fi US Navy Destroyer Is $8 Billion Of Military Tech Floating At Sea",
    "description": "Right out of a sci-fi movie, this US Navy stealth ship comes with an $8 billion price tag and an incredible level of high-tech weaponry and capability.",
    "fullText": "When the U.S. Navy commissioned its Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG-1000) in 2016, it hailed the warship as the most advanced surface combatant in the world. Equipped with a state-of-the-art stealth design, revolutionary electric propulsion and integrated power mechanisms, and twin Advanced Gun Systems, the 16,000-ton Zumwalt was touted as being larger, more advanced, and more difficult to detect than any destroyer the world had ever seen.\n\nHowever, several shortcomings, including runaway costs and underwhelming performance, caused the Navy to reduce order numbers from the proposed 32 to three, raising doubts in the Navy's ability to deliver advanced warships. Ultimately, the Zumwalt suffered from two major problems. The first was its incredible cost, as the $8 billion per-ship price tag made it impractical for largescale manufacturing and deployment. Second, its advanced designs were poorly suited for the Navy's intended usage as a land support ship, where stealth features are less important. As such, U.S. leadership determined the Zumwalt was an expensive square peg for the Navy's shore-support round hole, rendering it a floating money pit without a definitive mission.\n\nThis disconnect prompted the U.S. Navy to begin the arduous task of updating its most expensive destroyer, replacing the 155mm guns with hypersonic missiles. The first ship of its kind to sport an intercontinental missile system, the Zumwalt is one of a host of global destroyers adding high-tech weapons systems to address a changing threat landscape. The update recasts the Zumwalt as part of the U.S.'s long range strike operations, an increasingly important strategic priority, perhaps best exemplified by the nuclear missile test in November 2025. Having completed a round of post-modernization sea trials in January 2026, this sci-fi stealth ship may finally be ready to take its place at the head of U.S. Naval strategy.\n\nWhen the DDG-1000 was commissioned, it was lauded for its novel stealth designs. Despite constituting an approximate 40% jump in size from its Arleigh Burke-class predecessor, the 610-foot Zumwalt's radar cross section matches that of a 50-foot fishing vessel. Employing many of the same stealth design principles of fighter jets, the Zumwalt eschewed typical design structures, instead using an angular, wave-piercing tumblehome hull and a deckhouse constructed of electromagnetic wave-absorbing composite materials to lower the ship's radar footprint.\n\nAdd acoustics that more closely resemble a submarine, and the Zumwalt is roughly 50 times more clandestine than the Arleigh Burke destroyers. Another major development was the Zumwalt's electric propulsion system. Powered by a revolutionary integrated power network, it's capable of generating 78 megawatts, nearly as much as a nuclear aircraft carrier.\n\nThe massive size allows the Zumwalt to host a diverse array of aircraft, including Joint Strike Fighters, drones, and MV-22 Osprey, initially seen as a boon for its position alongside amphibious and littoral combat ships. To support these near-shore operations, the ship was equipped with two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS). With a range of 62 nautical miles, the Navy intended the AGS' Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles to fill the Naval Surface Fire Support void left by the 1992 retirement of the Iowa-class battleship.\n\nUnfortunately, the technological advancements of the Navy's sci-fi stealth ship came at a price. Over its 11-year development, costs skyrocketed to$23 billion. To put such astronomical numbers in perspective, the US Navy's new nuclear supercarrier, the Gerald R. Ford-class, costs $13 billion. Ammunition alone proved a financial disaster for the Zumwalt, as each round cost over $800,000, forcing a purchase cut from 20,000 to 2,400 units.\n\nFurther complicating things, the Zumwalt's expensive stealth advancements were ill-suited for the Navy's planned near-shore use, where crowded waterways and clear sightlines nullify much of its anti-radar capability. Between rising costs and competing design priorities, Naval planners largely viewed the Zumwalt-class destroyers as an expensive ship without a mission. Since canceling its ammunition order, however, the Navy has begun to reorient the Zumwalt away from close shore combat and towards clandestine operations and long range missile strikes.\n\nThis repurposing began in August 2023, when the DDG-1000 underwent a 3-year modernization effort.  Part of which involved replacing the Advanced Gun Systems with a state-of-the-art Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapons system that carries Common Hypersonic Glide Bodies capable of worldwide range at speeds up to Mach 5. Through these efforts, the Navy hopes that the CPS system will shift the Zumwalt-class destroyer into a key cog of its global force-projection efforts, particularly in the Pacific theatre.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "Hassan Ismail cofounded a defense tech startup in Canada. He found the country's regulations difficult to navigate, and the investors too risk-averse.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hassan Ismail, the 24-year-old cofounder of Yellowcake, who lives in Toronto. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2021, there was a government bid in Canada for some military hardware. My cofounder and I officially founded West Tek Defense Corporation in August 2022. We were doing smart rifles for the military.\n\nIt was complicated. (At one point, we were literally balancing redox equations for propellant in the ammo.) The physics background we both had helped a lot; essentially, everything we saw was something we'd encountered in a class or during personal research.\n\nWe spent about three years on the entire process. Ultimately, we found out it wasn't going to work — mostly because of regulation.\n\nWe spoke to the head of the civilian side of procurement for the bid, and we were flat-out told something like: \"There's no reason for us to consider you. We don't even care.\" For us to even find the contact for who was running the bid, it was a bunch of dead links. We had to go pester extremely high officials to get us the appropriate contact.\n\nTo be able to produce firearms in America, you need an FFL. You go through a pretty standard process: apply, background check, reason.\n\nIn Canada, the equivalent of an FFL is a BFL. We weren't able to get a BFL until we had a contract. We had to convince some type of agency, as two kids, to buy an idea. Almost all of them at first would be receptive: \"Sure, can we see this thing?\" We'd have to awkwardly explain to them: \"Well, you have to order them before I can even produce them, because of government regulation.\"\n\nJustifiably, most of them were like, \"Nope.\"\n\nWe took this terrible 3D-printed demo to the law enforcement in Northwest Ontario. It was falling apart. I could tell they pitied us.\n\nIt was regulatory law after regulatory law. After a while, we did finally get our BFL.\n\nIt turns out, if you want to subcontract this — which you will if you're a startup, because the startup doesn't have millions to start some manufacturing project — whoever you subcontract to needs their own BFL.\n\nIt really seemed that it was tailored against any kind of startup or disruptor to come in and break the status quo.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was that a lot of manufacturing businesses are going under here. Every time we'd reach out to a company, they'd either say they don't have the budget to help us, or they would and then would call us back later and say something to the effect of, \"We're going bankrupt.\"\n\nInvestors would say: Until you guys lock in these contracts, this $1 billion government bid, we're not going to touch it. These guys were looking for fourth- or fifth-time founders who already had multi-hundred-million-dollar exits.\n\nOne of our angels, who was the first money in, is on the board of a Big Tech company. He wrote us a $50,000 angel check. We'd pitch investors on that — and Canadian investors wouldn't care.\n\nAmerican investors were interested, but the issue was that they were interested in American defense, not really Canadian defense. They also had a lot of compliance issues with investing in foreign defense.\n\nWe ended up shuttering that. We still have the patents. The tech is still ready to go.\n\nWe got into the University of Waterloo's accelerator and started a new SaaS startup.\n\nThis startup is a Delaware C Corp. American investors — who rightfully want to invest in American companies, because it's what they're familiar with — are far more friendly and open-minded.\n\nMany Canadian investors have very hostile agreement conditions. One investor wanted to do CA$100,00 at a $3-5 million valuation. For reference, we ended up raising our round at $1.6 million at a $10 million post-money capitalization in America. They were offering less than a fraction. It's brutal.\n\nEveryone in our cap table is American, or Canadian expats living in America. None of our investors are actually living in Canada.\n\nWe'd like to move the business to New York. We think it is going to be the next tech hub. Clay CEO Kareem Amin is a McGill grad. He's Canadian. He also lets us co-work in his office in Chelsea.\n\nYC initially deciding not to invest in Canadian corporations is totally justifiable. There are a lot of Canadian founders in YC. What that's telling them is: Canadians aren't even confidant in building Canadian companies. They're all moving to America anyway.\n\nI understand their decision to reverse it. The backlash was coming from a place of political climate and ignorance. A lot of people were seeing it as YC sticking the middle finger to Canada.\n\nEveryone that we know, as well as Canadian YC founders that we know and love, have all said the same thing: This is a stupid debacle.\n\nWe all understand why YC did it.",

    "fullText": "The AI wars are driving a more demanding work culture in Silicon Valley that some insiders worry is burning workers out.\n\nA \"996\" work schedule, in which employees work six days a week from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., has been well established in China and is taking hold in the San Francisco tech scene. While Silicon Valley has long been known for an intense work culture, some companies have recently adopted the more rigid 996 work schedule.\n\nNathan Lambert, a senior research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, and Sebastian Raschka, an AI research lab founder, joined podcaster Lex Fridman in a recent episode about artificial intelligence. When asked about 996 culture in Silicon Valley, Raschka said what he's seen is not exactly the same as in China, but it's trending that way.\n\nThe current landscape of the tech industry consists of AI models leapfrogging each other to try to stay ahead of their competitors. For startups, the pressure to make it big can lead to grueling work schedules for employees.\n\n\"It's really hard because you have to deliver constantly,\" Raschka said.\n\nRaschka said both passion and competition are driving the grind mindset in Silicon Valley. He got a taste of this work culture while working as an academic in AI. He said he wasn't forced to overwork; he chose to.\n\nLambert said this mindset is showing up in some of the most recognizable companies in San Francisco and the AI industry.\n\n\"That's what OpenAI and Anthropic are like,\" he said, saying that employees commit to the high-pressure culture because they want to do the work, particularly the programmers.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nStill, Lambert said that the environment can come at a \"human expense,\" including lost time with family, closed-mindedness toward the rest of the world, and, sometimes, health issues.\n\n\"You can only do this for so long, and people are definitely burning out,\" he said.\n\nFor Raschka, the toll was back and neck pain from skipping breaks that he said he should've taken.\n\nIt's an environment that young programmers may have to brave if they want to make their mark in AI.\n\n\"If you're really passionate about wanting to have an impact in AI, being physically in SF is the most likely place where you're going to do this,\" Lambert said. \"But it has trade-offs.\"",

    "description": "Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said there are three big traits the people \"who are wildly successful\" in tech all share.",
    "fullText": "Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins says he hates interviewing internal candidates for promotions.\n\n\"I think when we have two or three internal candidates for a promotion, the whole interview process is stupid,\" Robbins said during a recent interview on TBPN. \"What are we going to learn about them when we sit down in a room for 30 minutes and ask them questions when we can watch them work?\"\n\nThis frustration, Robbins said, translates into his belief that \"every day you're working is an interview for your next job.\"\n\nRobbins, who started at Cisco in 1997 as an account manager, said it's also not enough to simply strive to climb higher and higher on the corporate ladder.\n\n\"You also have to have people who care about making sure their peers are successful as well,\" he said. \"The person who is solely focused on getting to the top as an individual, it's probably not going to happen for them.\"\n\nThere's a simple exercise, Robbins said, that people should use when envisioning their promotion.\n\n\"If your peer group would look at your promotion announcement and go, 'that makes perfect sense,' then you've done your job, right?\" he said. \"And if you can't look in the mirror and say, 'OK, those people, would they be happy, would they believe it's the right decision?' And if they wouldn't, you're probably not quite where you ought to be.\"\n\nWhen it comes to those gunning for the C-Suite, or maybe even his job, Robbins said you \"can't underestimate\" the value of EQ.\n\n\"The people who are wildly successful have this really incredible combination — in our industry — understand the technology, have high EQ, and really care about the mission of the team,\" he said.\n\nAs for himself, Robbins said he's always had a way to compartmentalize things he can't control. It's why he said he's nothing that is keeping him awake at night.\n\n\"Look, I've gone home where I've had a really bad day, and I look at my wife, and say, 'You want to hear the good news? I wasn't diagnosed with cancer today,'\" he said. \"And somebody was, and I wasn't. So if my worst day, if I'm not being diagnosed with cancer or some sort of terminal illness, tomorrow I'll get up and fight another fight. You just gotta have perspective.\"",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about what AI means for the future of the software business.",
    "fullText": "Software stocks had a brutal week, aside from a Friday rally, extending what has been a rough year for the industry. I touched base with our tech columnist, Ali Barr, the best I know on AI business models. He also wrote this piece in the midst of the selloff.\n\nAli, you've been covering AI adoption and costs by big business since you started our Tech Memo newsletter. What's your gut on whether the recent selloff was overblown?\n\nSoftware business models have underpinned the tech industry for decades. Companies invest heavily upfront to build software, but each additional copy costs almost nothing to distribute. So revenue scales faster than costs, driving fat profit margins. That dynamic helps explain why Microsoft, the world's largest software company, is so valuable.\n\nAI challenges this model. If this new technology makes employees more productive, companies may need fewer software subscriptions. And as AI tools improve, businesses could replace existing software with AI-driven workflows or even build their own software using AI coding tools. Finally, if software companies embrace AI, that could make their services more expensive to run than traditional software. That would mean rising usage doesn't automatically translate into soaring profitability.\n\nIf software in the AI era becomes less profitable and grows more slowly, then it's logical that the stock prices of software companies might fall. A lot.\n\nBig Tech spending on AI data centers and other infrastructure is set to soar again this year. How will these companies generate a return on these huge investments?\n\nThe numbers are breathtaking. Just two companies, Google and Amazon, are planning capex of almost $400 billion in 2026. A couple more years of the same, and that's more than $1 trillion.\n\nTo get a return on this, they will have to come up with new revenue of well over $1 trillion in future years. AI is amazing and really useful, but it's hard for some investors to see how this happens. Even if new AI products are awesome, do consumers and companies have enough money to buy all this stuff? I don't know. One outcome could be that Big Tech giants make do with slimmer profit margins in an AI future. That's similar to the concerns that have hammered software stocks lately.\n\nWho are the most-interesting people to watch in the sector?\n\nI pay attention to Andrej Karpathy. He was director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI. He's pretty independent nowadays, which means what he says about AI can be trusted more. Bonus: He coined the term \"vibe coding.\"\n\nAditya Agarwal was Facebook's first head of product engineering. He was also CTO and VP of engineering at Dropbox. He's a coding powerhouse. Recently, he used Claude to do some coding and was stunned by the power of this tool. \"I am filled with wonder and also a profound sadness,\" he wrote on X. \"We will never ever write code by hand again. It doesn't make any sense to do so. Something I was very good at is now free and abundant.\"\n\nI'm usually skeptical, but the start of 2026 feels like a moment of highly disruptive — and destructive — change.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Singapore (AP) — This week’s Singapore Air Show brought together trade delegations from around the world to show off the latest in civilian and military aviation technology.\n\nThe event this year marked the 10th edition of the air show, which showcased cutting-edge planes from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force. This included the F-35 Lightning II, the latest U.S.-made fifth-generation fighter jet that has integrated stealth technology and is considered one of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.\n\nMajor commercial plane makers also touted the latest advancements in their fleets, including Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Boeing and China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC.\n\n“We have a very good representation of the latest and the greatest,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, which organizes the event. “The Singapore Air Show, the unique part of it is we cover both the aviation and also the defense industries.”\n\nDuring the Singapore Air Show's aerial displays, COMAC promoted its C919 passenger jet, which China is pushing as an alternative to the European Airbus A320neo and the American Boeing 737 MAX. The daily aerial displays at the event also showcased six military teams and Airbus’ A350-1000.\n\nWithin the exhibition hall, the air show featured experimental air taxis, advanced flight simulators, a wide variety of drones and both manned and unmanned helicopters. The static aircraft display under Singapore’s sizzling sun included roughly 35 planes from more than 10 countries.\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 companies from around 50 countries participated in the air show, hosted on the grounds of Changi International Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest airport. The event, which opened on Feb. 3, is considered Asia’s largest aerospace and defense exhibition and runs through Feb. 8.\n\n“All the exhibitors can use Singapore as a springboard to then tap into the opportunities that are rising in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key driver that is driving the growth of the global aviation industry,\" Lam said.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "fullText": "One of these companies is not like the others.\n\nIf you’ve been following the Big Tech companies’ earnings reports, you know that they’re pouring more than ever into capital expenditure to pursue their AI futures.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft all spent record sums last quarter on purchases of property and equipment — largely tied AI chips and data centers. And for the companies that offered forward-looking guidance, their capex plans for the year blew analysts’ already generous estimates out of the water.\n\nAmazon expects its 2026 capex to surge to $200 billion. Google is aiming for $175 billion to $185 billion. Meta estimates it will spend between $115 billion and $135 billion. All of those figures came in well above expectations and, for the most part, have weighed on their stocks. Microsoft didn’t give a formal 2026 capex outlook, but if its peers are any indication, spending will likely exceed the roughly $114 billion Wall Street expects for the calendar year.\n\nOf the Big Tech companies, just one stands apart this earnings season. Apple’s capital expenditure, already just a fraction of its peers, actually declined in the December quarter from a year earlier.\n\nFor better or worse, Apple has struck its own path with AI. As we’ve argued before, it’s embracing AI but is not an AI company. Instead, it’s chosen a hybrid model, relying on both first- and third-party data centers — a move that keeps a significant amount of infrastructure spending off its balance sheet. And while Apple has said it expects capex to increase as it invests more heavily in AI, particularly to support its Private Cloud Compute, those outlays remain minimal compared with its peers.\n\nYou can see that approach reflected in Apple’s decision to use Google’s Gemini, rather than an in-house model, to power the next generation of Siri and Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe Google deal, reportedly worth about $1 billion a year, gives Apple access to a top-tier AI model for pennies on the dollar compared to what other Big Tech companies are spending to build their own.\n\nOf course, it also means Apple won’t fully own a technology that some see as powering the next industrial revolution. But if that revolution fails to materialize — or takes longer than expected — Apple won’t be left holding the most expensive bag in Silicon Valley history.",

    "fullText": "The race to dominate the burgeoning AI market is pushing tech giants to adopt business models reminiscent of IBM's (IBM) in the 1960s.\n\nBig Tech \"hyperscalers\" Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) are all in various stages of developing their own custom AI chips to put in their data centers and power their cloud and software offerings. Alphabet, the farthest along of the four companies, is even reportedly in talks to sell its physical chips called TPUs to Meta — a move that would see it go head-to-head with leading chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nThose efforts have led Bloomberg Intelligence analysts to predict the custom AI chip market will grow to $122 billion by 2033.\n\nBig Tech's production of their own components goes beyond chips: Microsoft and Amazon are actively investing in dark fiber, or currently unused fiber-optic cables that are already underground, RBC Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Atkin said in a recent note to clients. Google and Meta also own their own cables but still buy from third parties, he wrote. Those cables are necessary to connect companies' data centers and the enterprises that use them.\n\nThe dynamic in which cloud providers are making their own components (hardware) to run their core products (software) shows Silicon Valley swinging back toward vertical integration — an operating model pioneered by oil and steel tycoons in the late 19th century and adopted by IBM during the digital revolution.\n\nIBM was one of the most successful vertically integrated companies in the 1960s, when it made the hardware components for its mainframes, or large computer systems. IBM's strategy emerged from the idea that making its own specialized parts would improve its end product (mainframes) and profit margins — and amid concerns over supply shortages of parts for early computers. It worked: In 1985, the company accounted for more than half the market value of the computer industry, Carliss Y. Baldwin noted in her book \"Design Rules.\"\n\nOf course, that all fell apart later. In the 1990s, the falling costs of producing semiconductors — as well as the rise of software powerhouse Microsoft and chip leader Intel — dug into IBM's once-formidable competitive moat, and the company no longer claimed to be vertically integrated by 2000, Baldwin said.\n\nJust as the emergence of computers pushed IBM toward vertical integration, the popularization of AI since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 has put today's cloud giants on a similar trajectory. In particular, the steep costs of Nvidia's chips and their limited availability have pushed tech giants to advance their AI chip efforts. Those custom chips are cheaper and better optimized for the companies' software.",

    "description": "AI bubble fears have led to billions erased from tech CEOs’ net worth overnight—and Oracle founder Larry Ellison has been hit the hardest this year.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to the world’s richest billionaires, tech founders litter the top of the list. AI has been heralded as a multitrillion-dollar industry, catapulting many founders to extreme wealth; but now AI bubble fears and doubts over valuations have led to billions erased from CEOs’ net worth overnight. For Larry Ellison, whose net worth has been hardest hit, that looks like a $59.2 billion loss since the year started—and we’re only in February.\n\nAfter months of eyebrow-raising over software stocks and AI’s impact on the sector, a selloff on Tuesday triggered the loss of billions among the wealthiest. In the few days since then, Ellison has watched his wealth slide by $19 billion, according to current data from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s fortune has dropped by $14 billion.\n\nThe Tuesday selloff, turbocharged by Anthropic’s new legal AI tool, also sent the already dwindling fortunes of software billionaires to tumble even harder. Following the broad selloff that saw the S&P 500 software and services index fall by nearly 4%, at least $62 billion was wiped from the net worth of the industry’s wealthiest entrepreneurs so far this year, according to a Bloomberg analysis of its Billionaires Index.\n\nBut the three founders of advertising platform AppLovin saw the biggest relative decline in wealth in the aftermath in the selloff; CEO Adam Foroughi lost 31% of his net worth since the start of the year, around $7.8 billion, while former CTO John Krystynak’s fortune was shaved down 30% after a $2.4 billion blow. Fellow AppLovin cofounder Andrew Karam also emerged from the selloff 29% less rich than at the start of 2026.\n\nDespite building the world’s most valuable company thanks to AI advancements, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also faced a decline; he’s lost $7 billion since the selloff earlier this week, and is down nearly $12 billion this year. And the net worth of Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, has gone through the wringer this week. Relative to his peers, he’s only lost a modest $5 billion after Tuesday—but since the start of 2026, almost $29 billion has been wiped from Ballmer’s name.\n\nTechnology has proved a gold rush, with the industry minting new entrepreneurial millionaires and billionaires yearly. Take a look at the top 10 richest U.S. billionaires, who added a whopping $698 billion to their net worth between 2024 and 2025, according to a 2025 Oxfam report, and the sector’s financial power comes to light.",

Plus, earlier that year, Intel announced plans to outsource much of his division's work to Accenture, which it said would use AI to enhance its marketing efforts.\n\n\"That made it seem even more likely that our group would be hit,\" said Ha, who's in his 30s and based in Portland, Oregon.\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken with dozens of white-collar workers who had recently been laid off — and were left wondering why. Those who weren't aware of any personal performance concerns pointed to a variety of possible explanations, including cost-cutting, the Great Flattening, and pandemic-era overhiring. And one question came up over and over: Is AI to blame?\n\nAs companies pour money into AI, it remains unclear if the technology will replace jobs — or create new ones. While some have signaled that replacing human employees is the goal, others haven't been as clear. Instead, they've cut jobs while simultaneously funding significant AI investments, leaving workers to connect the dots.\n\nUS employers cited AI as responsible for nearly 55,000 planned layoffs last year, per Challenger — up from about 17,000 combined in the two years prior. As pressure mounts to show returns on AI investments, companies may respond by tightening performance standards — and ultimately, shedding the workers who can't keep up.\n\nStill, most companies stop short of pointing the finger at AI. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. Amazon also cited efficiency and culture as a reason for cuts.\n\nRegarding the layoffs that affected Ha, an Intel spokesperson said the company is \"taking steps to become a leaner, faster and more efficient company.\"\n\nThe workers puzzling out AI's role in their layoffs aren't just trying to process the news — they want to better assess what they're up against in today's job market. To thrive in an AI-driven future, they know they may need to learn new skills and explore new roles. They just want to know if the future they've been fearing has already arrived.\n\nWhen Joe Friend learned in May that he, along with thousands of others at Microsoft, had lost their jobs, he \"wasn't entirely surprised by the layoffs,\" he said. \"I was surprised to get caught up in them.\"\n\nFriend, who's in his 60s and lives in Washington state, was a director of product management overseeing a team of nine. He said he saw speculation online that the layoffs were tied to productivity gains from Microsoft's AI investments — that AI had effectively \"eaten\" people's jobs. However, he said he hadn't seen much evidence that AI was significantly boosting productivity — and suspects the cuts were more about freeing up money for those investments.\n\n\"I think these are cuts to offset the huge expenditures that are being made into the structure for AI,\" he said. \"So in that way, AI has eaten your job, but not in terms of AI creating productivity gains.\"\n\nIan Carter, another laid-off Microsoft worker, also pointed to the company's large investments in AI, as well as what he saw as overhiring during the pandemic. While pursuing roles similar to his former technical program manager position, he also began developing his AI skills — noting that job postings increasingly signaled demand for that expertise.\n\nWhich jobs will be most vulnerable to AI takeover has been a topic of speculation for years. James Hwang, who lost his Amazon job in October, said he knew that his role — providing IT support for Amazon employees — could be at some risk of automation. Plus, last June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he expected AI-driven efficiency gains would eventually lead to a smaller workforce.\n\nStill, while Hwang's team had started using AI to help troubleshoot issues, he didn't think the tech was there yet. He's currently applying to similar IT support roles and hasn't shifted his job search strategy in response to AI concerns.\n\n\"Amazon is not at that stage yet where AI can do our job,\" said Hwang, who's in his 20s and lives in Michigan. \"For us, AI is a tool, because there needs to be a human touch for support.\"\n\nFriend and Hwang are among several laid-off workers who told Business Insider they believe AI's role in their cuts had less to do with automating jobs and more to do with freeing up cash, in part to fund AI investments. But in the end, the financial impact is the same for those who lost their jobs. Going forward, Friend said he plans to be highly selective about his next role, as he believes job security is becoming harder to find in the tech industry.\n\nLaid-off workers who wonder whether AI played a role in their job loss may never get a clear answer.\n\nA company's decision to conduct layoffs is often shaped by a mix of factors — from financial pressures to shifting priorities. And even when leadership offers an explanation for the cuts, it may reflect only part of the story — shaped as much by messaging strategy as by internal reasoning.\n\nNinety percent of analysts surveyed recently by Goldman Sachs said AI hadn't yet affected employment levels at the companies they cover — but 60% expected it to drive lower employment over the next five years.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, some laid-off workers have decided to build AI skills to prepare for the evolving job market.\n\nIn his prior role in product at a software development company, Lee Givens Jr. saw colleagues leave for firms eager to shell out big salaries for AI talent. So when was laid off in 2023, he began thinking about how to better position himself in a tech industry that had clearly shifted toward AI.\n\nGivens Jr. decided to study AI frameworks relevant to his field, hoping it would make him a more attractive candidate. He said he believes that investment paid off, helping him later land a staff product manager role at a Toyota subsidiary, where he's now putting his AI knowledge to work.\n\n\"When there's a major technological shift — like the rise of the internet or AI — you have to reinvent yourself,\" he said.",

    "description": "A San Francisco AI startup is giving out stipends and dedicating project days for non-tech staff to vibe code apps that help with their workflow.",
    "fullText": "If you work for a San Francisco startup and don't know how to code, you could soon be asked to get creative with vibe coding.\n\nCheckr, an AI-powered background check company, gave Business Insider a glimpse of how employees are actually using AI.\n\nCheckr CEO Daniel Yanisse said that the company is going \"all in\" and trying everything to encourage its employees to fully embrace AI — including staff that don't work in engineering roles.\n\n\"We really pride ourselves on using AI to the maximum possible amount,\" said Yanisse. \"We gave every employee a monthly stipend to try AI tools, and we did AI days and demos. After one year, 95% of the employees use prompting daily.\"\n\n\"This year, we're going to level up and move to building with AI, as in vibe coding,\" Yanisse added. \"I'm working with all of our teams now, and we're going to do our AI days soon in March, where we're going to make every non-technical person vibe code their own business apps.\"\n\nYanisse said that many employees who have no idea how to code, who work in finance, legal, and HR, are already vibecoding apps to automate their workflows and problem-solve, such as building tools that help clean up large spreadsheets.\n\nWhile Checkr is evaluating a variety of builder tools like Lovable, Replit, and Claude Code, Yanisse said Cursor is a clear standout and \"has amazing adoption\" among both engineers and non-technical staff, but Lovable is the best place to start for people with no coding experience.\n\n\"Probably, we're going to buy all of them and just use the right tool for the right person,\" Yanisse said of different AI coding tools.\n\n\"We have AI solution engineers who are available to actually partner and help, so they would come and help you and unstuck you if you have a problem, and take you all the way to success,\" Yanisse added. \"And then you're on your way because then we share success stories with everyone in the company.\"\n\nIn practice, data shows that AI adoption can be complicated in a large enterprise. Competence with AI tools can be very uneven across the board, and security risks can mount without clear guidelines on AI usage.\n\nAccording to a survey published in November by Moveworks, an AI-powered platform that automates IT and HR support, most executives said that non-technical employees are playing a bigger role in driving AI use, and that 78% have seen successful AI projects originate directly from support staff looking to solve daily challenges.\n\nThe National Cybersecurity Alliance also wrote in its Annual Cybersecurity Attitudes and Behaviors Report that AI adoption has surged to 65% globally as of the end of 2025, but more than half of these AI users never received any training in privacy and security risks. The report surveyed over 6,500 workers worldwide.\n\n\"A few years ago, most businesses were still debating whether AI was something they really needed,\" Louis Riat-Bonello of Optisearch, an AI-powered marketing platform that specializes in SEO, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The businesses getting the best results aren't blindly chasing automation. They're using AI to support smarter decisions, move faster, and free up teams to focus on strategy and creativity,\" Riat-Bonello added. \"That balance is what will matter long after the hype fades.\"\n\nYanisse said that in the age of AI, the company is looking for creative and adaptable people, because while AI will eliminate some roles, it will create others.\n\n\"We are constantly training and helping people update their skills and careers,\" said Yanisse. \"The job of the product designer and the job of the marketer are all completely shifting right now.\"\n\n\"We're over 900 people, so we're not a small startup, but I'm a startup guy, and I'm a builder,\" Yanisse added. \"The people who come here need to be OK with uncertainty, be self-driven, adaptable, flexible, willing to do new things, and solve new problems without too much guidance or structure.\"",

    "description": "Here’s how you can watch today’s ACC matchup between the Hokies and Wolfpack.",
    "fullText": "After a much-needed week off, the Virginia Tech Hokies (16-7, 5-5) are back on the hardwood for a noon tipoff Saturday in Raleigh against the North Carolina State Wolfpack (17-6, 8-2). This game kicks off a critical stretch for the Hokies, who will face the Wolfpack on Saturday, followed by games against No. 20 Clemson, Florida State and Miami over the next 10 days. Clemson, N.C. State and Miami are all ahead of the Hokies in the ACC standings.\n\nThe Wolfpack are not yet a lock for the NCAA Tournament, but are trending in that direction. They’ve won five in a row and seven of their last eight games, with their most impressive wins coming against Clemson and SMU.\n\nN.C. State features a balanced offense with at least four players averaging 13 points per game. Senior forward Derrion Williams leads the Pack, averaging 15 per game. The Wolfpack’s top interior scorer is senior Van-Allen Lubin, while the trio of Paul McNeil Jr., Quadir Copeland and Tre Holloman make up an impressive backcourt.\n\nWe learned some unfortunate news on Thursday when Virginia Tech head coach Mike Young said sophomore guard Tyler Johnson would be out again for the Hokies on Saturday. Last weekend, Young was optimistic that Johnson would play against the Wolfpack. Unfortunately, Young said he wasn’t quite ready, but he is on track to return soon in Tech’s current stretch of games.\n\nJunior forward Amani Hansberry leads the Hokies in scoring at 15 points per game, while sophomore guard Ben Hammond (12.8), freshman Neoklis Avdalas (12.5), Tobi Lawal (11.1) and Jailen Bedford (11.0) are all scoring in double figures. Junior guard Jaden Schutt averages almost nine points per game off the bench. Johnson averages 10 points and five rebounds per game, but has missed the last 10 games.\n\nA key for the Hokies is preventing the Wolfpack from taking uncontested 3-pointers. N.C. State is 11th in college basketball in 3-pointers made per game and shoots 40.1% from beyond the arc, which ranks 7th nationally.\n\nHere’s how you can watch Saturday’s game:\n\nWhen: Saturday, February 7, 2026\n\nWhere: Lenovo Center, Raleigh, North Carolina\n\nAnnouncers: Tom Werme and John Henson\n\nRadio: Virginia Tech Sports Network Radio. You can find a list of affiliates here.\n\nBetting odds: The Wolfpack are a 10.5-point favorite, according to FanDuel.",

    "description": "Big Tech's capital expenditures soar with Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft at the forefront, ushering a new era of AI infrastructure spending.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech is taking the AI age to a whole new level.\n\nWhen Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta announced earnings recently, one set of numbers stole the show: The massive projections for data center spending this year.\n\nThough the industry's capital expenditures — spending on property and equipment — have ramped up in recent years, 2026 is shaping up to be leaps and bounds ahead of any private-sector infrastructure spending in modern history.\n\nThe projections draw comparisons to previous transformational eras, such as the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the Information Age of the 1990s.\n\nStill, Wall Street questions whether it will bring a return on investment — and investors are starting to get antsy. Shares of Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta were all down as of Friday morning. Microsoft was slightly up.\n\n\"Investors needed more than promises to underwrite this story,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote Thursday in a research note following Amazon's earnings call.\n\nAmazon said Thursday it is planning $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, a more than 50% increase from 2025 and the largest estimated budget among Big Tech companies.\n\nThe forecast came in $50 billion above analysts' expectations, and they were less than impressed — despite Amazon's 14% revenue growth for the quarter compared with the same period last year.\n\nThe company's stock dropped as much as 10% after the bell on Thursday, and was down 8% on Friday morning.\n\nWith spending this extreme, a beat on earnings should be \"table-stakes,\" Bernstein's Shmulik wrote Thursday night in a research note that dripped with sarcasm.\n\n\"If we're going to peg the share price to 2026 CapEx, maybe Amazon should have guided even higher, Shmulik wrote. \"Why not at this point?\"\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet stunned investors on Wednesday when it said it is planning $175 billion to $185 billion in capex for 2026, doubling its budget for the second year in a row.\n\nGoogle, which trails behind Amazon and Microsoft in cloud services, has dramatically increased its spending as demand for its Gemini AI models grows. Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users, the company said on its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nGoogle's stock was down about 2% Friday morning as investors digested Big Tech's big spending plans for 2026.\n\nOne thing Google has going for it is the growing enthusiasm for Gemini.\n\n\"We believe these investments are rational, given its fast-growing backlog, supporting our view that Alphabet is among the best positioned to emerge as one of the leading, if not the leading, AI platform,\" BNP Paribas analyst Nick Jones wrote Thursday in a research note.\n\nLike its Big Tech peers, Meta will up the ante on AI investment in 2026. It was the only company that seemed to get a pass from investors this earnings season — at first, that is.\n\nMeta said last week it is planning $115 billion to $135 billion in capex, close to doubling its spend from last year. Meta's stock surged 8% on January 29, the morning after its fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors were pleased with the social media giant's strong advertising business, which reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue that quarter. What's more, it saw gains from its advertising AI tools.\n\nSince then, enthusiasm has waned, and the stock has been on a downward slope this week.\n\nMicrosoft reported $37.5 billion in capex for the second quarter of its fiscal 2026. While the company hasn't released full-year capex guidance, S&P last week estimated the figure could be around $97.7 billion, with some analysts projecting slightly more.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business heavily depends on OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker represents 45% of its backlog, meaning Microsoft's future cloud revenue largely depends on it. The company's stock fell 12% on January 29, the morning after it reported earnings last week — Microsoft's biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nInvestors seemed pleased with the 17% jump in total revenue, including a 39% spike in revenue from Azure and other cloud services.",

    "fullText": "Technology has dramatically changed the beverage market.\n\n\"About 30% of milk was still delivered to homes in the 1960s,\" according to USDA agricultural surveys, and prior to that, had been the most common way consumers got their milk, Food52 reported.\n\nIt was actually the growth of supermarkets and the prevalence of car ownership that ultimately made the milk man irrelevant.\n\nShipping and storage technology has also changed the beverage market.\n\nJuice concentrates, for example, were created for a logical reason.\n\n\"Frozen concentrated orange juice was invented in Florida in the 1940s, primarily as a way to provide juice for the military, readily storable and easy to ship. But frozen juice has been losing favor for years,\" the Wall Street Journal reported in 2015.\n\nNow, Coca-Cola has dealt another blow to the struggling market for juice concentrates.\n\nNot-from-concentrate orange juice surpassed the concentrated orange-juice market in the 1980s, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing data from Nielsen.\n\nCoca-Cola's Minute Maid brand, however, has continued to make concentrated orange juice and lemonade in a variety of flavors including raspberry lemonade, pink lemonade, and limeade.\n\nThe beverage giant has decided to discontinue Minute Maid’s frozen canned orange juices and lemonades after 80 years as consumer demand declines.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n\"Minute Maid frozen products will be discontinued in North America in the first quarter of 2026, with in-store inventory available when supplies last,\" a Coca-Cola spokesperson told Food Dive.\n\n“With the juice category growing strongly, we’re focusing on products that better match what our consumers want,” the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Juice concentrate is a thick liquid made by removing the water content from fruit juice. This process involves heating the juice to evaporate the water, leaving behind a concentrated form of the juice's flavor and nutrients. It is like making fruit juice more potent by taking out most of the water,\" according to Business Research Insights.\n\nIt can be stored for longer than fresh juice, and while demand has slipped in U.S. homes, it's still used by manufacturers, and the global market is growing.\n\nThe global juice concentrates market is projected to grow from about $83.9 billion in 2025 to nearly $134.1 billion by 2035, reflecting strong long‑term expansion driven by beverage demand worldwide.\n\nIn the broader fruit concentrate segment, the market is valued at roughly $20.95 billion in 2025 and expected to reach around $36.96 billion by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 5.8%.\n\nOther forecasts show the juice concentrates industry growing from about $67.6 billion in 2025 to an estimated $94.6 billion by 2030, with CAGR near 7%, highlighting rising demand for natural and functional beverage ingredients.\n\nNorth America dominates with nearly 35% market share due to strong demand, advanced infrastructure, and abundant agricultural resources.\n\nOrange juice from concentrate was something my parents always had in my childhood home in the 1980s, though I never actually drank it. Back then, it felt like a household staple, even if it didn’t end up in my glass.\n\nSjors Peters, global innovation marketing leader for beverages at IFF, believes that consumer perceptions around taste, naturality, and health have continued to drive demand for Not From Concentrate (NFC) over Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice (FCOJ), Food Ingredients First reported.\n\n“The preference for NFC juice over FCOJ has also been accentuated by the lack of carryover from previous crops. One effect of higher NFC production has been a drastic reduction in the availability of orange essence oil,” he says.\n\nBack in 2020, Coca-Cola slashed its beverage lineup, killing a number of well-known brands including TaB, its original diet soda product. It also killed the Odwalla juice line, and Zico, a coconut water brand.\n\n\"Reducing the portfolio will allow Coca-Cola to focus on its most profitable offerings, the company explained. Those include its core products like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar as well as brands that fit into trendy new categories, like Topo Chico hard seltzer and AHA, a caffeinated seltzer the company launched last year,\" CNN Business reported at the time.\n\nDuring that culling, Coca-Cola stopped making approximately 200 different beverages. The company explained the decision at the time.\n\n\"The company continues to pursue its beverages for life ambition by calibrating a portfolio with an optimal set of global, regional and local brands with the strongest potential to grow their consumer bases, increase frequency and drive system margins. The company expects to offer a portfolio of approximately 200 master brands, an approximate 50% reduction from the current number,\" it shared in a press release.\n\nSince then, Coca-Cola has not had a widespread purge of brands, but it has made regular cuts when a product or product line did not meet performance expectations.",

    "fullText": "A CORUNA, Spain, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Around a third of countries attending a military AI summit agreed on Thursday to a a declaration ​on how to govern deployment of the technology in warfare, but military ‌heavyweights China and the U.S. opted out.\n\nTensions in relations between the United States and European allies, and uncertainty ‌over how transatlantic ties will look in coming months and years, made some countries hesitant to sign joint agreements, several attendees and delegates said.\n\nThe pledge underscores growing concern among some governments that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could outpace rules around its military use, raising the ⁠risk of accidents, miscalculation or ‌unintended escalation.\n\nGovernments are facing a \"prisoner's dilemma\", caught between putting responsible restrictions in place and not wanting to limit themselves in comparison with adversaries, ‍said Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans.\n\n\"Russia and China are moving very fast. That creates urgency to make progress in developing AI. But seeing it going fast also increases the urgency to keep ​working on its responsible use. The two go hand-in-hand,\" he said in comments to ‌Reuters.\n\nOnly 35 countries out of 85 attending the Responsible AI in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit in A Coruna, Spain, on signed a commitment to 20 principles on AI on Thursday.\n\nThese included affirming human responsibility over AI-powered weapons, encouraging clear chains of command and control, and sharing information on national oversight arrangements \"where consistent with national security\".\n\nThe document also outlined the ⁠importance of risk assessments, robust testing and training ​and education for personnel operating military AI capabilities.\n\nAt two ​prior military AI summits in The Hague and Seoul in 2023 and 2024 respectively, around 60 nations, excluding China but including the United States, ‍endorsed a modest \"blueprint ⁠for action\" without legal commitment.\n\nWhile this year's document was also non-binding, some were still uncomfortable with the idea of endorsing more concrete policies, said Yasmin Afina, a ⁠researcher at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, an adviser on the process.\n\nMajor signatories on Thursday included ‌Canada, Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, South Korea and Ukraine.",

    "fullText": "After days of heavy selling, investors look like they're in buy-the-dip mode.\n\nUS stocks rallied hard on Friday, with traders trying to cap off a week of heavy losses in the tech sector and in software stocks on a high note.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF — which entered a bear market earlier this month as investors panicked over high valuations and AI's potential threat to software companies — surged 3%. The ETF is still down around 30% from its peak late last year.\n\nMajor indexes soared. The Dow advanced more than 1,000 points. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2% as tech stocks rose across the board. The index also soared despite Amazon shares plummeting after the tech giant reported Q4 earnings on Thursday.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around 1 p.m. ET on Friday:\n\nInvestors were also eager to jump back into other areas of the market that logged heavy losses this week. Bitcoin surged 13% after testing the $60,000 mark late Thursday. It's still down 9% since Monday.\n\nOther areas continued to struggle. Silver, which stabilized after a historic plunge last week, dropped as much as 1 before paring some of its losses%.\n\nHere were some of the most notable moves across the software and tech space.\n\nTraders are taking the recent decline in tech as an opportunity to buy the dip, a winning strategy that has persisted for the last several years, Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told Business Insider.\n\n\"People are coming in again, and whether it'll be successful in the future, nobody knows.

    "title": "Inside the Milan Olympic Village: Real beds, free tech and other athlete perks",
    "description": "The Olympic Village in Milan offers plenty of perks and amenities for athletes, including free food, stress plants and beds that are not made of cardboard.",
    "fullText": "The Olympic Village rises above the security fences that surround it, a collection of structures both temporary and permanent where the athletes will reside over the next two-plus weeks at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nOut on the sidewalk and behind barriers, lookie-loos crane their necks for a peek at the competitors, while pin traders mill through the churning crowd in hopes of making a souvenir swap.\n\nBut what’s it like inside the Village, where the medal hopefuls work out, mingle and relax before some of the biggest moments of their young lives?\n\n“The best part is the food,” said Micah Moore, bobsledder from Trinidad and Tobago, echoing what people have said for centuries about Italy. “Nutrition is so important. And everything you see is free.”\n\nAh, yes, gratis. That’s a common theme in the Olympic Village, where corporate sponsors of the Games have gotten creative with their free goods and services — and swag bags — for the athletes.\n\nThere are multiple rooms devoted to gaming, with virtual-reality glasses over here, and “Call of Duty” over there, and overstuffed chairs and couches everywhere. There are the typical role-playing video games, along with virtual tennis and dirtbike riding, but conspicuously absent are any winter sports. Organizers explain the rooms are meant to be an escape from that all-encompassing world.\n\nSpeaking of escapes, Corona Cero — the non-alcoholic version of that beer — has constructed a pair of round, glass-roofed wooden structures that feel like part-ski lodge, part-yurt and are filled with plants and comfortable seats and soft music where the athletes can kick back with a chilled beverage. (It has been mild weather for a Milan winter.)\n\nThere are rolled-up yoga mats in the corner, and a chalkboard outside lists times for a breathwork class with Sarah, a soundbath session with Guilia, and restorative yoga and meditation in the afternoon.\n\nNot far away, and made of similar wood, is a wagon labeled the Cero (“zero”) Stress Plant Shop. There, an athlete can adopt a houseplant for the duration of his or her stay, nurturing it for a couple weeks before it’s donated to a local charity, perhaps for auction. The competitor is given a pack of seeds upon departure to grow the same plant at home.\n\nFour-time Olympian Madison Chock said she was “pleasantly surprised” the competitors could foster plants. She said the plant that she shares with husband/ice dance partner Evan Bates is named “Stenry,” a combination of their dogs’ names, Stella and Henry. She said the plant is thriving, although she doesn’t know the variety, only that it’s dangly and has leaves that cascade down like a waterfall.\n\nOf course, sitting around and watching plants grow can get a little dull. This week, the arriving athletes seemed more interested in getting accustomed to their free Samsung phones and using their own hand gestures to direct a robotic hand behind glass to pick up a plastic ball encasing a mystery Olympic pin. The AI demonstration by Alibaba Cloud is a futuristic version of those arcade games where you maneuver a metal claw to grab a stuffed animal.\n\nThe Olympics is filled with young, beautiful athletes, so it’s no wonder two of the more popular pop-ups in the Village provide skin and haircare products and services. KIKO Milano has cosmetic stations where athletes can schedule makeup appointments — very popular before the Opening Ceremonies — and Procter & Gamble has built a “Champions Clubhouse” for scalp massages, hair washing and styling, along with barbers for personalized shaving and beard care.\n\nThere are P&G swag bags of course — some athletes arrived without any toiletries — and KIKO engraves complimentary tubes of lipstick with the names of competitors.\n\nCoca-Cola takes that engraving process a step further with a machine that snaps a photo of the user, then embosses that picture onto the iconic red can of soda.\n\nBeyond the keepsakes, the Olympic organizers have gotten an essential right in the Village. Gone are the flimsy cardboard bedframes of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, held during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere was speculation at the time that those beds were designed to discourage casual sex among the competitors because the frames would break apart at the slightest provocation. Organizers brushed off those rumors, heralding the beds as sturdy and eco-friendly.\n\nRegardless, when she arrived at this year’s Olympic Village, Britain figure skater Phebe Bekker posted a Tik-Tok video from her room that answered a popular question among the athletes, many of whom found the cardboard beds uncomfortable.\n\n“We’re looking good,” she said, knocking on her wooden bedframe and testing the mattress. “Heard it here first, there are no cardboard beds, as far as I know.”\n\nJust like the slogan of that popular soft drink. It’s the real thing.\n\nStaff writer Thuc Nhi Nguyen contributed to this report.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",
