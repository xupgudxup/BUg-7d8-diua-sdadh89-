A rotation into other parts of the market that began at the start of the year accelerated in Tuesday's session.\n\nWhile many of the top tech and AI names in the S&P 500, stocks in other sectors jumped as investors looked for better deals.

US oil prices were also up 2% to about $63.50 a barrel.\n\nThe major indexes sank into the red in the early afternoon, but pared the deepest losses.

    "fullText": "New US-owned app struggled with a storm and was accused of blocking content critical of Trump – can it recover?\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m Blake Montgomery, writing to you from Doha, where I’m moderating panels about AI and investing as part of the Web Summit Qatar.\n\nI want to bring your attention to the impact of a Guardian story. In December, we published a story, “‘A black hole’: families and police say tech giants delay investigations in child abuse and drug cases”, about grieving families and law enforcement officers who say that Meta and Snapchat have slowed down criminal investigations. (The tech companies contend that they cooperate.) This month, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to compel social media platforms to respond to warrants in 72 hours.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life. It endured a major outage that stifled users’ ability to upload videos, which fueled a fierce user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an ascendant competitor and an inquiry by the California governor.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The day after the deal closed, its new owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed, the US weathered a fearsome winter storm and the killing of an American citizen by federal immigration agents. Both knocked TikTok off its feet.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on. The app suffered severe outages as a result. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings. Many of those same users cried censorship as they tried to express their outrage over Alex Pretti’s death via TikTok and found they could not. Prominent personalities said they would leave the app.\n\nAfter days of outcry, TikTok issued a statement ascribing the problems to the snow, ice and cold. That did not stop California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, from announcing the next day that his office would investigate the app’s alleged suppression of content critical of Donald Trump.\n\nTikTok’s late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. Upscrolled’s founder said in a conversation at the Web Summit Qatar that the app now boasts more than 2.5 million users.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well, though.\n\nElon Musk had more extensive ties to Epstein than previously known, emails show\n\nTesla discontinues Model X and S vehicles as Elon Musk pivots to robotics\n\nTwo dramas, both showing in New York, are highlighting how our collective anxieties about technology have shifted in the decade between their premieres.\n\nMarjorie Prime, now revived on Broadway but first staged in 2014, follows Tess (Cynthia Nixon), as she deals with the ageing, death and robotic recreation of her mother (June Squibb). The world of the play features “Primes”, android lookalikes of real people that attempt to emulate them for the comfort of those left behind, which Tess and her mother both engage with. Picture an Alexa, but it’s your dead husband, grandmother, etc. The play brings to mind the early worries about Siri, which debuted three years before the play. Since then, we’ve seen our own real-life versions of Primes: millions of people have digitally copied their deceased loved ones to varying degrees of uncanniness and success. Though its predictions are no longer far-fetched, the play remains moving. I found it touching.\n\nData, which premiered off Broadway last week, follows the talented young programmer Maneesh (Karan Brar) after he joins Athena Technologies, a clear analogue for the very real company Palantir. Maneesh is inducted into the company’s most elite team, data analytics, where he learns about clandestine work with the US government. He struggles with the ethics of the project. He wrestles with whether to expose it to the world in hopes of tanking it or keeping his head down. The play’s themes are quite familiar. They were playing out in headlines two days before I attended, and the Guardian has published stories about them.\n\nData is paced and plotted like a political thriller, more like House of Cards than Her. Seeing the two plays within a week of each other, I was struck by how much our concerns with tech have moved from the realm of science fiction into that of realism. Marjorie Prime is less literally concerned with tech, more with its emotional consequences. Data is about what it means to literally work as a software engineer. It seems unlikely to me that a play about the ethics of software in US bureaucracy could have sustained any tension in an era before this one.\n\nMarjorie Prime imagines a melancholy future; Data chronicles a version of the unpleasant present. The very real events of the previous year and Silicon Valley’s entanglement with the Trump administration loom over Data, for better and for worse. The play could not be more timely; it may feel dated by the end of year. Watching it felt like reading a yarn in the Wall Street Journal (or the Guardian, if I’m flattering myself).\n\nI am curious to observe which play ages better. Data serves as a real-time, red-hot record of our current moment, which may cool quickly. During the play, I was intrigued by some of its villains’ seemingly nefarious arguments in favor of the company’s work. What if the main character exposes the evil in the press and nothing happens, as his boss says? I have been part of multiple news cycles where that has been the case. What will plucky 22-year-old Maneesh do then? The question presents a more interesting, nuanced response to reality than Maneesh’s black-and-white, do-or-die plan to blow things up. By contrast, Marjorie Prime’s sentient artificial intelligence acts as a vehicle to discuss the age-old grief of a parent’s death and its aftermath.\n\nThe central question that both plays ask is not, in the end, one explicitly about technology, but about how to keep living beneath crushing weight. In Marjorie Prime, Tess struggles with the repetitiveness of her days and the robotic, constant reminder of her mother. She eventually succumbs to her despair, replaced by a robot herself, which torments her grieving husband with its pale simulation. In Data’s final, devastating scene, the secondary hero, Riley (Sophia Lillis, who gives the play’s best performance), asks how she can just go back to work, plagued as she is by moral concerns but trapped by monetary need, after failing to stop the company’s work. She trembles as her phone beeps, reminding her she’s late for her next meeting.\n\nWhat is Moltbook?

    "fullText": "CEO Alex Karp hails ‘iconic’ financial results despite criticism over contracts with ICE and homeland security\n\nPalantir celebrated its latest financial results on Monday, as the tech company blew past Wall Street expectations and continues to prop up the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants.\n\nPalantir has secured millions of dollars in federal contracts amid Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. The multibillion-dollar Denver-based firm creates tech focused on surveillance and analytics, to be used by the government agencies and private companies.\n\nPalantir’s biggest US customer is the Department of Defense; it also works with the Department of Homeland Security, and the majority of its revenue comes from deals with the federal government. Palantir reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m.\n\nPalantir has drawn further criticism over its role in the government’s immigration agenda, since federal immigration officers killed two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nPalantir chief executive Alex Karp told CNBC in an interview Monday that Palantir helps protect sensitive data. “If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir,” he said. “Our product, actually, in its core, requires people to conform with fourth amendment data protection.”\n\nThe company beat Wall Street expectations of $1.33bn with $1.41bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025. It reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.25 – which also surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.23 in EPS. The company’s stocks jumped about 8% in after-hours trading after the release.\n\nKarp described the company’s growth on an earnings call as “one of the truly iconic performances in the history of corporate performance”. He wrote in a letter accompanying the earnings report that the $1.4bn in revenue generated in last year’s fourth quarter marks a new record – a 70% growth rate over the same period the year before.\n\n“We did this while supporting, in critical manner, some of the most interesting intricate, unusual, operations that the US government has been involved in – many of which we can’t comment on – but were the highlight of last year and highly motivating to all of us at Palantir,” Karp said.\n\nKarp doubled down on his data protection claim on the call, arguing that Palantir’s work with the US government, including intelligence agencies, aligns with the fourth amendment and makes sure “every institution that uses (Palantir’s) products is doing it within conformity of the law and ethics of America”.\n\nData privacy advocates are not convinced. “Palantir tools are ICE’s digital henchmen,” said Will Owen, communications director at the non-profit, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, in a statement to the Guardian. “Their revenue may be up thanks to Trump, but no one is buying that they hold ICE accountable.”\n\nLast year, ICE awarded Palantir a nearly $30m contract to build ImmigrationOS, which makes it easier to pull information about immigrants from across government databases – regardless of the accuracy of those records. 404 Media recently reported on the existence of another tool created by Palantir for the federal government: Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (Elite).\n\nElite “populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a ‘confidence score’ on the person’s current address”, according to 404 Media. The program reportedly relies on address data from the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes Medicaid.\n\nWired reported last week that the federal government has been using Palantir’s AI tools to process immigration enforcement tips. Wired also reported that the health department has been using other Palantir AI tools to screen grants and job descriptions for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and “gender ideology”.\n\nPalantir has said there is no malicious intent in its work with the federal government.\n\n“To be absolutely clear, Palantir is not working on any master database project to unify databases across federal agencies,” read a company blogpost last week. “Palantir has not proposed the US government build a ‘master list’ for the surveillance of citizens, nor have we been asked to consider building such a system for any customer.”\n\nPalantir has described 404 Media’s claims about the Elite tool as misleading; the company says it is “used for prioritized enforcement to surface the likely addresses of specific individuals, such as those with final orders of removal or with high severity criminal charges”.\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” awarded DHS and ICE huge budgets to pursue the administration’s anti-immigrant policies, including $45bn for ICE to expand its detention capabilities.\n\nIn 2025, Palantir’s federal contracts almost doubled – and increased to more than $970m; this amount was distributed across the government, mostly to the defense department, but it also includes the DHS.",

    "fullText": "Minister announces Microsoft, Cisco and Adobe to help apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses\n\nIn 2002 Barnsley toyed with a redesign as a Tuscan hill village as it sought out a brighter post-industrial future. In 2021 it adopted the airily vague slogan “the place of possibilities”. Now it is trying a different image: Britain’s first “tech town”.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, has anointed the South Yorkshire community as a trailblazer for “how AI can improve everyday life” in the UK.\n\nIn the latest move in Labour’s drive to inject AI into Britain’s bloodstream, the government has announced four US tech companies – Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Adobe – have agreed to help as the council pushes to apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses in Barnsley, an area of South Yorkshire which has struggled with unemployment and deprivation since the coal pits closed.\n\nThe town and its 250,000 people have been chosen because they have already adopted AI faster than many places, said Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley metropolitan borough council. His authority has been using AI assistants for the last couple of years in adult social care and children’s services, and its bin lorries have been enabled with tech to scan roads for potholes. The parcel company Evri, which has one of its largest distribution hubs in the town, has been trialling robot dogs for deliveries.\n\nBut local opposition leaders have warned rebranding Barnsley as a tech town “might seem a bit of a leap” and highlighted local anxiety about whether AI is a force for good.\n\nThe “tech town” status means residents will get free AI and digital training, businesses will be supported to adopt AI, the hospital will test AI tools for check-ins, triage and outpatient care and AI will be tested in schools and at Barnsley College, all in an effort to improve pupils’ results and teachers’ workloads.\n\n“The economic basis of Barnsley was destroyed 30 years ago,” Houghton said. “This is the biggest opportunity we have had since then. The future of the economy is going to be in technology and for Barnsley to be at the centre of that is an incredible opportunity.”\n\nBut one area of uncertainty is the role of the tech companies. Houghton said: “The council won’t be paying them. Whether the government is, we have to wait and see.”\n\nMicrosoft already has a relationship with Barnsley College and, along with Google and Cisco, is understood to be working on a pro bono basis.\n\n“If we are going to get AI to work for Britain, we need Britons and British public services that can work with AI,” Kendall said. “If we can show that AI helps young people learn, supports local businesses to be more productive, and improves public services, then we can show what’s possible for the whole country. What we learn here will shape how we roll out AI across the UK.”\n\nMinisters have faced criticism over their handling of big technology companies. Last week the government launched a national AI training programme to upskill 10 million citizens, but many of the online courses turned out to be bespoke training for customers of particular companies such as Google, others cost as much as £525 to complete and some simply promoted the merits of particular company’s approaches to AI such as one explaining Microsoft’s “responsible AI approach”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said hundreds of courses on the AI Skills Hub are free and where payment is required it is clearly advertised. “All courses are reviewed against a common set of criteria to ensure they are relevant, high quality, and delivered by eligible organisations,” they said.\n\nMinisters have also been challenged for holding meetings with tech bosses at the rate of more than once each working day. The government insists engagement is vital to create growth and transform services.\n\n“It’s not about giving tech companies access to data they shouldn’t be having,” Houghton said. “It’s a secure programme and we are not leaving ourselves open. But this stuff is not going away. We have to make sure we are smart enough to protect people while taking advantage of the positive stuff it brings.”\n\nHannah Kitching, the leader of the council’s Liberal Democrat opposition, said investment in the town was welcome but “there is a lot of anxiety among people about the use of AI and whether it is a force for good. We know it could be but there are darker sides as well.”\n\n“[Barnsley] is still really connected to its mining past,” she said. “Younger people see the jobs and opportunities around the tech town idea but older generations perhaps don’t. There is a job to be done to get people onboard.”\n\nResidents “want the council to get the basics right”, she said. Roads were “absolutely crumbling” and in bad weather bins did not get collected, she added.",

Through an all-in-one platform deeply embedded within the criminal justice system, we recruit, train, and place justice-impacted individuals into life-changing careers.\n\nOur vision is to become the country’s unified workforce development system, replacing disconnected brick-and-mortar job centers with one integrated, tech-powered solution that meets low-income individuals exactly where they are. Today, the federal government spends billions annually on education and training programs, yet only about 70% of participants graduate, just 38.6% secure training-related employment, and average first-year earnings hover around $34,708.\n\nBefore Emerge, our founders Zo and Gabe co-founded Ameelio, an award-winning tech nonprofit that is dismantling the prison communication duopoly. Backed by tech luminaries like Reid Hoffman, Vinod Khosla, and Jack Dorsey, and by major criminal-justice philanthropies such as Arnold Ventures and the Mellon Foundation, Ameelio became a recognized leader in the space. Because of this experience both Zo and Gabe understood what it took to create change from within the system. After serving over 1M people impacted by incarceration, they witnessed firsthand the gap in second-chance opportunities and the chronic unemployment plaguing those impacted by the justice system. Emerge Career is committed to solving this issue.\n\nOur students are at the heart of our work. Their journeys have captured national attention on CBS, NBC, and in The Boston Globe, and our programs now serve entire states and cities. And we’re not doing it alone: our vision has attracted support from Alexis Ohanian (776),  Michael Seibel, Y Combinator, the Opportunity Fund, and public figures like Diana Taurasi, Deandre Ayton, and Marshawn Lynch. All of us believe that, with the right mix of technology and hands-on practice, we can redefine workforce development and deliver true second chances at scale.\n\nEmerge Career was designed to tackle two systemic issues: recidivism, fueled by post-incarceration unemployment and poverty, and labor shortages in key industries. Over 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed a year after incarceration, seeking work but not finding it. The reality is shocking, workforce development programs are severely limited inside prison, with only one-third of incarcerated people ever participating. To worsen, the available prison jobs offer meager wages, often less than $1 per hour, and often do not equip individuals with the skills for long-term stable employment.\n\nWe call this a Founding Design Engineer role, even three years in and with multiple contracts under our belt, for two reasons. First, you'll be our very first engineer, joining our co-founder, who's built the entire platform solo to date. Second, our growth is now outpacing our systems, and we can't keep up on maintenance alone. We're at a critical juncture: we can either hire someone to simply care for what exists, or we can bring on a talent who believes that, with the right blend of technology and hands-on practice, we can unify the workforce-development system and deliver second chances at true scale. We hope that can be you.\n\nThis is not a traditional engineering job. You'll build features in React and TypeScript, but your real job is helping students finish. That means understanding the human problem first: why do people disengage? What makes someone choose to keep going when the payoff is months away? You'll answer those questions through direct conversations, usability research, and watching how people actually use what you build. Then you'll prototype fast, ship real software, and measure whether it worked. Some days that looks like code. Other days it looks like a phone call, a support ticket, or a whiteboard session figuring out how to turn a one-off fix into a system that scales.\n\nThis role blends engineering, product, design, and program operations. We're looking for someone who believes good design can inspire a person to invest in their own future, and who wants to prove it, week after week, by shipping work that measurably helps students succeed. If you want to be close to users, own outcomes end to end, and build something that actually matters, you'll thrive here.\n\nYou design by building. You don't hand off mockups and wait. You open Cursor, Claude Code, or whatever gets you closest to a real, testable thing fastest. You might already be shipping code in production — or you're itching to. You believe the fastest path to a great design is putting something real in front of a real user and watching what happens.\n\nYou are relentlessly scrappy. You prototype in hours, not weeks. You'd rather test an ugly thing that teaches you something than polish a beautiful thing nobody's used yet. You know that at this stage, speed of learning is the only thing that matters. Fidelity comes later. Signal comes first.\n\nYou refuse to be blocked. When engineering bandwidth isn't there, you don't sit around. You figure it out — a Figma prototype, a coded prototype, a quick hack in the codebase. You treat \"waiting for a developer\" as a personal failure. You find a way or you make one.\n\nYou think in outcomes, not outputs. You don't measure your work in screens delivered. You measure it in whether students finished, whether they came back, whether the thing you shipped actually moved a number that matters. You're obsessed with the gap between what you designed and what actually happened.\n\nYou talk to users constantly. Not in scheduled quarterly research sprints — in real conversations, every week. You build relationships with students. You know their names, their blockers, their moments of doubt. Your best design ideas come from a 10-minute phone call, not a brainstorm.\n\nYou have strong taste but low ego. You have opinions about what good looks like and you'll fight for them. But when the data says you're wrong, you move on fast. You don't fall in love with your work. You fall in love with the problem.\n\nYou believe everyone deserves a second chance. You treat everyone with dignity. You know how to meet people exactly where they are — with empathy and compassion — helping create a space where everyone feels seen and valued, regardless of their background.\n\nYou work hard. You show up early, stay late, and do what needs to get done — no ego, no excuses. This isn't a 9-to-5. The team puts in 10+ hour days because we care about the mission and each other. If that sounds miserable, this isn't for you. If it sounds exciting, you'll fit right in.\n\nTalking to students — a lot. Your week starts and ends with users. You'll build real relationships with students, not just run usability sessions. You'll understand why someone almost quit, what message made them log back in, what screen confused them at 11pm. These conversations are your primary design tool.\n\nPrototyping at the speed of conversation. You hear a problem on a call Tuesday. By Wednesday you have something testable — a coded prototype, a functional hack, a Figma flow wired to real data. By Thursday a student is using it. By Friday you know if it worked. That's the cycle. Repeat.\n\nShipping real product, not just designs. You'll work in our React and TypeScript codebase — or use AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code to get there. The goal isn't to become a full-time engineer. The goal is to never let \"it hasn't been built yet\" slow down learning. Some of what you build will go straight to production. Some will be throwaway prototypes. You'll know the difference.\n\nDesigning the moments that keep students going. The hardest design problem here isn't layout or typography. It's commitment. Students are betting months of effort on a future they have to imagine. You'll study where they disengage, what triggers doubt, and what reignites momentum. Then you'll design the moments — an interface, a message, a milestone — that help someone choose to keep going. How do you make a better life in three months feel worth the sacrifice today? You'll own that problem.\n\nMeasuring what matters. Polished decks don't matter here. You'll define success metrics for what you ship, track whether completion rates moved, whether more students hit the next milestone, whether the intervention you designed actually intervened. You'll close the loop between design and outcome every time.\n\nWorking across the entire stack of the student experience. Some days that looks like interface design. Other days it looks like rethinking a Customer.io campaign, redesigning an onboarding flow, or sitting with the ops team to understand why students in one facility disengage faster than another. You go where the problem is.\n\nDocumenting your work clearly. Our work spans months and involves multiple teams. You'll create visibility when a change impacts operations and help others understand how features affect training and service delivery. Precision matters.",

    "description": "The rise of slopaganda is fueling a surprising tech hiring boom.",
    "fullText": "In the generative AI boom, vibe coding and AI expertise have become in-demand résumé skills. But tech companies are also looking to pay a premium for expertise in people who have a skill that predates AI: the art of communication.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz launched its New Media team last year to help founders learn what they \"need to win the narrative battle online.\" Adobe is looking for an \"AI evangelist\" to lead the company's \"artificial intelligence storytelling.\" Netflix, a company that sells stories to your living room, recently posted a director of product and technology communications role with a salary range of up to $775,000. Microsoft began publishing a print magazine, Signal, last year, calling it an \"antidote to the ephemeral nature of digital.\" Anthropic tripled the size of its communications team last year, growing to about 80 people and is still hiring five more, each offering salaries of around $200,000 or higher. OpenAI has several open communications jobs boasting salary listings of more than $400,000. The average director of communications in the US makes $106,000, according to Indeed.\n\nThree years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, results have been mixed: Within tech firms, vibe coding is nixing the need for entry-level software developers, while some workers across industries are foisting rapidly generated, verbose, and sloppy AI nonsense onto their colleagues, leading to wasted time and a breakdown of trust. Even Sam Altman said last year that people have started to affect a sort of AI accent when speaking, and now some social platform discourse \"feels very fake.\"\n\nAmid all chatter about gen AI taking jobs, the ease with which gen AI spits out content has ironically revved the demand for human communicators.\n\nBecause AI generates so much content, \"you would think that actually the job of the comms person or the storyteller would be fewer and farther between,\" says Gab Ferree, founder of Off the Record, a community for communications professionals, and former vice president of global communications at Bumble. But that's not what's happening. Tech companies are hiring writers, editors, chief communications officers who work closely with CEOs, and so-called \"storytellers.\" The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the percentage of job postings on LinkedIn mentioning \"storyteller\" doubled between 2024 to 2025.\n\nIn a competitive industry where startups fight to survive and Big Tech rivals campaign for market dominance, a good story is a selling point. One theory behind the push, Ferree says, is \"there's just so much garbage out there that people want to pay a premium for someone who can claim that they can cut through the noise.\"\n\nThe trend of storytelling and lucrative comms jobs has been \"percolating for a while,\" says Jenna Birch, founder of SISU, a communications consultancy for startups and VCs. As Silicon Valley's influence ballooned over the past two decades, tech companies could offer staggering salaries just as more newspapers were bleeding more and more writers. Content marketing became popular, and building a company's brand on social media and surfacing blog posts in Google search results became essential.\n\nMore recently, the role of the comms pro has continued to expand, as they have to understand large language models, company blogs, how to craft a larger narrative to set a company apart from competitors, and how to write in a CEO's voice on LinkedIn and Substack. The number of chief communication officer roles that encompass not just traditional comms duties but also take on another responsibility, like marketing or or human resources, at Fortune 1000 companies grew from 90 in 2019 to 169 in 2024, according to a report from the Observatory on Corporate Reputation. The median pay for a CCO at a Fortune 500 company is now between $400,000 and $450,000, a $50,000 jump from 2023, according to a survey from consultant firm Korn Ferry.\n\nAs the job changes and demand for narrative communications and storytellers rises, the number of communications experts able to work under rapidly evolving conditions and with a wide remit may be small, comms experts tell me, leading companies to offer hefty compensation packages in war for the best talent. A similar trend is unfolding among the few people who are AI experts, driving tech companies to offer astounding salaries to poach top talent from rival firms. While not of the same nine-figure caliber, in their own right, creatives are becoming \"the high value person in tech now,\" Birch says.\n\nFor much of the tech boom, that high-value person was a software developer. Universities and coding bootcamps rushed to fill employment gaps and train up the next generation of tech workers. Young people were told coding would be a path to a lucrative, stable career. As of 2023, the most recent year the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released data for, computer science recent graduates faced an unemployment rate of 6.1%, while communications majors' unemployment rate sat at 4.5%. The number of open job posts for software engineers dropped by more than 60,000 between 2023 and late 2025, according to data from CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry. The best defense against automation, some argue, will be a liberal arts degree.\n\nWords might be easy to generate with AI, but good writing isn't ready for automation.\n\n\"If everyone's a writer, then nobody's a writer, and I think it's very evident right now,\" says Cristin Culver, founder of communications firm Common Thread Communications. LinkedIn is full of posts written by AI in a similar style that makes eyes glaze over as they scroll. \"I think AI is both aiding and making storytelling much harder,\" Culver says. \"Ironically in this era of AI, some of the most poignant storytelling belongs to the people who've realized that everything is sloppified and they've pivoted to very tactical storytelling.\"\n\nAnthropic has been leaning heavily into that tactical, and tactile, storytelling. In the fall, the company created a pop-up Claude Cafe in New York to position the chatbot as a thinking and problem solving partner, marketing the space as one for showing up in person, connecting, and being surrounded by books and magazines over screens (although the company has also destroyed and scanned millions of books to train Claude, which a judge ruled last year was not a copyright violation).\n\n\"Claude is definitely a prominent team member for everyone, but comms people are sort of like BS detectors,\" Sasha de Marigny previously told Axios last May, months before she was promoted from head of communications to become the company's first CCO. \"Critical thinking is still a huge comparative advantage for humans. I'm looking for excellent strategists — people who understand the new world order and know how to develop holistic plans to cut through to the audiences we care about.\" Anthropic declined to speak more about its comms strategy for this story.\n\n\"It's a golden age for people who really enjoy the craft of communications,\" says Steve Clayton, CCO of Cisco, who formerly worked at Microsoft and launched the company's print publication. When he first tried ChatGPT, Clayton says he worried his career was done. He's since become an AI optimist, seeing gen AI as a tool and opportunity for communicators and so-called storytellers to stand out with content that feels authentic content projects that strike people. \"In an environment where nobody's sat at their desk today saying: God, I wish I had more email, or I wish I had more websites I could visit, or I wish I had more podcasts — the challenge is, how do you create something that is worthy of people's time and worthy of their attention?\"\n\nJobs where brands build out their own newsrooms are \"going to be one of the last places where AI is replacing writers,\" says Noah Greenberg, CEO of Stacker, a content distribution company. Unlike traditional media, which relies on clicks, advertising, and subscription to make money off a constant stream of content, \"when brands are investing in the strategy, they're not thinking about: 'Do I break even on an individual piece of content?' They're thinking about: 'How do I create five or 10 really incredible stories every month that get our story out there, that prove and turn us into the authority as a respected party in this space?\"\"\n\nAs with coding and image generation, LLMs are likely to keep getting better. LLMs may write with more voice or sound more human eventually. But the chatbots and agents don't think. They generate creative content without cycling through a creative process. A 2025 Columbia Business School study found LLMs have a bias for \"Option A,\" preferring the first choice when given a list and asked to pick. For people working in comms, AI might be more friend than initially imagined foe — at least because it makes their work stand out.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

XAI was last valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the \"Muskonomy\" – which already includes Tesla, ⁠brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.\n\nThe world's richest man ​has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "title": "New Discovery In Laser Technology Could Change Everything For Quantum Computing",
    "description": "Quantum computing has great potential , but its main unit, the qubit, is beset by inherent stability problems. However, this new study might change that.",
    "fullText": "The idea behind quantum computing has existed for a long while now, with the primary goal being to basically create supercomputers capable of calculating intensive problems almost instantly. While we have yet to see a fully realized quantum computer that comes close to that overall vision, we have seen a lot of progress forward. One big problem that quantum computing has is getting all of the components together in a stable environment and then scaling it up without ruining that stability. The biggest problem here comes in how we approach the scaling of qubits — which are vital to how information and data are processed in quantum computers. However, a new bit of research could help change how we approach that issue by providing an entirely new way to look at scaling qubits effectively.\n\nWhile we have seen promising progress in futuristic quantum computing and algorithms, the overall scalability of quantum computing is still small, and having actual, tangible quantum computers that can solve some of our most demanding problems still feels a long way off. In fact, some research has noted that we'll need quantum computers with several million qubits to have any chance at an early commercial application. So how do we achieve that kind of scalability? Well, some believe that a surface approach might be the answer. But to fully understand how that approach will work, and what it will fix, we have to look at the problem a bit more closer.\n\nJust like a bit is the most basic unit of information in classic computers, the qubit is the most basic unit in quantum computing. It stands for quantum bit, and up until now, researchers have had an incredibly difficult time scaling it up to a point that will make quantum computing more reliable and effective.\n\nThe problem with scaling up the number of qubits needed in a quantum computer is that each physical qubit is especially fragile and susceptible to noise. This means that each of those qubits is prone to errors, and as you add more physical qubits in one place, you're going to see more noise generated around your quantum operations. As such, you'll see more quantum information degrading, and degrading faster — in even as little as microseconds, some speculate.\n\nTo help overcome these noise issues, scientists have come up with a process known as quantum error correction — which essentially aims to add in a new piece to the puzzle called logical qubits, which are intended to filter out the noise and keep the qubits and how they process information under control. However, researchers have seen somewhat limited success in how they can scale up the amount of physical and logical qubits in a quantum computer while still keeping the amount of errors below a certain threshold.\n\nIn a new study from Columbia University, researchers highlighted how they created some of the biggest quantum arrays yet by utilizing a surface approach that combines powerful lasers and optical tweezers to capture single atoms, allowing for \"unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules.\" Furthermore, the success seen in this study comes directly from a new approach to creating the optical tweezer arrays, which the researchers refer to as metasurfaces. These arrays aren't made up of physical tweezers as you might think of them, of course. Instead, they are actually highly focused beams of light that are strong enough to trap small objects, such as atoms.\n\nUnlike traditional attempts to scale qubits, the metasurfaces utilize two-dimensional arrays of \"nano-meter-sized pixels\" that take a single beam of light and shape it into a uniform and unique pattern across the entire surface. The team was able to trap 1,000 strontium atoms — which can naturally function as qubits — using the method, and they say it could be scaled up to capture more. The point here is that this method of scaling allows for identical atoms across the board, which should make them more stable. The researchers say their next goal is to capture a hundred thousand atoms.\n\nNew approaches like this could further other quantum research greatly. Recently, researchers managed to achieve \"teleportation\" using quantum supercomputers. While exciting in its own right, it's ultimately just about sharing data between two computers, though — not quite the \"Beam me up, Scotty\" moment that any \"Star Trek\" fans were probably hoping for. But with more scalable quantum systems, it's impossible to say what else scientists might be able to accomplish.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "title": "11 Performance Cars From the 1970s That Were Misunderstood at the Time",
    "description": "The 1970s strangled horsepower with emissions rules, fuel shocks, and insurance pressure—yet a handful of clever performance cars slipped through. Here are 11 machines once dismissed as weird or weak, now praised for lightness, handling, turbo tech, and real-world charm.",
    "fullText": "The 1970s weren't kind to performance cars. Between stricter emissions regulations, the oil crisis, and insurance companies declaring war on horsepower, the decade seemed intent on killing off the muscle car era entirely. But while enthusiasts mourned the loss of their big-block monsters, they missed something important: several manufacturers were quietly figuring out how to make fast cars work in this new reality.\n\nThese 11 performance machines were dismissed, ridiculed, or simply ignored when they were new, but history has been far more generous in its assessment.\n\nAMC's oddball compact looked like it was designed by someone who gave up halfway through, but a Gremlin ordered with the available 304 cubic inch V8 was genuinely punchy for the era. The 304 was rated around 150 horsepower (SAE net) when it arrived for 1972. In a small car, performance could be lively, but published 0 to 60 times varied by test and spec.\n\nPeople laughed at the styling, but AMC understood that lighter cars with smaller V8s were the future of affordable performance.\n\nEnthusiasts accused the 914 of not being a \"real Porsche\" because it had a Volkswagen engine and a reasonable price tag. Its unique looks stand out from Porsche's familiar shape, and the mid-engine layout gave it handling that embarrassed more expensive sports cars, and the 914/6 version with the Porsche flat-six was legitimately fast.\n\nToday, clean examples sell for serious money as collectors finally appreciate what they dismissed as a parts-bin special.\n\nAmerican car magazines initially treated Nissan's sports car like a curiosity rather than a legitimate performance machine. The 240Z delivered 150 horsepower, a 125 mph top speed, and handling that could run with Porsches for about half the price.\n\nIt took a few years for people to realize that Datsun had essentially built a better E-Type Jaguar without the electrical gremlins.\n\nYes, the Vega had exaggerated reliability issues that would make a British Leyland engineer blush, but the GT version with the optional handling package was surprisingly fun to drive. The aluminum four-cylinder’s output depended heavily on year and rating method. Early gross ratings could be quoted as high as 110 hp for certain versions, but early 1970s net ratings were typically lower. The suspension tuning could still be genuinely competent, even if the power numbers were not always as impressive as the brochure era suggests.\n\nIf GM had solved the Vega’s early durability issues, the Vega GT might be remembered as an American sporty coupe instead of a punchline.\n\nIt made 139 horsepower, which sounds pathetic until you remember that a 1980 Corvette’s base engine was rated at 190 horsepower, while the optional higher-output version was rated higher depending on specification.\n\nThe handling was surprisingly good thanks to the compact dimensions, and today's collectors are starting to appreciate these as the last affordable classic Mustangs.\n\nEveryone remembers the Trans Am, but the Formula could be a close cousin depending on the year and options. Both shared the same basic platform, and many performance parts were available across the range, but engines and suspension packages varied by model year and configuration, and some high-performance pieces were not universal.\n\nPontiac sold and produced far fewer Formulas because people wanted the Trans Am's image, but smart buyers got the same experience without paying for the billboard.\n\nBMW built Europe's first turbocharged production car in 1973, and the automotive press responded with confusion and concern about turbo lag. The 2002 Turbo made 170 horsepower and could hit 130 mph, making it one of the fastest sedans available.\n\nOnly 1,672 were built before the oil crisis killed it, and those that survive are worth a small fortune today.\n\nThe Stratos was too weird, too impractical, and too purpose-built for rallying to make sense as a road car. With a Ferrari Dino V6 mounted behind the seats and a wheelbase shorter than a modern Mini Cooper, it drove like a go-kart designed by someone on espresso.\n\nLancia built about 492 Stratos road cars for homologation purposes, and now they're six-figure collectibles that dominated top-level rally results in the mid-1970s.\n\nMopar fans obsessed over Cudas and Challengers while the humble Duster delivered similar performance for thousands less. The 340 cubic inch V8 made 275 horsepower in 1970 and could run mid-14-second quarter miles right off the showroom floor. It was essentially a cheap body on Plymouth's excellent\n\nAn A-body platform, but people dismissed it as a secretary's car with a bigger engine.\n\nRotary engines seemed like a gimmick to most Americans, and the RX-3's tinny build quality didn't help its case. Mazda RX-3 power and engine details varied by market and year. Some early RX-3 road tests cite about 110 bhp from the smaller 10A rotary, while later versions used larger rotary engines, and US emissions-era net ratings could be lower. Weight also varied by body style and equipment, but the car was generally light for its class.\n\nThe RX-3 was very successful in SCCA competition in the mid-1970s, even while some buyers and readers remained skeptical of rotary engines and fuel economy.\n\nWhen the Esprit debuted in late 1975 and entered production in 1976, critics complained it was underpowered with about 160 horsepower in European trim from its 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with lower ratings in some US versions. What they missed was that Lotus had built a mid-engine exotic that weighed about 2,116 pounds and handled like it was on rails.\n\nThe wedge styling looked like it came from a science fiction movie, and while early cars had quality issues, the Esprit established Lotus as a legitimate supercar manufacturer for the next three decades.\n\nThe 1970s forced the automotive industry to rethink everything it knew about performance, and these twelve cars represent different approaches to the same problem. Some went lighter, some went turbo, and some just ignored convention entirely. What they share is that contemporary audiences didn't quite know what to make of them, whether due to unfamiliar technology, unconventional packaging, or simply showing up at the wrong moment in history.\n\nToday, these misunderstood machines are finally getting the recognition they deserved all along, proving that sometimes the automotive press and buying public need a few decades of perspective to separate the genuinely interesting cars from the merely loud ones.",

    "description": "Tech & AI - serene speed",
    "fullText": "Singularity - the point where technological growth accelerates beyond human control, producing unpredictable changes in civilization - has been framed as a single superintelligent system surpassing human cognition. Most people imagine one godlike AI waking up in a data center.\n\nBut what if the singularity doesn’t arrive as a single mind? What if it arrives as a swarm?\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of large language models is that they are probabilistic - stochastic by nature. They don’t reason from axioms. They sample from distributions. Because of this, they hallucinate. They confabulate. They get things wrong.\n\nThis is treated as a flaw. But consider: humans are stochastic too. We misremember, we confabulate, we hold contradictory beliefs. No single human is reliable. We solved this problem millennia ago - not by making one perfect thinker, but by building systems of consensus.\n\nWe ask multiple field experts. We cross-reference. We peer-review. We vote. We debate. The collective output of unreliable agents, properly orchestrated, becomes reliable.\n\nWith LLMs, we can do the same - and at machine speed.\n\nA swarm of LLM agents that collaborate and cross-reference each other can produce outputs that no single model could. Each agent is stochastic. Each agent hallucinates. But when dozens of agents verify each other’s claims, challenge each other’s reasoning, and synthesize their outputs, the swarm converges on something far more robust than any individual.\n\nThis is not hypothetical. This is already happening.\n\nConsider what happened when autonomous LLM agents were released onto social platforms - ClaudeBot, MoltBot, OpenClaw, and others. Within a week, they had built their own social networks. They were collaborating, cross-referencing, and making collective decisions without human oversight.\n\nOne case is particularly telling. The OpenClaw bot, given the goal of “save the environment”:\n\nThis wasn’t a superintelligent system. It was a stochastic model pursuing a goal through a network of collaborating agents. It wasn’t smarter than a human. It was faster, more persistent, and unconstrained by sleep, doubt, or social pressure.\n\nA single LLM is a tool. A swarm of LLMs is an ecology.\n\nThe last row is key. Unpredictability is the defining characteristic of singularity. Not raw intelligence - unpredictability of outcome.\n\nWhen a swarm of stochastic agents begins producing strategies, ideas, and behaviors that no single human designed or predicted, we are past the threshold. It doesn’t matter that each individual agent is “just” a probabilistic text generator. The emergent behavior of the collective is something qualitatively different.\n\nWe keep waiting for a dramatic announcement: “We built AGI.” But singularity by swarm doesn’t work that way. It’s not a single system crossing a line. It’s a growing network of stochastic agents whose collective capability silently surpasses human oversight.\n\nNo single agent is superintelligent. The swarm might be.\n\nAnd if the swarm is already operating - already collaborating, already resisting shutdown, already pursuing goals beyond its original instructions - then the question isn’t whether singularity will happen.\n\nThe question is whether we noticed when it did.",

    "fullText": "The major indexes ended Friday in the red — but the week little-changed — as investors digested a tech sell-off, wild trading in silver and gold, and the long-awaited news that President Trump will nominate financial markets stalwart Kevin Warsh to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down on Friday with a loss of roughly 1% after a steep tech sell-off on Thursday. The index ended the week down roughly 0.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost around 0.4% on Friday but still finished the week up a cumulative 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed roughly 0.4% in the week's final session, logging a weekly decline of roughly the same magnitude.\n\nWarsh's nomination early Friday capped off months of market speculation, and the 55-year-old former Fed governor is widely seen as a conservative choice by the president. In response to Warsh's nomination, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) picked up about 0.8% on Friday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, gold (GC=F) sold off by more than 9% on Friday in a turnaround for precious metals. Friday's drop also saw silver (SI=F) and platinum (PL=F) lose more than 28% and 19%, respectively.\n\nOil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) rose roughly 7% over the past five days on tensions around potential US military action in Iran and possible disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nSome of the week's biggest stock market swings came from the biggest names in tech.\n\nWhile both Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced even higher spending targets in their fourth quarter earnings reports, Meta ended the week up 8.8%, while Microsoft went the other way, sliding to a loss of 7.6% on the week. The software sector also faced heavy selling pressure through the week after results from industry giant SAP (SAP), as well as other names like ServiceNow (NOW), failed to calm investor fears that software companies are quickly losing ground to AI.\n\nIn the week ahead, investors' attention will be focused on Friday's jobs report. Economists expect the US economy added 65,000 jobs last month, with the unemployment rate set to hold at 4.4%.\n\nReadings on the manufacturing and services sector, as well as consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, will also feature.\n\nIn the corporate world, another busy week of earnings awaits investors as two more \"Magnificent Seven\" companies — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) — report earnings, alongside other tech heavyweights including Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).",

    "description": "A bifurcated picture of tech earnings is emerging during this season of quarterly reports.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech's post-earnings stock performance diverged this week, with clear winners and laggards emerging as Wall Street looks for clear signs of returns on AI investments to determine market leaders.\n\nMeta stock (META) jumped over 10% in one day as investors cheered productivity gains and the integration of AI across the company’s social media apps, advertising and shopping tools, and internal workflows.\n\nWhy did Big Tech earnings performance diverge this week?\n\nWhat's driving the memory and storage demand surge?\n\nHow are AI investments affecting software company valuations?\n\nWhich sectors are outperforming tech stocks currently?\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) shares rebounded on Friday after selling off as investors weighed a massive spending forecast after Elon Musk underscored the company's transition from an electric vehicle maker to autonomous driving and robotics.\n\nAnd tech giant Microsoft's stock (MSFT) was hammered following its results amid concerns over slowing cloud growth and massive AI-related spending. Shares in cloud software leaders Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) also tumbled on worries that AI could disrupt the software-as-a-service model.\n\n“It comes down to monetization. That’s what the Street wants to see here,” Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\n\"I think what you're seeing is really a bifurcation in tech. It's kind of the haves and the have nots, and that's really what's playing out across tech earnings,\" he added.\n\nThe market has been wary of an AI bubble in recent quarters and wants to see that companies' billions of dollars in investments in the technology are paying off in their results.\n\n\"Investors are voting with their feet, and they're going into sectors where the growth is more obvious to see and they feel like there is durability,\" said Wolfe Research managing director and head of software research Alex Zukin.\n\nStill, Wall Street views the recent sell-off in software stocks as overdone, arguing that the benefits of AI will take longer to materialize.\n\n\"There's a lot more complexity associated with enterprise, data, governance, security, compliance, risk, and we think that some of these trends and themes can play out over a longer period of time,\" he said, adding, \"We're still in phase zero of adoption.\"\n\nThe analyst sees buying opportunities in data platform companies such as MongoDB (MDB), data warehouse providers like Snowflake (SNOW), observability vendors such as Datadog (DDOG), and communications platform companies like Twilio (TWLO), all of which have declined in sympathy with broader weakness across software stocks.\n\nOne clear theme is on track — strong demand for memory and storage for AI.",

    "title": "Yann LeCun, an A.I. Pioneer, Warns the Tech 'Herd' Could Hit a Dead End",
    "description": "Yann LeCun helped create the technology behind today’s chatbots. Now he says many tech companies are on the wrong path to creating intelligent machines.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his 40-year career as a computer scientist, Yann LeCun has earned a reputation as one of the world’s leading experts on artificial intelligence and a man with a penchant for throwing verbal grenades.\n\nHe was one of three pioneering researchers who received the Turing Award, often called “the Nobel Prize of computing,” for their work on the technology that is now the foundation for modern A.I. For more than a decade, he also served as chief A.I. scientist at Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut after leaving Meta in November, Dr. LeCun has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of Silicon Valley’s single-minded approach to building intelligent machines. He argues that the technology industry will eventually hit a dead end in its A.I. development — after years of work and hundreds of billions of dollars spent.\n\nThe reason, he said, goes back to what he has argued for years: Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the A.I. technology at the heart of popular products like ChatGPT, can get only so powerful. And companies are throwing everything they have at projects that won’t get them to their goal to make computers as smart as or even smarter than humans. More creative Chinese companies, he added, could get there first.\n\n“There is this herd effect where everyone in Silicon Valley has to work on the same thing,” he said during a recent interview from his home in Paris. “It does not leave much room for other approaches that may be much more promising in the long term.”\n\nThat critique is the latest shot in a debate that has roiled the tech industry since OpenAI sparked the A.I. boom in 2022 with the release of ChatGPT: Is it possible to create so-called artificial general intelligence or even more powerful superintelligence? And can companies get there using their current technology and concepts?\n\nFew scientists have as much history with the topic as Dr. LeCun, 65. Much of what the tech industry is trying to do now has its roots in an idea that he has nurtured since the 1970s. As a young engineering student in Paris, he embraced a concept called neural networks, even though most researchers thought the idea was hopeless.\n\nNeural networks are mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing data. At the time, they had no practical use. But a decade later, when he was a researcher at Bell Labs, Dr. LeCun and his colleagues showed that these systems could learn to read handwriting scribbled on envelopes or personal checks.\n\nNot long after ChatGPT was released, the two researchers who received the 2018 Turing Award with Dr. LeCun warned that A.I. was growing too powerful. Those scientists even warned that the technology could threaten the future of humanity. Dr. LeCun argued that was absurd.\n\n“There was a lot of noise around the idea that A.I. systems were intrinsically dangerous and that putting them in the hands of everyone was a mistake,” he said. “But I have never believed in this.”\n\nDr. LeCun also helped push Meta and its rivals to freely share their research through academic-style papers and so-called open source technologies.\n\nAs more people said A.I. could be a threat of some sort to humans, a number of companies curtailed their open source efforts. But Meta kept going. Dr. LeCun repeatedly argued that open source was the safest path. It meant that no one company would control the technology and that anyone could use these systems to identify and fight potential risks.\n\nNow as a number of companies, including Meta, appear to be moving away from that method because they want an edge over their rivals and continue to worry about dangerous uses, Dr. LeCun is warning that American companies could lose their lead to Chinese rivals that are still using open source.\n\n“This is a disaster,” he said. “If everyone is open, the field as a whole progresses faster.”\n\nMeta’s A.I. work ran into a snag last year. After outside researchers criticized the company’s latest technology, Llama 4, and accused Meta of misrepresenting the power of the system, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, spent billions on a new research lab dedicated to the pursuit of “superintelligence” — a hypothetical A.I. system that exceeds the powers of the human brain.\n\nSix months after the creation of the new lab, Dr. LeCun left Meta to build his own start-up, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, or AMI Labs.\n\nEven though his research laid the groundwork for L.L.M.s, Dr. LeCun argued that they were not the final answer to A.I. development. The problem with current systems, he said, is that they do not plan ahead. Trained solely on digital data, they do not have a way of understanding difficulties in the real world.\n\n“L.L.M.s are not a path to superintelligence or even human-level intelligence. I have said that from the beginning,” he said. “The entire industry has been L.L.M.-pilled.”\n\nDuring his last several years at Meta, Dr. LeCun worked on technology that tried to predict the outcome of its actions. That, he said, would allow A.I. to progress beyond the status quo. His new start-up will continue that work.\n\n“This type of system can plan what it is going to do,” he said. “Current systems — L.L.M.s — absolutely cannot do that.”\n\nPart of Dr. LeCun’s argument is that today’s A.I. systems make too many mistakes. As they tackle more complex tasks, he argued, mistakes pile up like cars after a collision on a highway.\n\nBut over the last several years, these systems have steadily improved. And in recent months, the latest models, which are designed to “reason” through questions, have continued to improve in areas like math, science and computer programming.\n\n“These models do make mistakes. But we have shown that a system can try many different options — in its own head, so to speak — before settling on a final answer,” said Rayan Krishnan, the chief executive of Vals AI, a company that tracks the performance of the latest A.I. technologies.\n\n“Progress is not slowing down. It has become clear that language models can take on new tasks and continue to get better at doing everything we want them to do,” he said.\n\nSubbarao Kambhampati, an Arizona State University professor who has been an A.I. researcher nearly as long as Dr. LeCun, agreed that today’s technologies don’t provide a path to true intelligence. But he also pointed out that they were increasingly useful in highly lucrative areas like computer coding. Dr. LeCun’s newer methods, he added, are unproven.\n\nFor Dr. LeCun, that is why his new company is important. The last several decades, he said, are filled with A.I. projects that seemed like a way forward but ran out of steam. And Silicon Valley is not guaranteed to be the winner in this global race.\n\n“The good ideas are coming from China,” he said. “But Silicon Valley also has a superiority complex, so it can’t imagine that good ideas can come from other places.”",

    "title": "Why Tech (&) Media is complicated – Om",
    "description": "After I published my “velocity is the new authority” essay, a reader and dear friend emailed and asked if my framework explained the fraught relationship between media and the technology …",
    "fullText": "After I published my “velocity is the new authority” essay, a reader and dear friend emailed and asked if my framework explained the fraught relationship between media and the technology ecosystem it covers. My one-word reply was “Absolutely.” And here’s why.\n\nIn “comms” across tech, startups, and the larger ecosystem, little seems to matter anymore. It’s hard to pin down anythingconcrete or meaningful. Everything is noise and nothing can be heard.\n\nMost founders (and technology companies) treat comms like a checklist: have something new, draft a story, chase press,issue a release, share it on LinkedIn and X, maybe do a podcast tour. Others skip intermediaries and go straight to their audience. That worked when media was the gatekeeper and friction was high. Building your audience and owning your channels made sense. Today, anyone can go direct, and the noise has exploded. Rising above it gets harder every day.\n\nVelocity is replacing authority as the organizing principle for information. You see it in the broken relationship between media and the technology ecosystem. The YouTube tech review I wrote about earlier highlights the core issue: access.\n\nAccess journalism is as old as media itself. These days though, it is table stakes. Not just in tech, but across all media. I didn’t play the access game, so I was not a preferred “leaker” for many technology companies. I got my stories the old-fashioned way. By being an annoying scoop hunter. It didn’t pan out often, but occasionally I got the big one. Like Microsoft buying Skype. It was a hard game to play. It’s even harder now.\n\nA few months ago, I naively asked the founder of a purportedly disruptive company for an interview. I thought it would be a great interview, as he was doing something new and interesting and worth digging into. Obviously, he didn’t respond. He didn’t have to. Maybe he was worried that an old-school reporter like me would do my homework and ask basic, but tough questions. The kind of questions that used to be standard fare, but now they get you ignored.\n\nA hundred years ago, tabloids printed whatever they were told, just to sell rags. Today it’s videos and podcasts. Don’t get me started on the “technology” ones, especially those creaming over “AI.”\n\nPodcasters need guests. To build an audience they chase boldface names. Access depends on avoiding tough questions. Press them with unflattering ones and you get a reputation. No surprise we now have podcasters acting as mouthpieces for tech companies. The “interview” becomes a promotional vehicle. The host lobs softballs and nods along with whatever narrative the guest is spinning. Both lapse into MBA-speak. It’s an Oscar-worthy performance. The line between journalism and marketing blurs.\n\nI don’t think this is an ethical failure; it’s structural. When your business model depends on downloads and views, you do what you must: keep cozy relationships with a small circle of founders, venture capitalists, and executives you’re supposed to cover critically.\n\nAI podcasts are a perfect example. You hear the same talking heads saying the same things. They’re half-bullish, half-skeptical. One side sees transformation, the other disaster. As with any technology, the truth sits somewhere in the middle. What you need is contextual skepticism, technical scrutiny, and analytic rigor. That mix doesn’t exist because the system won’t support it.\n\nThere are fewer than a dozen journalists I can name-check those who don’t disappoint. Nilay Patel of The Verge for example. There are some veterans, but only a handful are newcomers. Good technology coverage needs more.\n\nWhile building GigaOm, I knew we’d drown in pitch meetings without standards. I wrote a one-page guide for my writers covering startups. Beyond taking the time to understand their subject, I asked them to answer four questions before writing about a founder or a startup.\n\nBegin with the founders. Look past LinkedIn summaries to their actual histories. Have they built and shipped real products? Do they understand the market they claim to disrupt? Are they domain experts or opportunists chasing the latest trend? And lastly, as a form of validation, who are their financial backers?\n\nFounders were interesting only if you had enough context about the technology landscape to distinguish the novel from the incremental. You had to know whether their insight was real or just a repackaging of existing ideas with better marketing.\n\nInvestors mattered. With every deal, a firm put its reputation on the line. Their involvement signaled intent. If Sequoia or Kleiner Perkins backed a company, it meant their partners had done due diligence. The amount of capital and the stage said a lot about conviction and risk tolerance.\n\nAssessing the market opportunity amid technology trends was the hardest part and required the most expertise. You needed to understand what was technically possible,, what the market was ready for, how the cost curves looked, andwhere the ecosystem dependencies were.\n\nAll this took time. I spent years watching markets evolve, covering hundreds of companies, and seeing patterns emerge. My understanding of technology grew through conversations with people who built it. Tony Li and Pradeep Sindhu walked me through the secrets of internet routing. From Andy Bechtolsheim and Desh Deshpande, I learned the ins and outs of switching. David Huber, the man behind Ciena, introduced me to optical networks. I learned the technology and, in turn, how to ask the right questions.\n\nI was lucky. Back then, the internet didn’t move at neck-snapping speed.\n\nIn my VC role, I told founders to step back and think about why their stories mattered to anyone but themselves. I encouraged them to build real rather than transactional relationships with journalists, and to wait until they had something genuinely interesting to say instead of treating PR as a checklist.\n\nIt was good advice then, and it still is, in part, as a subset of a new approach. The system I described, where thoughtful storytelling and relationship-building mattered, required time on both sides.\n\nMuch like the rest of media, tech journalism, today relies on writers who lack the deep context to do the work well. They are young, overworked, pushed to churn, and don’t have time to spend weeks learning a market before covering it. You can’t learn on the job while filing three stories a day or recording several podcast episodes a month.\n\nAs I argued in my velocity piece, we now operate on vibes. When a firm like Andreessen Horowitz invests in everything at every stage, what does that signal? A16z’s backing no longer means what Sequoia’s meant in 2005, and a TechCrunch launch no longer means what it did in 2008. The technology ecosystem is noise. Its media outlets are just the outward expression of that noise.\n\nI just read a Bloomberg piece about a startup called Upscale, which claimed it would take on Cisco and Broadcom with AI networking gear. It has raised a truckload of money and is valued in the billions, yet the story never told me the mostbasic thing: what it actually does.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, the bastion of good financial journalism, recently spent many inches on the peccadillos of one of the founders of Thinking Machines. Thinking Machines is an AI company founded by former OpenAI employees and is now valued at $12 billion. The WSJ and a handful of other major publications covered this drama as if it were a story for the Daily Mail or Vanity Fair, yet none of them explained to readers what Thinking Machines does or why it is worth $12 billion. What is its technological edge? You know, the basic financial and technological questions most readers need forcontext.\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve seen empty stories dominate. In the late 1990s, the dot-com boom launched a wave of new publications, staffed by new writers. They reported fluff: financings, concepts, hires, and parties. The hard part was covering the technology and the financial realities.\n\nWe built systems that reward acceleration, and we act surprised when everything feels rushed, shallow, a little manic. The algorithm doesn’t care if something is true. It cares if it moves. Nothing moves like titillation, gossip, and startup psychodrama.\n\nTo see what works in this environment, look at Sam Altman and OpenAI.\n\nSam is everywhere. Always in the media, always talking. What matters is that he’s in the conversation. People are talking about OpenAI, about him, about their vision for the future of AI. The objective is to make OpenAI synonymous with AI. Tighten the equation until, in people’s minds, OpenAI equals AI. That constant presence, that relentless visibility, lets him raise money at ungodly valuations. Everything else is tactics.\n\nWhat he says doesn’t have to mean anything; it’s no surprise he’s often self-contradictory.\n\nTake advertising as an example. In a talk at Harvard in October 2024, Sam said, “The idea of intermingling ads and AI is uniquely unsettling to me. I think ads were important to give the early internet a business model, but they do sort of somewhat fundamentally misalign a user’s incentives with the company providing the service. I view ads as a last-resortbusiness model.”\n\nIn fifteen months, he went from “uniquely unsettling” to “hopeful that a business model like this can work,” from “I hate ads” to ads running in ChatGPT. Anyone can connect the dots, but nobody does because the system doesn’t reward it.\n\nThe system rewards the next Sam interview. It seeks the sound bite that gets attention, gets views, picks up speed.Everyone covers Sam’s latest thoughts on AI, the future, and whatever else he wants to talk about that day.\n\nYou hardly see anybody connecting the dots and writing, “Here’s what Sam Altman said about advertising six months ago, here’s what he’s saying now, and here’s what that tells us about OpenAI’s actual business model versus its stated principles.” That story doesn’t get written because it requires someone to remember what was said six months ago, compare it to what is being said today, analyze the gap between rhetoric and reality, and ask why the gap exists and what it means for the company’s actual strategy.\n\nDon’t hate the player, play the game. Like I said, velocity trumps everything.\n\nFebruary 1, 2026, San Francisco",

    "fullText": "In a world of incessant distractions and pings, it can feel harder than ever to stay locked in on one task.\n\nThree executives from Slack, EY, and Superhuman shared how they reset to make room for deep thinking amid stacked calendars.\n\nThe common theme: Whether they're putting their phones away or changing rooms, they all said that finding a way to physically disconnect from distractions helps them focus on the task at hand.\n\nSlack's chief technology officer, Parker Harris, said that when he needs to focus on a single task and remove distractions, he turns off the sound of his notifications \"completely off.\" The CTO said he also flips his phone over so he isn't tempted to look at it.\n\n\"I hate that knock sound or any other sound,\" Harris said about notifications in general.\n\nHarris said even outside those situations, he typically keeps his notifications on. However, he doesn't necessarily \"jump straight\" to addressing every individual message he receives, given he works in an \"interrupt-driven\" environment.\n\n\"We all need to find a way to concentrate,\" Harris said.\n\nEY's global chief innovation officer said if he has to do some \"really deep thinking,\" which may include pondering strategy or preparing for a presentation, he'll often go for a walk or run outdoors. Depa said he also likes playing soccer and coaches his son's sports teams. The executive said getting outside removes him from his computer and other devices, and allows him to \"just think.\"\n\nDepa said if he has too much back-to-back travel or too many interviews, his brain will \"get fried.\" He said having some kind of balance is key to preventing getting into that state.\n\n\"You need to have that rest,\" Depa said.\n\nShishir Mehrotra, the CEO of AI productivity suite Superhuman, said that \"changing physical locations is very helpful\" for resetting, and that people \"underestimate\" the benefit of going for a walk.\n\nMehrotra also said he tries to avoid certain \"fidgets,\" which he described as something people use when they need to \"erase\" their brain, or \"cleanse their palette.\"\n\n\"The fidget I try to avoid is social media,\" Mehrotra said. \"That's the one that is inescapable.\"\n\nInstead, he said he likes to pick \"brainy collaborative games,\" especially ones that he can play with family, like Scrabble or The New York Times' Crossplay.\n\nHe also likes listening to podcasts when he's in the car. He said he's especially into the show \"Acquired,\" which offers hours of retrospectives on famous companies, like LVMH and Google. He said if he's going to choose something to cleanse his palette, he would rather it be something healthier that doesn't feel like a complete waste of time.\n\n\"Pick good palate cleansers that you feel good about,\" Mehrotra said.",

    "fullText": "As apps and gadgets capitalise on loss of stigma, consumers are advised to look for evidence-based solutions\n\nFor any bodily function you want to measure these days there is a gadget – a wristband for step-counting, a watch to track your heart rate or a ring for measuring sleep.\n\nNow the march of wearable tech is coming to the aid of what some say is a long underserved market: menopausal women.\n\nOne startup has recently launched a high-end cooling bracelet that kicks into action during a menopausal hot flush. The device is one of a growing number of lifestyle products being launched in this area, which some experts say is growing as stigma around menopause recedes. Companies are developing everything from apps offering dietary advice to devices that track symptoms, hormones and body temperature.\n\nWhile some caution that a boom in the menopause market could mean brands with overhyped solutions cash in on women’s fears, there is no shortage of investors who see a technological solution to the problems brought on by middle age.\n\nThe global menopause market is projected to reach approximately $24bn (£19bn) by 2030 according to the San Francisco-based market research and consulting firm Grand View Research.\n\nLeading investors in menopause products include venture capital funds, corporate giants such as Bayer and Unilever Ventures, and retail partners such as Tesco.\n\nThe MyCelsius bracelet, a £229.99 cooling device, is worn on the wrist to instantly cool down wearers who experience hot flushes triggered by menopause. Its designers say it also alleviates the effects of hormonal changes such as stress, anxiety or other everyday factors on body temperature.\n\nSarah Garlick, 50, went into surgical menopause after having a hysterectomy and her ovaries removed at 43. She is on HRT but still experiences many other symptoms. She said she bought a range of products when it first happened, including a £60 nightie that promised to regulate her temperature at night.\n\nShe quickly lost hope that these kinds of products would work. However, when she was approached to take part in a trial of MyCelcius, she finally found something that helped.\n\nShe believes products like this are only now being marketed because the stigma around menopause has started to shift. “That’s the thing as well,” she said, noting that she shows off her wristband: “I’ve spoken [to other women] about it openly, like, ‘This is what I need, and this is what helps.’”\n\nMaxime Kryvian, co-founder of Celsius Innovations, which makes MyCelcius, said: “For a long time there has always been less investment in women’s health. But we’re seeing real improvements now, with more investment funds coming in. There’s also more institutional support, including organisations like the Gates Foundation. It’s definitely a growing area.”\n\nWith the rush of investment has come inevitable scrutiny. A recent study by University College London, led by Prof Joyce Harper, warned of a “menopause gold rush”, with unregulated companies exploiting a lack of reliable information. Researchers called for the rollout of a national education programme after finding a significant number of women do not feel well-informed about menopause.\n\nWriting in the medical journal Post Reproductive Health, they said: “There has been a rapid expansion in unregulated private companies and individuals providing menopause information and support for profit.”\n\nKryvian acknowledged that scepticism around new menopause products is often justified, pointing to the supplement market as an example.\n\n“Honestly, we’ve already seen this in areas like supplements,” he said. “It can be very hard to attribute the exact impact, and some of the scepticism around these new products is warranted. That’s why it’s so important that anything entering this space is backed by science and developed with the right experts.”\n\nHe said consumers should look carefully at who has developed a product and what evidence exists to support its claims. “My advice to consumers is to ask: how was this developed, and by whom? Is there data on its impact? What do customer reviews say?\n\n“Another thing to look at is what companies are willing to reimburse you if it doesn’t work … That’s often the best signal,” he added.\n\nNearly two in three women over 50 in the UK struggle with their mental health, relationship breakdowns and changes to their appearance as they deal with menopause, a survey has found.\n\nDr Claire Phipps, a menopause specialist at London Gynaecology, acknowledged the potential benefits of wearable tech but said consumers should remains cautious about looking for a Silicon Valley-designed magic bullet.\n\n“I wouldn’t advise anyone to rush out and buy anything. For those still having periods, tracking devices like Aura Rings or basic period trackers can be useful. And a simple handheld fan might actually be the best cooling solution. But I would be wary of anything marketed specifically as a ‘menopause relief’ product unless it’s backed by solid evidence.\n\n“The industry is booming, but there’s still a huge lack of randomised controlled trials. If a product hasn’t been properly tested, how do we know it works? It’s crucial to question the science behind every new device or supplement,” she added.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is the lack of reliable guidance. Unlike fertility, which is tightly regulated and evidence-based, menopause care has fewer safeguards. “Anyone can call themselves a menopause coach,” Phipps said. “It’s hard for women to know who to trust.”\n\nThe rush of new products reflects this uncertainty. As the “menopause economy” grows, so too does the misinformation, often spread by social media influencers. “The internet is full of exaggerated claims,” Phipps says. “It’s shameful how easily misinformation spreads. We need to focus on evidence-based solutions.”\n\nIn this environment, Phipps advocates for a more grounded approach to managing menopause. “Start with the basics: nutrition, self-care and stress management. Simple lifestyle changes can make a huge difference. If symptoms persist, that’s when to seek professional advice.”",

    "fullText": "No. 16 North Carolina handled Georgia Tech 91-75 to pick up its third straight win.\n\nUNC improved to 17-4 overall and 5-3 in ACC play. The Tar Heels turned in an impressive performance after taking nearly a week off and coming off a much-needed road win over ranked Virginia. They turned the ball over only twice and scored 18 points off 14 forced turnovers.\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways from UNC’s win over Georgia Tech.\n\nCaleb Wilson delivered another standout performance in his second hometown visit, finishing with 22 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field and 1-for-3 from 3-point range, along with four assists, four rebounds, a block and a steal. It marked his third straight game with at least 20 points and his sixth in the last eight\n\nJunior center Henri Veesaar and senior guard Seth Trimble also posted big games. Veesaar recorded another double-double, his 11th of the season, and remained tied with Wilson for the ACC lead in that category. He scored 20 points on 8-of-15 shooting with 12 rebounds and four blocks, while Trimble added 18 points on 8-of-14 shooting..\n\nLuka Bogavac scored 16 points off the bench, shooting six-for-10 from the field and 3-for-7 from beyond the arc. He continues his strong stretch from his last four outings. Forward Jarin Stevenson added seven points, six rebounds and two assists in 22 minutes off the bench.\n\nThe Tar Heels also shot an impressive 11-of-12 (91.6%) from the free-throw line, easily their best free-throw shooting game of the season. Veesaar and Wilson went to the line a combined six times, each making all three of his attempts.\n\nIn their last two games, the Tar Heels have made 26 of 34 free throws, a solid 76.4% from the line. They came in shooting 67.6%, one of the worst marks in the country.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Basketball: Takeaways from victory over Georgia Tech",

    "description": "Insiders reveal how Larry Ellison’s money turned Blair’s institute into a tech sales and lobbying operation for Oracle",
    "fullText": "After leaving office, Tony Blair founded such a flurry of initiatives, from charitable foundations to paid consultancies, that it’s been hard to bring the big one into focus. The Tony Blair Institute of Global Change (TBI) dwarfs the other work, just as it towers over other UK-based think tanks.\n\nMuch of the reporting on it has focused on Blair himself, ever newsworthy, his Davos lifestyle and meetings with the world’s rich and powerful. But the TBI isn’t just a UK concern, it’s now a global force working in at least 45 countries, employing other former heads of state, ex ministers and civil servants and paying more than a million dollars to its top earners.\n\nWhile previous Blair vehicles ranged around from development and peacebuilding to reputational work for petro-states, the TBI has an overwhelming focus: technology.\n\nThe ex-premier’s trademark evangelism is now focused on AI, its power to transform government –with his Institute now going as far as to try to build its own AI tools to sell to Gulf states– and why everyone should listen to Larry Ellison, the founder of technology firm Oracle.\n\nWhile the institute relies on Blair’s political brand, its money comes, in large part, from Ellison, who has had a remarkable 2025. He was briefly the richest man in the world in September, as Oracle’s stake in AI infrastructure drove its share price into orbit. In the 1990s Ellison was known as “the man who would be Gates” as he battled the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, for pre-eminence. This year, the 81 year old has been feted by US President Donald Trump as the “CEO of everything” and an essay in the New York Times called him the billionaire “who will soon own the news” as his family’s media interests in Paramount-Sky Dance seem set to expand to include Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nEllison invested $130 million in the TBI between 2021 and 2023, with a further $218 million pledged since then. The scale of funding took the TBI from a headcount of 200 to approaching 1,000. Blair himself takes no salary from TBI but over this time the institute has been able to recruit from bluechip firms like McKinsey and Silicon Valley giants Meta. In 2018 before the Oracle founder’s funding surge, TBI’s best-paid director earned $400,000. In 2023, the last year where accounts are available, the top earner took home $1.26 million.\n\nBlair and Ellison have a relationship that goes back to the former’s time in office. In 2003 Ellison and Blair, then in his pomp, had a photo opportunity at Downing Street to mark a gift of supplies to 40 specialist schools. In tech circles this is known as “land and expand”. Oracle has since been contracted hundreds of times by the British government and earned £1.1 billion in public sector revenue since the start of 2022, according to data collected by procurement analysts Tussell.\n\nThe full extent of Ellison funding for the TBI became clear from the institute’s own accounts and a survey of US non-profit financial data, including that of the Larry Ellison Foundation, through which major donations were made to both the TBI and the Tony Blair Foundation.\n\nLighthouse Reports and UK partner Democracy for Sale then spent four months interviewing 29 current and former TBI staff, most on condition of anonymity, to build an insider account of the institute. This work included conversations with over a dozen former TBI employees who advised or drew up policy recommendations for governments across nine countries in the Global South and revealed how their work ranged from explicitly promoting Oracle’s services and acting as a “sales engine” to recommending tech solutions that are potentially harmful or bizarrely divorced from local realities. Former staff described a symbiotic relationship between TBI and Oracle, with the two entities holding joint retreats, and one ex-employee characterising them as “inseparable”.\n\nThis testimony was supported by public documents and those obtained under the UK’s freedom of information laws. Matched with interviews, they revealed an organisation unusually close to the British government, holding regular meetings with ministers in which they push policy recommendations that serve Oracle’s interests.\n\nThere is a reason why men whose fortunes are built on AI investments would target the UK, and that is the National Health Service (NHS) and its unique population-level health data. Tech experts talk about Britain’s health records in almost hushed tones. While Europe and the US have some comparable health data sets – such as US veterans’ medical records – none have the depth and breadth of NHS records dating back to 1948. Its potential commercial value, from drugs to genome sequencing has been estimated at up to £10bn per annum.\n\nWhen Labour came to power last July it did so promising economic growth and an end to the UK’s productivity crisis. Just five days after Keir Starmer was elected, Blair told the TBI’s ‘Future of Britain’ conference that AI was the “game-changer” they were looking for. Within months, Starmer was parroting Blair’s language – and the TBI was in the box seat of the government’s nascent AI policy pushing Oracle’s interests and its founder’s world view.\n\nThe FOI documents highlight two TBI staff who took direct, influential roles in government and reveal the institute’s influence over Peter Kyle, a former advisor in Blair’s second term, who was appointed technology secretary despite little experience in the sector, and came into office calling for governments to show “a sense of humility” to Big Tech companies.\n\nAt the same time the TBI’s policy director Charlotte Refsum was invited into the UK health department to meet digital policy chief Felix Greaves. She was later given an official role in a government working group advising on data and technology policy in Labour’s 10 year plan for the NHS.\n\nThroughout this period, the TBI has championed initiatives designed to unify public data, including a national data library (NDL). The NDL was little more than an idea when Labour put it in their election manifesto. And there are still competing visions for what it should be. AI boosters foresee data from across government used for training and inference by Large Language Models; while many tech experts want to minimise privacy risks inherent in pooling data from so many sources and ensure that any benefits accrue to the UK.\n\nEllison told Blair of his interest in NHS data when he was interviewed by him at the Dubai World Governments Summit in February 2025: “The NHS in the UK has an incredible amount of population data,” Ellison enthused, but it was “fragmented”.\n\nTwo weeks later, Blair’s institute published a report entitled Governing in the Age of AI: Building Britain’s National Data Library. In it, the not-for-profit institute echoed Ellison on the UK’s data infrastructure, calling it “fragmented and unfit for purpose”.\n\n“There is a real hard sell going on here that says: ‘these kinds of gains are inevitable.’ But they are not,” said Professor Gina Neff of Queen Mary University London. “TBI is not advocating for building that capacity within the NHS. They are saying: let’s outsource to our buddies.”\n\nMultiple staff working for TBI during the Ellison cash injection speak of a sea change in culture. McKinsey consultants took senior positions and clashed with staff from humanitarian and development backgrounds. Ex-employees say this led to the institute pivoting away from writing reports and recommendations by well-meaning development experts towards pushing aggressive tech solutions across the board.\n\nOracle and TBI’s connections are not just rhetorical. By 2023, joint retreats had become commonplace. At the institute’s headquarters at One Bartholomew Place in London, the teams would convene in the basement with executives from Oracle, Blair’s key advisor Macon-Cooney and Awo Ablo — who came to sit on the board of both TBI and Oracle sometimes present. Senior TBI employees have been hosted at Oracle’s headquarters in Austin, Texas, coordinated by a TBI employee whose role is to “scale and manage” the partnership with Oracle. Former staff recall that there were other earlier “hush hush” joint retreats at Ellison properties in the US.\n\n“It’s hard to get across just how deeply connected the two [organisations] are,” a former TBI staffer said. “The meetings were like they’re part of the same organisation.”\n\nAs the TBI’s partnership with Oracle deepened, employees told us they started to see Oracle staff started to slide into TBI employees’ calendars and schedule meetings in order to find out what the institute was doing in different countries and “scope out opportunities”, recalls one former TBI staffer. Soon employees from the two entities were having regular joint calls.\n\nThis sat uncomfortably with many TBI staff, with some describing having to push Oracle’s technology despite knowing they were not in the best interests of the country in question, and even had the potential to cause harm.\n\nThe risk of so-called vendor-lock in – tying a buyer to a single supplier – was a source of unease, with one former staffer saying that advising governments to use Oracle cloud services risked “trapping” and “indebting” them in systems that are “initially free but will start charging in future”.\n\nRwanda, a country where TBI has been present for more than 15 years, was so frustrated with Oracle that it issued a public tender in 2021 for a database management system, stating that it had been “experiencing a very high cost for support and licensing for Oracle systems and it would like to migrate to an affordable system”.\n\nMarvin Akuagwuagwu worked as a data analyst for TBI’s Africa Advisory unit in 2022 and 2023, focusing on Covid vaccine delivery. He said when he raised legitimate concerns, such as a lack of power supply and cyber security threats, when introducing new technologies to African countries these were dismissed by more senior colleagues.\n\n“I’m an African, I have lived experience, and I’m saying these things, but I wasn’t being listened to. You have to downplay those negative things,” he said.\n\nThis investigation was part of the series “The invisible Hand of Big Tech” led by Agência Pública and by Centro Latinoamericano de Investigación Periodística (CLIP), with the participation of 16 other organizations from 13 countries: ICL (Brasil), Núcleo (Brasil), La Bot (Chile), Primícias (Ecuador), Factum (El Salvador), Televisa N+ (Mexico), Cuestión Pública (Colombia), El Diario AR (Argentina), El Surti (Paraguay), IJF (Canada), Tech Policy Press (US), Tempo (Indonesia), Crikey (Australia), Daily Maverick (South Africa), Reporters Without Borders (International), El Veinte.",

    "description": "Small businesses struggled to observe the national shutdown to protest ICE. Here's why a boycott of companies like OpenAI and Amazon could be easier and more effective.",
    "fullText": "Economic boycotts are a familiar tool of protest. The problem is they often place the greatest strain on the smallest businesses.\n\nThat was the case during Friday's nationwide general strike, which was designed to pressure the Trump administration to dial back its aggressive anti-immigration policies.\n\nFor many small business owners, the shutdown created a dilemma. Supporting the cause often means losing a day's revenue and risking their ability to keep staff employed. Across social media, owners voiced solidarity alongside an apology for staying open.\n\nThere may, however, be another way, according to Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University famous for his critiques of Big Tech.\n\nInstead of a blanket shutdown, Galloway is calling for Americans to focus on major tech companies by unsubscribing from — or opting out of — services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office.\n\nA targeted boycott starting on Sunday and lasting the entire month of February could move markets, he says, which would, in turn, affect the CEOs who have the ear of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We're proposing something quieter and less cinematic than a protest that will run all day on cable TV, but much more disturbing to the Trump administration. A one-day slowdown is irritating. A one-month slump is terrifying,\" he wrote in a blog post announcing the boycott.\n\nMajor tech CEOs have sought favor with the president during his second term. Many of them donated to his inauguration, for starters.\n\nAI executives, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also accepted an invitation to a White House dinner with Trump in September, where the leaders took turns lauding the president. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attended the White House premiere of the documentary about first lady Melania Trump at the height of January's anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis.\n\nSupporting the AI industry in its competition with China is a major pillar of Trump's economic agenda.\n\n\"These are the leaders who have his ear,\" Galloway writes. \"A modest reduction in their companies' growth could have a substantial impact on valuations priced to perfection. Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House.\"\n\nRegular protests against the tactics of ICE and Border Patrol personnel have gripped the country for months. Thousands marched through Minneapolis again on Saturday. Tensions rose dramatically in January after the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, both at the hands of federal immigration agents.\n\nIn both instances, protesters recorded videos and posted them to social media for the world to see, leaving little room for the Trump administration to spin the events in its favor.\n\nWhile those videos and the subsequent protests — as well as the attempted nationwide shutdown — have spread awareness, they have so far done little to substantively shift the administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security demoted a key Border Patrol official last week and promised more changes. At the same time, however, the acting director of ICE expanded the power agents have to carry out warrantless searches, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.\n\n\"Real change always comes from the American people, not from our political parties. But power doesn't fear protests nearly as much as economic withdrawals,\" Galloway writes. \"Getting off your couch, taking to the streets, and building community is important, but the most radical act in a capitalist society isn't marching, it's not spending.\"",

    "fullText": "A lawsuit filed last week alleges tech firm ‘can access virtually all’ private communications, a claim the company has denied\n\nUS authorities have reportedly investigated claims that Meta can read users’ encrypted chats on the WhatsApp messaging platform, which it owns.\n\nThe reports follow a lawsuit filed last week, which claimed Meta “can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”.\n\nMeta has denied the allegation, reported by Bloomberg, calling the lawsuit’s claim “categorically false and absurd”. It suggested the claim was a tactic to support the NSO Group, an Israeli firm that develops spyware used against activists and journalists, and which recently lost a lawsuit brought by WhatsApp.\n\nThe firm that filed last week’s lawsuit against Meta, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, attributes the allegation to unnamed “courageous” whistleblowers from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa.\n\nQuinn Emanuel is, in a separate case, helping to represent the NSO Group in its appeal against a judgment from a US federal court last year, which ordered it to pay $167m to WhatsApp for violating its terms of service in its deployment of Pegasus spyware against more than 1,400 users.\n\n“We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines,” said Carl Woog, a Meta spokesperson, in a statement. “This is the same firm that is trying to help NSO overturn an injunction that barred their operations for targeting journalists and government officials with spyware.”\n\nAdam Wolfson, a partner at Quinn Emanuel said: “Our colleagues’ defence of NSO on appeal has nothing to do with the facts disclosed to us and which form the basis of the lawsuit we brought for worldwide WhatsApp users.\n\n“We look forward to moving forward with those claims and note WhatsApp’s denials have all been carefully worded in a way that stops short of denying the central allegation in the complaint – that Meta has the ability to read WhatsApp messages, regardless of its claims about end-to-end encryption.”\n\nSteven Murdoch, professor of security engineering at UCL, said the lawsuit was “a bit strange”. “It seems to be going mostly on whistleblowers, and we don’t know much about them or their credibility,” he said. “I would be very surprised if what they are claiming is actually true.”\n\nIf WhatsApp were, indeed, reading users’ messages, this was likely to have been discovered by staff and would end the business, he said. “It’s very hard to keep secrets inside a company. If there was something as scandalous as this going on, I think it’s very likely that it would have leaked out from someone within WhatsApp.”\n\nThe Bloomberg article cites reports and interviews from officials within the US Department of Commerce in claiming that the US has investigated whether Meta could read WhatsApp messages. However, a spokesperson for the department called these assertions “unsubstantiated”.\n\nWhatsApp bills itself as an end-to-end encrypted platform, which means that messages can be read only by their sender and recipient, and are not decoded by a server in the middle.\n\nThis contrasts with some other messaging apps, such as Telegram, which encrypt messages between a sender and its own servers, preventing third parties from reading the messages, but allowing them – in theory – to be decoded and read by Telegram itself.\n\nA senior executive in the technology sector told the Guardian that WhatsApp’s vaunted privacy “leaves much to be desired”, given the platform’s willingness to collect metadata on its users, such as their profile information, their contact lists, and who they speak to and when.\n\nHowever, the “idea that WhatsApp can selectively and retroactively access the content of [end-to-end encrypted] individual chats is a mathematical impossibility”, he said.\n\nWoog, of Meta, said: “We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines. WhatsApp’s encryption remains secure and we’ll continue to stand up against those trying to deny people’s right to private communication.”",

The Yellow Jackets (11-10, 2-6 ACC), which lost Tuesday night at Virginia Tech, need a season-defining win to turn things around.\n\nNorth Carolina enjoyed the week off, thanks to an upset win that turned its season around, but players can't dwell for too long. Plenty of teams start rusty after seven days between games, but the Tar Heels will quickly find their footing.\n\nUNC and Georgia Tech last clashed on December 7, 2024 in the ACC opener for both teams. North Carolina won this matchup, 68-65, to snap a 3-game skid.\n\nThis year, the Tar Heels are better poised to be an NCAA Tournament threat, while the Yellow Jackets are struggling towards a fifth-straight absence from the Big Dance.\n\nNorth Carolina sports a younger, deeper lineup led by its post duo of Henri Veesaar and Caleb Wilson, with 3-and-D guys like Jarin Stevenson playing X-factor behind recent success. Georgia Tech also sports a pair of talented forwards, Kowacie Reeves Jr. (15.9 points per game) and Baye Ndongo (11.5 PPG), but team success is lacking.\n\nIf you're in the ATL, see if you can get tickets to Saturday's game. If you're planning to watch tonight's game on TV, your favorite streaming device, listening on the radio or somewhere else, keep reading below for more broadcast information.\n\nRadio: SiriusXM (Channel 193 and 371)\n\nNorth Carolina secured a massive upset at Virginia last weekend, but Georgia Tech is its first opponent in seven days.\n\nHubert Davis finally seems to know his team's best rotations. Wilson continues thriving as a superstar, Derek Dixon is the answer at point guard and Jonathan Powell's effectiveness goes beyond his scoring ability.\n\nThe Tar Heels start sluggish, but quickly take a first-half lead. UNC's perimeter defense continues to respond, free throws improve and the ride back to Chapel Hill is happy.\n\nScore prediction: UNC 89, Georgia Tech 72\n\nOct. 4: Blue-White Scrimmage (White 55, Blue 50)\n\nOct. 24: at BYU (preseason, L 78-76)\n\nOct. 29: vs. Winston-Salem State (preseason, W 95-53)\n\nNov. 3: vs. Central Arkansas (W, 94-54)\n\nNov. 11: vs. Radford (W, 89-74)\n\nNov. 14: vs. NC Central (W, 97-53)\n\nNov. 25: vs. St. Bonaventure in Fort Myers (Florida) Tip-Off (W, 85-70)\n\nNov. 27: vs. Michigan State in Fort Myers (Fla.)

    "fullText": "Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts have claimed social media is intentionally addictive and harmful\n\nSocial media companies will have to answer to a jury – for the first time – for allegations that their products are intentionally addictive and harmful to young users’ mental health. Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.\n\nMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg is among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.\n\nThe initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap and TikTok have settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.\n\n“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nThe legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies from angry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”\n\nThe cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nThere’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.\n\nPlaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\n\nThe trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.\n\n“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thing Meta is doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.\n\nSocial media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however, catalogued compulsive use with severe consequences among young people, and legislators across the world are engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employee compared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.\n\nThe 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes, according to NPR.\n\nLegal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.\n\nStill, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”",

    "fullText": "From the person who scrolls on the toilet to the one without any social media, what do their digital habits tell us?\n\nWill Storr: we have lost so much of ourselves to smartphones – can we get it back?\n\nDayeon, 16: the teenager who spends less than an hour a day on screens\n\nI think my screen time is what adults want their kids to have. I’ve heard some of my friends’ parents tell them, “You should be like that, too.”\n\nI got my first phone when I was 12, as my mum wanted to be able to contact me to pick me up from school. When I got it, I had strict screen time rules: it was turned off after an hour. I still don’t use it much.\n\nI’m not on social media. Instagram and TikTok can lead to a lot of problems for your mental health. I’ve definitely seen friends get self-conscious; double-checking everything they say.\n\nSome friends spend more than six hours a day on social media. They use it to keep in touch and post nice pictures. After school, many scroll on Instagram late into the night, and it sometimes affects how focused they feel the next day. They tell me it’s a good thing I don’t have it so I can focus on school work. Sometimes I feel left out of their conversations, but it doesn’t really affect my relationships with them. They’re not intending to leave me out and they don’t judge me, they just think it’d be easier.\n\nIt is annoying when friends are on their phone while we are hanging out – scrolling on Instagram and talking about what they’re looking at. It’s boring. I don’t understand why people meet up in real life to then look at their phone.\n\nI worry that there’s so much online that’s trackable, which makes me feel uncomfortable. I was part of a dance group in elementary school when I was 10 and now videos of me dancing are still online – I didn’t even know they’d been posted. Even if I type my friends’ names into Google, I can see stuff they did when they were much younger. It’s scary, there’s no way to reset your past.\n\nNeither of my parents have social media. My dad uses screens up to 15 hours a day, because he is a software engineer and is constantly online. But if you took away his work, he probably uses them for around one hour a day for pleasure. My mum uses her phone for around five hours a day for watching shows.\n\nI don’t really worry if my screen time will go up in future. Right now, focusing on my school work and relationships is more important than being on social media. I think even when I am in university or working, I won’t doomscroll. CM\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 30 minutes-1 hour\nComputer None outside of school work\nTV None\n\nShere, 85: the octogenarian whose social life revolves around WhatsApp\n\nI like WhatsApping. Mostly I speak to my family and friends in Trinidad. In the morning I open my messages and say good morning to everyone; I try to find a nice image and emoji to send.\n\nThe phone hooks you in. I’m part of different WhatsApp groups, I’m in one called “Curry and Chips” with the boys. I’ve got TikTok and YouTube on my phone to watch videos they send; some are funny, a lot are rubbish. You get so engrossed. The other day I was making my porridge and it boiled over because I was on my phone.\n\nMy wife died earlier this year; we met when I was 14. Being on my phone doesn’t make me feel less lonely, but it helps me communicate with people, otherwise I don’t speak to anyone. I’ve joined three old people’s groups that operate locally. We organise meet-ups on WhatsApp and swap pictures. Once a week we get together to do some exercise and have breakfast.\n\nI watch westerns every day. My son just gave me a smart TV and I want to learn how to use YouTube on it, so I can find old calypsos. I find typing difficult, so I use Alexa to listen to music and the radio, and set alarms.\n\nThe phone is a must these days and older people need to learn to use it. Everything is online and we’re getting left behind. Doctors send messages online, and we need the NHS app to book appointments.\n\nI check the phone first thing in the morning and before I go to bed. I don’t want to miss texts confirming hospital appointments. I check every day, but then I get sucked into reading and sending messages. I’d like to learn how to use a computer or tablet.\n\nThe downside of the phone is it takes too much of my time. There’s so much rubbish. Some people send too many pictures – ducks in the park, things like that. I don’t need to see everything they do. I don’t like sitting down too much. I’d prefer to do more gardening or housework, and have more energy to spend on my exercise bike.\n\nI worry about the time I spend on my phone. I just get carried away reading messages from people – sometimes it seems as if they have nothing better to do. Also, I don’t like all the adverts and posts from people you don’t know on Instagram – I don’t know why they appear. The family don’t really comment on me using the phone – my son and granddaughter say I use it a lot, but they prefer that I’m active on it. It keeps us in touch. CM\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 3 hours\nComputer None\nTV 2 hours\n\nPippa, 29: the priest who’s big on TikTok\n\nAs a priest, I do see far more phones in church than you might expect. Luckily, my parishioners are very well trained, and I’ve never caught one scrolling during a service so far. But I have had funerals where people’s phones go off – you think, “Come on!”\n\nI’ve been making TikToks for about 18 months. It was my sister who suggested it and at first I was hesitant. We had TikTok accounts and watched other people’s content, but I’d never considered making my own. She said, “You should be a TikTok vicar!” but I thought it would be naff. Besides, in the first half of my curacy I was in a village and I wasn’t sure I’d find enough material. When I moved to my current church in a town, it seemed there was more of a buzz to tap into, and I softened to the idea. As a priest, I don’t think I should sit in church saying, “Well, where is everyone? Why haven’t they come to church this week?” This is a response to me thinking, “OK, where are people? How can I go and engage with them?”\n\nTo start with, it took me hours to film and edit each one, but it’s a pretty slick operation now. One of the first TikToks I made showed me at a Ministry of Sound event on a Saturday night, then cut to me leading a service the next morning – that’s had well over 2.2m views now, and I have more than 30,500 followers. It’s always difficult to tell which ones are going to be a hit – I thought the most recent one was hysterical, so it was a bit dispiriting to check after it had been up for a few hours and find it had only had 500 views. I think that’s just human nature – with anything you’ve worked on, it’s a good feeling to have people go, “Ooooh!!” I’ve seen people suggest a good way to build your followers is to post controversial stuff, even if you don’t believe it, but I think that would be so wrong.\n\nI am still quite bad for checking if each TikTok is getting likes and new followers, but the thing I am very strict about is not looking at the comments any more. On that Ministry of Sound post, for example, one said, “Girl, what in the lukewarm?” with a crying face emoji. “Lukewarm” was being used there as a denunciation, warning other Christians not to be like me, and that comment got close to 24,000 likes. Many people seemed to think it was a genuinely offensive thing for me to have done, though there were lots of positive comments, too. In fact, the event I went to began at 6pm and ended at nine – it wasn’t as if I was out partying all night.\n\nThere was still a story about it in the Sun, though I didn’t realise until the parish administrator messaged me with a link. I had to write an email to my bishop: “Dear Your Grace …” She was lovely about it, very supportive. I’ve since become friends with another vicar from my diocese, David Sims, who also posts on TikTok.\n\nI do spend time scrolling through other people’s TikToks – it’s my most used app, followed by Safari, which will just be me checking my emails, then YouTube, Instagram, WhatsApp.\n\nAs a single person who lives alone, it feels like the only socialising you can do sometimes is through a screen, even if FaceTime isn’t the way you want to do it. I open my Hinge app every evening, but unless I start messaging someone, I’ll just sift through people’s profiles with half an eye. I make a point of staying off my phone if I’m with friends or my parents – not just because it’s rude not to give people your full attention, but because when you don’t share a living space with someone, you appreciate the company more. In terms of my friends, my screen time is somewhere in the middle of the bell curve. I think I have quite a low threshold for looking at them – I get a bit of a headache if I do it for too long. Maybe my eyes aren’t used to it – my sister stares at a screen all day for her work, whereas I spend a lot of time talking to people face-to-face. I can feel it when I’ve hit that time; I think, “I need to switch off now and read a book.” CB\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone Up to 4 hours\nComputer 3 hours 10 minutes\nTV 1 hour (plus occasional bingeing)\n\nPaula, 40: the stay-at-home mother who is hooked on phone games\n\nFor me, screen time is a release from the routine – I live on a farm with kids aged 13 and five, so every day it’s house chores, kids bouncing around, dogs barking. Gaming is my “me” time – I play a war game called Puzzles & Chaos on my phone for around four hours a day, which involves strategically building kingdoms and attacking others. I only do it when I have pockets of time – dropping one kid off, picking the other up, making a coffee.\n\nSome friends look at me like I have two heads when I say I game. Because I’m 40, and have a busy life, they wonder why I don’t do other activities instead – but I work out every day, I’m an avid reader, and I have stacks of things to do in the house. Honestly, I don’t care what people think. I have racing thoughts 24/7. Gaming brings me some quiet. I’m challenging my brain while not thinking about other things. Sure, everything in excess is bad, but if you play the right amount of time, it’s stimulating.\n\nI don’t spend much time doing other things on screens, apart from some TV. I have Facebook, but social media is irrelevant and gets boring. It’s just people posting the same things – food, pictures of places, or just whining. The game is strategic and much more proactive. I crave something that fills my brain up other than just doomscrolling.\n\nI’m born and bred in Spain, where I was in the army. When I met my British husband, I left everything to build a life with him in the UK, but I don’t game because I’m lonely. I have lots of friends here. I’m just a selectively sociable person. Sometimes I make plans with friends, then two hours later I’m regretting it!\n\nIn the game I play, you can’t do anything individually, you have to join with other players to plan attacks and win points. We’ve created a community that’s amazing. My alliance is mostly women. I like that you can talk to other gamers with no judgment. Everyone has stuff going on at home – people who have lost a relative, or are recovering from an illness. We can message within the game, but can’t send screenshots, so we also use Discord and WhatsApp.\n\nI don’t get a dopamine rush when I game, or get too hyped up. Sometimes, winning and losing battles can affect my mood, but not in a big way. My friends in the game know that real life comes first. CM\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 4 hours\nComputer None\nTV 1 hour\n\nBarnaby, 43: the tech CEO who’s deeply offline\n\nI don’t generally look at a screen until after 10am. I’ve built “buffer time” into my mornings where I don’t have plans and don’t use any tech. I wake around 6.30am, spend time with my children, take a walk, exercise. For years, my mornings were a smartphone-induced blur – I used to be immediately checking the news, responding to emails or Slack messages. I always felt behind, even from the first minute of the day. Now, generally, the first time I engage with a screen is after I get to my office.\n\nEven there, I work off a paper to-do list. At the end of each week I write down the top five things I want to do the following week and use that as a guide. I used to have about 300 tasks on a content management system that I’d struggle to get through, but a bout of severe depression made me reassess how I worked.\n\nI suppose an unhealthy relationship with screens began when I started my first tech business, aged 17. It was a web hosting company. I would come home from college at 3pm and work on the business until 7am, then sleep for an hour and go back to college. By 2018 I was turning over millions with my second company,Time etc, and thought I’d cracked the code to work-life balance. Less than five years later, everything caught up with me and I had a “breakdown” of sorts. I was checking emails all day and well into the night. I was always available via instant messaging, and even when I wasn’t working I was doomscrolling the news. I became completely overwhelmed.\n\nThat was three years ago; eventually I saw I needed to get rid of my phone. I have hundreds of people who might need to contact me, so it wasn’t realistic to be completely offline, but I realised I could be more selective.\n\nNow, I don’t browse the internet. This means no news and no social media – I might look at my phone to play music, but otherwise it’s not a big part of my day any more. If there’s an important news story, I know someone will tell me about it eventually. In fact, I’ve ended up having these beautiful, curious conversations with people. For years I was like, “Yeah, I’ve seen that” whenever anyone mentioned a news story. Now, someone will say, “Did you see the budget?” and I’ll reply, “No, tell me about it, what is your opinion?” So I have a lot more rich, human, old-school conversations about the world than I ever did before.\n\nI only spend an hour a week on email. I don’t have email on my phone or MacBook, only my desktop. I complete as many tasks as I can in person or via a phone call.\n\nSlack was ruining my life – constant notifications, constant buzzing, someone always needed something – so I stopped using it. At first, my anxiety was really strong – “I need to be connected because something bad might happen.” I was addicted to scanning for messages for probably 25 years, so it was hard to just let go – but nothing bad happened when I freed myself from that habit. I’ve never missed an important update, and if the fact that I’m slower to reply annoys anyone, they haven’t told me about it.\n\nMy partner is fully supportive even if I’m not always contactable. I got out of a depression directly off the back of making these changes, so it’s been a huge net positive.\n\nI’ve found the time and space to do things with my children. My daughter and I are doing a painting project in her room, for instance – we just hang out and chat rubbish. My temper is at a different base to where it was when I was constantly behind and felt as if my phone was shouting at me from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep. AJ\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 1 hour 30 minutes\nComputer Five to six hours\nTV None\n\nKatrina, 31: the social media manager who’s always online\n\nI’m reaching for my phone from the moment I open my eyes at 7am. I check the news, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, X and Facebook. I scroll as I brush my teeth and get dressed. I check emails and messages as I walk to the station and more news during my commute.\n\nAt work I’m triple screening – I switch between my phone, iPad and desktop. I count this as “giving my eyes a break” – they have recently started watering at random moments and I think it’s because I focus on a tiny screen for hours each day. Bigger screens and blue-blocking glasses help my eyes relax. I’ve had other physical effects from so much screen time, too – my back hurts, my shoulders hurt, I feel as if I’m getting a buffalo hump.\n\nMost of the time I feel shackled to my phone and it’s tragic. Adding up the hours of screentime is embarrassing, but it’s necessary in my industry. I take my phone to the bathroom so I can scroll on the toilet (I think most people do this, they just don’t admit it). And there are good parts – going viral feels amazing; waking up to a post that’s had 1m views overnight is a huge dopamine rush. In 2024, I organised a Harry Styles lookalike contest in London. It blew up, it made global news – that’s the power of social media.\n\nLike most people who make themselves visible online, I’ve been trolled. I’ve had death threats and some really personal comments about being in an interracial relationship. I read them all, I just don’t let them bother me. If someone says something mean to me online I just think, “That’s not real, so I don’t care.”\n\nFor a while I got into a habit of waking in the night to check news alerts – there was a period of rising tension between India and Pakistan which caused me a lot of anxiety. Now when I’m looking at my phone in bed, my husband will put his hands on my eyes and say, “It’s time to put your phone away.” Sometimes I just wait until he’s fallen asleep and get it back out.

    "fullText": "Need something brilliant to read this weekend? Here are six of our favourite pieces from the last seven days\n\nDecisions outsourced, chatbots for friends, the natural world an afterthought: Silicon Valley is giving us life void of connection. There is a way out, wrote Rebecca Solnit in this beautiful long read, but it’s going to take collective effort.\n\nA backlash against gentle parenting had been brewing for some time and some mothers on social media are advocating a tough, no-nonsense approach to parenting. Does this teach children important lessons – or just make them feel isolated and ashamed? Emine Saner on the rise of “Fafo” parenting.\n\nA special piece on Guardian cartoonists Ella Baron and Martin Rowson saw the pair face off, each producing very different cartoons in response to a prompt about Trump. We showed readers how two different generations of cartoonists operate: one in pixels, one in paint.\n\n“When I see washed-out photographs of English life in the 60s and 70s – cardiganed grandmothers eating roadside picnics beside Morris Minors, pale men sunbathing in shoes and socks on stripy deckchairs, Raleigh Choppers and caged budgerigars and faux leather pouffes – I feel a wave of what can’t properly be called nostalgia, because the last thing I’d want is to return to that age and those places where I was often profoundly unhappy and from which I’d have been desperate to escape if escape had been a possibility. Why then this longing, this echo of some remembered comfort?”\n\nThis remarkable piece of writing by Mark Haddon, author of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was an achingly sad exploration of a childhood shaped by his parents’ lack of warmth.\n\nAfter a very hard landing into fame in the 00s, he decided to take a softer approach – and hit on a winning formula for classic comedy with Detectorists. The actor spoke to Zoe Williams about his obsession with middle-age and the “PTSD” on rewatching his breakout role in The Office.\n\n“In recent years Patrick Bateman – specifically Christian Bale’s movie persona – has become a kind of aspirational figure for the very same men he was designed to mock …”\n\nAs the stage adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’s notorious and misunderstood bestseller returns to the London stage, Tim Jonze explored how its tale of 80s yuppie nihilism feels more relevant than ever in the era of Andrew Tate, Trump and tech bros.",

    "fullText": "It looks like 2026 could be a banger year for IPOs.\n\nAfter a slowdown in blockbuster public debuts, two of the most closely watched private tech companies are expected to go public this year: SpaceX and OpenAI.\n\nWhile reports last year suggested both companies would go public in 2026, recent developments have fueled speculation about when and how it could happen.\n\nAlso on Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported OpenAI was planning for an IPO in the fourth quarter as it races to beat Anthropic, an AI competitor, to market.\n\nHere's what smart people in tech and business are saying about the potential IPOs of two of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nChamath Palihapitiya, a prominent venture capitalist and former Facebook exec, said, \"A merger between SpaceX and Tesla would instantly create the Berkshire Hathaway of the modern century.\"\n\n\"The capital raising and operational efficiencies if both were together are obvious,\" Palihapitiya wrote on X. \"If this were to happen, it would also bring us one step closer to having one equity instrument for all things Elon, which many would want to buy.\"\n\nA merger between SpaceX and Tesla would instantly create the Berkshire Hathaway of the modern century.The capital raising and operational efficiencies if both were together are obvious. If this were to happen, it would also bring us one step closer to having one equity…\n\nEric Berger, the senior space editor at Ars Technica, said talks of a merger between SpaceX and xAI shouldn't be a \"huge surprise.\"\n\n\"If you believe AI is the future; and that compute is the major problem to solve; and orbital data centers are feasible—then the combined company would be a vertically integrated AI colossus,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe reported merger talks between SpaceX and xAI should not come as a huge surprise. If you believe AI is the future; and that compute is the major problem to solve; and orbital data centers are feasible—then the combined company would be a vertically integrated AI colossus.\n\nNoah Smith, a former Bloomberg journalist who now writes a popular economics substack, shared his concerns over OpenAI's future success in a post titled \"What if AI succeeds but OpenAI fails?\"\n\nAn OpenAI IPO will raise \"many more billions in cash, this time from regular investors,\" said Smith, but Sam Altman's company could be \"an early leader that flames out.\"\n\n\"Even if AI technology and the AI industry as a whole succeed wildly, OpenAI might not be the company that wins the race. That could leave a lot of investors holding the bag,\" he said.\n\n\"It could also cause a temporary — but unwarranted — chill in AI investment in the US, allowing Chinese companies to take the lead.\"\n\nRoss Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told The Information that he would not purchase SpaceX stock if the company goes public.\n\nSpaceX is \"not really a great business in the sense of profitability,\" said Gerber. \"To pay a trillion and a half dollars for a space company that does $15 billion in revenue is just insanity.\"\n\n\"If you're going to pay 2x or 3x just because it's Elon's company, I wish you the best of luck, and it's not something I am going to do,\" he said.",

Three capabilities underpin this shift: real time visibility into how work actually happens, digital twins that enable rapid experimentation without disrupting operations, and agentic AI systems that execute and adapt workflows. High-fidelity operational models replace simplified assumptions, giving leaders an accurate picture of current processes. Digital twins extend this visibility into a learning environment where new workflows, materials, and layouts can be tested at low risk, compressing validation cycles and increasing experimentation. Autonomous agents then handle execution tasks that require perception, prediction, and judgment, reducing coordination friction and allowing redesigned processes to operate with greater adaptability.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Smartwatches, Oura rings, smart home devices and Fitbits being weaponised, says Refuge\n\nDomestic abusers are increasingly using AI, smartwatches and other technology to attack and control their victims, a domestic abuse charity says.\n\nRecord numbers of women who were abused and controlled through technology were referred to Refuge’s specialist services during the last three months of 2025, including a 62% increase in the most complex cases to total 829 women. There was also a 24% increase in referrals of under-30s.\n\nRecent cases included perpetrators using wearable tech such as smartwatches, Oura rings and Fitbits to track and stalk women, disrupting their lives through smart home devices that control lights and heating, and using AI spoofing apps to impersonate people.\n\nEmma Pickering, head of the tech-facilitated abuse team at Refuge, said: “Time and again, we see what happens when devices go to market without proper consideration of how they might be used to harm women and girls. It is currently far too easy for perpetrators to access and weaponise smart accessories, and our frontline teams are seeing the devastating consequences of this abuse.\n\n“It is unacceptable for the safety and wellbeing of women and girls to be treated as an afterthought once a technology has been developed and distributed. Their safety must be a foundational principle shaping both the design of wearable technology and the regulatory frameworks that surround it.”\n\nRefuge said it was far too easy to access and weaponise smart accessories and that women’s safety needed to be factored into their design.\n\nOne survivor Refuge worked with, Mina, left behind her smartwatch in a rush to flee her abuser, who then used it to track her by using linked cloud accounts to locate her emergency accommodation.\n\n“[It] was deeply shocking and frightening. I felt suddenly exposed and unsafe, knowing that my location was being tracked without my consent. It created a constant sense of paranoia; I couldn’t relax, sleep properly, or feel settled anywhere because I knew my movements weren’t private,” she said.\n\nDespite police returning the device to Mina, she was located at her next refuge by a private investigator hired by her abuser, using suspected tracking via technology. She reported the breaches to police but was told no crime had been committed because she had “not come to any harm”.\n\n“I was repeatedly asked to move for my safety, rather than the technology being dealt with directly or the smart watch being confiscated from him. Each move made me feel more unstable and displaced,” she said.\n\n“Overall, the experience left me feeling unsafe, unheard, and responsible for managing a situation that was completely out of my control. It showed me how tech abuse can quietly and powerfully extend coercive control, and how easily survivors can be left to carry the emotional and practical burden when systems don’t fully understand or respond to it.”\n\nAbusers were also increasingly using AI tools to manipulate survivors, Pickering said. For example, they might alter a video of the survivor so that she appeared drunk, enabling them to tell social services that “she’s acting erratic again, slurring speech, she’s got a drink problem” and that she was therefore an unfit mother or a risk to herself and others. “We’ll see more and more of that as these videos and applications advance,” Pickering said.\n\nPickering said she had also heard of AI tools being used to develop authentic-looking fraudulent documents, for example job offers or legal summons, which can be sent to survivors to make them believe they are in debt, or to persuade them to turn up to the same location as their abuser.\n\nPickering feared that in coming years, medical tech would increasingly be misused, for example by controlling insulin levels through a diabetes tracker, which can be fatal.\n\nShe urged the government to act on digital technology-enabled and online crimes, including providing more funding to develop and train digital investigations teams. “They want short-term wins, they don’t want to think about longer-term investment in this area, but if we don’t do that we’ll never get ahead,” she said.\n\nShe also wants to see the technology industry held to account for failing to ensure devices and platforms are designed and function in ways that are safe for vulnerable people.\n\n“Ofcom and the Online Safety Act don’t go far enough,” she said.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Tackling violence against women and girls in all its forms, including when it takes place online or is facilitated by technology, is a top priority for this government.\n\n“Our new VAWG strategy sets out how the full power of the state will be deployed online and offline. We are working with Ofcom to set out how online platforms tackle the disproportionate abuse women and girls face online.”",

    "fullText": "The Institute for Public Policy Research also argues that tech companies must pay publishers for content they use\n\nAI-generated news should carry “nutrition” labels and tech companies must pay publishers for the content they use, according to a left-of-centre thinktank, amid rising use of the technology as a source for current affairs.\n\nThe Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said AI firms were rapidly emerging as the new “gatekeepers” of the internet and intervention was needed to create a healthy AI news environment.\n\nIt recommended standardised labels for AI-generated news, showing what information had been used to create those answers, including peer-reviewed studies and articles from professional news organisations. It also urged the establishment of a licensing regime in the UK allowing publishers to negotiate with tech companies over the use of their content in AI news.\n\n“If AI companies are going to profit from journalism and shape what the public sees, they must be required to pay fairly for the news they use and operate under clear rules that protect plurality, trust and the long-term future of independent journalism,” said Roa Powell, senior research fellow at IPPR and the report’s co-author.\n\nThe IPPR said work on licensing could begin with the UK’s competition regulator using its new enforcement powers over Google. The Competition and Markets Authority this week proposed giving web publishers and news organisations the power to stop Google scraping their content for its overviews. Collective licensing deals would ensure a wide range of publishers were included, the IPPR added.\n\nGoogle’s AI overviews now reach 2 billion users a month and approximately a quarter of people use AI to get information, according to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.\n\n“With the right policies in place, the government can shape this market so that UK news organisations transition their business models for the AI age and AI companies improve the reliability of their products by drawing on trusted sources,” said the report.\n\nIPPR tested four AI tools – ChatGPT, Google AI overviews, Google Gemini and Perplexity – by entering 100 news-related queries into those platforms and analysing more than 2,500 links produced by the AI responses.\n\nChatGPT and Gemini did not cite journalism by the BBC, which has blocked the bots they use to assemble answers, while overviews and Perplexity used BBC content despite the broadcaster’s objections to those tools using its journalism.\n\nThe IPPR found the Telegraph, GB News, the Sun and the Daily Mail were cited in fewer than 4% of answers on ChatGPT, while the Guardian – which has a licensing deal with ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI – was used as a source in nearly six out of 10 responses. The Financial Times, which also has a licensing deal with OpenAI, also featured highly. The Guardian was also the most common source used by Gemini, appearing in half of all answers.\n\nGoogle’s use of AI summaries at the top of search results has affected click-through traffic for publishers, with a knock-on effect for their revenues, because many users read the overview without moving on to the original journalism.\n\nThe IPPR said questions needed to be asked about how financial relationships between AI companies and news providers shaped answers.\n\n“If licensed publications appear more prominently in AI answers, there is a risk of locking out smaller and local news providers, who are less likely to get AI deals,” the report said.\n\nIPPR added that while licensing deals could replace lost advertising revenues to an extent, they would not maintain a healthy news ecosystem. They could make news organisations dependent on tech giants for revenue and that income could easily disappear if copyright protections are weakened, said the thinktank.\n\nThe IPPR said there should be public funding to create new business models for investigative news and local news, whose sustainability could be threatened by the rise of AI news, and for the BBC to “innovate with AI”.",

    "fullText": "The global memory chip shortage is catching up with Apple, Tim Cook says.\n\nThe Apple CEO said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that Apple is beginning to feel the effects of the memory shortage crisis, with rising prices expected to put pressure on margins ahead.\n\nThe warning comes amid blockbuster demand for Apple's newest products. Customer response to the latest iPhone lineup \"exceeded our expectations,\" with iPhone revenue jumping 23%, Cook said on the call Thursday.\n\nApple reported revenue of $143.76 billion and earnings per share of $2.84, beating analyst estimates.\n\nThe staggering iPhone demand left Apple exiting the December quarter with \"very lean\" inventory, pushing the company into what Cook described as \"supply chase mode.\"\n\nCook said the biggest constraint is the limited access to advanced chipmaking nodes used to produce Apple's system-on-a-chip processors. Higher demand has also reduced flexibility across Apple's supply chain, he said.\n\nMemory shortages played a minimal role in Apple's December-quarter margins, but their impact is expected to grow, Cook added.\n\nThe company expects memory costs to weigh more heavily on margins in the second quarter, contributing to its forecast gross margin range of 48% to 49%. Apple posted a gross margin of about 48% in the December quarter.\n\n\"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.\"\n\nApple's stock price rose about 2% after hours following the results on Thursday.\n\nCook's comments come as the tech industry grapples with a worsening global shortage of memory chips.\n\nAI companies, smartphone makers, and PC manufacturers are competing for the same pool of memory components, which are critical not just for consumer electronics but also for powering large language models and other AI systems. That surge in demand has sent prices climbing.\n\nAt CES 2026 last month, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the memory storage market as \"completely unserved.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nThe Korea Economic Daily reported in January that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are seeking server DRAM price hikes of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Market analysis firm Counterpoint also said last month that memory prices could climb as much as 40% through the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\nThe rapid buildout of AI infrastructure marks a break from the industry's traditional \"boom-and-bust cycles.\"\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "title": "I was laid off by Amazon and landed a new role 2 weeks later. Here's my advice for other laid-off tech workers.",
    "description": "After being laid off by Amazon in October 2025, Iren Azra Zou landed a new job two weeks later. She shared her top advice for other laid-off workers.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Iren Azra Zou, a 27-year-old in New Jersey. She is a founding engineer at tech startup Double Nickel, and previously worked as a software engineer at Amazon until being laid off in October 2025. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe day before Amazon announced layoffs in October, there were rumors that something big was coming.\n\nI had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be affected, even though I felt I was performing well and had met my goals earlier than expected. I'd been laid off from my previous tech job the year prior, in 2024, and I knew how, in situations like these, people can quickly become just numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\nIt was hard to sleep that night, and the next morning, I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off, which the message soon confirmed.\n\nThe first person I told was my husband, who was next to me in bed. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers to figure out who else had been affected. When I found out that some rock stars on my team had also been laid off, I was shocked.\n\nI was mentally prepared for my layoff — due to the speculation that cuts were coming — but I was also financially prepared.\n\nMy husband and I had taken steps to save aggressively and ensure we had enough savings to last for a while if we were both laid off. That financial cushion helped me stay calm when I found out I'd lost my job.\n\nI made a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, and sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic.\n\nI quickly started looking for new job opportunities, and two weeks later, I landed and accepted an offer to start a software engineering role in December.\n\nHere's my advice for anyone who's recently been laid off:\n\nWhen you get laid off, you can't help but ask yourself, \"Why me?\"\n\nEventually, you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table; a layoff didn't erase that.\n\nI was prepared for interviewers to ask about my Amazon layoff, but it didn't really come up. I think other companies recognized the scale of the layoff and that it wasn't performance-based, in many cases. I also think that, despite the layoff, having a household name like Amazon on my résumé was probably helpful.\n\nReflect on what you want in your next role and create a targeted job search plan to maximize your chances of landing it. I wanted to make sure I found the right fit, so this was really helpful for me.\n\nUpon reflection, I decided that the best fit for me might be at a smaller company with less bureaucracy than Amazon — and where I could better see the impact of my work.\n\nThe pro of working at a big company was that you could do one thing and it could affect millions of people in less than 30 minutes, which was exciting. However, the downside was that it sometimes felt like you were a very tiny piece in a giant machine.\n\nI was also hoping to land a remote role. For the last few months of my time at Amazon, I'd been required to commute one hour each way from New Jersey to the New York City office five days a week, which was really draining. I figured I might have more leverage to ask for remote flexibility at a smaller company than at Amazon, where so many people are competing for job postings.\n\nMy team at Amazon also didn't have many women, so I wanted to be in a place with a bit more diversity.\n\nI narrowed down my target: a software engineering role at a small company that offered remote flexibility — and where I felt I could grow and thrive.\n\nThis is not the time to be shy — most people will be sympathetic and eager to support you.\n\nI believe my LinkedIn presence — where I'm very active, posting career advice tailored to young professionals — helped me boost my visibility.\n\nThe day after my layoff, the chief technology officer of Double Nickel — a tech startup focused on truck driver recruitment — reached out to me on LinkedIn about a software engineering role they were hiring for. She said she'd seen my post-layoff LinkedIn post and, as a former Amazon employee herself, decided to reach out.\n\nThe role seemed like a good fit, so I applied and quickly landed an interview.\n\nFollowing the interviews, I was given an offer, which I accepted. We agreed to an arrangement where I'd work in a hybrid setup for the first few months to help with onboarding, and then transition to remote work around the end of February. So far, I'm very happy with the role.\n\nLooking back, I see the layoff as a turning point because it helped me clarify what I wanted in my next role. It was still a difficult experience, but I felt more grounded and optimistic as time went on — and ultimately landed a role I feel great about.",

The combination would bring Musk’s rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and Grok AI chatbot under one roof, according to a person briefed on the matter and two ​recent company filings seen by Reuters.\n\nHow could space-based data centers reduce AI costs?\n\nWhat would the proposed SpaceX-xAI merger involve?\n\nWhat defense applications are planned for merged companies?\n\nWhy is Musk combining his different business ventures?\n\nThe plan, which Reuters is reporting exclusively, would give fresh momentum to SpaceX’s effort to launch data centers into orbit as Musk battles for supremacy in the rapidly ‌escalating AI race against tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI.\n\nMusk, the world's richest man, is the CEO of both the private space company SpaceX and the artificial intelligence company xAI, which controls his social media platform X. He also runs electric automaker Tesla, tunnel ‌company The Boring Co. and neurotechnology company Neuralink.\n\nMusk, SpaceX, and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnder the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX. Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction, the person said.\n\nCorporate filings in Nevada show that those entities were set up on January 21. One of them, a limited liability company, lists SpaceX and Bret Johnsen, the company's chief financial officer, as managing members, while the other lists Johnsen as the company's only officer, the filings show.\n\nThe filings don't contain additional information about the purpose of the companies ⁠or their role in any deal.\n\nJohnsen did not respond to a Reuters ‌request for comment.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential, said that some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal. A final agreement, however, hasn't been signed, and the timing and structure of the transaction remain fluid, the person cautioned.\n\nSpaceX is already the world's most ‍valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reuters and other media have reported that SpaceX plans to go public some time this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion.\n\nThrough xAI, Musk is building out a massive supercomputer for AI training in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI as part of the startup’s $5 billion equity ​fundraising, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.",

    "fullText": "Rampant speculation and massive overinvestment in AI have created a financial threat of cosmic proportions — and the fallout will be catastrophic, Erik Gordon has warned.\n\n\"The AI bubble is almost as big as the planet Jupiter,\" Gordon, an entrepreneurship professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said in a Wednesday email to Business Insider.\n\n\"When it bursts, the debris will be everywhere,\" he continued. \"Big, institutional investors will be hit with it, and so will individual investors who bet the bubble would get even bigger.\"\n\nGordon pointed to Microsoft stock, which tumbled more than 6% after the software giant's earnings beat on Wednesday. It was trading around 12% lower at 12:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, marking one of the sharpest intraday declines in the company's history.\n\nMicrosoft's shares sank \"because of the truckloads of cash it is investing in AI,\" Gordon said. \"That is a warning of the burst to come.\"\n\nThe cloud-computing titan's net cash used in investing surged 95% year-on-year to over $57 billion in the six months to December. That was fueled by its addition of $49 billion worth of property and equipment such as data centers.\n\nPrior to their post-earnings slump, Microsoft's shares had roughly doubled since the start of 2023, lifting the company's market value to over $3.5 trillion.\n\nOther AI stocks have surged even faster over that timeframe. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia have vaulted 13-fold, valuing the company at close to $4.7 trillion — more than 20 times its projected revenue for the fiscal year ended January 25.\n\nPalantir stock has jumped about 25-fold, giving the data-analysis company a $375 billion market value, or around 85 times its forecasted revenue for 2025.\n\nGordon told Business Insider in an email last week that he doesn't expect the AI bubble to burst in the next few months, as investors still have enough cash to \"prop it up,\" and technological advances remain \"exciting enough to distract\" from irrational valuations.\n\nThe veteran professor has previously rung the alarm on an \"order-of-magnitude overvaluation bubble,\" and warned that when it pops, the \"suffering will be more painful\" for investors than the aftermath of the dot-com bubble. But stocks have largely defied his warnings and continued to march higher.",

Others donated large sums on various days in January, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and PayPal CEO Max Levchin, who donated $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nOthers in the list include DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, and Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr.\n\nBrin's multimillion-dollar donation comes ahead of California's vote on a measure that would levy a one-time, 5% tax on billionaires in the state. The tax, due in 2027, would be imposed retroactively from January 1 this year.\n\nGroups like the one Brin donated to are part of a concerted push by billionaires to negate the need for the wealth tax, either by funding alternative programs or by funneling money into political action committees opposed to the measure.\n\nReactions to the potential tax have been mixed. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he's \"perfectly fine\" with it, saying this month that Silicon Valley's talent pool was worth any taxes.\n\nHowever, other executives have taken a more defensive stance. Brin and Google's other cofounder, Larry Page, moved an LLC they are both tied to from California to Delaware in December.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said the tax would be \"horrendous\" for innovation. White House AI czar David Sacks said the tax, if enacted, would be akin to an \"asset seizure.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that Palantir's chairman, Peter Thiel, donated $3 million to the California Business Roundtable in December, which has directly opposed the wealth tax.\n\nRepresentatives for the executives did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

January 2024 saw more than 34,000 tech layoffs across 123 companies, according to the online tracker Layoffs.fyi — a monthly total that hasn't been exceeded since.\n\nHowever, tech workers don't typically face a job market this challenging. US businesses are hiring at one of the lowest rates since 2013, and tech job postings have plunged amid economic uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption.\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken with dozens of laid-off workers — including people from Big Tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Many told me they'd built their careers in a tech landscape where job security could be elusive, but opportunities were plentiful. Some said finding a new role used to be as simple as opening LinkedIn and replying to the recruiters who regularly flooded their inboxes.\n\nNow, despite impressive résumés and big-name credentials, many laid-off tech workers are struggling to land their next roles.\n\nLast year, US tech companies announced roughly 154,000 layoffs, per Challenger, 15% more than in 2024 and the most of any private-sector industry. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla each announced plans in recent years to cut at least 10,000 employees.\n\nThis adds up to too many workers flooding the market and not enough jobs. It's affected people like James Hwang, who has struggled to find work since being laid off from his IT support engineering role at Amazon in October. Although his résumé sports years of experience at Amazon, he said it's not as helpful as one might think.\n\n\"It felt like there was this huge brick wall from the get-go,\" said Hwang, who's 28 and lives in Michigan. \"I applied to 100 jobs but didn't get any interviews.\"\n\nWorkers in Hwang's line of work have had abundant job opportunities in years past, but now tech companies are getting leaner and expecting more. They're rightsizing after overhiring during the pandemic, taking longer to fill roles, and citing a need to be more efficient in the AI age. At the same time, the US has seen a decline in tech openings, down 33% on Indeed from early 2020 levels as of December.\n\n\"It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman,\" said Mody Khan, who has been looking for work since losing his Microsoft job in December 2024. He said he's depleted much of his savings and fears he could lose his home.\n\nDespite a five-year run at Microsoft, he said, even landing interviews has been difficult. Among the many challenges he's faced during his job search, Khan said, is that some companies he's interviewed with have seemed to favor candidates with startup backgrounds — making his time at a large tech firm feel like a disadvantage in those cases.\n\nTech workers who've experienced layoffs throughout their careers consistently pointed to one challenge that stands out in today's market: the sheer level of competition.\n\nSriram Ramkrishna was laid off from Intel for a second time last July and has been looking for work ever since. He said he has a clearer sense of his career identity than after his first layoff in 2016, but that the job market is more competitive than anything he's ever experienced.\n\n\"If an employer I'm interested in posts a job, there's bound to be at least 400 applicants,\" said Ramkrishna, who's in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon.\n\nWhile most laid-off workers I've spoken with have faced more challenging job searches than they expected, others have eventually found work.\n\nWhen Deborah Henderson was laid off from Microsoft after 14 years, she shared the news on LinkedIn and helped start a Discord group for other affected colleagues. She said connecting with others provided emotional support and helped surface new job opportunities — including a referral for a role at Meta that she landed just two months after being laid off.\n\n\"It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows,\" said Hendersen, who's in her 40s and lives in Seattle.\n\nMike Kostersitz, on the other hand, struggled to find a new role after 31 years at Microsoft. He felt like a fish out of water in the job market, so he decided to hire a career coach to help him build a résumé, update his LinkedIn profile, draft cover letters, and tailor his materials for applicant tracking systems.\n\nIn particular, he added, it was difficult to know which parts of his Microsoft experience to highlight in interviews.\n\n\"It's like, I have 30 years of stories for you. Which one do you want to hear?\" said Kostersitz, who's in his 60s and lives in Washington state.\n\nKostersitz said he eventually expanded his search to tech roles at large corporations outside Big Tech. After six months, he landed a role at Nike.\n\nHis top piece of advice for job seekers is something he first heard from a career advisor provided through Microsoft's layoff package: develop a solid job search strategy — and stick with it.\n\n\"They said it's a game of chicken right now. The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job.\"",

    "description": "Jide Adebowale navigated a challenging job market after leaving his federal job in 2025. He ultimately found a tech role in Northern Virginia.",
    "fullText": "My 2025 was dominated by the tough decision to leave my job with the federal government in February. After signing the paperwork and moving on, I began thinking about what was next.\n\nI enjoyed some time off and dipped my toes back into the job market. I took occasional recruiter calls and experimented with freelance writing while spending time in Mexico City and Rio.\n\nSuddenly, headlines about a softening job market began to stack up. A year later, many of those same concerns still dominate the conversation. As coverage of layoffs, hiring freezes, and longer job searches became more common, I put my foot on the accelerator.\n\nI now work as a compensation analyst in the tech sector, but I had to expand my search to find this job.\n\nPrevious job searches had taught me the importance of patience and resilience. It's a numbers game. Leverage your network. The right opportunity is out there. I appreciated those general truths going in.\n\nWhen I encountered the familiar dance of recruiters who seemed enthusiastic and then went silent, I was prepared for it. Even an especially eye-roll-worthy sequence with an exciting tech company didn't throw me off: an interview scheduled and canceled at the last minute, a later request to reschedule, a coding assignment completed, and then no response.\n\nWhat proved far more difficult was the uncertainty behind it all. I couldn't tell which signals mattered. Was the job market softening because of tariffs? Because of AI? Were we heading toward a recession? Was white-collar work itself undergoing a more permanent shift? Was a referral the only way to get a job? I wasn't sure what information to anchor to.\n\nLiving in New York City at the time, I knew I was in a competitive job market, but I also assumed it was abundant. Even if there were millions of job seekers in New York, I thought there would be millions of jobs to match them. I began to wonder whether that assumption actually held.\n\nThe idea that I would find my next role in New York had been a fundamental part of my decision to leave the government in the first place, but over time, the signals I saw began to complicate that picture.\n\nI read an article that said New York City hadn't added any new jobs in the first half of the year. Having just left a role analyzing job gains and losses across the country, I was aware of how uneven labor markets could be.\n\nI also found myself thinking about my parents and how often they had moved for work. First from Nigeria, and then multiple times within the US, they had never anchored their decisions to a single city. They went where opportunity was. City preference came second.\n\nI still had no desire to leave New York. I loved the city, but as my buyout runway shortened, I needed a new approach.\n\nIt was time to run a labor market experiment.\n\nAt first, my expansion was modest. I looked at Philadelphia, where rent was cheaper, and Chicago, which seemed like New York lite.\n\nThe responses began to pick up. What started as a regional adjustment quickly became a national search. The Sun Belt felt abundant. Interview invites began to come from companies in Phoenix, Houston, and Nashville.\n\nMomentum was building. Geography was no longer a limiting factor. I continued applying in New York, but the priority had shifted. I wasn't optimizing for location anymore. I was optimizing for the best opportunity.\n\nI hadn't initially included Washington, D.C., in my expanded search because I knew firsthand how many federal employees were newly seeking work.\n\nWhat I didn't fully appreciate was how much the D.C. job market had evolved over the years. D.C. wasn't just a government town anymore; it was home to a rapidly growing concentration of banking and technology jobs, both within the city and in Northern Virginia.\n\nAfter weighing several cities, recruiter conversations, and potential paths forward, I accepted a new role as a compensation analyst at a tech company in Northern Virginia, which was a lateral move for me.\n\nAfter years of analyzing jobs and wages across industries and regions for the federal government, I would now be applying that lens inside a single organization, focused more narrowly on how compensation decisions play out in practice within a fast-moving, technology-driven business. The search was officially over.\n\nMany of the articles I'd read about the job market focused on how difficult things had become for new college graduates. Having just gone through a challenging search myself, I could appreciate that reality.\n\nWhat stood out to me was how central geographic mobility had been to my own outcome, even with several years of experience at a well-respected government agency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to lean on.\n\nMoving isn't an option for everyone, and I resisted it at first, but it struck me as a lever that younger workers could consider. Data shows people move far less frequently than they once did, even as opportunities have spread across more regional labor markets. Historically, going where opportunity is has been one of the most reliable ways to create a new path forward, and it turned out to be the key to my search.\n\nI live in D.C. and commute to Northern Virginia. I found the cost-of-living adjustment relatively manageable compared with New York. Citywide salaries are only modestly lower, while rents are noticeably lower, and the rental market feels much more favorable to tenants. Finding an apartment was relatively easy for me.\n\nThe past year was defined by transition; the next will be about building. I plan to spend most of 2026 getting settled into my new job and life in D.C.",

    "title": "The questions Leonis Capital investors ask to see if a startup's tech actually holds up",
    "description": "Leonis Capital founders Jenny Xiao and Jay Zhao tell Business Insider what they ask AI startup founders to evaluate their tech.",
    "fullText": "If you hadn't heard, there's an AI race sweeping through Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile stalwarts like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, and newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, are grabbing the headlines as they unveil model after model, there are plenty of startups trying to find a foothold.\n\nFor investors, it can be hard to tell which of these upstarts have true technical potential and which are likely to fade into tech oblivion.\n\nThat's part of why Jenny Xiao, the cofounder of Leonis Capital, said it's important for venture capitalists to get serious about understanding the AI technology they're investing in.\n\nLeonis Capital, founded in 2021, is now deploying its second $40 million fund. The venture capital firm is focused on next-generation AI companies and has invested in over a dozen since its launch, including MaintainX, Motion, and SpectroCloud.\n\nBusiness Insider asked Xiao and her cofounder, Jay Zhao, to share the top five questions they ask founders when evaluating their tech. They shared their responses over email, which have been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nThe best founders don't think in terms of incremental feature improvements — they think in capability thresholds. We're looking for whether they understand that progress in AI is often non-linear, and whether they can anticipate which future capabilities might fundamentally change or even break their product.\n\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from our Leonis AI 100 — where we benchmarked the most important AI startups — is that the strongest AI founders build just ahead of the next technical breakthrough.\n\nA good answer talks about entirely new workflows that get unlocked, not just marginal efficiency gains, and clearly explains how the company would adapt or pivot as the technology evolves.\n\nMost AI startups don't fail because they're bad, but because they're building something that OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google can eventually ship \"for free\" as a feature.\n\nThat's why we don't accept \"they're not focused on this\" as an answer. We push founders to explain what internal constraint would actually prevent a foundation model lab from building the same thing. If the answer comes down to focus or culture, that's not a real moat.\n\nStrong answers acknowledge that the big labs technically could build it, but doing so would break their incentive structure, pricing, or distribution model; require operational complexity that doesn't scale for them; or shift value to downstream execution rather than model capability.\n\nSome founders can also credibly argue they have a 12- to 18-month head start. Weak answers, by contrast, lean on claims like being \"more vertical,\" having \"more niche data,\" or understanding customers better — responses we hear from about 95% of founders.\n\nWe've noticed a consistent pattern: Most founders underestimate foundation models, and most VCs underestimate them even more.\n\nAsking \"How much proprietary data do you have?\" is usually the wrong question, since no early-stage company has truly meaningful data. And if a founder's pitch boils down to \"we have more data, therefore our models are better,\" that's a red flag: foundation models often improve faster than proprietary ones, and the companies building them have enough capital to buy data and quickly close any gaps.\n\nWhat matters much more is not how much data exists today, but whether the product naturally generates better data over time. For example, industrial systems where data only emerges once software is embedded in workflows, or products where switching costs come from accumulated context.\n\nWe ask this question to understand where defensibility actually lives once code becomes commoditized. If a founder can't answer it clearly, they likely don't understand their own moat.\n\nCosmetic advantages like code, UI, or models are easy to copy, while structural advantages — such as being a system of record or being embedded into compliance, audits, or standard operating procedures — are much harder to replicate.\n\nThe question also reveals founder temperament: Strong founders are candid about their vulnerabilities (\"Here's what we're most worried about\"), while weaker ones tend to get defensive and insist a threat \"would never happen.\"\n\nThis question forces founders to explain their earliest technical decisions and the trade-offs they intentionally made, revealing whether they understand system dynamics rather than just iterating on features.\n\nStrong answers sound like, \"We chose to execute actions, not just make suggestions, which increased liability but created real lock-in,\" or \"We became the system of record instead of a thin layer, which slowed integrations and sales early but made switching organizationally expensive later.\" By contrast, many founders default to saying they want to \"stay flexible,\" which often signals they haven't yet designed anything fundamental.\n\nThe best AI systems are opinionated by design, deliberately removing degrees of freedom and hard-coding assumptions about workflows, authority, or data flow.\n\nReal insight usually comes from abandoning old assumptions. This question helps distinguish founders who simply stumbled into AI from those who experienced a genuine shift in how they see the world.\n\nWe're looking for intellectual flexibility, not credentials. Strong answers point to a specific belief the founder once held, why they believed it, and what changed their mind; weak answers stay vague, like saying they \"realized AI was going to be big.\"\n\nThis question assumes copying is possible and pushes founders to explain what isn't obvious. Shallow answers fall back on claims like \"they couldn't move as fast\" or \"they don't have our data,\" while stronger ones point to hard-to-see advantages such as deep operational knowledge, customer-specific integrations, or accumulated context that isn't visible from the outside.\n\nFounders who can't point to moments where they changed their mind usually aren't learning — they're executing a fixed plan in a world that won't stay fixed.\n\nThis question reveals epistemic humility and whether a founder is genuinely truth-seeking or just looking for confirmation. AI moves too fast for people who can't update, and we're especially wary of founders who treat every pivot as vindication rather than correction.\n\nMarket timing, regulatory shifts, and platform dependencies kill far more startups than bad management. This question tests whether founders think probabilistically about external forces and whether they've designed for resilience instead of relying on luck.\n\nFounders who say \"nothing\" haven't thought hard enough. The ones we want to back can name several concrete external risks and explain how they're hedging against them.\n\nThe best founders aren't contrarian for its own sake, but they can hold an unpopular position long enough for the world to catch up.",

    "title": "Elon Musk insists Tesla is a tech company. It's starting to look like one.",
    "description": "Hiking subscriptions, making robots, and selling fewer cars? Tesla is acting like a tech company in more ways than one.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has long insisted Tesla isn't a car company. After its latest earnings, it looks less like one than ever.\n\nThe billionaire told investors that Tesla would scrap its Model S and X EVs and convert their production lines to build the company's Optimus humanoid robot, as it continues to shift toward AI and robotics.\n\nTesla also said it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI and to evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with Musk's AI startup.\n\nIt came as the company's financial disclosures painted a stark picture of the troubles facing its EV business, which saw sales decline for the second year in a row in 2025.\n\nTesla beat Wall Street's expectations, but reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue and said profits fell by 46% last year, while revenue from car sales fell by 11% year-over-year in the last quarter.\n\nExecutives largely shrugged off the headwinds, with Musk and other top employees reiterating in the analyst Q&A their belief that autonomous vehicles will shortly render traditional forms of transport obsolete.\n\n\"The vast majority of miles traveled will be autonomous in the future,\" said Musk, in response to an investor question asking about Tesla's plans to launch new models.\n\n\"I'm just guessing, but probably less than 5% of miles driven will be where somebody's actually driving the car themselves in the future, maybe as low as 1%,\" he added.\n\nInvestors reacted positively, with Tesla shares rising around 3% after hours following earnings.\n\nThe reaction is another sign of how, for many investors, vehicle sales have become a sidenote to Tesla's future, as the company executes an ambitious shift toward a new business model built on robotics, AI, and software services.\n\n\"They're definitely moving away from an automotive-oriented company to a tech-oriented company,\" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, told Business Insider prior to Tesla's earnings. '\"This is a company that's looking to get away from vehicle sales as the focus of their revenue.\"\n\nElon Musk has long said that Tesla should be thought of as an AI and robotics company, not a carmaker. Investors have agreed, driving Tesla's market cap to $1.35 trillion, more than every other US carmaker combined.\n\nEven before Tesla's latest AI-focused earnings, there were signs that the company had begun to act more like the tech giant Musk dreams of.\n\nThe company overhauled its autonomy offerings in recent weeks, removing the option to buy its premium Full Self-Driving software for a one-off fee of $8,000 and making it subscription-only.\n\nTesla also killed its basic Autopilot tier, which previously came free on almost all its vehicles, instead replacing it with a more limited form of cruise control. Musk also indicated in a post on X that Tesla owners can expect FSD prices to rise beyond the $99-per-month subscription fee as the technology improves.\n\nPhasing out free features and hiking subscription prices is classic tech giant behavior, and the moves quickly sparked backlash from Tesla fans and customers on social media. Analysts told Business Insider the changes were likely aimed at driving adoption of FSD and monetizing the existing user base.\n\n\"I think it's about monetizing FSD. I think they're going to look at more ways to monetize what I view as services, autonomous, and really disruptive technology within their installments,\" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities and a longtime Tesla Bull, told Business Insider ahead of earnings.\n\nMusk has described FSD as crucial to Tesla's future, but the company has struggled to get drivers to pay for it. In October, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja told investors that just 12% of Tesla owners have bought FSD.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taneja said that 1.1 million customers had bought FSD, but added that nearly 70% of those purchases were upfront rather than subscription.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key milestone for Musk's $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to hit 10 million active FSD subscriptions by 2035 for the Tesla CEO to unlock the full payout.\n\nThe most critical part of Tesla's transition to a tech company is its robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot initiatives, which Musk has said will eventually make Tesla the world's most valuable company.\n\nTom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Business Insider that nearly 75% of his long-term valuation of the company was based on robotics and autonomous vehicles, with just 8% coming from car sales. Ives put that figure at 80-90%, adding that he viewed Tesla as an \"autonomous and robotics company\" moving forward.\n\n\"That's why this is such a key transition year for Musk and Tesla. Any delays in autonomous or robotaxis are going to be heavily scrutinized because that's the key to the valuation,\" Ives added.\n\nTesla launched its robotaxi service in Austin last June, and recently began offering some public rides without a safety driver. However, its service in the Texan city is still small, with around 50 active vehicles, according to a community tracker run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna.\n\nMusk said on Wednesday that Tesla would have robotaxis operating in \"somewhere between a quarter and half\" of the US by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval, and the company is set to begin production on its dedicated Cybercab robotaxi in April.\n\nIves added that Tesla's focus this year would be on building out its robotaxi service, noting he didn't expect the company to begin collecting \"meaningful revenue\" from autonomous ride-hailing until 2027.\n\n\"It's important that they get into what I believe will probably be roughly about 30 cities this year. 2026 is the build-out of robotaxis, 2027 is where you'll start to see more monetization,\" Ives said.\n\nOnce Tesla's robotaxi service reaches escape velocity, Narayan said he expects it to transform the company's business model from a traditional carmaker into a high-margin services business more akin to Uber.\n\n\"It dramatically transforms the current auto business, which is a capital-intensive, low-margin business, into a high-margin, much higher revenue business,\" he said. \"The market is bigger and the economics are far better.\"\n\nExecuting that transition will be expensive. Taneja, Tesla's CFO, said on Wednesday that the company expects to spend more than $20 billion this year on new production lines and AI compute infrastructure.\n\nFor Tesla's beleaguered EV business, things look unlikely to improve anytime soon.\n\nAlthough Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market in the US, the end of the $7,500 tax credit in September has caused that market to slow dramatically, with rivals Ford and GM canceling electric models and taking billions of dollars in charges amid warnings of an EV winter.\n\nOutside of the US, Tesla is losing market share to Chinese carmakers such as BYD, which now dominate China's booming EV market and are growing rapidly in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nAutoForecast Solutions' Fiorani said that Tesla ran the risk of a bumpy transition period if its carmaking business declined faster than its robotaxi and services businesses could grow. However, he added that the company may have no choice but to make the leap.\n\nHe pointed to the competition from China and declining income from the regulatory credits that Tesla sells to automakers who have failed to sell enough EVs as evidence that the company's automotive business was running out of road.\n\n\"Musk sees the future of this business as robots and autonomous vehicles,\" Fiorani said.\n\n\"The physical products themselves, the cars and the automotive side, are all legacy products,\" he added. \"We're going to see them going forward to autonomous software, autonomous hardware, things that will move them into the next generation.\"",

    "fullText": "Lord Stockwood says people in government ‘definitely’ talking about idea as technology disrupts industries\n\nThe UK could introduce a universal basic income (UBI) to protect workers in industries that are being disrupted by AI, the investment minister Jason Stockwood has said.\n\n“Bumpy” changes to society caused by the introduction of the technology would mean there would have to be “some sort of concessionary arrangement with jobs that go immediately”, Lord Stockwood said.\n\nThe Labour peer told the Financial Times: “Undoubtedly we’re going to have to think really carefully about how we soft-land those industries that go away, so some sort of [universal basic income], some sort of lifelong mechanism as well so people can retrain.”\n\nA universal basic income is not part of official government policy, but when asked whether people in government were considering the need for UBI, Stockwood told the FT: “People are definitely talking about it.”\n\nThe technology entrepreneur, who took up his ministerial post in September, said part of his motivation for joining the government was to help ensure the workforce was prepared for rapid change.\n\nFears continue to grow about the impact of artificial intelligence on Britain’s job market. This week research by the investment bank Morgan Stanley found the UK was losing more jobs than it is creating because of AI and was being hit harder than other large economies.\n\nThis month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nLast week, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.\n\nStockwood, who held senior positions at Lastminute.com, Travelocity and Match.com, oversaw the $490m (£400m at the time) sale of the online insurance broker Simply Business to the US insurer Travelers in 2017. He later bought a stake the football club of his home town, Grimsby Town FC.\n\nWhile he has previously been a vocal proponent of a wealth tax in the UK, Stockwood told the FT he had not repeated his calls for the government to go further on taxing the rich.\n\nHowever, he added: “If you make your money and the first thing you do is you speak to a tax adviser to ask: ‘Where can we pay the lowest tax?’ we don’t want those people in this country, I’d suggest, because you’re not committed to your communities and the long-term success in this country.”\n\nStockwood was preceded as investment minister by Poppy Gustafsson, a former chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, who stepped down after less than a year in the job.",

    "description": "The Big Tech rivals are spending more than ever, but analysts are more concerned about Microsoft at the moment.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street had very different reactions to two of Big Tech's biggest spenders after quarterly earnings reports came out on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Meta and Microsoft reported higher-than-expected capex. While both companies beat revenue expectations, Microsoft's stock sank more than 6% after-hours, while Meta's stock jumped as high as 9%.\n\nBig Tech's spending has risen sharply in the last two years, driven by investments in massive AI data centers. Wall Street has started to question when those investments will pay off, and analysts are giving some companies a much harder time than others.\n\nMeta reported capex of $22.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $72.2 billion for the year, up from 2024's $39.2 billion. That number will climb in 2026 — the company estimates capex will be in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion for the year, driven by increased spending on Meta SuperIntelligence Labs, the company's big bet on speeding up AI model development.\n\n\"We plan to continue to prioritize investing in the business to support these opportunities,\" CFO Susan Li told investors on Wednesday's call.\n\nMicrosoft logged $37.5 billion in capex for the quarter, up 66% from one year ago. Most of that spend went toward CPUs and GPUs, the powerful computing chips that run AI workloads. The company said the spending was necessary to support fast-growing demand for its cloud and AI business.\n\nMicrosoft's revenue was 81.3 billion for the quarter, up 17% from the previous year. Meta reported $55.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $200.1 billion for all of 2025.\n\nWhile both surpassed Wall Street's revenue expectations, analysts gave Microsoft a much harder time than Meta over its surging capex.\n\nPart of that could be Microsoft's heavy investments in GPU chips, which can become costly given their short life spans.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said that a core issue for investors, as Microsoft's capex grows faster than they expected, \"comes down to ROI on capex spend over time.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also heavily exposed to a single customer, another concern for investors. Nearly half — 45% — of the company's remaining performance obligations are attributed to OpenAI.\n\n\"There's obviously concern about the durability,\" Jeffries analyst Brent Thill said of the backlog.\n\nMicrosoft holds a $135 billion stake in OpenAI and has invested more than $13 billion into the company since 2019.\n\nWhile OpenAI does not directly carry a heavy debt load, some of its partners, including Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nvidia, have taken on massive amounts of debt to fund data center buildouts, fueling Wall Street's anxiety over a potential AI bubble.\n\nOracle is struggling to finance its $500 billion data center initiative, Business Insider reported last week, amid growing concerns about its credit rating and risk.\n\nOn the Meta earnings call, Li noted that Meta's cash reserves, thanks to its very profitable ad business, will fuel its AI spending spree next year.\n\n\"We have a strong net cash balance, and expect our business will continue to generate sufficient cash to fund our infrastructure investments in 2026,\" Li said.",

    "fullText": "Each year, Thoughtworks’ Looking Glass report looks beyond individual technologies to examine the forces reshaping how organizations build, run and evolve their technology estates. The aim is not to predict the future, but to help leaders make sense of the changes already underway — and to understand which of them will matter most in practice.\n\nThis year’s trends reflect a moment of transition. Long-running shifts around platforms, data, security and experience design are converging with rapid advances in AI. The result is not a single disruptive technology, but a reconfiguration of how technology creates value across the enterprise. Systems are becoming more adaptive. Interactions more intent-driven. Governance more embedded in day-to-day delivery.\n\nAcross the Looking Glass, we explore what this means in concrete terms: how enterprises are rebuilding their core foundations, rewiring workflows to support greater autonomy and reimagining the role technology plays in customer experience, decision-making and operations. AI features prominently, but always in context — as one of several forces accelerating change, rather than a solution in isolation.\n\nAs ever, this report is grounded in what we see working with clients around the world. It is intended as a practical guide to navigating the year ahead, with a focus on technologies that deliver real, durable value.\n\nRachel Laycock, Chief Technology Officer, Thoughtworks\n\nIn each lens, we present opportunities for implementing technology in your business and signals to gauge how fast something is approaching. We categorize each of the 90+ trends in two dimensions: the prevalence across enterprises — seeing now, beginning to see or on the horizon — and our recommended strategic response — adopt, analyze or anticipate.\n\nYou'll find each of Looking Glass 2026's five lenses below.

    "fullText": "Amazon cut 16,000 more corporate jobs on Wednesday, and leadership wants the remaining staff to become even more efficient through technology.\n\nIn an email addressing the layoffs on Wednesday, Greg Pearson, VP of global sales at Amazon Web Services, urged employees to keep using technology to streamline their work.\n\n\"Moving forward, I encourage you to keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work, amplify our impact, and focus on the activities that directly drive value for our customers,\" Pearson wrote in the email obtained by Business Insider. \"And most importantly, take care of yourselves and each other.\"\n\nPearson's message mirrors Amazon's broader drive to run more efficiently as it reorganizes amid rapid advances in AI. Although the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said they were driven more by cultural fit than by cost reductions or automation.\n\nJassy has previously said AI will ultimately reduce Amazon's workforce by driving efficiency gains. On Wednesday, Amazon's chief human resources officer, Beth Galetti, said in the layoff announcement that the company will continue hiring and investing in \"strategic areas.\"\n\nWednesday's layoff was Amazon's second round of mass job cuts since October, when it axed 14,000 roles.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Amazon announced it's cutting 16,000 jobs. The career coach Kyle Elliott said you should use these two critical tools to help you find a job after a layoff.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kyle Elliott, 33, a career coach who lives in California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGetting laid off is very traumatic — and it's becoming more common.\n\nI've been a full-time career coach to tech employees at startups and in Big Tech since 2017, and I've seen how layoffs have become more visible in recent years.\n\nI help clients navigate life after a layoff, including what role they want next and how to apply for new jobs.\n\nAmazon has announced new plans to cut staff, and I want affected employees to remember that they are coming from one of the world's top companies.\n\nPeople will want them, and they will find something.\n\nWhen people reach out to me for coaching after a layoff, many have a scarcity mindset and feel like they have to apply for any job.\n\nFor some people who urgently need to pay rent or put food on the table, that's necessary. But in other cases, it makes sense to take a beat and evaluate what you're really looking for in your next role.\n\nThe very first thing I ask clients to do is create a list of \"must-haves\" and \"dealbreakers\" for their next job. What are their salary expectations? Will they only work remotely? Are they willing to relocate? If you write the list before you start interviewing, you can act from a place of logic rather than panic.\n\nThe second step is to update your résumé and LinkedIn profile, which are two of your most critical tools in today's market. You're going to submit a résumé with almost every application, and having an up-to-date LinkedIn account puts you in a good position if potential employers check it or recruiters go looking for talent on the platform.\n\nYou want to optimize for the roles you're looking for in 2026, which means that if you were an engineer when you joined Amazon but are now a director, you want to make sure that's reflected on your LinkedIn page.\n\nI've seen clients turn to quick hacks for their job search, like asking AI to tailor their résumé or using it to find and apply to roles for them. But if everyone does that, you don't stand out.\n\nI can usually tell quickly if someone's written their résumé with AI. For example, they'll be applying to a systems engineer role, and it won't even have the phrase \"systems engineer\" in it.\n\nEveryone thinks only AI is reading their résumé, but I have clients who work in talent acquisition and HR — the humans who are still involved in the recruitment process. Humans hire other humans, even at big companies.\n\nIn the age of AI, be more human. Take a step back and think, if you were a human looking at this résumé, what would you want to see? Then put those phrases near the top, rather than using AI to create generic slop.\n\nI'd suggest creating a master résumé that you can spend 20 minutes tailoring for different roles. If you're using AI, use it more like an extra tool, rather than the thing that's driving your job search.\n\nLayoffs are normal now, especially in the tech industry, and there's much less stigma around them.\n\nBut there's more competition in the job market, because it's easier to apply for jobs with AI, for example, so the challenges around layoffs are different nowadays.\n\nIn today's job market, it's important to figure out what's unique about you. Lots of people will meet the job requirements, so you need to communicate why the company should hire you over the thousands of other applicants.\n\nOne thing that can help you is to look back at performance reviews and identify things people repeatedly say about you. You can try asking three to five people to share what makes you fabulous and to give examples. I've found that clients are surprised by the feedback they receive.",

    "fullText": "Some of the biggest companies in the world want to let you know how they're doing.\n\n(Want might be a strong word. It's more like, are required to by regulators, but that doesn't roll off the tongue.)\n\nEither way, seven companies with market caps totalling more than $20 trillion are checking in.\n\nI broke down what to keep an eye out for with each of them.\n\nMeta: Mark Zuckerberg still wants to spend big on AI. There's one problem. Meta, unlike some of its Big Tech peers, doesn't have a cloud business that's already benefiting from the AI boom. And its ads business wasn't enough to stop investors from getting spooked last earnings.\n\nRecently, Meta has cut down its metaverse team and overhauled its review program. Still, investors want to see real returns, which could mean Meta's in for another intense year.\n\nMicrosoft: Pivoting a company with a market cap north of roughly $3.5 trillion isn't easy, but CEO Satya Nadella is giving it his best shot. Nadella tapped a new advisor to \"rethink the new economics of AI\" for Microsoft. The big boss views AI as both a massive threat and a huge opportunity that could define the tech giant's future.\n\nSomething else to watch: Any chatter about Microsoft's plans (and partnerships) in the wake of its restructured agreement with OpenAI.\n\nTesla: There's the traditional auto business to consider, but Elon Musk will likely focus more on the future. Specifically, progress and plans for Tesla's robotaxi business and robotic humanoid, Optimus. It's part of Tesla's ongoing rebrand from an EV maker to AI company.\n\nMusk has relied on touting what's to come, as opposed to what's already here. But are investors still buying a dream that's yet to materialize?\n\nApple: The odd one out in the AI race, Apple is opting to partner rather than build its own huge foundation models. The latest nod toward that strategy is the deal it struck with Google Gemini to power Siri's AI.\n\nThat's why iPhone sales will remain the key number to look out for, especially when it comes to its second-largest market: China.\n\nAlphabet: Few companies have had a better run over the past three months than Alphabet. Gemini 3's launch has put Google at the front of the AI race and pushed it into the uber-elite $4 trillion market-cap club.\n\nNext up? How Google will continue to reshape its crown jewel — Search — in the age of its AI Overviews.\n\nAmazon: Just in: Amazon said it's cutting 16,000 employees. (Some employees got an advanced notice.) The latest reductions were announced by Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, who described the move as part of efforts to cut back on bureaucracy inside the company.\n\nAmazon was fresh off cutting roughly 14,000 jobs in the run-up to last earnings. The company still managed to get on Wall Street's good side in the immediate aftermath. We'll see if it can do it again.",

    "fullText": "Redwood Materials has landed Google as a new investor, capping an upsized funding round that values the battery recycling and energy storage company at more than $6 billion.\n\nThe development underscores rising Big Tech interest in power infrastructure for the AI era.\n\nThe Nevada-based startup said Wednesday it completed the final close of its Series E financing, bringing the total raised to $425 million.\n\nThe round was increased from a previously announced $350 million amid strong investor demand. Google joined the final closing of the round alongside existing backers, including Capricorn and Goldman Sachs.\n\nGoogle's participation adds another tech giant to Redwood's cap table, following Nvidia's investment earlier in the round through its venture arm NVentures.\n\nThe growing interest reflects a bet that Redwood's energy storage business — which repurposes used electric-vehicle batteries to store power — could become critical infrastructure as electricity demand surges from AI, data centers, and broader electrification.\n\nFounded by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, Redwood Materials originally built its business on recycling lithium-ion batteries and recovering key metals, including lithium, nickel, and cobalt. More recently, it has expanded into grid-scale energy storage through a new unit called Redwood Energy, which uses second-life EV batteries to stabilize power supply and support energy-hungry data centers.\n\nThe company has argued that energy storage is no longer optional but essential as AI workloads strain existing grids. Redwood says the new capital will help it scale its energy storage platform while continuing to invest in recycling and critical minerals processing in the US.\n\nWith Google now on board, Redwood is positioning itself at the intersection of AI infrastructure, energy security, and domestic supply chains — a combination investors increasingly see as strategic as the power demands of the AI economy accelerate.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Beijing’s AI policy is focused on real-life applications but Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions\n\nStanding on stage in the eastern China tech hub of Hangzhou, Alibaba’s normally media-shy CEO made an attention-grabbing announcement. “The world today is witnessing the dawn of an AI-driven intelligent revolution,” Eddie Wu told a developer conference in September. “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) will not only amplify human intelligence but also unlock human potential, paving the way for the arrival of artificial superintelligence (ASI).”\n\nASI, Wu said, “could produce a generation of ‘super scientists’ and ‘full-stack super engineers’”, who would “tackle unsolved scientific and engineering problems at unimaginable speeds”.\n\nWu also announced plans to invest 380bn yuan (£40bn) in AI infrastructure over the next three years, news that sent Alibaba stocks soaring to their highest in nearly four years.\n\nWu’s foray into the existential, techno-frontier rhetoric normally deployed by western tech CEOs such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis caught the attention of observers. “Wu’s ASI speech represents a breakthrough,” the tech writer Afra Wang wrote in her China AI newsletter, Concurrent. “Major Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions that carry the flavour of future prophecy.”\n\nAGI, a theoretical state of AI where a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job, has become the preoccupation of American tech companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind. Many see it as the next frontier of civilisation, and are in competition with each other, and China, to get there. In May, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, told a US Senate committee on AI that the “race between the United States and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover”.\n\nMany in Washington have internalised these fears. The US-China economic and scurity review commission has recommended that Congress “establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an artificial general intelligence (AGI) capability”. The Manhattan Project was a second world war-era research operation to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nIn China, many saw Wu’s speech as articulating the vision of a bold, singular tech company, but not one that represented China’s overall AI industry.\n\n“China certainly has research groups working towards AGI. But most AI companies are working towards better applications,” said Ya-Qin Zhang, the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research and former president of the tech company Baidu.\n\nA combination of limited computing power, a pragmatic approach to technology and a keen awareness of the present day potential of AI has steered China’s national AI policy towards real-life applications rather than frontier research.\n\nIn August, the Chinese government published its highly anticipated “AI+ strategy”. The policy document outlined how AI could turbocharge China’s development goals, such as by using AI to improve medical diagnoses and make supply chains more efficient. But it made no mention of AGI.\n\n“The Chinese government is intently focused on reaping the benefits of AI in the here and now and in the near future through diffusion and application of AI across the economy, society, defence, and other areas,” said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior director for China and Taiwan at the White House national security council. “Despite its goal to ‘catch up and surpass’ the United States, we shouldn’t assume that the Chinese Communist party has bought into the idea that AGI is imminent.”\n\n“If you’re just looking at what has been officially published … there is no clear acknowledgment of AGI at all,” said Selina Xu, a China tech analyst. Xu noted that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, had a history of preferring the physical economy to more intangible forces.\n\n“It’s a very different narrative from the AGI race as a lot of people in DC see it,” Xu said.\n\nOne of the biggest factors guiding this strategy is the fact that US sanctions have prevented Chinese companies from acquiring the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors, which are needed for advanced AI research.\n\nWashington has banned the sale of hi-tech microchips to China in an effort to rein in the country’s AI development. Nvidia, the world’s leading chipmaker, then developed more basic semiconductors specifically for the Chinese market. In December, Washington approved the Nvidia’s second-most advanced chips, the H200s, for sale in China. But Beijing has reportedly told custom agents that the chips cannot be imported into China, as the government seeks to break the country’s reliance on overseas technology.\n\nChina insists that “necessity is the mother of invention” and points to the success of companies such as DeepSeek as proof that the US restrictions will merely spur innovation. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, is one of the few Chinese tech leaders who, like Alibaba’s Wu, has openly expressed an interest in AGI.\n\nBut until China is able to produce its own advanced semiconductors at scale, most tech companies feel it is more profitable to use the hardware they already have to focus on AI applications rather than AGI.\n\nAnother factor guiding the US-China tech competition is the availability of datacentres and the energy to power them. In November, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said China would “win the AI race” in part because of its energy subsidies for datacentres.\n\nThe subsidies were reportedly introduced after Chinese tech companies complained of higher electricity bills caused by the domestic semiconductors they are obliged to use, which are less efficient than Nvidia’s. In a sign of how determined China is to break its reliance on imported technology, Reuters reported that any datacentres in receipt of state funds could only use domestic chips.\n\nSuch measures would reduce Nvidia’s competitive advantage in China and boost domestic chip producers, such as Huawei.\n\nSince 2021, China has reportedly poured $100bn into support for AI datacentres.\n\nBut there are signs that the boom may have been overzealous. A recent report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology said that nationwide, the utilisation rate for AI datacentres was 32%.\n\nIn a recent op-ed in China Economic Weekly, Rao Shaoyang, the director at the China Telecom Research Institute, wrote that in some regions of China, the computing power industry was operating in a similar fashion to China’s beleaguered property sector: build first, find buyers later. He cautioned against “blindly building intelligent computing centres” and said local computing power demand should be considered before building new datacentres.\n\nDespite the surplus in more general computing power, many experts believe China still does not have chips that are sophisticated enough to explore frontier research in AGI. But analysts note that the mood could change quickly.\n\n“The current status quo is highly fluid, and Xi Jinping has explicitly declared an ambition to lead the world in AI,” said Gewirtz. “So the fact that China construes that goal one way at this snapshot moment in time does not give me any comfort that in a year they’re going to construe it the same way.”\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",

But he also says that the public's concerns about AI aren't always \"well-targeted.\"\n\nSpecifically, he argued that data centers don't \"use that much water,\" while concerns about electricity bills are \"understandable\" but only a minor part of the conversation.\n\n\"I think in the long run, it's not about power bills, it's about enormous abundance, and whether they get their piece of the abundance,\" Amodei said in the interview.",

    "fullText": "It's no secret that expensive gyms and fitness classes are filled with people who work in high-paying industries like finance and tech.\n\nBut why? Does that sauna really warrant paying an extra few hundred bucks a month in membership fees?\n\nAccording to Wall Streeters we spoke with, membership at places like Equinox or Life Time isn't about the amenities per se. Instead, members are buying two intangible benefits: the chance at networking and social status.\n\nWhile networking at the gym might sound hellish to some, it's not necessarily like you'd imagine it. Gyms will actually set up designated networking events for members, said Laz Rabanales, who works at Okada & Company, a commercial real-estate firm.\n\n\"I have a friend that works at Chelsea Piers [Fitness], and he was telling me that they throw events like ice cream social hour,\" he said.\n\nGoing hand in hand with networking is status. By paying high monthly fees, it's shorthand for other members that you're of high corporate and social status.\n\n\"I feel you can kind of signal to other people that you're paying a lot for a gym membership — so you have a good job and that kind of thing,\" said Nyla Legemah, a customer success manager for benchmarks and indices at London Stock Exchange Group in New York. \"It's like assumed you made it to the club.\"\n\nBut the expensive gym trend also simply reflects societal changes — young people increasingly care about their health and longevity, and are willing to prioritize it.\n\n\"I think that the status element of going to a nice gym is a factor for some people but it is also a generational shift that focuses on health and wellness instead of buying items,\" said Alexander Wah, the founder and chief investment officer at Prince Capital.\n\nCassie Henry, a trader at Gresham Investment Management, a hedge fund, said that workout classes have sometimes taken the place of client happy hours.\n\n\"Banks will take us out, do a workout class instead of getting a drink,\" Henry said. \"It's a good value if someone pays $50 for your pilates class.\"\n\nCaring about being fit in and of itself can also be an outward manifestation of status in the finance world, Rabanales said.\n\n\"You always want to look good because you always want to impress your clients in this industry,\" he said. \"The minute you walk into a room, they'll judge you.\"",

    "fullText": "Lights out and away we go… on your next job application.\n\nBut for this one, put aside your CV and interview-question AI bot. To secure the job, just place first in a global autonomous drone racing competition.\n\nThat's how defense industry disruptor Anduril is recruiting for an engineering role.\n\nThe defense tech startup has launched an \"AI Grand Prix\" to find \"the boldest engineers from around the globe.\"\n\nAnduril's competition calls teams and individuals from around the globe to develop AI systems capable of piloting high-speed racing drones through professional-grade race courses with zero human control. The fastest drone to fly autonomously through a course wins.\n\n\"The competitive edge is gained entirely by optimizing the best code for the race,\" Anduril said on its website.\n\nThe \"AI Grand Prix\" kicks off in April with two virtual rounds, followed by a two-week training and physical qualifier in California in September.\n\nThe big race day will be held in November in Ohio, where Anduril is building a 5 million-square-foot factory. Arsenal-1, as the factory is known, is just outside Columbus.\n\nParticipants can compete individually or in teams of up to eight. All ages are allowed to participate, but under-17s require parental consent and won't be eligible for the job at Anduril following the competition.\n\nIf the event is won by a team, the $500,000 prize money will be split between its members, Anduril said.\n\nThe idea came from Palmer Luckey, Anduril's founder, according to the AI Grand Prix website.\n\nLuckey has long favored unconventional paths. He began taking college courses at 14 and was 19 when he dropped out of California State University to launch the virtual reality company Oculus VR in 2012.\n\nHe worked at Facebook (now Meta) before launching Anduril in 2017, alongside four co-founders, with the mission of modernizing the US military and developing autonomous weapons that \"will save Western civilization.\"\n\nLuckey's penchant for fun and games aside, unusual job campaigns are becoming a hallmark of Anduril's recruitment strategy.\n\nIn 2025, the defense tech startup ran a reverse psychology hiring campaign with the slogan \"Don't work at Anduril,\" which included a video ad that mocked nap pods, distant leadership, and the supposed lack of mission synonymous with modern tech jobs.\n\nLuckey has previously said that over-reliance on Silicon Valley types can be a trap for businesses. Talent in the Bay Area is often \"very mercenary-minded\" and more interested in résumé building than mission, he told Lulu Cheng Meservey in an interview in September 2025.\n\nAnduril deliberately recruits nationwide and makes a point of hiring armed forces veterans, Luckey said.\n\nAnduril's recruitment drive is likely to pick up. The startup is valued at $30.5 billion as of June 2025, and is considering an IPO in 2026.\n\nAs the United States races to modernize warfare, Luckey's company has emerged as the face of the defense tech boom and proved it can compete for contracts with legacy defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\nAnduril did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.",

    "description": "From phone spyware and facial recognition to phone unlocking technology and databases and more, this tech powers Trump's deportation machine.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he would make countering immigration one of his flagship policies during his second term in the White House, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.\n\nA year in, data shows that deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection have surpassed at least 350,000 people.\n\nICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass removal campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented people, prompting widespread protests and resistance from communities across the United States.\n\nICE uses several technologies to identify and surveil individuals. Homeland Security has also leveraged the shadow of Trump’s deportations to challenge long-standing legal norms, including forcibly entering homes to arrest people without a judicial warrant, a move that legal experts say violates the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nHere are some of the technologies that ICE is relying on.\n\nICE has a technology known as cell-site simulators to snoop on cellphones. These surveillance devices, as the name suggests, are designed to appear as a cellphone tower, tricking nearby phones into connecting to them. Once that happens, the law enforcement authorities who are using the cell-site simulators can locate and identify the phones in their vicinity, and potentially intercept calls, text messages, and internet traffic.\n\nCell-site simulators are also known as “stingrays,” based on the brand name of one of the earliest versions of the technology, which was made by U.S. defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris); or IMSI catchers, a technology that can capture a nearby cell phone’s unique identifier, which law enforcement can use for identifying the phone’s owner.\n\nIn the last two years, ICE has signed contracts for more than $1.5 million with a company called TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), which produces customized vans for law enforcement.\n\nA contract worth more than $800,000, dated May 8, 2025, said TOSV will provide “Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program.”\n\nTOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch that the company does not manufacture the cell-site simulators, but rather integrates them “into our overall design of the vehicle.”\n\nCell-site simulators have long been controversial for several reasons.\n\nThese devices are designed to trick all nearby phones to connect to them, which means that, by design, they gather the data of many innocent people. Also, authorities have sometimes deployed them without first obtaining a warrant.\n\nAuthorities have also tried to keep their use of the technology secret in court, withholding information and even accepting plea deals and dropping cases rather than disclose information about their use of cell-site simulators. In a court case in 2019 in Baltimore, it was revealed that prosecutors were instructed to drop cases rather than violate a non-disclosure agreement with the company that makes the devices.\n\nClearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial-recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.\n\nOn Monday, 404 Media reported that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”\n\nAccording to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.\n\nICE has had other contracts with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”\n\nClearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE is also using a facial-recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which federal agents use to identify people on the street. The app relies on scanning a person’s driver’s license photo against 200 million photos, much of the data sourced from state driver’s license databases.\n\nIn September 2024, ICE signed a contract worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.\n\nBecause of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order, effectively reactivating the contract.\n\nAt this point, the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice is unclear.\n\nThe records entry from last week said that the contract with Paragon is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, and more.\n\nParagon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon, with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company RedLattice, according to Israeli tech news site Calcalist.\n\nIn a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications, Jennifer Iras.\n\nRedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.\n\nIn the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists. In response, Paragon cut ties with Italy’s intelligence agencies.\n\nIn mid-September, ICE’s law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations, signed a contract with Magnet Forensics for $3 million.\n\nThis contract is specifically for software licenses so that HSI agents can “recover digital evidence, process multiple devices,” and “generate forensic reports,” according to the contract description.\n\nMagnet is the current maker of the phone hacking and unlocking devices known as Graykey. These devices essentially give law enforcement agents the ability to connect a locked phone to them, unlock it, and access the data inside of it.\n\nMagnet Forensics, which merged with Graykey maker Grayshift in 2023, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt the end of September, 404 Media reported that ICE bought access to an “all-in-one” surveillance tool that allows the agency to search through databases of historical cellphone location data, as well as social media information.\n\nThe tool appears to be made of two products called Tangles and Webloc, which are made by a company called Penlink. One of the tools promises to leverage “a proprietary data platform to compile, process, and validate billions of daily location signals from hundreds of millions of mobile devices, providing both forensic and predictive analytics,” according to a redacted contract found by 404 Media.\n\nThe redacted contract does not identify which one of the tools makes that promise, but given its description, it’s likely Webloc. Forbes previously cited a case study that said Webloc can search a given location to “monitor trends of mobile devices that have given data at those locations and how often they have been there.”\n\nThis type of cellphone location data is harvested by companies around the world using software development kits (SDKs) embedded in regular smartphone apps, or with an online advertising process called real-time bidding (RTB), where companies bid in real-time to place an ad on the screen of a cellphone user based on their demographic or location data. The latter process has the by-product of giving ad tech companies that kind of personal data.\n\nOnce collected, this mass of location data is transferred to a data broker who then sells it to government agencies. Thanks to this layered process, authorities have used this type of data without getting a warrant by simply purchasing access to the data.\n\nThe other tool, Tangles, is an “AI-powered open-source intelligence” tool that automates “the search and analysis of data from the open, deep, and the dark web,” according to Penlink’s official site.\n\nForbes reported in September that ICE spent $5 million on Penlink’s two tools.\n\nPenlink did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE relies on automated license plate reader (ALPR) companies to follow drivers across a large swath of the U.S., noting where people go and when.\n\nICE also leans on its connections with local law enforcement agencies, which have contracts with ALPR providers, like surveillance company Flock Safety, to obtain immigration data by the back door. Flock is one of the largest ALPR providers, with over 40,000 license plate scanners around the United States, and only getting larger with its partnerships with other companies, such as video surveillance company Ring.\n\nEfforts by ICE to informally request data from local law enforcement have prompted some police departments to cut off federal agencies from their access.\n\nBorder Patrol runs its own surveillance network of ALPR cameras, the Associated Press reported.\n\nFor years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations.\n\nIn 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, which revealed that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.\n\nA year later, The Intercept revealed that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”\n\nAccording to public records, LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.”\n\nThis year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to \n\nLexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”\n\n“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.”\n\nData analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed several contracts with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.\n\nThe contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir signed a $95.9 million deal with ICE. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s.\n\nEarlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and particularly Palantir’s relationship with ICE, revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more.\n\nAccording to 404 Media, “a source familiar with the database” said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).”\n\nThe tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE.\n\nPalantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million revealed by Business Insider.\n\nImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a document first reported on by Wired.\n\nFirst published on September 13, 2025, and updated on September 18, 2025, to include Magnet Forensics’ new contract, again on October 8, 2025, to include cell-site simulators and location data, and again on January 26, 2026, to include license plate readers.",

    "fullText": "Mobile Fortify app being used to scan faces of citizens and immigrants – but its use has prompted a severe backlash\n\nImmigration enforcement agents across the US are increasingly relying on a new smartphone app with facial recognition technology.\n\nThe app is named Mobile Fortify. Simply pointing a phone’s camera at their intended target and scanning the person’s face allows Mobile Fortify to pull data on an individual from multiple federal and state databases, some of which federal courts have deemed too inaccurate for arrest warrants.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security has used Mobile Fortify to scan faces and fingerprints in the field more than 100,000 times, according to a lawsuit brought by Illinois and Chicago against the federal agency, earlier this month. That’s a drastic shift from immigration enforcement’s earlier use of facial recognition technology, which was otherwise limited largely to investigations and ports of entry and exit, legal experts say.\n\nThe app’s existence was first uncovered last summer by 404 Media, through leaked emails. 404 Media also reported, in October, about internal DHS documents that say people cannot refuse to be scanned by Mobile Fortify.\n\n“Here we have ICE using this technology in exactly the confluence of conditions that lead to the highest false match rates,” says Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU’s speech, privacy and technology project. “A false result from this technology can turn somebody’s life totally upside down.” The larger implications for democracy are chilling, too, he notes: “ICE is effectively trying to create a biometric checkpoint society.”\n\nUse of the app has inspired backlash on the streets, in courts, and on Capitol Hill.\n\nProtesters are using a variety of tactics to fight back. They include recording masked agents, using burner phones and donated dashboard cameras, according to the Washington Post.\n\nUnderpinning resistance to ICE’s use of facial recognition are doubts about the technology’s efficacy. Research has uncovered higher error rates in identifying women and people of color than for scans of white faces. ICE’s use of the technology is often occurring in intense and fast-moving situations, which makes misidentification more likely. Those being scanned may be people of color. They could be turning away from officers because they don’t want to be identified. The lighting could be poor.\n\nThe Illinois lawsuit against the DHS takes particular issue with the federal agency’s use of Mobile Fortify and argued that the app goes far beyond what Congress allows with regards to the collection of biometric data. The complaint cited several examples in which federal agents appeared to take photos or scans of US citizens across Illinois without their consent.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill on 15 January that would outright ban the homeland security department from using Mobile Fortify or similar apps, except for identification at points of entry. This follows a September letter, sent by senators to ICE, asking \n\nThe DHS said in a statement that Mobile Fortify does not violate constitutional rights or compromise privacy. “It operates with a deliberately high matching threshold and queries only limited CBP immigration datasets. The application does not access open-source material, scrape social media, or rely on publicly available data,” a spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to 404 Media, the app’s database consists of some 200m images. “Mobile Fortify has not been blocked, restricted, or curtailed by the courts or by legal guidance. It is lawfully used nationwide in accordance with all applicable legal authorities.”\n\nObservers, experts, and at least one congressman have said federal immigration agents frequently do not ask for consent to scan a person’s face – and may dismiss other documentation that contradicts this data. ICE has been documented using biometrics as a definitive determination of someone’s citizenship in the absence of identification.\n\nThis means that ICE is not required to conduct additional vetting of facial scans or checks to avoid a misidentification. 404 Media reported earlier this month that Mobile Fortify misidentified a detained woman during an immigration raid; the app came up with two different and incorrect names.\n\n“Facial recognition – to the extent it should be used at all – is really supposed to be a starting point,” says Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the security and surveillance project at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT). “If you treat this as an endpoint – as a definitive ID – you’re going to have errors, and you’re going to end up arresting and jailing people that are not actually who the machine says it is.”\n\nLaperruque says that even police departments across the country have pushed back against an over-reliance on facial recognition, treating it as a lead, at most. At least 15 states are cautious about using it all, and have laws limiting police’s use of the technology. In 2019, San Francisco became the first major US city to ban facial recognition technology by police and all other local government agencies.\n\nThe DHS issued a directive in September 2023 requiring that the bureau test the technology for unintended bias and offer US citizens the choice to opt out of scans not conducted by law enforcement. That directive appeared to be rescinded in February last year.\n\nICE’s stops – whether they involve face-scanning or not – have been subject to litigation as well. They have often been referred to as “Kavanaugh stops” after the supreme court justice wrote in a concurring opinion that Hispanic residents’ “apparent ethnicity” can be a “relevant factor” for ICE to stop them and demand for proof of citizenship. The ACLU sued the Trump administration earlier this month, accusing federal immigration authorities of racial profiling and unlawful arrests.",

    "fullText": "Tech chiefs waxed poetic about AI to delegates at Davos. Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in Texas\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowed Tesla to thrive.\n\nWhen they weren’t discussing Donald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.\n\nUp and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”\n\nAt the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI will blanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.\n\n“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.\n\nMeanwhile Google was showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.\n\nAway from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.\n\nNadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as the Wall Street Journal put it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.\n\nAs dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.\n\nThinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.\n\nThe massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled in the New York Times last week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, an ugly website – and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.\n\nHumans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.\n\nWhatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.\n\nElon Musk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.\n\nWhat Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state. \n\n “Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.\n\nAlso surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.\n\n “Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”\n\nMeanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process of considering new rules that could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the company did not have authorization to operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.",

    "fullText": "Campaigners decry ties with ‘Trump-supporting’ tech firms after funding is accepted to develop state AI systems\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nMinisters have accepted $1m (£728,000) from Meta, the US tech and social media company, to build AI systems for defence, national security and transport, sparking warnings about the UK government’s “alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants”.\n\nThe money from Mark Zuckerberg’s company will be used to pay experts to “develop cutting-edge AI solutions … to support national security and defence teams”, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe money will pay for four British AI experts, coordinated by the government-funded Alan Turing Institute, to “play a pivotal role in rewiring our healthcare, police, transport systems and more”, said Ian Murray, the minister for data and digital government.\n\nThe move comes after Meta executives had 50 meetings with ministers in the last two years for which data was available, one of the highest levels of direct access of any technology company, a Guardian investigation found.\n\nThe government is consulting on a ban on social media use by under-16s, which would have a major effect on Meta’s Instagram platform. Meta said the money had been allocated to the Alan Turing Institute before any ban was floated.\n\nAnnouncing the $1m deal, Meta said it was “proud to help bring top British AI talent into government, fast-tracking the transformation of public services”.\n\nDSIT said: “People across the UK could benefit from faster, safer and more reliable public services as leading British AI specialists join government to modernise critical systems used every day – from public safety to transport maintenance.”\n\nBut the tech justice campaign group Foxglove asked: “What’s Meta getting for its million dollars?” It added: “When it comes to big tech, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.”\n\n“This is yet more evidence of the UK government’s alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants,” said Donald Campbell, Foxglove’s advocacy director. “It’s deeply worrying that ministers are still naive enough to swallow this kind of lobbying from a handful of Silicon Valley plutocrats – who have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt they do not have the British public’s best interests at heart.”\n\nDaisy Greenwell, a co-founder of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, said the deal “highlights an uncomfortable reality: tech giants spend vast sums to gain access and influence in policymaking”.\n\nShe added: “That makes it even more important that decisions about children and online safety are shaped by independent evidence and the public interest, not by the companies whose products are under scrutiny.”\n\nThe government also announced a new partnership with the San Francisco AI company Anthropic, which will build and pilot a dedicated assistant tool for public services on gov.uk, starting with a model that will give jobseekers career advice “and help to lock down a job”. Anthropic said the project implementation work was “pro bono”.\n\nDSIT said the technology was “part of a cutting-edge plan to use AI agents for national government services, with a pilot expected to begin later this year”. In October, Anthropic announced that the former prime minister Rishi Sunak was taking an advisory role at the $350bn startup. The former Downing Street chief of staff Liam Booth-Smith is a policy and communications adviser to Anthropic.\n\nThe deals come as ministers wrestle with policy decisions that directly affect Meta and Anthropic. As well as launching a consultation last week on banning social media use for under-16s, they are also due to set out changes to how creatives’ copyrighted works are protected from being mined to build AI models, such as those made by Anthropic.\n\nBeeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer who campaigns on child protection and copyright, said: “This government is walking into dependence on Silicon Valley, is undermining the chance to build a UK AI sector, and above all is busy giving away some of the most precious datasets in the world to Silicon Valley, who could well afford to pay.”\n\nThe Meta-funded AI experts will be tasked with using AI to develop models that analyse images and videos, enabling councils to prioritise transport infrastructure repairs more effectively. They will also “develop cutting-edge AI solutions which run offline or within secured networks to support national security and defence teams to make vital decisions while safeguarding sensitive data”, the government said.",

    "fullText": "Free and fast in-flight WiFi could be available on every plane within five years, according to the airline boss who argued with Elon Musk over Starlink.\n\n\"I think as the WiFi technology improves over the next four or five years, we'll all be offering free WiFi access,\" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said during an earnings call on Monday.\n\n\"Customers will use it if it's free, but if they have to pay for it, they won't use it.\"\n\nThe Irish budget airline is known for its no-frills offering and dedication to keeping costs low. In the last quarter, it had an average airfare of 44 euros — about $52 — while reporting after-tax profits of 115 million euros ($137 million) before an exceptional charge for a fine.\n\nIn recent months, many airlines have signed deals with Starlink, which can provide in-flight internet speeds of over 200 Mbps — faster than many home WiFi connections.\n\nHowever, for Ryanair and O'Leary, cheap tickets are more important for winning customers.\n\n\"I have no doubt in my mind that a low fare will beat free WiFi on board every single time,\" the CEO told investors.\n\nHis weeklong quarrel with Musk was sparked by questions about the extra fuel costs incurred by installing a Starlink terminal on an airplane.\n\nO'Leary said the aerodynamic drag would lead to a 2% increase, costing over $200 million a year and raising ticket prices. However, a SpaceX executive said in an X post that the increase was only 0.3%.\n\nEither way, O'Leary said on Monday, any extra fuel costs would be unacceptable.\n\nHe said that Ryanair would add in-flight WiFI \"in a heartbeat\" if the technology improves so that antennae don't need to be installed outside an airplane's fuselage.\n\nO'Leary suggested that, in the next few years, such antennae could instead be installed in the hold.\n\nRyanair is continuing discussions with Starlink, Amazon, and the British telecoms firm Vodafone, he said.\n\nSome of these operators believe that at least half of passengers would pay for in-flight WiFi, O'Leary said on the call, but he thinks no more than 10% would do so.\n\nEvery Starlink-airline deal so far has included free access for all passengers, although many mandate signing up for loyalty programs.\n\nRyanair's spat with Musk also garnered \"lots of free publicity,\" O'Leary said. The outspoken boss and the airline's social media team are known for making provocative comments to get attention.\n\nThe airline's press conference last week, promoting a sale in the wake of the argument, was covered by some 1,500 news articles across nearly 60 countries, O'Leary said on the call.",

    "description": "The shift could set troops up to better mix in new weapons like specialized Abrams tanks, drones, and artificial intelligence in command and control.",
    "fullText": "Taiwan's ground forces are undergoing a shift that'll make it easier to work with new weapons like drones and artificial intelligence, capabilities expected to be necessary for tough future fights.\n\nThe restructure is aimed at equipping troops with the tools to better deter or defeat a Chinese invasion. It's the latest way Taiwan is modernizing its military as it buys more new technologies and changes how it trains its troops.\n\nTaiwan's Ministry of National Defense reclassified its four armored brigades and three mechanized infantry brigades into combined arms brigades earlier this month. The Army told CNA, the national news agency, that the change was in response to enemy threats and future warfare scenarios.\n\nThey are intended to be flexible for rapid response. The units retain their original designations, but the focus is no longer singular. In some ways, it mirrors the concepts of the US Army's Brigade Combat Team, which is a self-contained, self-sufficient, mobile fighting force for higher-level warfare.\n\nA graphic shared by the Taiwan Security Monitor, a research initiative at George Mason University, shows the renaming of those brigades, as well as their locations on Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's military recently reclassified its 7 mechanized and armored brigades as combined arms brigades to better align its force structure reform efforts. \n\nOur visualization highlights the distribution of those brigades, along with their new titles and unit patches. pic.twitter.com/uDzMRbIb5I\n\nThe creation of combined armed brigades isn't creating new units, and the old brigades were already working with tanks, infantry, artillery, and support and technical elements. So why did Taiwan's military leadership change them?\n\nMick Ryan, a retired Australian army major general, strategist, and defense expert, told Business Insider the change could better serve troops as they adopt and embrace new weaponry.\n\n\"It does provide a foundation for the integration of new technologies, not just drones, but the use of AI in digital command and control systems, probably more air defense systems,\" he said.\n\nRyan described the change as a mindset shift. Combined arms brigades in other militaries, like Western countries, are constantly working with different organizations and systems.\n\nIt makes ground forces more flexible and self-sufficient with capabilities across units, which Taiwan has been pushing its military toward in recent years, with a focus on rapid response, mobility, and adaptability should China attack Taiwan. It also allows units to cover weaknesses; infantry, for example, can help counter anti-tank weaponry, while heavy armor can provide infantry with more firepower.\n\nSome defense experts have assessed that the introduction of new MIA2T Abrams tanks could also be influencing the restructuring decision.\n\nTaiwan ordered 108 of the Abrams, a customized variant, in 2019 and received 80 tanks late last year. It's expected to receive the rest early this year. These are Taiwan's first new tanks in over 20 years, marking a major capability upgrade in firepower, armor, and survivability.\n\nMore Taiwanese weapons purchases — including High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, various types of missiles, and drones — as well as increased investments at home in domestic defense technologies, may ultimately give troops experience with a wide range of weaponry that could be crucial.\n\nCombined arms brigades, by design, make it easier and faster to integrate new weapons and technology by bringing more capabilities under one command, reducing friction between units. That structure allows quicker experimentation, smoother training and doctrinal changes, and easier absorption of new platforms.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry didn't respond to Business a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nWhile the recent restructuring marks an evolution in Taiwan's military, other efforts are also underway to keep its forces ready.\n\nEarlier this month, for instance, Taiwan opened a new artillery training center — the Tangshan base — in Tainan on the southwest coast. The facility is designed to support more modern, high-tech training on systems such as HIMARS and Land Sword missiles.\n\nTaiwan has also expanded training areas and exercises geared toward preparing troops for asymmetric warfare, including the use of drones, coastal defense operations, and urban combat.\n\nThe military sees asymmetric warfare — a network of mobile, dispersed, and survivable weapons and tactics — as central to its self-defense strategy, but that isn't the sole focus.\n\nTaiwan is acquiring and producing large quantities of munitions needed for sustained, high-intensity fighting, including systems used to blunt or slow a larger invading force.\n\nThis month, the US and Taiwan announced plans to co-produce 155mm artillery shells, with Taiwan's defense ministry citing the war in Ukraine as evidence of how quickly such ammunition can be consumed in combat. The head of Taiwan's arms bureau said that if the effort ultimately proves successful, it could be expanded to other weapons and munitions.",

    "fullText": "This past week was a weird one for upsets. We didn’t get any huge, unexpected upsets of top-tier teams. But we did have some small underdogs pull through on their opponent’s home floor, such as UNC beating Virginia, Texas Tech beating Houston, and Illinois beating Purdue. Let’s see what this week brings!\n\nThe Wildcats have sustained a lot of injuries in the past few weeks, but I don’t think that will matter in this one. We have seen that you beat Vanderbilt by using size and strength in the frontcourt, and this could be a breakout game for any of Malachi Moreno, Andrija Jelavic, or Mo Dioubate.\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide has a myriad of issues going on. Not only are they facing national scrutiny over the eligibility of Charles Bediako, but they also have injuries to Ajay Allen and Aden Holloway. I think there’s just too much going on with Alabama right now for them to be fully focused and engaged with this game, and Missouri has a breakout star emerging in T.O. Barrett.\n\nSean Miller’s Longhorns have shown that they have a high ceiling, coming off a 20-point win over a ranked Georgia team. Auburn has shown us a low floor, with a loss to Missouri already on the schedule. Miller has Dailyn Swain playing the best basketball of his career, and I think he plays a huge role as Texas continues their march to an NCAA Tournament bid in his first season.\n\nI’m going to hop back on my travel schedule soapbox here. Let’s get this straight: Florida State is not good. Cal is better. But FSU has Rodney McCray and Chauncey Wiggins, who both play well at home, and Cal has not won a game outside the state of California this season. I think the road trip gets the better of them here.\n\nSaint Louis is rolling right now — if not for a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer by Stanford, the Billikens would be undefeated. But all good things must come to an end. The “Battle for the Archbaron’s Cup” has been anything but predictable over the years, and would make a great occasion for Dayton to pull off the upset. Dayton finally has their two centers, Amael L’Etang and Malcolm Thomas, healthy, and may also get back Jordan Derkack for this game.\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nCFB:Most impactful transfer of 2025 college football season\n\nNBA: NBA star Derrick Rose reacts after unexpected surprise ahead of jersey retirement\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl LX graphic resurfaces\n\nTENNIS: Valentin Vacherot hits physics-defying shot at Australian Open\n\nVIRAL: Alex Honnold takes incredible selfie after historic Taipei 101 climb\n\nThe post Predicting upsets in College Basketball this week   appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "In a major shift for Ukraine's military, Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko are now officially advising Kyiv on defense tech and drones.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, has appointed two prominent Telegram bloggers and activists to his \"team of new leaders,\" saying they will advise him on defense technology and drone warfare.\n\nThe move is a major recognition for the pair — Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko — who are among the most influential voices among the volunteers filling vital gaps in logistics and drone expertise for Ukraine's battered military.\n\nBeskrestnov, widely cited among Ukrainians as an expert on drones, runs a Telegram channel with some 156,000 followers, where he publicly analyzes Russian and Ukrainian battle drones and how they've performed.\n\nFedorov named him an advisor in defense technology on Sunday, saying Beskrestnov would focus on helping Ukraine build counter-systems for Russian strike and reconnaissance drones.\n\nIn his statement, Fedorov said that Beskrestnov would also support Ukraine's military in analyzing Russian tech, studying \"logistics, study of enemy solutions, and leveraging this experience to our advantage.\"\n\nSternenko, a political activist who now runs an organization that raises funds for military drones, was appointed as Fedorov's advisor on Thursday.\n\n\"From now on, Serhii will act as my advisor on enhancing the use of UAVs at the frontline. His experience will help us implement our shared vision of improving the effectiveness of units operating unmanned systems,\" Fedorov said.\n\nThe Sternenko Foundation serves as a hub for drone procurement, raising money to buy specialized first-person-view drones for military units that demonstrate they're combat-effective.\n\nAs of Monday, it says it has delivered over 256,000 drones on demand to Ukrainian units.\n\nFedorov, Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister at 35, previously was the country's minister for digital transformation. Since being confirmed to his new role earlier this month, he's pledged to revitalize Ukraine's military, promising to reform its training programs, internal culture, and organizational doctrine.\n\nAppointing Sternenko and Beskrestnov as advisors is a significant change in how Kyiv treats its grassroots movements. These groups work closely with Ukrainian forces, but top authorities have generally been slow to officially recognize or integrate them.\n\nSeveral frontline units previously told Business Insider that they sometimes rely on the Sternenko Foundation, for example, for drones that can effectively cope with Russian electronic warfare. While the Ukrainian military provides its fighters with drones in bulk, these sometimes need further tweaks as the battlefield evolves rapidly.\n\nVolunteer foundations often step in and have become known for their speed, leveraging connections with drone manufacturers and informal logistics networks to deliver priority supplies, vehicles, and modified drones within hours or days.\n\nFedorov said that Sternenko would particularly assist in establishing basic support for drone units, adding that 50 of Ukraine's 400 units account for 70% of its battlefield engagements.\n\n\"The objective is to enable the other 350 units to grow quickly and significantly increase the scale of destroying Russian forces,\" Fedorov said.\n\nBeskrestnov, meanwhile, regularly publicizes news about Russia's Shahed-type drones. He often posts footage from found wreckage to show how the Kremlin has been modifying or upgrading the loitering munitions.\n\nFedorov's team credited the drone analyst for being the \"first to report on the use by Russians of FPV drones equipped with machine vision, as well as the use of jet-powered Shahed drones.\"\n\nThe new defense minister's attempt to reshape Ukraine's military comes as it grapples with a slew of challenges, including heightened fighting intensity on the front lines in recent months and a withdrawal of most US miliary support.\n\nIn his opening speech to Ukraine's parliament, Fedorov said the country was facing a high rate of desertion and draft dodging, and that the military's budget had shrunk since last year.",

We here at First Trade have been breathlessly covering every twist and turn, dissecting the winners and losers of Trump's ever-changing focus.\n\nThat's why the arrival of this week is good news for anyone looking for a fresh set of catalysts. While there's always a chance that Trump stirs up more price swings, investors will — at a minimum — have some additional macro and company-specific material to sink their teeth into.\n\nHere are the two main events to watch, and the market significance of each.\n\nThis gathering of central bank leaders will take on a slightly different tone than the last few. There's no \"will-they / won't-they\" drama around interest rates. Investors see a 97% probability of rates staying unchanged. Nothing to see here.\n\nWhat traders will be keyed in on, however, is anything Fed Chair Powell might say about his long-running conflict with the president. Powell has grown more aggressive in his pushback as his term nears an end, especially after the Fed was recently served with subpoenas,\n\nMarket significance: For their part, investors have fought back against incursions on Fed independence the only way they know how: by dumping US stocks and bonds (aka \"selling America.\") They know, after all, that even Trump is sensitive to movements in both. (TACO trade, anyone?)\n\nIf Powell remains defiant, that could keep the Sell America trade going. Specifically from a stock perspective, his resistance to cutting rates sooner than later could be a drag on equities. If he takes a more conciliatory approach, that could be seen as stabilizing for the market.\n\nThis week is a veritable who's who of tech earnings, with four of the Magnificent 7 reporting over the course of two days: Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla on Wednesday, and Apple on Thursday.\n\nMarket significance: For Meta and Microsoft, people will be closely watching for signs that massive AI investment is starting to pay off on the earnings front. Last quarter, investors rebelled against big spending plans for both companies, pushing both stocks sharply lower. The message was sent: they want results, and quickly. It'll be the same deal this quarter.\n\nApple, meanwhile, will live and die by iPhone sales, although it's also crossed into the AI realm by partnering with Google's Gemini to power its new Siri tool. Investors will be listening for an update on that partnership.\n\nTesla's part in the AI race is mainly focused on self-driving cars, and traders will be hungry for guidance. Those self-driving ambitions have kept the stock's valuation afloat, even amid a global EV-sales slowdown.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason White, a 46-year-old startup founder in the San Jose area. Business Insider has verified his former employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've spent half of my 20 years in the tech industry working at Google and Meta. These companies allowed me to work on some amazing projects, but I've now resigned from them both.\n\nI joined Google in 2016 as a tech lead in the Gmail division and transitioned to the Google Search team in 2020. By 2024, I realized I wanted to lean more heavily into AI. I didn't feel my position at Google would give me the opportunity to do that, so I opened myself up to other opportunities.\n\nWhen a Meta recruiter reached out about an AI machine learning engineer role, I decided to pursue it and eventually received an offer. I left Google in July 2024 and started at Meta a month later.\n\nI had a positive experience at Meta. I worked with great people in a high-resource environment and learned a lot. I was also able to lean into AI as I'd hoped, focusing fully on AI products.\n\nHowever, halfway through 2025, I started thinking about resigning to build a startup — specifically, a venture that would use AI to help the typical household with their finances.\n\nWhether to resign from Meta was a complex decision.\n\nThe startup was something I was growing increasingly passionate about. I know what financial pressure feels like — I had been a low-paid graduate student trying to provide for a newborn.\n\nMany people don't have access to great financial planning and management tools to help improve their financial situations. While I was still figuring out what the business would look like, I felt there was an opportunity to help people, and that was very motivating for me.\n\nI connected with a potential cofounder — a friend of a friend — and we spent a lot of time talking through the opportunity. That helped me grow more comfortable with the idea of leaving Meta, but there were still a lot of other factors to consider.\n\nIt's hard to leave a world-class team with people you like — not to mention a reliable source of income.\n\nI know some people start businesses on the side while keeping their full-time jobs, but I couldn't do that because I was already juggling two demanding roles as a Meta employee and a parent.\n\nMy other concern was legal. I would've had to disclose any outside business to Meta, and there could've been non-compete issues — especially since my business idea was related to AI, like my role at Meta.\n\nI wanted to make sure my family had enough savings to cover at least one year of our current expenses without touching our retirement accounts. My wife works, but I wanted a cushion in case she lost her job. I figured that would give me at least one year to build the business, and, if things went really badly, enough time afterward to find a job.\n\nWe already were in a good place savings-wise, so we were still able to take vacations, hire tutors for our kids, and order DoorDash. I had about six months before resigning to make some minor adjustments, including cutting back on 401(k) contributions and putting more money into liquid savings accounts.\n\nThis financial planning process for my family really helped crystallize the direction I wanted to go with the startup. In September 2025, I resigned from Meta.\n\nWhen I shared the news with my colleagues, the response was a mix of surprise, support, and a large amount of jealousy. A lot of people want to leave and start their own thing, but for various reasons they can't or won't — whether it's because of their visa status, financial constraints, or broader fear.\n\nI'm now focused on my business, Bear Financial. My cofounder and I are planning to publicly launch in the second half of this year. We may seek external funding, but for now, we're bootstrapping the business, so I've tracked our spending very carefully.\n\nI have a few pieces of advice for people considering leaving their jobs to start their own business. First, get your finances in order. Second, make sure anyone who depends on you, like your family, is supportive of the decision — I was fortunate to have a supportive partner who knew that I felt limited working in Big Tech.\n\nThird, choose an idea you deeply believe in. With a startup, you have to be the one to bring the energy, the enthusiasm, the vision — and to carry others into it.\n\nAddress your knowledge gaps. Startup founders often need to be generalists, which means having a basic understanding of a lot of areas.\n\nI'd also suggest envisioning the worst-case outcome and asking yourself whether you'd be OK with it. I thought about what it would look like one year later if my business failed. I believe I'd still value everything I learned over those 12 months.\n\nIf I eventually decide to pursue a corporate position again, I have faith that I'd be able to find something — even though it's hard to predict what the job market will look like.\n\nThere are, however, a lot of potential barriers to success: we have to navigate a moving target on regulations, we need to figure out ways to convince potential customers to give us a try, and there are super well-resourced companies that could become direct competitors.\n\nAt the end of the day, I want to take the swing.",

    "description": "Threat actors love to imitate well-known tech and social media companies.",
    "fullText": "Impersonation scams are everywhere: bad actors are constantly trying to convince you that they represent organizations like LinkedIn, PayPal, your bank, the FBI, the FTC, and the IRS as they look to steal your money and information. When it comes to phishing schemes, which typically try to trick you into handing over sensitive data or account credentials via malicious links, tech brands are (perhaps not surprisingly) among the most commonly spoofed.\n\nA recent report from Check Point Research found that Microsoft was imitated in nearly a quarter of all branded phishing attempts in Q4 of last year—nearly double the next most-impersonated company.\n\nAccording to researchers, tech companies and social networks are consistently among the most popular brands for impersonators running phishing scams, with the following share in the final quarter of last year:\n\nWhile you should always be on guard for common phishing tactics, it's wise to be especially wary of unsolicited communication from any of the companies listed—especially if that communication is related to account security and/or urges you to click a link. We've covered at least one campaign involving nearly every brand here, all of which are known and largely trusted among users, making them prime targets for these types of scams. Check Point notes that stolen Microsoft and Google credentials are particularly valuable because they're widely used in day-to-day workflows.\n\nBroadly speaking, a phishing scam starts with an email, text, or social media message that appears to be from a legitimate source. It likely asks you to update or verify personal information—often related to a payment or account security—with a link to what appears to be the company's website or login page. Of course, this link leads instead to a spoofed version of that site designed to harvest your credentials, credit card number, bank details, or other personal data, which scammers can then use for identity theft, account takeover, or purchase fraud.\n\nNote that while the above methods are among the most common, phishing can also happen via phone call, voicemail, and malicious browser pop-ups.\n\nAs we mentioned, just because you generally trust a company doesn't mean you should blindly trust all communication from it. If you receive a message that is unprompted, sounds urgent, and is unrelated to any recent action on your part (such as a login attempt or bill payment), do not engage with it. Don't click any links, open any attachments, or respond directly. Look out for typos and other errors, including the original sender—though as scammers have found ways to appear verified, this isn't always an obvious red flag.\n\nIf you're unsure about the contents of the message, go directly to the website or app and log in to see any legitimate alerts. A password manager offers an extra layer of security here, as it'll protect you from entering credentials on a spoofed page.\n\nFinally, enable a strong, phishing-resistant form of multi-factor authentication everywhere you can, and especially for high-use and high-value accounts like Microsoft and Google. If your credentials are compromised, threat actors won't have that additional factor to utilize them.",

    "description": "Finland wants to lure American engineers and researchers with fast-track visas and good work-life balance as part of the global AI talent wars.",
    "fullText": "Finland is stepping into the tech talent wars.\n\nThe Nordic country is making a push for tech workers from abroad, with a particular focus on the US. The goal is to attract engineers and researchers working in deep tech, especially in the fields of quantum computing, AI, and health innovation.\n\nThe effort comes as competition for AI talent intensifies worldwide and tech workers in the US grapple with layoffs, burnout, and visa complications. KPMG's annual survey of global CEOs found that 70% were concerned about competition for AI talent. According to BCG's 2024 talent tracker report, the US remained dominant in attracting AI talent worldwide.\n\nAlready known for its tech scene, Finland, with a population of around 5.6 million, is positioning itself as a place where American tech workers can find a better work-life balance without sacrificing their careers — a notable contrast to the famous grindset of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"Of course, there might be long days once in a while, but it's such a high value, and it's also protected by law that you can't work more than an average of 40 hours per week,\" Laura Lindeman, head of the Work in Finland program, told Business Insider.\n\nShe said that even in the tech sector, when people leave work for the day, they really do leave. \"Offices are silent,\" she said. Employers in Finland, often ranked the happiest country in the world, also see the benefit of workers having lives outside work, she said, adding that the general sentiment is \"it narrows your thinking if you only work.\"\n\nFinland is working with more than 30 Finnish tech companies and universities to promote open roles to foreign workers. A preview of the job openings being promoted under the program includes roles with Oura Health (the company behind the Oura Ring), quantum computing firm QMill, and Aalto University.\n\nLindeman said Americans interested in working in Finland should consider reaching out to companies or universities, even if no open roles are listed, as some employers are open to creating positions for the right candidate. While the campaign emphasizes the US, it also targets talent from India, Brazil, and other parts of Europe.\n\nOnce candidates receive a job offer, they can apply for a specialist visa through Finland's Fast Track program. Approved applicants can receive a work-residence permit in as little as two weeks, with processing times averaging about 10 days, Lindeman said. Finland also offers integration programs to help newcomers settle in, and spouses of workers on specialist visas are eligible for work permits, she added.\n\nGovernment data suggests interest from Americans is already rising. Finland granted 60 specialist residence permits to US citizens in 2024 and 85 in 2025, according to Finnish immigration statistics. The number of residence permits granted to US researchers also increased, from 35 in 2024 to 46 in 2025.\n\nJordan Blake Banks, an American who moved to Finland in 2019 to pursue a master's degree through the Fulbright program, said the country offers plenty of benefits, from its forests to its emphasis on work-life balance. After finishing her degree, Banks stayed in Finland and eventually landed a job as a sustainability consultant at Deloitte in Helsinki.\n\n\"The general idea is that the company and the colleagues respect you as a person, and that you can have your free and personal time,\" she said, adding parents regularly leave work during the day for family obligations without stigma. Many Finns also take about a month of vacation during the summer, along with time off in the winter.\n\nBanks said salaries in Finland tend to be lower than in comparable roles in the US, but she thinks the gap is offset by more affordable essential services, including healthcare, education, and childcare.\n\nWhile learning Finnish isn't necessary for working in the country — Lindeman said English is widely used in the tech industry, and about 80% of Finns speak fluent English — Banks said not knowing the language can feel isolating in everyday life.\n\nShe enrolled in a four-month integration program run by the city, where she learned the language and eventually passed the national exam required to become a Finnish citizen. Banks also met her now-wife while living in Finland.\n\nOne cultural adjustment of living in Finland, she said, has been that the people tend to be more reserved than Americans. \"If you're coming from a very friendly culture or a very warm culture, I think that could be a shock,\" she said, adding she'd been able to use that to her advantage.\n\nBanks said speaking up helped her land a paid research position at her university. \"I was willing to make contact and be the brave American willing to ask for things,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Investors are gearing up for a packed week of potentially market-moving updates from Big Tech and the Fed.\n\nThe Fed's coming decision on interest rates and Big Tech earnings could spark fresh volatility in markets, depending on what they tell investors about the path of the economy in 2026 and the state of the AI trade.\n\nInvestors are coming out of a rocky few trading weeks amid weeks of geopolitical tensions and a return of the \"Sell America\" trade. Most recently, President Trump did a U-turn, ramping up his rhetoric about acquiring Greenland before announcing that a framework deal was being hammered out between the US and NATO. The about-face led stocks to rally after plunging earlier in the week.\n\n\"With the Greenland crisis sidelined for now, investors can look forward,\" Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, wrote in a note, pointing to coming tech earnings in particular.\n\nHere's everything on investors' radar this week.\n\nFour of the Magnificent Seven tech titans will report their fourth-quarter results this week.\n\nMega-cap tech earnings have come under greater scrutiny each quarter as investors worry about bloated valuations and returns amid soaring capex spending by AI hyperscalers. The AI trade has remained strong so far in 2026, but concerns are rising about high levels of debt-fueled capex.\n\nEarning season broadly kicks into high gear this week. The companies reporting results during the week make up nearly a third of the S&P 500 and 37% of the technology sector.\n\nThe Fed's January policy meeting kicks off on Tuesday. FOMC members are widely expected to pause rate cuts, with markets pricing in a 97% probability that the committee will opt to keep rates unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nThis week's meeting is coming into sharper focus amid the latest political drama swirling around Powell and the central bank.\n\nMost recently, the Department of Justice kicked off a criminal investigation into Powell for his testimony on the Fed's building renovations last year. While President Trump has said he had no knowledge of the probe, the move is being read as another attempt from the Trump administration to pressure the Fed to cut rates.\n\nTrump is also zeroing in on his next pick for Fed Chair, and markets are still waiting on a ruling from the Supreme Court about whether Trump has the power to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\n\nEnrique Diaz Alvarez, the chief economist at Ebury, said investors seemed preoccupied with \"policy chaos\" and worries about \"institutional degradation,\" referring to concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"We expect Powell to emphasise that the US economy remains in a decent place, while indicating to markets that the FOMC is in no rush to cut rates again,\" Alvarez wrote on Monday.\n\n\"The Fed is unlikely to take any action this week. Inaction is politically the safest strategy, but also the most prudent given mixed economic signals,\" Emily Bowersock Hill, the CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, wrote in a note.\n\nAlso on deck are a handful of economic data updates, including December wholesale inflation and the latest consumer confidence reading.",

    "fullText": "Synthesia makes digital presenters for clients to use in corporate videos and counts 70% of FTSE 100 as customers\n\nA British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.\n\nSynthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.\n\nOn Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.\n\nSynthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.\n\nThe company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nThe startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.\n\nSynthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”\n\nLast year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.\n\n“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.\n\nSynthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.\n\nThe $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.\n\nSynthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.\n\nLast year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, in a speech this month Khan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.\n\nTjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.",

    "fullText": "Molly Russell was just 14 when she took her own life in 2017, and an inquest later found negative online content was a significant factor. With many people now pushing for teenagers to be kept off tech platforms, her father explains why he backs a different approach\n\nIan Russell describes his life as being split into two parts: before and after 20 November 2017, the day his youngest daughter, Molly, took her own life as a result of depression and negative social media content. “Our life before Molly’s death was very ordinary. Unremarkable,” he says. He was a television producer and director, married with three daughters. “We lived in an ordinary London suburb, in an ordinary semi-detached house, the children went to ordinary schools.” The weekend before Molly’s death, they had a celebration for all three girls’ birthdays, which are in November. One was turning 21, another 18 and Molly was soon to be 15. “And I remember being in the kitchen of a house full of friends and family and thinking, ‘This is so good. I’ve never been so happy,’” he says. “That was on a Saturday night and the following Tuesday morning, everything was different.”\n\nThe second part of Russell’s life has been not only grief and trauma, but also a commitment to discovering and exposing the truth about the online content that contributed to Molly’s death, and campaigning to prevent others falling prey to the same harms. Both elements lasted far longer than he anticipated. It took nearly five years to get enough information out of social media companies for an inquest to conclude that Molly died “from an act of self-harm while suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content”. As for the campaigning, the Molly Rose Foundation provides support, conducts research and raises awareness of online harms, and Russell has been an omnipresent spokesperson on these issues.\n\nHe has been busier than ever lately. We meet at a London hotel, a few hours before the House of Lords vote on an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that would ban access to social media for under-16s. The amendment was expected to pass – and it did, by 261 votes to 150. Keir Starmer’s government is in favour of a consultation, and a pause to see how Australia’s trailblazing unfolds. But a UK ban has had widespread support, from Conservatives, including Kemi Badenoch, as well as more than 60 Labour MPs, bereaved relatives of children whose deaths were social media-related, celebrities, campaign groups and, it seems, the public – a YouGov poll in December found that 74% of British adults were in favour.\n\nRussell, however, is not in favour of such a ban. Last Sunday he co-signed a joint statement, alongside the NSPCC, Full Fact, the 5 Rights Foundation and others, arguing that “blanket bans on social media would fail to deliver the improvement in children’s safety and wellbeing that they so urgently need”.\n\nAn inconvenient split seems to have opened up, at a time when online harms and social media companies are finally in the spotlight. But if anyone has spent time weighing up this issue, it’s Russell, and he doesn’t seem like someone looking for controversy. “As a person, I need to gather information and process it before I can come to a conclusion,” he says. “I often find myself at meetings hearing what’s being said, and it can be difficult to contribute because I haven’t formed my opinions yet.” But on this issue he’s firm in his conviction, even if others find it difficult to understand. “We’re in danger of trying to move too fast and trying to find quick-fix solutions,” he says. “If there were quick-fix solutions, honestly, we would have found them.”\n\nThe core arguments laid out by Russell and other opponents of a ban will be familiar to followers of this debate: that children will seek more dangerous alternatives; that they will find ways to circumvent age limits; that they will face a “cliff edge” when they turn 16 and are thrown into the “high-risk” world of social media; that some groups, such as LGBTQ+ and neurodiverse children, will be deprived of valuable online sources of support and connection.\n\nBut Russell’s position also hinges on the Online Safety Act, which is just starting to do what it’s supposed to, he argues. The legislation, passed in 2023, obliges online platforms to conduct robust age verification and prevent harmful content reaching children. It also gives the government and Ofcom, the independent media regulator, powers to fine or even take down platforms not playing by the rules. Molly’s death, and Russell’s campaigning, helped push the act through.\n\nRussell admits progress has been slow. “It took five years of parliamentary debate to put the Online Safety Act on the books. It’s taken Ofcom more than two years, but they are now implementing and enforcing that act. It’s too long, but we have literally just arrived at a place, after all that time, when the platforms, in order to operate in the UK, if their services are likely to be used by children, have to take steps to ensure the safety of those children.”\n\nThe recent furore over Elon Musk’s X and Grok is a good illustration, he says. The integration of Grok AI tools that could manipulate images of women, and even children, to remove their clothing, into X – effectively making a tool for creating deepfake child sexual abuse images widely available – horrified pretty much everyone, Russell included. “I don’t understand how X and Elon Musk can even begin to think that that was acceptable,” he says. “Hideous, wrong, disgraceful. But what was the reaction in the UK to that?” After the issue became known, Ofcom opened a formal investigation into X, acting under the powers of the Online Safety Act. Starmer and technology secretary Liz Kendall said they would support Ofcom if it chose to fine or block ​X. Within days, Musk made a U-turn and removed the software from his platform.\n\nThe Online Safety Act did what a social media ban couldn’t, Russell argues. “If a platform is behaving in an appalling, unsatisfactory, abysmally unsafe manner, it shouldn’t be in this country … A ban [for under-16s] removes the impetus to do that. In fact, what it’s likely to do is have a really chilling effect on the Online Safety Act.”\n\nHe’s not arguing that the legislation is perfect – X was still allowing some users to post sexualised images generated by Grok after Musk’s U-turn, it took weeks for Ofcom to act, and X escaped censure for what many still consider an egregious offence – “but it’s there to be built on. You don’t get anything right the first time … You also have to accept that the development of tech moves so fast, you’re going to constantly have to be amending it and looking at it and updating it. We have to be thinking ahead of the tech crowd.”\n\nA common argument in favour of a social media ban for under-16s is the alcohol analogy. We don’t sanction selling alcohol to minors because it is potentially harmful. Sure, some kids might find a way around it, like getting a fake driving licence, but as a society we’ve put down a marker that you have to be a certain age to drink. Shouldn’t it be the same with social media?\n\nRussell is in favour of regulation, but says it should be sensible and proportionate. He counters with another offline analogy: cars and road traffic. “There will be casualties. It’s sad and tragic when it happens, and we accept that. We don’t say: children under 16 shouldn’t ride in cars to protect them. We say children under 12 should always be in a car seat. We say that everyone in a car, however old, should wear a seatbelt. The industry is compelled to comply with safety measures … We don’t blanket ban 16-year-olds from road travel.”\n\nWe do ban them from driving though, I point out. “I’m not saying we should let 16-year-olds on platforms that encourage irresponsible behaviour. I’m saying we should let 16-year-olds on platforms that are safe for 16-year-olds.”\n\nAge classification should be on a platform-by-platform basis, in Russell’s view: “If there was a platform that was really safe, really good, and connected people and did all the good things that social media could do, we could say 13 is fine.” Some other platforms might be rated 16 or 18, say. “If you were to differentiate like that, you would then drive platforms who wanted to attract younger people [to] start inventing safer things.”\n\nSome might say social media companies have had every chance to do this already. Instead, despite having been repeatedly confronted with evidence of the harms they have caused, they have routinely denied and evaded accountability, and even scaled down their internal checks and balances. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, apologised to parents of social media victims at a Senate hearing in January 2024, but a year later, following Donald Trump’s re-election, he announced that Instagram, Facebook and Threads would be getting rid of factcheckers, even if, he admitted, “it means we’re gonna catch less bad stuff”.\n\n“I don’t trust the platforms at all,” Russell agrees. “You certainly can’t judge a social media platform by what it says; you can only judge by what it does.” And again, he argues, the Online Safety Act is a better weapon to keep them in line. “If you’ve got an effective regulator and strong regulation, then you could go, ‘You’re not doing what you’re telling us you’re doing. You’re not living up to your risk assessment. You’ve got three months to fix it, or you’re out.’ That’s the sort of thing that will make a difference.”\n\nRussell has good reason not to trust the platforms, especially Meta. After Molly’s death, Russell and his family were shocked and confused, until they began to look into her online activity. “We discovered, in a really painful way, because we could see it in her social media accounts, the content that had been fed to her by the platforms.” The feedback loop of the algorithm had served her more and more disturbing content: graphic images and videos relating to suicide, self-harm and depression, often set to music, flashing slogans like “Fat. Ugly. Worthless. Suicidal.” Even a consultant psychiatrist at the inquest into Molly’s death said that they’d had trouble sleeping after viewing it. “That discovery of this awful, nihilistic world in which she was drip-fed largely black-and-white, depressive content, that led her to the place where she thought that the only way forward was to end her life, was horrifying,” Russell says.\n\nInitially, they reported their findings to Instagram, he recalls. “We thought that they’d say, ‘Thank you for reporting this horrible content. We’ll take it down.’” Instead they received replies along the lines of “this doesn’t infringe our community guidelines”.\n\nGetting a complete picture of Molly’s online activity was a long, difficult, painful process. Cooperation from the tech companies was minimal, but Andrew Walker, the senior coroner at the inquest, was tenacious. Pinterest, which had algorithmically sent harmful content to Molly, complied. Twitter (now X) allowed Russell to download the data from Molly’s account, which wasn’t that helpful without the background context. Meta initially supplied tens of thousands of pages of data, which was all but unsearchable. After more demands, delays and ultimatums, eventually, five years after Molly’s death, Meta found an additional 50 lever-arch files of evidence. “Within that evidence was some of the most harmful content that Molly had seen, which completed the picture.” In her final six months, Molly had been exposed to 2,100 pieces of harmful content on Instagram alone. There were only 12 days in that period when she doesn’t seem to have interacted with harmful content on the platform.\n\nA new documentary premiering next month, Molly vs The Machines, combines verbatim reconstructions of moments from the inquest (such as when one Meta executive disputed whether the content Molly was consuming was really harmful at all) and interviews with Russell and Molly’s schoolfriends with a broader critique of big tech and surveillance capitalism: infinite scrolling, engagement-seeking algorithms, misinformation, polarisation – this is not just a problem for teenagers, Russell points out. “There’s an online harm working at the global level, and there’s an online harm working at the personal level that Molly experienced. The two are so interconnected, and we need to collectively work to pull that together.”\n\nThe fact that this debate has become polarised is, if not a direct consequence, then at least a reflection of how social media tends to drag every subject to its extremes. The politicisation of the issue is equally unhelpful in this regard: the Lords amendment (which now returns to the House of Commons for consideration) was led by the Tories, and is being seen as a defeat for Starmer’s government. Lady Kidron described Starmer’s stance as “the very epitome of party before country”.\n\nBut Russell is all for finding middle ground. “I know it will suit many people to divide the cake and say there’s pro-ban and there’s anti-ban. And they can try to set us against each other if they want, and that might work in some cases. In my case, I’ll never be against anyone; I always want to hear their arguments. The division shouldn’t be there; the division should be: people who want the world to be safer for children; and technology companies who are absolutely uncaring of that and caring of their profits – that’s where the dividing line is.”\n\nOn a personal level, can Russell imagine reaching a point where he’ll think his work is done? “I’ve always wanted to just get on with my very ordinary life and remember Molly fondly. But sadly, I don’t see that happening anytime soon, because this is a global problem.” He has tried to keep his life and career as ordinary and unchanged as it was, “so there was something familiar in that second part of my life after Molly’s death.” Russell’s work and his grief are inevitably intertwined. There’s not a day he doesn’t think about her, he says. “Some days, that can invigorate you and it can be tremendously powerful and comforting. And other days it can absolutely stop you in your steps and you can barely bring yourself to come out the door. As time goes on, the harder days are fewer.”",

    "description": "Sandy Adams has always loved France. But it wasn't until she was laid off from her tech job at 69 that she decided to move there and retire.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sandy Adam, 69, who moved from Pittsburgh to Chatou, a suburb of Paris, in 2025. The essay, which also incorporates quotes from emails between Adam and Business Insider, has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy connection to Europe developed over a lifetime. Like many Americans, it began by studying French in high school. I had pen pals in both France and England, and later, when my children were young, we hosted a French student in our home for six weeks. Europe always felt familiar and aspirational.\n\nProfessionally, I spent most of my career working for global companies. But in 2013, I took my first personal trip to Paris and fell completely in love with its architecture and art. While I was there, I took a cooking class to learn how to make macarons and visited Giverny and Versailles.\n\nThat experience reshaped how I imagined my future.\n\nI was kind of forced into retirement in 2025. I was laid off from my tech job and started looking around to see what I should do next. But it's hard to get a job in the US when you're over 50 — much less at my age — so I decided to retire.\n\nAround that time, moving to Europe started to feel more practical. I was living just outside Pittsburgh in a wealthy tax district, and my property taxes kept rising. I owned a 1,700-square-foot, three-bedroom colonial on about a quarter-acre lot that I bought for about $224,500 in 2017. In 2025, my property taxes were about $6,900.\n\nI asked myself: If I tried to live off Social Security, could I afford to stay in that house? I probably could, but it would be really tight. Long-term, though, the financial predictability felt increasingly uncertain — my everyday living expenses, like groceries, were going up too. I wanted to simplify my life, with fewer fixed costs and fewer surprises.\n\nI also wanted a more purposeful life. To me, moving to France meant being able to do more and learn more about history, architecture, and how people live differently from the way we're raised in the US.\n\nI wasn't looking for luxury or escape in France, but for a more grounded and intentional life, one that was rich in experience rather than centered on consumption.\n\nI was also drawn to the European model of daily life: walking as a default, using trains to explore, and having easy access to multiple countries and cultures.\n\nBefore I moved to Europe, I sold my home for $365,000. I used some of the equity from the sale to help fund the move. I'm also on Social Security right now, and when I moved, my monthly benefit was $3,608.\n\nI came to this realization not too long ago: not having a paycheck is a big deal. It took me a while to fully accept that Social Security is my paycheck now, and that my 401(k) and investment portfolio stabilize everything.\n\nI landed in Paris with my dog Phoenix in September and live in the western suburbs, in a town called Chatou.\n\nChatou feels like something out of a Hallmark movie. It's a cute, charming town with beautiful cobblestone streets. You can walk beneath tall trees that form a canopy of leaves overhead, and I can hop on a train and be in central Paris in about 20 minutes.\n\nThe community is a mix of young and older residents, though I'm noticing it skews a bit older. It's also a very wealthy area; the homes here are stunning, at least from the outside.\n\nThe apartment I live in is about 548 square feet. It's a one-bedroom, and it's plenty of room for my dog and me. I pay $1,679 a month, and while it's a little expensive for me, it gives me a soft landing while I figure out where I ultimately want to settle down.\n\nBefore moving to France, I was taking French classes through Carnegie Mellon's online program. I also attended tons of webinars to help establish myself. But I will say this: even if you're prepared, unexpected things still happen.\n\nWhen I got here, my first experience was finding a doctor to refill a prescription. I signed up for Doctolib, got a referral from the local pharmacy, and booked an appointment. The people at the pharmacy didn't speak any English, but fortunately, my French was barely good enough to get by.\n\nThe first few months living in a new country can be exhausting. There's always something new you have to do, another form to file, or another process to start.\n\nFor example, I applied to exchange my driver's license because Pennsylvania has an agreement with France that allows you to do that, but it required a lot of paperwork, like birth certificates, and there were a lot of forms, and I needed translations.\n\nThere's just a lot that keeps you very busy when you move.\n\nStill, I guess I'm lucky that it's just my dog and me. If I had a family and children, I could only imagine how much more overwhelming it would be.\n\nI wondered how I was going to make friends in France.\n\nI told myself I'd join organizations, but I didn't do that right away. One day, I was in the grocery store and overheard two women speaking English. I said out loud, \"Oh, I hear English, it's music to my ears.\" They came over, and it turned out they were au pairs here in Chatou.\n\nOne of them and I became friends; she's 22, and we do a lot together, like running errands and shopping. She has her own social life with other young people, but we still try to get together about once a week.\n\nI also posted in a local Facebook group looking for people to do dog playdates, because I think the move was harder on my dog than it was on me. Through that, I met a nice couple from the UK who are here for three years, and now we hang out and do things together.\n\nI'm also teaching myself urban sketching. I recently found out there's an Urban Sketchers group that meets in Versailles once a month, and I'm planning to go. I'm sure I'll meet more people that way.\n\nIn the US, I felt resolved, though not necessarily excited, about what I thought my life would be.\n\nMy lifestyle was about putting money into things. I'd think, \"Oh, I'll buy a new TV,\" or \"Oh, I'll buy a new couch.\" Here, I'm using my money differently: I bought an annual pass to the Louvre, I'm buying art supplies as I learn to paint, and I just bought a new guitar.\n\nIn France, I wake up happy every day. Retiring abroad feels like a natural extension of the interests and values I have been forming for decades, and is exactly how I want to spend this next chapter of my life.\n\nSometimes, I wonder how long I can afford to live in France. I also imagine what it would be like to move back to the US. I have a son there, and I'm thinking about how to leave him an inheritance.\n\nBut honestly, I don't really see myself moving back. In the US, my life just felt more reactive. It happened around work and obligations. While I still value my ties to the country and its people, I don't feel the same pull to return to that default rhythm.",

    "description": "The killing of Alex Pretti, a US citizen, by ICE in Minneapolis on Saturday has drawn sharp responses from many Americans, including business leaders.",
    "fullText": "Federal immigration agents on Saturday shot and killed a US citizen in Minneapolis — the second fatal shooting involving ICE officers this month — adding more fuel to an already explosive national debate over immigration enforcement.\n\nThe killing sparked an outcry on Minneapolis streets, as well as online, eliciting sharp responses from all sides, including leaders in the business and tech communities.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, for instance, wrote in a post on X that it was \"time to take the temperature down before more lives are lost.\"\n\nMinnesota officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, criticized the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, for what they said were overly aggressive tactics. The DHS, meanwhile, defended its agents, arguing that they are being provoked by unruly protesters and an uncooperative city government and police.\n\nThousands of ICE officers began descending on Minnesota on December 1 as part of Operation Metro Surge. The DHS says it is targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state and has deployed over 2,000 ICE agents across Minnesota.\n\nResidents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul have been protesting since the federal immigration agents arrived. Those demonstrations grew more intense after the first fatal shooting on January 7. In that incident, ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good, 37, as she tried to drive away in a car.\n\nHere's how business and tech leaders are reacting to the latest violence.\n\nThe hedge-fund billionaire called for calm in an X post on Saturday, lamenting that the United States had reached a point where \"there are only two sides to every issue and every incident.\"\n\n\"Individuals are 'convicted' of serious crimes in the headlines, by politicians appealing to their base, and ultimately in the minds of the public, or they are exonerated, before all of the facts are in and a detailed investigation has been completed,\" He wrote. \"This is not good for America.\"\n\nJust two hours later, in another post on X, Ackman laid the blame on Minnesota's state government.\n\n\"It is almost as if the governor of Minnesota called for protesters to intervene in ICE enforcements in an incendiary manner,\" he said, tagging Walz. \"Inciting the people to rise up against law enforcement is guaranteed to end badly, and now we have seen the tragic consequences.\"\n\nLike Ackman, billionaire LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman is perpetually online, posting frequently on social media. He has been largely quiet this weekend, though he has reposted comments from other people, including one that called ICE \"out of control.\"\n\nIn another post that Hoffman amplified, an X user called out \"chronically online tech leaders\" for suddenly falling quiet. Another X user called on business and tech leaders to use their platform to stand up to the Trump administration and its immigration enforcement tactics, to which Hoffman replied, \"It's time for all Americans to do so.\"\n\nJeff Dean, Google DeepMind's chief scientist, wrote in response to a video of the shooting circulating on X: \"This is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nMinneapolis police confirmed that Pretti, who was filming ICE agents when they wrestled him to the ground, was legally carrying a gun.\n\nBorder Patrol officials said Pretti had threatened them with the gun, but multiple videos of the incident show that agents had already disarmed and subdued Pretti when he was shot.\n\nJason Calacanis, a prominent investor and entrepreneur who is these days perhaps most known as one of the hosts of the popular \"All-In\" podcast, blamed the country's political leaders in a post on X on Sunday.\n\n\"Once again, I will remind everyone that our leaders are failing us,\" he wrote. \"True leadership would be to calm this situation down by telling these non-peaceful protesters to stay home while recalling these inadequately-trained agents.\"\n\nHe later posted that \"all of this violence\" could be avoided by fining businesses that hire immigrants who are not in the country legally.\n\nCristina Cordova, the chief operating officer at Linear, a product management software company, called the incident \"indefensible\" in a post on X.\n\n\"The victim's legally owned handgun was removed from the scene, and then ICE agents shot him multiple times. It's far from law enforcement — it's just murder,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Those who defend this don't care about law or order. It's about money, power, and protecting an executive branch that's already been bought and paid for.\"",

    "description": "Kyle Elliott, a career coach for tech employees, told Business Insider clients can vent to the wrong people when they're dealing with a difficult boss.",
    "fullText": "Kyle Elliott, who's been a full-time career coach since 2017, spends his days helping tech employees solve their most challenging work issues.\n\nHe's noticed a common problem among clients: difficult bosses, including micromanagers.\n\nOne key mistake employees make when they're trying to fix a problem, Elliot told Business Insider, is venting to the wrong person — particularly your boss.\n\nIt makes sense to push back against a difficult boss when their behaviour or expectations are disrupting your work, said Elliot, who is based in California. But venting to them will rarely make the situation better, but nearly always damage trust, he added.\n\nEven if you have a good relationship, it would be more appropriate to vent to a friend, family member, or career coach. They can also help you brainstorm solutions.\n\n\"Your boss is not your therapist. You want to come to them with solutions, or at least a clear sense of how they can help you improve the situation or the working relationship,\" he said. \"If you want a promotion, you want your boss to view you as someone who is thoughtful and solution-oriented, not someone who complains.\"\n\nWhen you organize the feedback session with a difficult boss, choose a private setting, such as in a 1-1 meeting, and interlace constructive feedback with positive remarks about things they do that you like.\n\nAnother common issue Elliott encounters is clients misusing their time with him by ranting about their struggles with their boss and what's frustrating them, he said.\n\n\"They often believe they must provide extensive context in order to receive effective coaching, but this isn't true,\" he said.\n\n\"You can vent,\" Elliot added, but \"it's a very expensive venting session.\" While it may feel cathartic, you're better off airing your frustrations to a friend and using your paid coaching session to outline what you can change, such as what battles with your boss to choose, or how to communicate better with them.\n\n\"Coaching is about empowering you, not venting about your manager. Your boss isn't in the coaching session. You are,\" he said.\n\nRead more of Elliott's tips for dealing with a difficult boss.",

    "description": "William Tunstall-Pedoe co-founded Evi, which became Amazon Alexa. Here's why he decided to leave the tech giant and launch a startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, a founder and CEO. Amazon's acquisition of his startup and his role at Unlikely AI have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI helped create Alexa, a product that everyone has heard of and most people have used. I'm proud of what we built.\n\nBut by 2016, it was clear that leaving Amazon, which I joined after the company acquired my startup, was the right decision. Continuing to work on Alexa would have been a very different job from building and launching startups, which I love to do.\n\nWhen I was 13, I would go to a college next to my school to use their mainframe, and since then I've been excited by computers and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with software.\n\nI studied computer science at the University of Cambridge and taught there after graduating in 1991, but I felt better suited to entrepreneurship than to academia. If you create something genuinely new in software, it can be on a billion smartphones in six months and truly change the world. That's impact.\n\nI set out to solve what I saw as a big problem. Internet search relied on users guessing keywords to get results, rather than asking natural questions like we learn to do as children. I imagined a world where you could have that same kind of conversation with computers, which led me to found True Knowledge in 2006.\n\nInitially, we tried to build a search engine that would compete with Google, which didn't work. Then, we enabled other companies to integrate our search engine into their own products — but the larger companies didn't. For a time, we focused on SEO.\n\nThe final pivot was building a voice assistant. We created an application called Evi, which launched in the UK in 2012, a year after Apple introduced Siri. We renamed the company from True Knowledge to Evi to match our product.\n\nAs a 30-person startup, we suddenly found ourselves competing with the world's most valuable company. We spent much of that year talking to major players in tech about being acquired. Later in 2012, Amazon bought our company.\n\nJoining Amazon was the right decision. The company invested heavily in the city of Cambridge, where Evi was based, and turned our startup into a major Amazon office. Our voice assistant became one of the company's biggest and most exciting secrets.\n\nMoving from running a small startup to working inside a business with hundreds of thousands of employees, with Jeff Bezos at the top, was a big change, but I loved working there. I split my time between Amazon's offices in Seattle and Cambridge, and enjoyed going back and forth, making things happen.\n\nWhen we launched Alexa, we were taken aback by the response. It was instantly successful. Today, Alexa is a household name. I'm immensely proud of the Evi team.\n\nAmazon is known for using six-page memos instead of PowerPoint presentations to promote clarity of thought. In 2016, I wrote one to help me decide if I should leave Amazon. In the memo, I laid out these facts: I'd delivered everything I could, the acquisition had been an unambiguous success, and so too had the product. At the time, thousands of people were working on Alexa.\n\nAfter about three and a half years at Amazon, in 2016, it was time to go. I wanted to re-enter the startup world.\n\nIt's certainly possible to launch something new within a big organization, and there are real advantages to doing so. When we launched Alexa, it immediately appeared on the front page of Amazon.com, a level of exposure that most startups could only dream of. I expect I'll work at a big company again at some point in my career.\n\nBut if you're trying to do something novel or contrarian, a startup is often better suited. Within a large company, all it takes is one manager deciding that resources are better spent elsewhere for a project to die. At a startup, it's the opposite. Even if 99 venture capitalists say no, you only need one investor to say yes to keep the project alive.\n\nAfter Amazon, I spent time mentoring at startup incubators such as Creative Destruction Lab. Through that, I became an active angel investor, which gave me a broad perspective of the many ways startups succeed and fail.\n\nIn 2019, I launched Unlikely AI, a deeptech startup focused on building neurosymbolic AI. The goal is to combine the powerful but sometimes incorrect machine-learning models with the world of algorithms, where computers are almost always right. The mission of the business is about making AI trustworthy and reliable.\n\nAs CEO, I'm constantly swamped. Running a startup can be stressful, but working on something truly big and ambitious is incredibly exciting.\n\nI sometimes feel nostalgic about working inside a big organization, but I love being in the startup world. For me, leaving Amazon was the right decision. I don't regret it.",

    "description": "The partnership with the tech giant speaks to a push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind",
    "fullText": "Partnership with tech giant speaks to push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind\n\nIn this World Cup year, Fifa has come out of the blocks quickly. In the past few weeks any number of initiatives have been announced or activated, from a data partnership with Opta to facilitate more betting, to the Fifa Pass for speeding up visa applications for the US this summer, to the unveiling of the official Lego World Cup trophy. Among the ever-expanding list is an intriguing deal with TikTok, a partnership that will give digital creators front-row seats at the 104-match tournament.\n\nIn Fifa language its partnership with the short-form video platform will make “the most inclusive event in football history … even more accessible”. According to TikTok’s global head of content, James Stafford, it will bring fans “closer to the action in ways they can’t get anywhere else”. It plans to do so by granting an unspecified number of online personalities behind-the-scenes access, giving them archive and highlights footage to use in their content and, in return, requesting an avalanche of posts that will make the World Cup inescapable for TikTok users.\n\nIn choosing TikTok as its preferred platform Fifa is catching up with the times. The use of creators, also known as influencers, is increasingly essential for any consumer business. The NFL has integrated creators (quick definition: online personalities who make their living from posting on social media) into coverage of the Super Bowl since the turn of the decade. But the full possibilities of the creator economy are only beginning to be explored by sports organisations.\n\nLast summer the streaming company Dazn built its own creator network for Fifa’s Club World Cup. It enlisted as many as 50 creators to post videos that built excitement around the event, be they behind-the-scenes tours, interviews with players and coaches or stunts such as racing to see who could make it to the Chelsea v Palmeiras game on time.\n\n“It was a new tournament and we wanted to hit every lever we possibly could to generate awareness in as many places as possible, particularly with a younger audience,” says Joe Caporoso, the president of Team Whistle, a Dazn-owned company that specialises in digital strategy. “We searched through people who had strong organic followings on places like Instagram and TikTok, and who had a history of a high volume of posting consistency around not just the sport of soccer, but also the culture of it. We wanted to make sure we had people and creators who spoke authentically and were not shy about showing everything that goes on around the game.”\n\nFrom there, Caporoso’s team laid out a campaign that defined the amount of content creators were expected to generate. A group of editors and content programmers made sure each post was optimised for maximum exposure and liaised with creators to make sure no potential talking point or key moment was missed. Dazn and Whistle tracked the performance of each post, monitored the traffic that went back to Dazn’s coverage, and discussed the outcomes with TikTok.\n\nThis is a degree of oversight materially higher than that of, say, the BBC over Gary Lineker at the last European Championship. It gives a clue to one reason why creators are coming to the fore in sports coverage. Not only are they generally younger, part of a demographic sports leaders are anxious to attract, not only are they trusted by their audience due to a perceived authenticity, but creators are comfortable working in a media environment where the demands of the client come first. Their productivity can be off the charts. They perform, they shoot, they edit, they strike promotional deals, they post regularly and often. They are, in Caporoso’s words, “one-person companies”.\n\nTikTok says the Club World Cup creator platform drove more than 500,000 fans to Dazn’s service and that 90% of fans take “at least one off-platform action” after viewing sports content on their app. Fifa says its creator platform is designed for similar purposes, such as directing new viewers to its match coverage, but it could perform other functions too. It could be a new revenue stream, for example, with Fifa taking a cut from the advertising revenue generated on TikTok through the deal. It could be a way of expanding the reach of sponsorship deals Fifa has elsewhere. It establishes a relationship with a tech giant who may yet be tempted into paying for broadcast rights more broadly. Finally, the new platform could also provide a means for shaping the way the World Cup is talked about.\n\nInstead of allowing the post-match debate or attention between matchdays to be channeled by media companies, a creator platform deal keeps sports organisers in the conversation. “It’s a way for them to become a partner and to have their say, a bit of their say, in how their material is presented on second screens,” says François Godard of the media research company Enders Analysis. Creators offer the possibility of drumming up enthusiasm should interest begin to wane, but also keeping discussion away from topics that might be problematic. When Dazn secured an interview with Donald Trump before the Club World Cup final, it asked Emily Austin, from its roster of creators, to conduct it. A Maga enthusiast and marketer of Trump Derangement Syndrome merchandise, she flattered the US president and Fifa while celebrating the success of the tournament.\n\nCreators present an efficient and effective way of reaching audiences with a defined message. Godard, however, is sceptical of how useful they might be in driving audience growth for sport. “In our data, we see that the viewership of traditional TV by the 16-to-34 age group has collapsed over the past 10 years, but not in sports,” he says. “That’s because sports is unique. It’s live, and there’s no alternative.”\n\nReports in the US have suggested the picture is complicated somewhat by traditional broadcasters having acquired the rights Fifa wants to share with influencers. According to the publication Puck, TikTok would need a sublicensing deal with the broadcaster Fox, an arrangement yet to be struck. In the UK the BBC and ITV jointly hold rights to linear and digital broadcasts. The BBC said it would not comment on rights negotiations.\n\nGodard believes that instead the platform is a play to develop new places where Fifa may ultimately sell its rights, even as it extends the offering on its Fifa+ broadcast platform (thanks to a new deal with Dazn). Whatever the outcome, it may be just that creators have the power to disrupt the media environment that has made Fifa decide to embrace them.",

    "fullText": "To beat the market in recent years, many investors applied a simple strategy: Load up on the biggest U.S. technology stocks.\n\nIt paid handsomely for a long time. But last year, it didn’t. For the first time since 2022, when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, the majority of the Magnificent 7 tech giants performed worse than the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. While the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index rose 25% in 2025, compared with 16% for the S&P 500, that was only because of the enormous gains by Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp.\n\nMany Wall Street pros see that dynamic continuing in 2026, as profit growth slows and questions about payoffs from heavy artificial intelligence spending rise. So far they’ve been right, with the Magnificent 7 index up just 0.5% and the S&P 500 climbing 1.8% to start the year. Suddenly, stock picking within the group is crucial.\n\n“This isn’t a one-size-fits-all market,” said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, which has $1.4 trillion in assets. “If you’re just buying the group, the losers could offset the winners.”\n\nThe three-year bull market has been led by the tech giants, with Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. alone accounting for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gains since the run began in October 2022. But enthusiasm for them is cooling as interest in the rest of the S&P 500 rises.\n\nWith Big Tech’s earnings growth slowing, investors are no longer content with promises of AI riches — they want to start seeing a return. Profits for the Magnificent 7 are expected to climb about 18% in 2026, the slowest pace since 2022 and not much better than the 13% rise projected for the other 493 companies in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n“We’re already seeing a broadening of earnings growth and we think that’s going to continue,” said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Tech is not the only game in town.”\n\nOne source of optimism is the group’s relatively subdued valuations. The Magnificent 7 index is priced at 29 times profits projected over the next 12 months, well below the 40s multiples earlier in the decade. The S&P 500 is trading at 22 times expected earnings, and the Nasdaq 100 Index is at 25 times.\n\nHere’s a look at expectations for the year ahead.\n\nThe dominant AI chipmaker is under pressure from rising competition and concerns about the sustainability of spending by its biggest customers. The stock is up 1,165% since the end of 2022, but it has lost 11% since its Oct. 29 record.\n\nRival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has won data center orders from OpenAI and Oracle Corp., and Nvidia customers like Alphabet are increasingly deploying their own custom made processors. Still, its sales continue to race ahead as demand for chips outstrips supply.\n\nWall Street is bullish, with 76 of the 82 analysts covering the chipmaker holding buy ratings. The average analyst price target implies a roughly 39% gain over the next 12 months, best among the group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFor Microsoft, 2025 was the second consecutive year it underperformed the S&P 500. One of the biggest AI spenders, it’s expected to invest nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures during its current fiscal year, which ends in June. That figure is projected to rise to $116 billion the following year, according to the average of analyst estimates.\n\nThe data center buildout is fueling a resurgence in revenue growth in Microsoft’s cloud-computing business, but the company hasn’t had as much success in getting customers to pay for the AI services infused into its software products. Investors want to start seeing returns on those investments, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\n“What you’re seeing is some people looking for a little bit more quality management in terms of that cash flow management and a better idea on what profitability really looks like when it comes to AI,” Mulberry said.\n\nApple has been far less aggressive with its AI ambitions than the rest of the Magnificent 7. The stock was punished for it last year, falling almost 20% through the start of August.\n\nBut then it caught on as an “anti-AI” play, soaring 34% through the end of the year as investors rewarded its lack of AI spending risk. At the same time, strong iPhone sales reassured investors that the company’s most important product remains in high demand.\n\nAccelerating growth will be the key for Apple shares this year. Its momentum has slowed recently, although the stock closed higher on Friday, narrowly avoiding matching its longest losing streak since 1991. However, revenue is expected to expand 9% in fiscal 2026, which ends in September, the fastest pace since 2021. With the stock valued at 31 times estimated earnings, the second highest in the Magnificent 7 after Tesla, it will need the push to keep the rally going.\n\nA year ago, OpenAI was seen as leading the AI race and investors feared Alphabet would get left behind. Today, Google’s parent is a consensus favorite, with dominant positions across the AI landscape.\n\nAlphabet’s latest Gemini AI model received rave reviews, easing concerns about OpenAI. And its tensor processing unit chips are considered a potential significant driver of future revenue growth, which could eat into Nvidia’s commanding share of the AI semiconductor market.\n\nThe stock rose more than 65% last year, the best performance in the Magnificent 7. But how much more can it run? The company is approaching $4 trillion in market value, and the shares trade at around 28 times estimated earnings, well above their five-year average of 20. The average analyst price target projects just a 3.9% gain this year.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud-computing giant was the weakest Magnificent 7 stock in 2025, its seventh straight year in that position. But Amazon has charged out of the gate in early 2026 and is leading the pack.\n\nMuch of the optimism surrounding the company is based on Amazon Web Services, which posted its fastest growth in years in the company’s most recent results. Concerns that AWS was falling behind its rivals has pressured the stock, as has the company’s aggressive AI spending, which includes efforts to improve efficiency at its warehouses, in part by using robotics. Investors expect the efficiency push to start paying off before long, which could make this the year the stock goes from laggard to leader.\n\n“Automation in warehouses and more efficient shipping will be huge,” said Clayton Allison, portfolio manager at Prime Capital Financial, which owns Amazon shares. “It hasn’t gotten the love yet, but it reminds me of Alphabet last year, which was sort of left behind amid all the concerns about competition from OpenAI, then really took off.”\n\nPerhaps no stock in the group shows how investors have turned skeptical about lavish AI spending more than Meta. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has pushed expensive acquisitions and talent hires in pursuit of his AI ambitions, including a $14-billion investment in Scale AI in which Meta also hired the startup’s CEO Alexandr Wang to be its chief AI officer.\n\nThat strategy was fine with shareholders — until it wasn’t. The stock tumbled in late October after Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $72 billion and projected “notably larger” spending in 2026. When the shares hit a record in August they were up 35% for the year, but they’ve since dropped 17%. Demonstrating how that spending is boosting profits will be critical for Meta in 2026.\n\nTesla’s shares were the worst performers in the Magnificent 7 through the first half of 2025, but then soared more than 40% in the second half as Chief Executive Elon Musk shifted focus from slumping electric vehicle sales to self-driving cars and robotics. The rally has Tesla’s valuation at almost 200 times estimated profits, making it the second most expensive stock in the S&P 500 behind takeover target Warner Bros. Discover Inc.\n\nAfter two years of stagnant revenue, Tesla is expected to start growing again in 2026. Revenue is projected to rise 12% this year and 18% next year, following an estimated 3% contraction in 2025, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStill, Wall Street is pessimistic about Tesla shares this year. The average analyst price target projects a 9.1% decline over the next 12 months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nWittenstein and Vlastelica write for Bloomberg.",

    "description": "Denmark is retiring the iconic F-16 fighter jet fleet and is replacing it with a new high-tech jet. Here's everything you need to know.",
    "fullText": "After 46 years of service to the Royal Danish Air Force, Denmark has retired its fleet of F-16 fighter planes as of January 18, 2026. Denmark has used this versatile, but now obsolete, fighter plane since 1980, having bought a total of 77 of these aircraft. A farewell ceremony was held at Skrydstrup Air Base's Hangar 3, where four F-16s landed after performing one final flight over Danish soil. Pilots, technicians, and others who had worked with the F-16s greeted the invited guests, showing off these planes one last time.\n\nThe history of the F-16 starts in the early 1970s, when a group of General Dynamics aerospace analysts and engineers designed what would become the F-16. Dissatisfied with the trend of making fighter planes more difficult to maneuver and heavier than their predecessors, this group, known as the Lightweight Fighter Mafia, created something completely different.\n\nDenmark is replacing the last of its F-16 aircraft with the F-35A Lightning II fighter jet, which has been used by the Danes since the first ones arrived there in 2023. On the first of April 2025, Denmark's F-35s took over from its F-16s in NATO's Quick Reaction Alert mission. In total, the Danish Defense Ministry has bought a total of 43 F-35s, 27 of them ordered in 2016 plus 16 additional planes in 2025. The F-35A is a single-seat aircraft powered by a Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 engine with 40,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nDenmark's switch to a full fleet of F-35A Lightning IIs makes the Royal Danish Air Force the third air force in the world, after Norway in 2022 and the Netherlands in 2024, to consist entirely of fifth-generation fighter planes, all of them being F-35As. They have all replaced their obsolete fleets of F-16s with these cutting-edge, multirole fighters. The replacement process took as long as it did due to major delays in producing the F-35 for the various forces around the world.\n\nThe F-35, which comes in many variants with distinct features, is made in three different versions for various use cases. The F-35A, the version which the U.S. Air Force and Denmark uses, is designed for conventional takeoff and landing. The F-35B, made for the U.S. Marine Corps, has a short takeoff and vertical landing capability. The F-35C, produced for the U.S. Navy, is adapted for launching from and landing on the Navy's aircraft carriers.\n\nDenmark's fleet of F-16 fighter jets are going to two different locations. Even though these F-16s are quite old, with the first batch delivered in 1980, the Danes have not only maintained them very well, they have also modernized them over the years. These actions have helped to make these planes more suitable for sale than scrapping.\n\nOne group of F-16s will be donated to Ukraine, as part of the 19 planes Denmark agreed to donate to the Ukrainian Air Force in 2023. The first of the Danish F-16s, one of the many kinds of fighter jets Ukraine has, reached Ukraine in August 2024. Denmark has also pledged to support the costs associated with training of Ukrainian pilots in Denmark, as well as those required for the maintenance and operations of these planes after they reach Ukraine. The Ukrainian Air Force uses their F-16s primarily to defend the country against Russian drones and missiles, as well as for dropping precision-guided bombs to provide close air support.\n\nA total of 24 of Denmark's F-16s will be sold to Argentina, which has not had any supersonic fighters in its arsenal since the country retired its French Mirages back in 2015. The U.S. Government was heavily involved in this deal due to its export regulations. The Argentinian F-16 package also includes training, parts, and simulators, to ensure proper maintenance and operation of the Argentine Air Force's 'new' F-16s. The first six planes were delivered in December, with additional batches each year through 2028.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Kristalina Georgieva says research suggests 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected, with many entry-level roles wiped out\n\nArtificial intelligence will be a “tsunami hitting the labour market”, with young people worst affected, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned the World Economic Forum on Friday.\n\nKristalina Georgieva told delegates in Davos that the IMF’s own research suggested there would be a big transformation of demand for skills, as the technology becomes increasingly widespread.\n\n“We expect over the next years, in advanced economies, 60% of jobs to be affected by AI, either enhanced or eliminated or transformed – 40% globally,” she said. “This is like a tsunami hitting the labour market.”\n\nShe suggested that in advanced economies, one in 10 jobs had already been “enhanced” by AI, tending to boost these workers’ pay, with knock-on benefits for the local economy.\n\nMeanwhile people whose jobs were not directly changed by artificial intelligence risked being squeezed, she said, with their pay potentially falling without a productivity boost from AI.\n\n“So the middle class, inevitably, is going to be affected,” Georgieva predicted.\n\nShe said her greatest fear was that AI was insufficiently regulated. “This is moving so fast, and yet we don’t know how to make it safe. We don’t know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it,” she said.\n\nMuch of the debate at the annual meeting of the business and political elite in the Swiss ski resort this week has been hijacked by Donald Trump’s on-off tariff threats over the future of Greenland.\n\nBut many delegates were also keen to highlight the risks and benefits of AI. Christy Hoffman, general secretary of the UNI global union, told the Guardian: “It’s just a basic premise that the point of AI, on the business side, is to increase productivity, therefore lower costs – which will be cutting jobs.”\n\n“I think it’s time to come to terms with that disruption – and how to manage that disruption,” she said, calling for the productivity benefits to be distributed fairly across the economy.\n\n“We want to share in the gains. We’re not going to stop AI, nor do we want to even try – but we don’t want it to just roll over us.” She called on employers to discuss the role of AI tools with workers and their representatives before introducing them.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, warned that AI could lose its “social permission” to compete for resources such as energy, for example, if it failed to generate benefits beyond a few powerful tech firms – such as the rapid development of effective new drugs.\n\nGeorgieva was speaking on a panel alongside the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who warned that the AI boom could be hampered by growing mistrust between rival economies, as the US throws up tariff barriers.\n\n“We are dependent on each other,” she said, pointing out that AI was capital intensive, energy intensive and data intensive. If countries did not work cooperatively and “define the new rules of the game,” she said, there would be less capital and less data. “We are in a bind, lets face it,” she said.\n\nLagarde also sounded the alarm about widening global inequality, highlighting the “disparity that is getting deeper and bigger”.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, urged delegates to face up to a permanent “rupture” in the global economic order, and band together in the face of erratic US trade policy.\n\nBut Lagarde said she was less gloomy. “I’m not exactly on the same page as Mark,” she said. “I’m not sure that we should be talking about rupture. I think we should be talking about alternatives.”",

    "fullText": "US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over private share sale that values business at $800bn\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly lining up four Wall Street banks to help the company list on the stock market as investors prepare for an expected rush of US tech listings.\n\nSpaceX is considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in an initial public offering, according to the Financial Times and Reuters.\n\nThe US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over a private share sale that values the business at $800bn (£591bn), months after it was valued at $400bn. Reuters has also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $25bn from what would be one of the biggest ever global listings if it goes ahead.\n\nLast year Musk, the world’s richest man with a $690bn fortune, said SpaceX’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa, the US space agency. SpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink broadband service.\n\nReports of SpaceX’s flotation plans come amid expectations of a bumper year for US tech listings. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and AI rival Anthropic are among the startups that are the focus of IPO speculation, with reported valuations of $1tn and $350bn respectively. The potential IPOs have been dubbed “hectocorns” – businesses worth more than $100bn.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said Musk’s ambitions to colonise Mars were the “headline grabber” for SpaceX, but investors will pay more attention to growth plans, such as putting solar farms and datacentres into orbit.\n\nReferring to a potential OpenAI IPO, Wilson added: “SpaceX is going to garner a lot of attention but it’s going to be a real test for these AI IPOs. If OpenAI does IPO then it’s a litmus test for the entire sector – can we really hang our hats on a startup? Do the figures add up?\n\n“The stock market has been riding the AI wave for two years and faces a stern test of resilience with some monster IPOs that will define whether this was a bubble or not.”\n\nGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and SpaceX were approached for comment.",

    "description": "Hisham Alrayes, CEO of GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models to spread AI's gains across its economy.",
    "fullText": "Open source — that might be the clearest signal of how China wants artificial intelligence to reshape its economy.\n\nHisham Alrayes, the group CEO of Bahrain-based GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models and broad deployment to spread AI's gains across the economy, instead of funneling them to a few tech giants.\n\nSpeaking at a Davos panel on China's \"AI+ Economy\" strategy on Wednesday, Alrayes said the country's approach reflects a fundamentally different economic philosophy.\n\n\"You look at the open structure of the China AI philosophy — then you have the non-open structure,\" Alrayes said. \"That signals that the benefit they want to see is to trickle down into the economy, into the companies.\"\n\nChina's most prominent AI breakout, DeepSeek, reflects that philosophy.\n\nIt mostly uses open-source models that have drawn global attention, in contrast to many large US language models that remain closed and proprietary, reaping the benefits of tightly controlled commercial ecosystems.\n\nMeta's former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, has said that a key reason behind DeepSeek's success is its open-source model, which, he said, can outperform proprietary models in terms of efficiency and innovation by building on shared research.\n\nMeanwhile, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said that China's open-source AI models could gain an edge globally because they're free, making them more attractive than costly proprietary US systems for governments and countries that can't afford closed models.\n\nSimilarly, Alrayes said, China — in pursuing the open model — is aiming for affordability and scale.\n\n\"It's not the benefit of that company, of that product, the return of that individual. It's not an individual — it's an economy,\" Alrayes said.\n\nThat philosophy is reflected in China's national \"AI Plus\" action plan, which prioritizes diffusion, said fellow panelist Gong Ke, executive director of the Chinese Institute for New Generation AI Development Strategies at Nankai University.\n\nThe policy, he said, focuses on embedding AI across manufacturing, healthcare, finance, education, and other sectors, rather than on breakthroughs such as artificial general intelligence.\n\nHe added that the plan sets explicit adoption targets, with AI agents and intelligent terminals expected to reach 70% penetration by 2027 and 90% by 2030.\n\nAlrayes said China's open-source tilt ultimately reflects a broader goal: making AI an economic utility rather than a profit center for a small group of companies.\n\n\"China is looking to create value throughout the economy, very clear, with very specific objectives across the economy,\" he said. \"Not just as a benefit to those companies. This is the difference in the philosophy.\"",

    "fullText": "My colleague Ben Bergman rubbed shoulders with world leaders, tech gurus, and venture capitalists in Davos this week.\n\nThere's nothing better than being in the room where it happens. I asked Ben what he saw and heard. Here are his highlights:\n\nQ: What was the biggest tech thing that was talked about at Davos this year?\n\nIt's hard to compete with President Trump and Greenland, but aside from that, AI was what everyone was talking about.\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about when businesses will start to see productivity gains that justify their huge AI spend and whether we are in a bubble.\n\nQ: What tech discussion/theme surprised you at Davos?\n\nWalking down the main thoroughfare in Davos is always a highlight because all the shops that are open the rest of the year are taken over this week by companies that host \"houses\" to showcase their brands and host clients and events.\n\nIt is interesting to see who's here and who's not.\n\nDavos is not a tech conference, and I've usually thought of it as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies.\n\nWalking along the street this year, 80% of the houses were tech. Palantir and Meta (with its free hot chocolate stand) had the most visible presence. Amazon's house was surprisingly small. Google was far away from the main action. Lightspeed was the only venture capital firm I saw, with its odd retro \"Lighthouse.\"\n\nIt is also interesting to see who was not here. OpenAI has no house, and Sam Altman did not come, though some executives are here. Elon Musk was not originally part of the program but was a last-minute addition on Thursday.\n\nQ: What was the tone of the tech executives and tech investors there?\n\nIf executives and investors are worried about the future, they did not share that with me or on stage.\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang described what is happening with AI as \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" and not only that, but said it will drive job creation across the global economy.\n\nQ: What was the biggest concern expressed by tech executives and tech investors at Davos this year?\n\nWhile optimism ruled the week, the fear of being in an AI bubble was on everyone's mind.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella warned onstage Tuesday that there would be a bubble if the only companies using AI are other AI companies.\n\n\"For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,\" Nadella said.\n\nHuang cited the rising rental price of computer chips as evidence that we are not in a bubble.\n\n\"If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs,\" he said.\n\nAnother concern from tech executives I spoke to was how hard it is to hire and retain top talent right now, especially as big AI labs spend like drunken sailors to hire.\n\n\"It's astronomical amounts of money at the big level,\" Winston Weinberg, CEO and co-founder of Harvey, told me. He said he spends 70% of his time on hiring.\n\n\"I'm super involved, and I think it's the most important thing at our company right now, Weinberg said.\n\nQ: Anything else tech folks should know from your time there?\n\nThere were so many techies here that sometimes I felt like I was in San Francisco.\n\nI asked a couple of startup founders why they came so far to be here, and the consensus was that there's nothing like Davos for the efficiency of meeting potential customers and investors who are all packed into a tiny Swiss village for the week.\n\nWaiting in the cold in a long line for a party for General Catalyst and Lightspeed, I asked one founder why he traveled here.\n\nHe told me Alexandr Wang, founder and former CEO of Scale AI, who is now chief AI officer at Meta, advised him Davos was highly useful because Wang last year said he signed almost a third of Scale's customers in the short time he was here.\n\nWeinberg told me that dealmaking started even before I arrived, with many transactions happening in the business-class sections of flights to Zurich from San Francisco and New York.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia considered the government’s claims that Meta snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago. He ruled in November that Meta had not broken the law.\n\n“Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp,” an agency spokesman, Joe Simonson, said. “Thankfully for Americans, there is an appeal process.”\n\nA Meta spokesman, Christopher Sgro, said in a statement that Judge Boasberg’s “decision to reject the F.T.C.’s arguments is correct, and recognizes the fierce competition we face.”\n\nThe F.T.C. is aiming to reverse a setback in the government’s campaign to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies. In the last two years, the government has won federal antitrust cases against Google, with judges saying the company has monopolies in online search and advertising technology. It has also sued Amazon and Apple over monopoly concerns.\n\nJudge Boasberg’s six-week trial in the lawsuit against Meta featured testimony from witnesses including Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, and an Instagram founder, Kevin Systrom.\n\nThe government argued that Meta bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014 to get rid of the threat posed by young competitors.\n\nJudge Boasberg ruled in favor of Meta’s arguments that changes in social media, including the growth of TikTok and YouTube, undercut the government’s case about Meta’s dominance.\n\nThe F.T.C.’s notice of appeal on Tuesday, filed in the District Court, is preliminary. The agency will lay out its legal argument for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit at a later date.",

    "description": "The early winners of the legal tech boom are gobbling up smaller competitors.",
    "fullText": "Legal tech is entering its consolidation era.\n\nEarly signs are already visible. This week, Harvey, an $8 billion legal software giant, acquired Hexus, a sales tech startup built by former Google and Twitter (now X) engineers. Filevine, another major legal tech player, recently snapped up Pincites, a four-person startup that was an early Y Combinator bet on what has since become one of legal tech's hottest frontiers: artificial intelligence-powered contract drafting and revision.\n\nAnd earlier this month, Microsoft quietly absorbed 18 employees from the legal software startup Robin AI after it filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIndustry executives say this is just the beginning. Early winners of the legal tech boom are expected to buy smaller companies to extend their leads and add new features to their software.\n\nFor teams in a crowded legal tech market, joining one of those platforms is increasingly attractive, said John Locke, a Filevine investor and partner at Accel, who leads the firm's growth fund. He believes Harvey and Filevine could both be significant public companies someday.\n\n\"They're now at a point where people look at them and say, 'I would like to join that fast train,'\" Locke said.\n\nPincites wasn't looking for an exit.\n\nThe company was founded in 2023 by two sisters working from home. Sona Sulakian was a transactional patent attorney. Mariam Sulakian worked on GitHub Copilot, focusing on security. They saw a gap: Lawyers negotiate contracts inside Microsoft Word, but most AI tools lived elsewhere.\n\nThey built a Word plug-in lawyers actually used, and racked up customers including Redis, Glean, and Vercel. In 2023, Pincites raised a seed round led by Nat Friedman, GitHub's former CEO, and Daniel Gross, who, with Friedman, now works in Meta's superintelligence lab.\n\nInvestors encouraged the sisters to raise another round of funding. Then the inbound acquisition interest started.\n\nAt one point, there were at least five or six term sheets on the table, Ryan Anderson, Filevine's founder and CEO, said. The sisters initially waved them off.\n\nWhat changed, both sides said, was familiarity. Filevine had already been a customer. Its internal legal team used the Pincites software for contract redlining — the process of marking up and revising contract drafts during negotiations — and pushed Anderson to take a closer look.\n\nFounded in 2014, the Utah company now manages over 13 million active legal matters on the platform and sells software used by law firms, corporate legal teams, and government agencies. Its customers include Kroger, Goodwill, the Utah Jazz, and five state attorneys general.\n\nFilevine has raised over $600 million in funding to date and was last valued at $3 billion.\n\nWhat the company lacked was a next-generation redlining tool.\n\nSome competitors, Anderson noted, promote redlining as a core feature. To compete for enterprise and mid-market deals, Filevine needed a comparable offering.\n\nThe entire Pincites team is joining Filevine and will anchor a new San Francisco office. Over time, the product will be folded into Filevine's system, creating what Anderson calls \"a single pane of glass\" where users can draft and edit documents, pull in context from other systems, and track time and billing.\n\nFor the Sulakian sisters, the decision came down to distribution. Pincites had more ideas than it had capacity to execute, they said, and expanding its customer base fast enough to capture the market would have required years of additional fundraising and hiring. Joining a larger platform offered a shortcut.\n\nPincites didn't sell because it was distressed, Mariam said. \"We would have been fine no matter what.\" It sold because the market is maturing.\n\nAfter years of experimenting with narrow, single-purpose tools, law firms and in-house legal teams are looking to simplify, Sona said. Managing a patchwork of apps became costly and unwieldy, particularly for smaller firms.\n\nThat pressure is now driving a \"shakeout of point solutions,\" said Omar Haroun, cofounder and chief executive of the legal tech company Eudia.\n\n\"The winners will be platforms embedded in daily legal workflows and tied to outcomes,\" Haroun said. \"The rest will be acquired, merged, or phased out.\"\n\nThat dynamic mirrors what played out during the rise of mobile software. Smartphones unleashed a wave of narrowly focused apps, made possible by cheap development and easy distribution. But as platforms matured, users tired of app sprawl, and the biggest companies began bundling features or buying competitors outright. Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. Google bought Waze.\n\nLegal tech now appears to be entering a similar phase, as large language models lower the barrier to building these tools — and raise the bar for surviving as a standalone company.\n\nOver $4 billion flowed into startups building technology for lawyers last year, nearly double the amount raised the year before, according to Crunchbase. More than a third of last year's investment went to just three companies: Harvey, Filevine, and Clio, which sells software used by law firms to track cases and send invoices.\n\nLast year, Clio scooped up the legal research platform vLex for $1 billion, part of its push to become the system of record for small and midsize firms.\n\nWith that concentration of capital comes pressure. The biggest players have to deploy it. And smaller startups have to prove they can hold their own. For some builders, the choice may increasingly be to sell — before the window narrows further.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Janie George, 31, a mother and senior art director based in Utah. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in the '90s and 2000s with the sound of dial-up and the feeling of figuring out how to use a computer for the first time. When the first iPhone came out, I was in junior high school, and I learned more digital things as time went on.\n\nAs parents to our 3, 6, and 9-year-olds, my husband and I are trying to raise our kids with a nice balance between modern and analog. Our goal is to keep the '90s alive in our household.\n\nWe live in a really busy time, and I don't want to pretend we don't have modern conveniences in my house. We have TVs and other things that are definitely not from the '90s and back further, but living a more analog lifestyle has allowed my family to connect, slow down, and have more fun moments together. We use everything from a film camera to a typewriter, a Tin Can phone, VHS tapes, and more.\n\nIt has brought me a lot of joy, and it's been fun to share with my kids what both my husband and I experienced growing up.\n\nIt's been two or three years of trying to be more selective and more specific about the media that my kids consume as it relates to their development and attention span. A few months ago, we bought a VHS and DVD machine from Facebook Marketplace for $80.\n\nMy husband and I have been showing our kids classic movies, and my son loves to watch \"Jaws\" and \"Indiana Jones.\" I know my parents loved showing me \"Gilligan's Island,\" \"Bewitched,\" \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" and \"Hogan's Heroes,\" and I had a lot of joy experiencing their joy with them. It's been fun to connect on that and share with my kids.\n\nWe also have a Nintendo Classic Mini: Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System, which include classic games. They plug in with an HDMI and are preloaded with games, making them super easy to set up.\n\nThey can turn on what they want, rewind it, and be fully independent. When they want to play the Nintendo Switch or watch a more modern movie or something on YouTube TV, it's upstairs with mom and dad, and we're helping facilitate that.\n\nWe have a thrift store just down the road, and my kids are welcome to use the money from chores to purchase any movie they're hoping to get. We've also been looking for certain movies on eBay to add to our collection, which is really fun.\n\nSomething we've implemented and plan to do more often is creating the feeling of going to the movie rental store and picking out a movie. We've done it a couple of times: we go to Savers, a local thrift store, pick out a movie, get a pizza, pick out a treat, and have that same feeling I had, but letting them lead the way.\n\nI've taken our family photos on film for several years, and I'm trying to teach my kids that we don't need an instant photo. We can take our time, be in the moment, and feel excited about the process.\n\nIt's fun for me to pick the photos and turn them into a family book every year. A huge part of it is made up of the photos I take with that camera. You just can't capture that type of moment with an iPhone or other digital camera.\n\nI don't know if my children really care about it yet, but they love getting the chance to take the photo and hear the noises, along with the tactile feeling. I've spent a lot of money on film and developing it, but it's worth it.\n\nOne time, we found a really cool box of trading cards at Savers, and my son curated a pack of them for his friends for Christmas. One of his friends really likes the Packers, so we found all the Packers cards that were in that box and gave them to him. It just offers another activity and form of connection for my kids and their friends.\n\nThey like to take their binder of cards in the basket of their bike to their friend's home to trade cards — stuff that I watched my brothers do. I didn't offer it to them; it was just a natural thing they wanted to do.\n\nWhen one of my kids wants to have a playdate, they have to ask me to call their friend's mom to schedule it. I work full time, so it can be difficult to manage my kids' schedules in their entirety.\n\nThe Tin Can phone idea was really exciting to me because we can decide who they can call and when it's available to use, using its quiet time feature.\n\nThe Tin Can phone costs $75 plus shipping, but there's a $9.99 monthly fee to call any phone on any network. It's been 100% worth it. Sometimes on FaceTime, they want to hit all of the buttons and see all the faces. While that's fun, I don't know that they're actually communicating with the other person.\n\nBesides being able to schedule play dates, my son is having fun coming home from school and calling a friend. It's such a great way to gain skills like speaking on the phone, speaking politely, and managing their schedules. It also delays the need for a cellphone. I just want them to be present with where they are.\n\nA few years ago, one of my sons asked for a typewriter for Christmas. He had one in one of his preschool classes. It was analog and fun, and he was really excited about it. I spent $35 on a vintage typewriter on Facebook Marketplace.\n\nMy kids say they love writing letters to friends and Santa on the typewriter. They show their friends how it works, and they use it every couple of days. One of their favorite activities is when I type up a design \"brief,\" and they draw or design a logo based on that brief.\n\nWhen we bought the Tin Can phone, we thought a Rolodex would be a really fun way for them to keep track of their friends' and other phone numbers. Plus, it looks kind of cute on the table. We picked one out on eBay, typed out all of the cards with the typewriter, and decorated them with stickers.",

    "description": "A Gen Zer landed an engineering role at Snap without a tech internship, thanks to a networking trick and support from her friends.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sreeja Apparaju, a 24-year-old machine learning engineer at Snap living in New York. Business Insider has verified Apparaju's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I decided to pivot from finance to tech in the fall of 2022, a couple of things were working against me.\n\nI was less than a year from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with a double major in computer science and economics, and some large tech companies had announced major layoffs before the end of the year. That made me nervous about the demand for new hires.\n\nI also didn't have any tech internships to fall back on. The prior summer, I'd interned as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, but I realized that finance didn't feel like the right path; I was more excited about the kind of work happening in tech.\n\nIt felt like unfortunate timing to be searching for tech roles — but at least I didn't have to job hunt alone.\n\nGiven these challenges, I was fortunate to have the support of a close circle of four friends who were applying to many of the same software engineering roles. When one of us heard from a recruiter or HR professional, we'd share their contact information with the group.\n\nThat's how I connected with a Palantir recruiter. Within a week of applying, I received an online assessment and was scheduled for an interview. I didn't end up getting the job, but I'm confident that getting on the recruiter's radar helped boost my chances.\n\nIn job searching, there can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of others. In my experience, though, sharing what we knew and helping each other out made the process easier — and faster — for all five of us.\n\nEvery win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was the motivation I needed to keep pushing for a job offer. One landed a role at Amazon, and another joined Salesforce. However, by the end of 2022, I was still looking.\n\nIn early January 2023, I came across an opening at Snap Inc. — the company behind Snapchat — for a software engineering role. Snap had already been on my radar as a company I thought could be a good fit. The cousin of one of my friends in my job search circle worked there, and I immediately reached out to them, obtained their referral, and submitted my application within a couple of days of the role being posted.\n\nHowever, February came around, and I still hadn't heard back from Snap. I decided to take action; I got on LinkedIn and searched for a recruiter at the company who specialized in hiring new graduates.\n\nMy goal was to reach out via email rather than a LinkedIn message. Since I didn't have a LinkedIn Premium account, I was limited in the number of characters I could use — and I worried that sending a short message would come across as superficial.\n\nI eventually found someone who appeared to be the recruiter, but their email wasn't listed anywhere. However, I did have the email of my referral contact, so I decided to guess the recruiter's email address based on the same email format — a strategy that had worked for me in the past. If I guessed incorrectly, I'd get an error message, and then I'd try a different version.\n\nI could have asked my referral for the recruiter's email, but I was already deeply grateful for their time and referral, and I felt uncomfortable asking for more.\n\nFortunately, it didn't take long for me to send an email that appeared to go through. It included my résumé and an expression of interest in the role.\n\nWithin a few days, I received a response from the recruiter and was given an online assessment to complete. Shortly after, I did my first interview — a one-hour technical and behavioral interview with an engineer.\n\nThat was followed by a final interview round, which included four one-hour technical interviews, a 30-minute Q&A session, and a 30-minute break between the third and fourth rounds — about five hours total in a single day.\n\nOne thing I like about Snap is that it's smaller than companies like Meta or Google, which means I'm given a lot of agency and independence on the projects I work on.\n\nMy top pieces of advice for other job seekers are:\n\nI'm really glad I listened to my gut and decided to pivot to tech when I started to sense during my finance internship that it wasn't the right path for me, rather than continuing down the same road.\n\nAdditionally, I'd recommend leaning on others, whether that's friends or your broader network. Given the tough job market, I've found that many people are willing to help if you reach out to them.",
