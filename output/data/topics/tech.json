    "fullText": "MLB’s ABS Challenge System has baseball fans intrigued by how it affects games and New York Yankees star Aaron Judge got a look in spring training.\n\nThe new Automatic Ball-Strike technology has been in the works in baseball for many years. However, 2026 will finally mark its debut at the MLB level after several years of operation in the minor leagues.\n\nMeanwhile, Judge got a closer look at how the ABS Challenge System works Thursday in New York’s spring training game. Unfortunately for the MLB superstar, the result didn’t go in his team’s favor.\n\nMORE: 2026 World Baseball Classic favorites, nations with best odds to win title\n\nAaron Judge challenges the call\n\nA closer look at how the ABS Challenge System powered by T-Mobile will look when you head to the ballpark in 2026! pic.twitter.com/REZNXJOrB9\n\nMLB posted a video breaking down the sequence when Judge stepped up to the plate. In a matter of seconds, everyone in the stadium, including Judge, was able to see the pitch and where it landed in relation to the strike zone.\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred continues to find ways to innovate in professional baseball, and the ABS Challenge System could be another huge win for the sport. This comes on the heels of the pitch clock speeding up the timing of games in recent seasons.\n\nBaseball fans are seemingly enjoying the faster-paced nature of games, and the new challenge system can surely play an additional role in speeding things up.\n\nMORE: Rear end surgery sidelines MLB knuckleballer in spring training\n\nOne area of the game that MLB fans at home will need to adjust to is the on-air experience with the new ABS system. The league recently revealed that TV watchers won’t be able to see the customary strike zone that’s been shown on screen for several years.\n\nBaseball originally introduced the concept to make it clearer for fans to see balls and strikes. It marked a similar technology to how the NFL has used a virtual yellow line to indicate first downs.\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nOLYMPICS: Most talked-about Olympic romances from 2026 Winter Games\n\nNBA: Andrew Friedman, other Dodgers execs get new roles with Lakers after $10 billion sale\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: USA men’s hockey draws record Olympic gold medal TV viewership\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Martin Short’s daughter Katherine tragically dies at age 42\n\nVIRAL: Pat McAfee makes stunning gesture during Team USA’s $150K Gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Yankees star gets closer look at MLB’s new ABS Challenge System appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "A storm of layoffs is upon us, and tech career coach Kyle Elliott shared mistakes he helps his clients avoid.",
    "fullText": "More than 1.1 million people were laid off in the US in 2025, and there were more job cuts in January 2026 than any January since 2009, according to reports. Business leaders are predicting that things will only get worse as AI disrupts the workforce.\n\nWhen Amazon announced layoffs earlier this year, the tech career coach Kyle Elliott shared what he thinks employees should do immediately after being laid off to put them in the best position to find a new role.\n\nHe also shared three common mistakes to avoid after a layoff.\n\nAfter the sting of a layoff, Elliott has seen workers turn to LinkedIn to share negative posts about their former employer.\n\n\"Sometimes people just really react from that emotion or wound, instead of waiting until it heals,\" he said.\n\nSuch posts could be detrimental when applying for a new job, when recruiters and hiring managers check your LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"People want to work with other positive people, so if they see that you're venting, they may worry, 'if we have to conduct layoffs in the future, are you going to then put a hit piece out on us as soon as you get laid off?\" Elliott said.\n\nInstead, consider waiting until you are more able to position the event differently in your post, which could be a month or two after, Elliot said. In the post, share lessons you learned and the amazing work you did at your previous company, he added.\n\nFormer colleagues can be a good resource when you're looking for jobs in the future. In your last conversation with your former colleagues before leaving the company, reiterate the work you're proud of and share what kind of opportunity you're looking for next, Elliott said.\n\nWith this in mind, it may be better to vent about your layoff experience to a trusted confidant like a spouse, best friend, or therapist rather than a former colleague, he added.\n\nVenting to a colleague could damage their perception of you and jeopardize the connection.\n\n\"A lot of people will remember that last piece, and you don't want them to be like, 'oh, they're bitter.'\" he said.\n\nElliott has noticed that clients are sometimes afraid to network because of the stigma associated with layoffs, and their fear that they can't add value to conversations while unemployed.\n\n\"Layoffs are normal now,\" Elliott said, so there's no need to avoid reaching out to people out of fear.\n\nHe recommended starting small. For example, meet a former colleague whom you were close to.\n\nIn your first conversation, focus on putting yourself out there and taking small steps toward your next role, and don't expect to be offered a job, he said.\n\n\"If you were fired and you're calling it a layoff, it's a little different. But if you were truly just laid off as part of a reorganization or cost-cutting measures, people understand that, and there shouldn't be shame in that,\" he said.",

    "description": "\"For Love & Money\" answers your relationship and money questions. This week, a reader feels resentful at his wife's lack of financial contribution.",
    "fullText": "Until recently, I was an executive at a tech company, earning a great income. My wife is an artist; she's always pursuing one career or another, trying to maintain a sense of financial independence, but she's never made much money doing it.\n\nThen, I got laid off. Now we're down to just our savings and her income. I'm trying my best to find a new job, but until then, we're relying on her. And while I'm spending every waking minute trying to find work, it seems like she's content making next to nothing while she continues pursuing a career we both know she'll never have.\n\nI am frustrated and resentful. How come she gets to chase this impractical dream when, even now, between jobs, I am the one responsible for keeping the ship afloat?\n\nI wonder if it's a gender thing. I'm a man; therefore, I must provide, and she is a woman, so she doesn't? I feel alone with this burden when I'd really like a partner to help me carry it.\n\nI appreciate your question, and understand that you recently lost your job — something that can be difficult for people not only in terms of financial security but also their sense of achievement and self — and feel unsupported by your wife.\n\nBased on what you've said, though, it sounds like you're discussing this issue with the wrong person; you need to talk to your wife — not only because she's your partner and the only other person with an equal stake in your finances, but also because, as I read your letter, it became increasingly clear that you're assuming a few things, like your wife's motives, the role of gender dynamics, and that her focus is entirely on her personal objectives.\n\nThe first assumption you're making is about why your wife is acting the way she is. In your letter, you wrote that she is \"trying to maintain a sense of financial independence\" and also that she is \"content making next to nothing.\" Which is it? Is she participating in the soul-crushing grind of trying to get her career as an artist to the point of actually paying off? Or is she casually indulging in her hobby while you write the checks?\n\nUntil you ask her and really listen to her answer, feeling resentful or frustrated is unfair, because those feelings are a construct of your assumptions. Instead, ask your wife where she sees her career in the next five years, what support she needs to get there, and how she wants to adjust it to fit your current circumstances.\n\nThis leads me to the next assumption you're bringing into this dynamic, which is particularly evident in your question: \"Is this a gender thing?\" My answer to that would be, it very well could be — not necessarily because your wife expects a man to provide for her, but because you're projecting that notion onto her.\n\nYour letter seems to suggest you view her contribution to your family's financial survival as voluntary, while you have no choice. In your words, \"Even now, between jobs, I am the one responsible for keeping the ship afloat.\" However, your wife is also an adult with a credit score, who must eat to survive. While I am sure she's appreciated the freedom your income has given her to pursue her dreams, your job loss has impacted her financial security as much as it has yours. And your feeling that it all needs to fall on you because you're the man in the relationship may reflect more about your gendered preoccupations than her expectations of you — and you'll never know if you don't have a conversation with her.\n\nOn the topic of gender, something I noticed was missing from your letter was a recognition of how else your wife spends her time and energy, outside chasing her \"impractical dream.\" Keeping the house clean, making meals, providing childcare if you have kids — these are all forms of labor that cost money if you outsource, and if you don't, it's money in your pocket. Statistically, women do the majority of both mental and physical work involved in these jobs. If your wife is doing this work, it's unfair to frame the way she spends her time and energy as \"impractical\" and self-focused, and it's important to acknowledge her contributions as valuable.\n\nSpeaking of self-focused, this seems to be your third assumption. She could have any number of reasons for remaining focused on her dream job, even as the wheels are spinning off the cart. Maybe she's spent so long chasing this dream that it's all she feels qualified to do. Maybe she understands your financial situation differently than you, and she doesn't think either of you needs to get a new job urgently. Or maybe this is her attempt to frantically try to find new income streams, but she doesn't feel comfortable telling you she's doing so, because she recognizes your contempt toward her career goals — as you said, \"a career we both know she'll never have.\" Trying anything is a vulnerable act because to try is to face potential failure. If your wife no longer feels safe failing in front of you, she won't try things in front of you — not even things like searching for a job.\n\nThere's a chance that these assumptions of yours aren't 100% wrong, but until you have a good-faith conversation with your wife and hear her perspective, you're operating off a false premise that isn't fair to the woman you love. Put aside your assumptions and be curious about her thought process, open-minded about what she has to say, and vulnerable about your feelings.\n\nOn the topic of gender roles, as a man, you may feel uncomfortable admitting to needing help providing. This is where you have to trust your wife to be the partner you need her to be. Show her the numbers that are worrying you, and collaborate with her on a solution.\n\nI encourage you not to approach the conversation with an adversarial attitude. This doesn't have to be a fight, because it's unlikely that you disagree. Your wife is an adult who understands financial realities — likely more than you think she does. Don't go into your conversation believing you must convince her that having little to no income is a problem. Instead, see your conversation as the meeting of a crisis committee — two people on the same team facing the same threat, who will win or lose together.\n\nBecause the thing is, Lonely Provider, you aren't alone. You just need to reach out your hand and bring your wife on the journey with you, instead of assuming she doesn't want to come along.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was originally published in October 2023.\n\nLooking for advice on how your savings, debt, or another financial challenge is affecting your relationships?

However, VAR operations for this match will be managed by experienced referees from outside Northern Ireland using the Hawk-Eye system, as used in Fifa and Uefa competitions, ensuring technical proficiency during this introductory phase.\"\n\nThe statement explained that the cup final would \"provide an ideal controlled environment to evaluate operational procedures, communication protocols, and overall integration of VAR into the domestic matchday framework\".\n\nThe experience gained is set to inform any future decisions the governing body will make regarding potential broader implementation of VAR across NIFL competitions.\n\nNIFL chief executive Gerard Lawlor acknowledged that the decision would not attract support from all quarters but highlighted the benefits of using the technology.\n\n\"The introduction of VAR for this game represents an important step forward for our league, strengthening decision-making and supporting our match officials,\" he said.\n\n\"We recognise, however, that this will not be a universally popular decision and that the implementation of any new technology brings scrutiny and adjustment.\n\n\"This game represents a valuable opportunity for us to assess and become familiar with the technology in a controlled environment, while providing practical benefits to both the Referee Team and our clubs, particularly those participating in European competitions where its use may be required.\"\n\nIrish FA Head of Refereeing Andrew Davey added: \"The use of VAR in the BetMcLean Cup Final is an exciting step forward for both the league and refereeing in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"The introduction of this technology for such a significant fixture underlines our ongoing efforts to support referees with the highest standards of officiating tools available.\"",

    "description": "The billionaire's move to slash nearly half of Block's workforce in one fell swoop signals a departure from Big Tech's pattern of repeated cuts.",
    "fullText": "CEO Jack Dorsey is departing from the classic tech layoff playbook — and it could be a sign of what's to come.\n\nIn a post on X on Thursday, the billionaire said he's slashing nearly half of Block's workforce, cutting its over 10,000-person staff to just under 6,000. He said that he is doing this despite the business being strong and profits growing.\n\nIn the tech industry's hardcore era, many companies have pared down teams through repeated rounds of layoffs. Dorsey's massive chop stands alone. \n\nIn his memo, the cofounder and CEO said repeated rounds of layoffs are \"destructive to morale,\" focus, and to the trust of customers and shareholders. He said he'd rather do the cuts in one fell swoop.\n\n\"I'd rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome,\" Dorsey wrote in the post.\n\nThe company appears to have conducted repeated rounds of cuts in recent months, Wired reported.\n\nBecause repeated cuts create \"layoff fatigue and chronic anxiety,\" as well as drops in morale and productivity, it's better to make a single reduction rather than piecemeal ones, Brooks Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown University, told Business Insider.\n\nNevertheless, the size of the cut is notable, he said.\n\n\"This is a pretty extreme example in terms of the amount of people that are being let go all at once, but the packages are relatively generous,\" Holtom said.\n\nDorsey wrote that laid-off employees would receive 20 weeks of base pay, plus an additional week for each year of tenure. Their equity will continue vesting through the end of May, and they'll receive six months of health coverage. The company is also allowing them to keep their corporate devices and will provide a $5,000 payment.\n\nThe move to lay off over 40% of the company's workforce signals a departure from the typical pattern followed by other Big Tech companies. It also raises the question of whether other firms will follow a similar trend, and some industry leaders have already commented on the move.\n\n\"Feels inevitable this is about to ripple through every public company. We've gotta find a way to make everyone an owner w/ some exposure to the upside as the # of employees falls off a cliff,\" Jessica Verrilli, managing director and cofounder at Adverb Ventures said in a post on X.\n\nDorsey said that he's adapting to an era in which technology is dramatically changing the workplace.\n\n\"We're already seeing that the intelligence tools we're creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company,\" Dorsey said in his memo on X.\n\nIn the company's earnings call on Thursday, he said that more companies will follow suit in using AI to drive efficiency gains. Block is already ahead of the trend that \"all companies will eventually\" adopt, Dorsey said.\n\nMichael Blank, an assistant professor of finance at Stanford Business School, told Business Insider that there could be a race among CEOs to convince investors that their companies are better positioned than their rivals to adopt abruptly changing AI technologies. Mass layoffs would be a potentially inexpensive way to signal that, he said.\n\nShares of Block were up over 20% in after-hours trading.\n\nBlock's layoffs come in the wake of a viral report from research firm Citrini on February 22, that raised fears about the impact of AI and sent stocks tumbling. Citrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, laid out a predictive scenario in which AI continues to grow but proves detrimental to the broader economy.\n\nA number of tech leaders have also been warning of a fundamental erosion of white-collar work.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei has sounded the alarm about a looming white-collar \"bloodbath,\" while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said AI is reshaping what individual employees can achieve.\n\nMeanwhile, companies like Klarna have been more explicit about replacing human workers. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said its workforce has halved over the last four years and will shrink further in the coming years. The company had 7,000 employees in 2022 and he said he expects the company's workforce to drop below 2,000 by 2030.\n\nNot everyone is convinced the end times are here for desk workers. While the World Economic Forum's 2026 Global Risk report predicts that 92 million workers will be displaced by 2030, it also said 170 million roles will be created in that time frame, resulting in a net increase.",

Or you might not make the cut, as an employee or as a company.\"\n\n\"Block is the canary in the coal mine,\" Aakash Gupta, host of \"The Growth Podcast,\" said on X. \"And they're not alone.\"\n\nGupta said Dorsey \"said the quiet part out loud: intelligence tools paired with smaller teams have already changed what it means to run a company.\"\n\n\"Block went from 10,000 to 6,000 while growing revenue and raising guidance. Every CEO running a company with more than a few thousand employees is doing this math tonight,\" he added. \"The canary just stopped singing.\"\n\nBen Carlson, a financial analyst and director at Ritholtz Wealth Management, expressed skepticism that the cuts were purely driven by AI innovation, sharing a chart that shows Block's share price is down sharply from its high point in 2021.\n\n\"Maybe Block laying off a ton of employees is a sign that AI is gonna destroy everything,\" he wrote on X. \"Or maybe the stock is down 80% from the highs and they overhired and AI is a convenient excuse.\"\n\nJason Calacanis, angel investor and co-host of the \"All-In\" podcast, praised Dorsey for the cuts.\n\n\"Leadership is hard, but this feels like (another) visionary move,\" he said on X. \"Have never sold a share, since being a private investor in square.\"\n\n\"Feels inevitable this is about to ripple through every public company,\" Jessica Verrilli, cofounder of VC firm Adverb Ventures, said on X. \"We've gotta find a way to make everyone an owner w/ some exposure to the upside as the # of employees falls off a cliff.\"\n\n\"Respect to @jack for doing the hard thing,\" Shaun Maguire, partner at Sequoia Capital, wrote on X. \"While doing it intentionally and owning the decision.\"\n\n\"Square is just the beginning,\" Clara Shih, a startup investor and senior advisor at Meta, said in an X post. \"Every CEO faces the same decision today that manufacturing CEOs did in 2000: do a big layoff or your competitor will, pass on cost savings to customers and investors, and beat you.\"\n\n\"In 2000, jobs were lost to Shenzhen. In 2026, jobs will be lost to AI,\" she added.\n\nMatt Shumer, an AI CEO who wrote the viral \"Something Big is Happening\" essay earlier this month, said this is \"one of the first major examples of AI driving layoffs, but certainly not the last.\"\n\n\"If you're saying 'this won't happen to me', re-evaluate your thoughts. Now,\" he said on X. \"It may be the most important thing you do.\"",

    "fullText": "Jeff Walz once joked that his Louisville women’s basketball team enjoys silencing crowds more than energizing them.\n\nThe 11th-ranked Cardinals (25-5, 15-2 ACC) have quieted plenty of crowds this season, doling out home loss after loss to each opponent. For the first time in program history, Louisville has gone undefeated in true road games after beating Georgia Tech, 69-50, on Thursday night in Atlanta.\n\nAfter facing two top-25 teams at home and another at a neutral site, the Cardinals recorded their first ranked win of the season at North Carolina, ranked 11th at the time, on Dec. 14. Getting road wins at N.C. State, Syracuse and Notre Dame were also critical to the Cardinals securing the No. 2 seed in the ACC Tournament and garnering the 9-0 road mark. Taj Roberts was ruled a gametime decision after suffering a Grade 2 ankle sprain against Virginia on Sunday but remained in the starting lineup. She played 37 minutes and finished with 12 points, four rebounds and two assists against the Yellow Jackets (12-17, 7-10).\n\nThe Cardinals had a 20-point scorer in six of the nine road games. Forward Elif Istanbulluoglu was two points shy of her second 20-point road performance of the season with a team-leading 18 points while shooting 50% from the field after scoring 23 points against Miami on Jan. 8.\n\nForward Laura Ziegler had 22 point-performances at Syracuse and Stanford. But she got in foul trouble against the Yellow Jackets and finished with four points, three assists and two rebounds.\n\nThe Cardinals upped its defensive intensity and forced Georgia Tech into 15 first-half turnovers and scored 20 points off the Yellow Jackets’ mistakes. In less than a minute midway through the second quarter, GT turned the ball over four times, giving way to the Cardinals’ 28-18 lead via a 6-0 run.\n\nThe Cardinals finished with 27 points off 22 Georgia Tech turnovers.\n\nLouisville returns home for the regular-season finale to play Notre Dame at 4 p.m. Sunday. UofL has a chance to sweet the Fighting Irish in the regular-season series for the first time since the 2021-22 season.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Louisville women's basketball score, UofL WBB wins at Georgia Tech",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance just reported fourth-quarter earnings as it tries to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. Read CEO David Ellison's latest memo to employees.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison gave employees a shoutout after the media company roughly met Wall Street's estimates in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"The progress we've made over the past 6+ months — from advancing our strategy to strengthening our portfolio and reorganizing our businesses to operate more efficiently and effectively — is a direct reflection of your hard work and commitment,\" Ellison wrote in an email to staffers, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nEllison, who wants to turn his 114-year-old Hollywood studio into a tech-forward company, said in his memo that Paramount is focused on supercharging its tech and data capabilities.\n\n\"We recognize that in today's highly competitive marketplace, sustainable growth depends not only on what people watch, but on the quality of the overall user experience,\" Ellison wrote. \"That's why we are prioritizing investments in advanced technology and data capabilities to strengthen and differentiate our DTC offering. We are making meaningful investments across the company in innovation and technology, and we look forward to sharing more details in the coming months.\"\n\nThat message comes weeks after Ellison made data a bigger part of Paramount by expanding the role of the company's streaming data and insights team.\n\nParamount is planning to add short-form video to Paramount+ and is exploring ways to bring interactive features and user-generated content to its streamers, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nIn the memo, Ellison also emphasized storytelling, saying that he wants Paramount to be \"the home for the industry's leading creative talent.\" While Ellison lured former Netflix original content executive Cindy Holland to run its streaming business, Paramount is losing star TV creator Taylor Sheridan to rival NBCUniversal when his contract expires.\n\nParamount's biggest initiative is its quest to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, which seems increasingly open to Ellison's advances, even though it has a signed deal with Netflix.\n\nParamount's results were roughly in line with analyst expectations in its latest quarter, the first full quarter since Ellison took the helm in early August. As expected, Paramount's full-year revenue shrank for a second straight year to $28.89 billion, just under the estimate of $28.95 billion.\n\nParamount+ now has 78.9 million paid subscribers, up from 77.9 million last quarter and 4% higher than a year ago. Paramount's product chief told employees that its flagship streamer added about 1 million customers on the first day it carried UFC rights in the US, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRead Ellison's memo to Paramount employees here:",

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a message on the possibility of orbital data centers: Watch this space.\n\n\"The economics are poor today, but it's going to improve over time,\" Huang said during Nvidia's fourth quarter earnings call.\n\nHuang's tempered optimism is a stark contrast to the views of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has dismissed his onetime ally, Elon Musk, for his zealous pursuit of putting data centers in space.\n\n\"I honestly think the idea with the current landscape of putting data centers in space is ridiculous,\" Altman recently said.\n\nHuang pointed out some of the virtues of building the massive data centers needed to power AI in space, including the surplus of well, space.\n\n\"As you know, the way that space works is radically different than how it works down here,\" he said. \"There's an abundance of energy. But solar panels are large, but there's plenty of space in space.\"\n\nData centers are increasingly becoming a political football back on earth, fueling some of the push to look toward space.\n\nAI and tech companies are facing pressure to reduce the vast number of resources they draw on to power and cool data centers, or to simply build the supplies themselves. Companies have already begun exploring ways to build their own power sources, though many will rely on fossil fuels despite their clean energy commitments.\n\nTech leaders have also bristled at the sometimes lengthy approval process needed for their power plans. For example, licensing a nuclear reactor can take years, though Trump has pushed to shorten that timeline. In the meantime, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are all pursuing deals to secure nuclear power.\n\nMusk's xAI is already finding ways to build on-site power with the use of unpermitted mobile generators to get the company's massive data centers up and running in Tennessee and Mississippi.\n\nAltman previously said he's bearish on orbital data centers \"this decade\" because of the high launch costs and the difficulty of repairing chips in space.\n\n\"We are not there yet,\" he said. \"There will come a time. Space is great for a lot of things. Orbital data centers are not something that's going to matter at scale this decade.\"\n\nMusk isn't alone in pursuing the idea. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Fox News that the search giant could start putting data centers in space as soon as next year.\n\nMusk's push for data centers coincided with SpaceX's acquisition of xAI, which came as xAI needed cash to continue its data center buildout. (SpaceX is already hiring to make Musk's vision a reality.)\n\n\"My prediction is that it will be by far the cheapest place to put AI,\" Musk said during a recent podcast appearance. \"It will be space in 36 months or less. Maybe 30 months.\"",

    "fullText": "At a time when many workers are worried about AI-related job losses, Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison says the technology is helping his employees work better.\n\n\"We're very focused on employing AI to help our associates sell, to improve the shopping environment for our customers, both in-store and online, and creating productivity in the workspace,\" he said during the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nThe home improvement retailer has been leaning hard into a partnership with OpenAI that powers its Mylow digital assistant for employees and customers. Ellison said the technology is getting better with every interaction.\n\n\"It helps our associates do the most difficult part of transition to a home improvement world, and that is product knowledge,\" Ellison said.\n\nHe said that new hires sometimes lack the confidence to be out on the sales floor selling specialized products to the chain's combination of DIY and professional customers, and the Mylow assistant fills that knowledge gap.\n\n\"Not only does this platform and this assistant allow that to happen, it also now can do it in Spanish,\" Ellison said.\n\nHe said that's led to \"dramatic improvements\" in customer service, including helping \"break the language gap\" in some geographic areas and a two percentage-point lift in in-store satisfaction scores.\n\nOnline, Ellison said Lowe's is seeing conversion rates double when customers use Mylow's AI shopping assistant, which rolled out in March 2025.\n\nOther retailers, most notably Walmart and Amazon, have reported e-commerce bumps they attribute to AI shopping assistants: Walmart said last week its Sparky chatbot results in 35% larger basket sizes online, and Amazon has said it anticipates its Rufus bot to boost sales by $10 billion a year.\n\nBetter sales and customer service are critical at a time when the home improvement retail segment is now in its third year of challenging macroeconomic conditions marked by high borrowing costs and low housing turnover.\n\nStill, Lowe's managed to outperform rival Home Depot in comparable sales growth for the fourth quarter.\n\nLowe's corporate employees are using AI tools in other ways, Ellison said. The tools are freeing up merchandising teams to shift their focus from routine tasks to more strategic problems, and tech workers are using AI to develop and review code, achieving double-digit gains in productivity.\n\n\"We're excited about some of the work we're doing in agentic commerce with some of the leading tech platforms out there as well,\" he said. \"It's something as a large company that we understand is critically important to our current state and our future, and we're embracing it.\"",

    "fullText": "Jack Clark, Anthropic's head of policy, says he spends his days thinking about AI guardrails.\n\nAt home, he says he's building guardrails, too — for his own kids.\n\nDuring an interview with \"The Ezra Klein Show,\" Clark said he limits how much technology his toddler uses and is uneasy about algorithmic exposure for his children.\n\n\"I have the classic Californian technology executive view of not having that much technology around for children,\" Clark, who recently returned from parental leave and has a newborn at home, said. \"I think finding a way to budget your child's time with technology has always been the work of parents and will continue to be.\"\n\nHe said technology is becoming more \"ubiquitous,\" making it \"hard to escape\" for parents.\n\nAt home, Clark said his toddler can watch \"Bluey\" and a few other shows on their smart TV, but he hasn't allowed \"unfettered access to the YouTube algorithm.\"\n\nClark's approach echoes other tech leaders who limit their kids' screen time.\n\nIn 2025, Miranda Kerr said she and her husband, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, didn't allow her then-14-year-old son to have phones or computers in his bedroom after 9:30 pm. In 2024, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel said he limits his children's screen time to 90 minutes a week. Apple's cofounder Steve Jobs famously told the New York Times in 2010 that his kids hadn't used an iPad.\n\n\"We limit how much technology our kids use at home,\" Jobs said.\n\nClark says his parenting model is partially based on how he grew up. His father, who had a computer at his office, would let Clark use the machine — but would step in when screen time got excessive.\n\n\"My dad would let me play on the computer, and at some point he'd say: Jack, you've had enough computers today. You're getting weird,\" he said.\n\nAI systems will need stronger parental controls, Clark said. Those guardrails, he said, will take on increased importance in the AI race — especially as children try to access systems intended for adults.\n\n\"So we're going to need to build pretty heavy parental controls into this system,\" he said. \"We serve ages 18 and up today, but obviously, kids are smart, and they're going to try to get onto this stuff.\"\n\nClark and Anthropic didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. When reached for comment, a YouTube spokesperson pointed Business Insider to a guide on the platform's website about age-appropriate experiences and parental controls.",

    "fullText": "Some say the technology is devaluing their work, while others reckon it is not yet – and might never be – good enough to replace them entirely\n\nWorkers grappling with the rapid growth of artificial intelligence have said they feel “devalued” by the technology and warned of a downward trajectory in the quality of work.\n\nRecent analysis by the International Monetary Fund found AI would affect about 40% of jobs around the world. Its head, Kristalina Georgieva, has said: “This is like a tsunami hitting the labour market.”\n\nWorkers who have trained AI models to replace some or all of their roles tell the Guardian about their experiences.\n\n‘I now earn less while working longer correcting the mistakes of AI editors’\n\nChristie* edits papers for academics for whom English is a second language. She was asked to take part in a project to train new “assistant editors”, unaware that it was an AI programme that would lead to her being paid less.\n\n“There was a huge shortage of qualified editors, so I assumed they were training up more [people] to take some of the load,” says Christie, 55, who lives in the UK. “Then they got me to correct the mistakes of these assistant editors. But the new editors were making strange mistakes, like inserting unnecessary full stops or changing the names of countries to nonsense.”\n\nChristie says she “meticulously and respectfully pointed out these errors”.\n\nHowever, the errors kept happening and “sometimes they got worse”. Then, a few months later, she found out who “the editors” were.\n\n“In a newsletter, the company admitted that these assistant editors were actually an AI,” says Christie. “Going forward, all jobs would be pre-edited by it, and our fee would be reduced, so I now earn less money for correcting the mistakes of an AI, which takes me longer than editing from scratch.\n\n“There is this groupthink in the company that they must implement AI.”\n\nChristie says she feels “devalued, betrayed, and furious at this company”.\n\n“I prioritise work from any other sources, but I am trapped in this toxic cycle, as they have the highest volume of work, and I still need to eat and pay rent. But a lot of people have quit,” she adds.\n\n‘AI struggled with patients’ pronunciation’\n\nMark Taubert, a palliative care consultant and professor, said he was excited to work on a pilot chatbot project to explore how technology could help patients navigate the complexities of metastatic cancer and palliative care.\n\nTaubert, 51, who works at Velindre University NHS trust in Cardiff, was recorded over “several hours” for the chatbot and fed the computer with guidelines that would typically inform how he talks to patients.\n\n“We asked patients to write down all their questions, and added patient information leaflets that we had previously written and agreed on,” he says. “We also considered questions I might get from my palliative care community of outpatients and inpatients, such as, ‘Can I drink alcohol when I am taking morphine?’”\n\nThe chatbot was mostly aimed at home patients who might have a question, for example about their medication, out of hours.\n\nTaubert says the chatbot got about “50% spot on, in a way similar to how I might have responded”, but it struggled with the vagaries of human pronunciation and human error.\n\n“Patients don’t always use perfect English and sometimes use incorrect names for medications, for instance, they may say ‘morphium’, instead of morphine,” he says. “People also structured their questions quite differently. We saw a need for the technology to learn about human misspellings, dialects, jargon, variations and accents.\n\n“Subsequent adaptations made the system safer, but we also had to consider how the machine would respond if a patient typed in a more troubling question, for instance, how to end their own life.”\n\nThe chatbot, called Rita, was used for a time “with a lot of caveats and warnings around it” before funding ended, says Taubert.\n\n“We would say: ‘Give this a try if you want to,’ but we also put in links to the hospital information leaflets on each area,” he adds.\n\nWhile Taubert is open to “embracing new technologies”, he does not feel his role is threatened by AI.\n\n“A lot of what we do relies on nuances of language, body language and facial expression and being in the room,” he says. “In the coming months or years, perhaps my working week can be enhanced by such systems by taking away the very administrative duties and letting me actually speak to the patient more.”\n\n‘The overall effect is a decline in quality’\n\nPhilip*, 45, was required to train AI-based translation engines that his supervisors “want to replace us with because they’ll cost less”, but says that even after four years they are still unreliable.\n\n“At first, the results were inevitably laughable,” he says. “But they have improved as we have corrected the programs. However, even after years of this, besides tending to produce formulaic results, they are still unreliable and inadequately accurate, so we still need to review each AI-generated translation word by word and correct as necessary.”\n\nPhilip, who lives in New Jersey, says in his experience, “it doesn’t save time over directly translating the material myself. I think the overall effect is a decline in quality.“If you need a translation that is just a rough idea of what is being said, then generally AI is OK. But it is not always reliable, and that’s the problem, because part of the time you will still run into things that are just completely wrong.”\n\nHe says the moment when he will no longer be needed in his current role “has been looming over our heads for years now, but we’re not there yet”.\n\n‘Training your robot replacement feels like digging your own digital grave’\n\nJoe*, 50, an award-winning marketing writer and content manager, says the company where he worked began exploring AI as a productivity tool at the start of 2024, but he was assured his job was safe.\n\n“I should have seen the writing on the wall when they had me spend the first six months of 2025 building our extensive ‘AI process workflows’ and ‘best practices documentation’. In my naivety, I thought that I would be administering this system and would be asked to oversee these processes.”\n\nHowever, in August 2025, two weeks after he handed in his best practices documentation, Joe was laid off.\n\n“At my exit interview, I was told it had absolutely nothing to do with my work or performance; they blamed ‘market conditions’, and some of that was no doubt true, but the timing of it was certainly suspicious,” says Joe, who lives in Milwaukee. “Working for this company and being asked to do this – training your robot replacement – feels like digging your own digital grave.”\n\nJoe has been told that much of his former workload has been delegated to junior employees.\n\n“They are following my AI documentation to just enter prompts into AI clients in order to produce the work I used to do,” he says.\n\nJoe is now considering a career pivot into sales, but says it has not been easy.\n\n“I wouldn’t necessarily say that AI 100% forced me out of my career path, but at 50 and with the threat of AI looming constantly, I am thinking to myself, I could line up another writing job, but then am I looking at another layoff at 55?”\n\n‘Work will look completely different in 10 years’ time, perhaps even less’\n\nFilippo, 44, an associate professor in mathematics, has been collaborating with two startups on AI projects.\n\nThey are developing models to reason about mathematics and prove theorems with very little human input, and to verify the input using the proof assistant software Lean.\n\n“It’s been three months, and while the results are still somewhat limited, it is clear that these tools are getting stronger and more efficient by the day,” says Filippo, who lives and works in France. “With most of my colleagues experimenting with this AI technology, we are convinced that a mathematician’s work will look completely different in 10 years’ time, or perhaps even less.\n\n“AI will be able to replace us in mundane tasks that occupy a large amount of our time, like proving small ancillary results needed for our larger goals. Whether mathematicians will still be needed to prove these larger ones is debatable.”\n\nFilippo, who works for a university, says he does not feel his role will become obsolete in the immediate future.\n\n“Given that I work for a public institution, that I spend a significant amount of my time teaching and that these AI tools aren’t yet at a professional research level, I do not feel any pressure or concern for my job,” he says. “But I would have a completely different view if I were 25 and had just completed my PhD.”",

    "fullText": "Chipmaker’s quarterly earnings surpassed Wall Street’s expectations every quarter for multiple years now\n\nNvidia released its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, with the chipmaker revealing higher than expected revenues and extending its yearslong streak of surpassing Wall Street’s sky-high expectations.\n\nThe company receives the vast majority of its revenue from its data center business, which has been buoyed by the tech industry’s immense investment into AI infrastructure. On Wednesday, Nvidia reported 75% year-over-year growth of this vertical to $62.3bn. The world’s most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia has dominated the chip market as its processing units have become the backbone of the artificial intelligence boom. The company also posted an enormous total profit for the fiscal year: $120bn.\n\n“Our customers are racing to invest in AI compute – the factories powering the AI industrial revolution and their future growth,” CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement accompanying the earnings report.\n\nInvestors have been more skeptical in recent months regarding the massive amount of spending that big tech companies have poured into advancing their AI products, with share prices for most of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech firms starting the year off in decline. Nvidia’s growth, meanwhile, has acted as a reassurance to the market, with a stock rally on Wednesday ahead of the company’s earnings report. Throughout the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years, Nvidia beat Wall Street’s expectations every quarter.\n\nThe chipmaker reported earnings of $1.62 per share, beating the $1.53 per share that Wall Street analysts estimated. Its overall revenue for the quarter was $68.13bn, more than analysts’ prediction of $66.2bn in revenue.\n\nShares in the company rose by around 3% in after-hours trading immediately following the earnings report, although those gains dropped to less than 1% as the day went on.\n\nDespite Nvidia’s huge profits, there has been increased scrutiny of the company’s various multibillion dollar deals with AI firms like OpenAI. The circular nature of these deals, where Nvidia invests in a company only for that company to turn around and purchase chips from Nvidia, has led some analysts to worry that the AI industry is on riskier footing than its backers would admit.\n\nOne of Nvidia’s marquee deals, a proposed $100bn investment into OpenAI, also fell through earlier this month. Instead, Nvidia will reportedly invest $30bn into OpenAI as the ChatGPT creator seeks to go public later this year at a valuation of around $730bn.\n\n“We continue to work with OpenAI towards a partnership agreement, and believe we are close,” Huang said on Wednesday’s earnings call.\n\nHuang has repeatedly downplayed concerns around how AI will disrupt or replace workers across numerous industries. Last month, Huang spoke out against fears of AI replacing software technologies during a global rush to sell off software stocks. At the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year, he also framed AI as a job creator that would unlock productivity gains and become a core part of international infrastructure.\n\n“In this new world of AI, compute equals revenues,” Huang said on the call.\n\nAfter years of markets swooning over advances in generative AI, however, some investors have grown more skittish and wary of volatility or potential negative effects that AI may have on the economy. This week, a piece of speculative fiction from a research firm caused a market downturn and panic on Wall Street after it outlined an imagined future where AI had caused surging unemployment.",

    "fullText": "Feb 25 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia posted better-than-expected results for the January quarter on Wednesday and forecast current-quarter revenue above market estimates, betting on Big Tech's unabated spending on its artificial-intelligence processors.\n\nBut its stock traded flat after hours, as investors, used to solid revenue beats from the ‌company for 14 straight quarters, were likely disappointed by the uneventful results that were released 10 minutes after the expected time.\n\nOn the post-earnings conference call, UBS ‌analyst Tim Arcuri asked executives whether Nvidia was looking to give back to shareholders some of the $100 billion cash it was likely to generate this year, because \"no matter how good the results have been, the stock hasn't really ​gone up much.\" In response, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the company wanted to keep investing in the AI ecosystem.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang said the output generated by AI models would be the foundation of future computing and Nvidia would keep building more infrastructure to support that. \"This new way of doing computing is not going to go back,\" he said.\n\nSeeking to alleviate concerns that a supply crunch at its chip contract maker TSMC was getting in the way of its growth, Nvidia said it had secured enough chip inventory and capacity to meet demand beyond ‌the next several quarters. The shortage, though, will affect its gaming ⁠business, the company said.\n\nThe world's most valuable company expects fiscal first-quarter sales of $78 billion, plus or minus 2%, compared with analysts' average estimate of $72.60 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\n\"This was a good beat and raise, the usual for Nvidia, but based on the reactions preliminarily, it ⁠seems a lot was baked in to the cake so far,\" said Ken Mahoney, CEO at Mahoney Asset Management, which holds shares of Nvidia.\n\nThe fourth-quarter results are good news for AI investors, who are looking to Nvidia's performance to gauge whether the hundreds of billions of dollars that Big Tech is pouring into data center infrastructure are paying off. Hyperscalers including Meta Platforms - a big Nvidia ​customer - ​have forecast total capital expenditure of at least $630 billion in 2026, with most of the spending earmarked ​for data centers and processors.\n\n\"It’s clear from Nvidia’s latest numbers and their ‌forecast that concerns about an AI slowdown simply are not showing up yet,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.",

    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Texas Tech had the best college defensive line money could buy last season.\n\nEnds David Bailey and Romello Height each had double-digit sacks totals and were ranked among the top 15 in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Tackles Lee Hunter and Skyler Gill-Howard each relished their opportunities to take on blockers and let teammates fill in the gaps.\n\nThe immediate payoff came with the Red Raiders celebrating their first outright league title since 1955, their first Big 12 crown and their first College Football Playoff appearance.\n\nFour of the five transfers who helped transform Texas Tech into a national power received a different reward — appearing at the NFL's annual scouting combine in Indianapolis.\n\n“All five of those guys we had come in, they’re really good football players, tremendous football players, and pretty much they’re all here getting ready for the combine,” former teammate Jacob Rodriguez said Wednesday.\n\n\"Shoot, they’re even better human beings. The people that they care about, the way they came in the program and made a difference in the program was really special.”\n\nPlaying behind the speedy pass rushers and big, beefy interior linemen, the linebacker had the best season of his college career — 128 tackles, seven forced fumbles, four interceptions and two fumble recoveries. His draft prospects soared and Rodriguez finished fifth in Heisman Trophy balloting.\n\nStill, it was a costly proposition for Texas Tech, which paid an estimated $7 million to get the five game-changing linemen. Nearly half of that total reportedly went to Bailey, who some dubbed the highest-paid defensive player in college football's NIL era.\n\nBailey, of course, insists he was worth every penny and few at Texas Tech would quibble with him given the results.\n\n“They should have paid the inside linebackers a little bit more,” he said. “They were the leaders of the defense, everything ran through them.\"\n\nFor combine observers, this is life in a new world — one where more than 300 invitees no longer arrive dreaming of big paydays and joking about how some players might pocket less cash after turning pro.\n\n“I never had to deal with that,” 53-year-old New York Jets coach Aaron Glenn said, discussing the absence of NIL deals during his college days in the early 1990s. “I do know it's a real thing and a lot of these players are taking pay cuts (to play in the NFL). But I will say this is what they deserve, probably, because of the amount of money they bring to the college.”\n\nWednesday's interview room could have doubled as an entrepreneurs roundtable.\n\nAt one point, defensive tackle Cam Ball explained why he spent all five seasons at Arkansas and how he's attempting to honor his late father's passion for barbecuing. Ball grew up moving grills for his father's Atlanta-based catering company and once his NIL deals kicked in, he continued to help his father though no longer needed need the paycheck.\n\nToday, eight months after his father, Charles, died, Ball and his girlfriend are still cooking. Ball continues to perfect his secret, vinegar-based sauce with seasonings and trimmings his father taught him, while his girlfriend takes care of things such as baked beans and macaroni and cheese.\n\n“Every now and then I would help with the grills on his truck, I started to become more curious about it,” Ball said, with a large silver chain and a large photo of his father dangling near his heart. “When I got to college, I started experimenting on my own how to do things, how to cook, how to season meats because he taught me how to do all those things. We had NIL in my second or third year, so I didn't really need the money, I just wanted to get the experience.”\n\nFormer Bearcats defensive tackle Dontay Corleone, naturally, has an NIL deal with a Cincinnati restaurant that features “The Godfather” burger.\n\nAnd Hunter explained how he'd used his NIL money to buy his mother a house and a car, to care for his 5-year-old daughter, Kaylee, and to help his brother start a trucking business by purchasing two 18-wheelers.\n\n“It feels amazing,” Hunter said. “There's still more, now I'm working to get (my brother) a bigger truck. That's my goal, to provide for my family and the people I love.”\n\nTexas Tech gave Hunter that opportunity last season and he and the school both cashed in. Now the question is will that continue in the NFL?\n\nWhile Bailey could be a top-five selection and Hunter and Rodriguez are both ranked in the top 10 at their respective positions, the futures of Height and Gill-Howard are more uncertain. But at Texas Tech, there's no doubt about their overall value.\n\n“I think we had the best defensive front in the country this year. It was a lot of fun to play behind those guys and play with them,” Rodriguez said. “They should have paid them more, I guess. They were as advertised and better.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "Tim Desoto built a shopping startup using AI, despite no tech background. He shares where AI helped him — and where human perspective still matters.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tim Desoto, a 49-year-old founder and CEO, based in San Francisco. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been working on my startup, an AI-powered shopping platform, since late 2024. With all the advancements in the tech industry, people might think of AI as a hammer, treating everything else as a nail, and in my experience, that just doesn't work.\n\nI don't have a tech background, and since starting my business, I've learned a lot about where to leverage AI, and where not to. I'm always trying to be flexible about when to switch from AI to human intervention, and vice versa.\n\nOver time, it's become clearer to me where and where not to use AI for my business.\n\nI'm fortunate to live in San Francisco. I go to meetups to hear what people are using, and I've attended some developer conferences. My ears always perk up when I hear that a new tool or version of something is working for somebody else in my network.\n\nRight now, there's a strong focus on agentic workflows. OpenClaw generated buzz as an open-source autonomous agent project, and Moltbook amplified that attention by making agent-to-agent interaction visible in a social environment. Claude Cowork is also gaining traction, particularly among teams looking for enterprise-ready agent workflows with clearer guardrails.\n\nBeyond the agents themselves, the focus is moving from \"what can agents do?\" to \"how do we run them reliably and securely at scale?\"\n\nWhether I'm looking at X, LinkedIn, or other platforms, there's a lot of really great work being done to share these updates.\n\nMy paid stack includes business plans for models such as Claude Max, Gemini Ultra, and ChatGPT Business, along with AI-powered development and productivity tools such as Cursor, Figma Make, Notion AI, Superhuman Ask AI, and Lovable.\n\nGemini's image models have become incredible. The latest updates to the new model have really improved everything. I noticed faster performance, more stable reasoning, and stronger multimodal capabilities, especially in image generation. I was impressed by how consistent the images remained during modifications. I've even noticed some improvements in the responses it gives about real-time information.\n\nI divvy up which tools I'm using based on where the latest developments are, and use them either as they've been designed or as I think I can use them in my current operational flow. For example, I use Lovable, an AI website builder, to make slide decks.\n\nUsually, I start with a written prompt, then go multimodal, talking out loud to the model. I'll talk back and forth with it about my idea and try to get the agent to push back because I know that some AI models tend to be more agreeable.\n\nOnce I get an output that I'm happy with, I use a different model to get a different view. For long-form analysis and structured insights, I lean toward Claude and Gemini. Gemini's inline source linking is particularly useful for verification and deeper research. For structured reasoning and formal writing, I primarily use ChatGPT and Claude.\n\nSometimes, I'll push a document out to multiple models at the same time and see what comes back simultaneously. For creative exploration and multimodal work, I use both Gemini and ChatGPT to generate early-stage concepts, mockups, and visual inputs. Some models are better than others at certain tasks, but I'm always getting a more well-rounded perspective by feeding content to multiple models.\n\nThe process can take as little as 15 minutes, or higher-impact decisions can span several hours to a couple of days, depending on complexity.\n\nWhen I was vibe coding the alpha version of my product, I would hit spots where 30 or 40% would be wrong. I didn't know what exactly the problem was. I would have multiple screens running the code to figure it out, and I'd continue to use AI against AI until I could get to about 95% confidence.\n\nI contracted a few developers to help move my product forward. Now I have a product developing at a faster, much more robust, and scalable rate.\n\nAs much as I can do with AI, it's amazing what technical people can do with AI tools that a non-technical person can't.\n\nI reached out to a lot of informal mentors and friends in the space who could be helpful early on in my process, but recently I formalized having advisors to bounce things off of. That has been a huge feather in my cap.\n\nThese advisors have their own expertise to draw on, and they know many smart people in this space working on projects that have helped us identify potential blind spots. It's helped me connect with potential partners in ways that I think would be more difficult as a solo founder.\n\nI feel like I have a clearer view now of what I can trust AI for, compared to what I thought at the beginning of my journey. While issues like hallucinations and agreeability can be mitigated, long-term strategic judgment and taste still require human oversight.\n\nAI can generate possibilities, but choosing the right direction remains a human responsibility.\n\nDo you have a story to share about running an AI-powered business?

    "description": "President Donald Trump urged tech giants to create their own power sources for data centers. Big Tech is already shifting to private energy solutions.",
    "fullText": "The AI data center boom has triggered a dramatic spike in electricity costs, and President Donald Trump has a plan to stop it.\n\nTo do this, Trump said at Tuesday's State of the Union address that he issued a mandate for data centers to build their own power plants.\n\nTrump said he'd \"negotiated\" a ratepayer protection pledge with major technology companies and billed it as a unique solution to Big Tech's mounting power demand that would also protect American consumers from higher electricity bills.\n\n\"They can build their own power plants as part of their factory,\" Trump said.\n\nMany data center sites have already started building their own power plants. The vast majority of this buildout will initially run on fossil fuels, despite tech giants' clean energy commitments.\n\nWhen reached for comment on Wednesday morning, a White House spokesperson gave the following statement: \"Major Tech companies will join President Trump at the White House next week to formally sign the Rate Payer Protection Pledge that he announced during his historic State of the Union address. Under this bold initiative, these massive companies will build, bring, or buy their own power supply for new AI data centers, ensuring that Americans' electricity bills will not increase as demand grows. President Trump is committed to ensuring American AI dominance while simultaneously lowering costs for working families.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon confirmed to Business Insider that it will attend the White House next week.\n\n\"The Ratepayer Protection Pledge is an important step. We appreciate the Administration's work to ensure that data centers don't contribute to higher electricity prices for consumers,\" Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Anthropic referred Business Insider to a post on X made last night by Sarah Heck, the company's head of external affairs.\n\n\"American families shouldn't pick up the tab for AI. In support of the @WhiteHouse ratepayer protection pledge, Anthropic has committed to covering 100% of electricity price increases that consumers face from data centers,\" Heck wrote.\n\nMicrosoft, Anthropic, and OpenAI have previously announced commitments to covering the costs of electricity consumption at their data centers, though details on those plans remain scant.\n\nIn the last year, on-site power plants fueled mostly by natural gas have emerged as a key strategy for data center developers looking to stay ahead in the AI race. Meanwhile, US power demand has reached record highs.\n\nUtilities in the US last year asked state regulators to approve $31 billion in rate increases, more than double the amount sought in 2024, according to research from PowerLines, a nonprofit advocate for utility customers. Many of those requests occurred in places experiencing heavy data center development, such as Virginia, Texas, Utah, and North Carolina.\n\nTrump has framed data center developers building their own power plants as part of his broader promise to ensure that Big Tech pays for the infrastructure needed to power AI ambitions. For developers, building an on-site power plant can bypass long wait times for a grid connection.\n\nElon Musk's xAI is the most prominent example of this. Musk has drawn intense scrutiny in Tennessee and Mississippi, where he has deployed unpermitted mobile generators to quickly get his data centers up and running.\n\nMusk brought his first mobile generators to Memphis in 2024. In the US, dozens of data centers — about 30% of all planned data center capacity in the nation — plan to build their own power plants, according to a report issued this month from Cleanview, a data visualization software company that tracks clean energy and data center projects. Nearly all of that planned capacity — 90% — was added in 2025, Cleanview found.\n\nIn a review of permit documents, corporate filings, press releases, and local news stories, Cleanview identified 46 data center projects, many of them already under construction, that plan to draw power \"behind the meter\" by building on-site, private power plants that don't need a grid connection or service from the local utility to run.\n\nThese include Meta's plans to build an on-site natural gas plant for its data center in New Albany, Ohio, as well as Oracle and OpenAI's plans to power their Project Jupiter data center site in New Mexico with two massive natural gas-fired systems.\n\nWhile Big Tech companies often tout their commitments to clean energy, Cleanview's review of behind-the-meter permit documents found that natural gas powered 75% of all equipment listed.\n\nTech companies have said they want to power AI with clean technology, such as small modular nuclear reactors and geothermal energy. Much of it is still years away from being deployed at scale.\n\nCleanview found that more than one-third of the behind-the-meter buildout is happening in Texas, which could soon overtake Virginia as the data center capital of the world.\n\nBusiness Insider has reported on Oracle and OpenAI's plan to power Stargate data centers in Texas with on-site natural gas plants, as well as Fermi America's pitch to build the world's largest combined data center and power plant in the state's Panhandle region.\n\nAfter Texas, the top five states with the most planned behind-the-meter capacity are New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Wyoming. West Virginia, Tennessee, Ohio, Virginia, and North Carolina also have significant behind-the-meter projects.\n\nHave a tip for this reporter?

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Traders in the equity options market are unusually subdued about how much Nvidia's quarterly results might move the stock, even as investors hope the chipmaker's ‌earnings report will shed light on the outlook for the artificial-intelligence trade.\n\nNvidia options imply a move of about ‌5.6% in either direction on Thursday, a day after the company reports results. This is the lowest expected post-results swing ahead of any Nvidia report in at ​least three years, according to data from analytics firm Option Research & Technology Services (ORATS).\n\nWhile that would translate into a swing of roughly $260 billion in market capitalization - more than the individual market value of about 90% of S&P 500 constituents - in percentage terms, it is well below the 7.6% average implied move over the past 12 quarters, according to ORATS data.\n\nThe options-implied move also trails Nvidia shares' average post-earnings ‌move of 7.4% over the past three ⁠years.\n\n\"In a market where single-stock volatility is elevated relative to index volatility, this unusually low event pricing makes Nvidia one of the more interesting catalysts of the week,\" said Chris Murphy, co-head of ⁠derivatives strategy at Susquehanna, a market maker in the NVDA securities.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 has traded in a relatively tight range this year — never more than 2% above or below its prior year-end close — outsized fluctuations in individual stocks have occurred as investors dumped software shares on ​fears ​the artificial-intelligence boom could reshape markets in unexpected ways.\n\nThe muted expectation for ​a post-earnings move in Nvidia shares may have ‌to do with the stock failing to log big swings in recent quarters, analysts said. The stock swung more than 5% in only one of the last five quarters, ORATS data showed.\n\n\"Nvidia simply has not been moving the way it used to on earnings,\" Susquehanna's Murphy said.\n\n\"With 80+ analysts covering the name and every major fund heavily focused on AI capex trends, positioning and estimates are far more refined than they were during the explosive 2023 phase, when earnings reactions of +14% and +24% were common,\" he said.\n\n\"The ‌element of surprise has diminished,\" said Murphy.\n\nThis earnings season, options traders have ​generally made money by betting that stocks will move more than expected after ​companies report results.\n\nEven with Nvidia's weighting of roughly 8% ​in the S&P 500 and its leading role in AI - making its results crucial for the broader ‌market - traders expect only a modest near-term move in ​the stock.",

    "title": "This New Marine Drone Looks Like A Killer Whale, But Is Much Deadlier",
    "description": "New developments in drone technology have led to increased capabilities on land, air, sea — including a new prototype that mimics a marine animal.",
    "fullText": "While most people think of aircraft like the fast-moving MQ-1 Predator when they hear the words \"military drone,\" that's not the only option. These days, drones can fly, as well as swim or travel overland; throughout the 21st century, they've proven their worth in the battlespace. The United States employed them throughout the War on Terror, and both sides of the Russo-Ukraine War have followed suit, though innovations in all areas of drone technology have increased the lethality of these devices in surprising ways.\n\nMarine drones in particular are becoming more important throughout the world, and Ukraine has already demonstrated their value in taking out large, strategic, and tactical targets. In February 2026, Lockheed Martin revealed its latest marine drone, Lamprey, a multi-mission autonomous undersea vehicle (MMAUV) capable of all manner of missions, but it's not the only drone of its kind. The Cardona Marine Group, Inc. (CMG), a defense tech startup, has been developing a similar technology for the past 15 years, and it's now in the functioning prototype sea trial stage.\n\nThe Sea-Predator-7 (SP-7) is an uncrewed surface vehicle (USV) that features a unique design. At a glance, it looks a bit like an Orca, but with the potential to be far deadlier; its payload capacity allows for the use of a variety of lethal armaments delivered stealthily to target enemy ships. Additional components and sensors allow for remote and potentially autonomous operation in the future, while the SP-7's components can be quickly fabricated for rapid production should the Department of War select them in a future defense acquisition contract.\n\nThe Sea-Predator 7 is designed with custom Kevlar, carbon fiber, ceramics, and ballistic fiberglass in its composition. It features a proprietary ballistic riblet coating and structure designed to mimic a shark's skin, combining with its design to enhance stealth and speed while also reducing power consumption during movement. These drones can be deployed in several ways, including dropping them from Navy MH-60R Romeo helicopters or Navy MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, miles from a target ship, either independently or within drone swarms.\n\nThe SP-7 can carry more than 800 lbs. of explosives for one-way attack capabilities alongside two specialized torpedoes. Additional armament options for the SP-7 include two CMG Mk 6 stealth riblet coated drone torpedoes, four CMG Mk 4 high-explosive torpedoes, a Mk 19 automatic 40 mm grenade launcher, twin M240B 7.62 mm machine guns, or six 40 mm smoke grenade launchers. It can be outfitted with four mini aerial drones used for reconnaissance. Additionally, the SP-7 itself can function as a remotely-operated underwater vehicle (ROV) ship mine, slamming into a target's hull and detonating.\n\nThe USV measures 13 feet long with a 5-foot beam, and is 3 feet high. Its weight is 700 lbs. before payloads are added. It moves through the water via a custom electric CMG flume drive for surface and sub-surface operations with electric bow planes and pulse thrusters for maneuvering. When you put it all together, the potential uses for SP-7s are widespread with the potential for changing marine offensive warfare.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "Gucci faced criticism over AI-generated ads ahead of Milan Fashion Week, highlighting the tension between luxury craftsmanship and modern tech use.",
    "fullText": "Gucci's new AI-generated ads have hit a nerve online.\n\nThe renderings — including a glamorous woman in a fur coat striding through a restaurant, a pair of models some commentators likened to \"Grand Theft Auto\" characters, and sleek car scenes — were posted on Gucci's social media pages ahead of creative director Demna Gvasalia's first runway show at Milan Fashion Week on Friday.\n\nThe images quickly drew sharp criticism online, with some users calling them \"cheap\" and \"slop\"— a term used to describe AI-generated content perceived as low-quality or mass-produced.\n\n\"You did not need to use AI for this, so tacky,\" one Instagram user said. Another user wrote: \"Craftsmanship reduced to marketing narrative.\" One user on X said AI makes the brand look cheaper than TJ Maxx.\n\nA post shared by GUCCI (@gucci)\n\nNot all of the images for the \"Primavera\" campaign are AI-generated — it also includes a mix of other photography.\n\nGucci did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBranding experts say that while some consumers perceive the images as \"cheap,\" Gucci's decision to use AI was likely driven by creative intent rather than cost-cutting.\n\nIt's about \"positioning Gucci at the intersection of fashion, art and technology,\" Blanca Zugaza Escribano, a fashion and luxury strategy consultant at Metyis, told Business Insider.\n\nThe use of AI fits into Gucci's history of experimentation and boundary-pushing, she said.\n\n\"It signals creative futurism, reinforces the brand's relevance in a tech-driven world, and allows it to generate surreal, high-impact imagery that traditional production might not easily achieve,\" she added.\n\nPRIMAVERAFebruary 272 p.m. CETCreated with AI pic.twitter.com/sNbcFrpTX9\n\nThis isn't the first time the Italian luxury fashion house has dipped its toes into AI.\n\nEarlier this month, Gucci partnered with Snapchat for an AI interactive lens — a feature that enables Snapchat users to become one of Gucci's \"La Famiglia\" figures. These were fictional digital characters created for one of its collection rollouts.\n\nArmelle Poulou, CFO of Kering — Gucci's parent company — said in its fourth-quarter earnings call that the launch of the \"La Famiglia\" Collection, and its \"surrounding activations,\" are putting \"Gucci back at the center of the attention.\"\n\nThat push for visibility comes at a critical moment for the brand.\n\nGucci had the steepest revenue decline among Kering's portfolio, falling 22% on a reported basis and 19% on a comparable basis in its full-year 2025 earnings.\n\nMatthew Drinkwater, the director of the Fashion Innovation Agency at the London College of Fashion, said luxury has traditionally been rooted in \"craft, heritage and human storytelling.\"\n\n\"If AI is used in a way that feels like it replaces craft, it risks undermining the very thing that creates aspiration,\" he said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Gucci has been accused of diluting the brand image. While its push for maximalism and logos more than doubled its revenue between 2015 and 2022 —under creative director Alessandro Michele — when consumers turned to the \"quiet luxury\" trend, it was unable to keep up.\n\nAlongside mass-market partnerships, the fashion house's customer base had also become younger and more aspirational, many of whom seem to have moved on.\n\nGucci isn't the only brand to face backlash for its use of AI in marketing. In December, fashion house Valentino raised eyebrows after launching an AI-generated campaign for its DeVain handbag.\n\nA post shared by Valentino (@maisonvalentino)\n\n\"Ruining a fashion house legacy is tough work, but I see you guys have determination,\" one user on Instagram said of Valentino's campaign at the time.\n\nFor luxury brands, the challenge of delivering a positive tech experience is even greater, said Elaine Parr, a senior partner and consumer products and retail industries leader EMEA at IBM.\n\nNot only is it a \"tough market\" for luxury right now as a pullback in spending from aspirational shoppers weighs on sales, but \"you need to deliver on the Lux brand promise and be modern whilst retaining your heritage,\" Parr added.\n\nThe Instagram comments section of luxury brands has become \"the most honest focus group in fashion,\" said Drinkwater, the director of the Fashion Innovation Agency at the London College of Fashion.\n\n\"Almost any use of AI in fashion still seems to trigger a level of outrage,\" he added.\n\nDrinkwater said that while AI is more effective when it supports a creative vision rather than replaces it, negative campaign reactions \"are good examples of how quickly the conversation can turn when people feel craft or human input is being displaced.\"",

    "description": "Valerie Valcourt worked in Big Tech for years, making six figures at Google. She left the tech industry behind to attend pastry school in France.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Valerie Valcourt, 36, who previously worked at Amazon and Google before she became a pastry chef. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I took a home economics class where we baked a lot. It was one of my favorite classes. One time, my teacher said, \"Val, you're running this for the day,\" and I was in charge of everything. That's when I knew I'd love to go to pastry school.\n\nI graduated from high school in 2007, and my parents said, \"You're not going to pastry school. You don't need to be in the kitchen.\"\n\nI worked at Big Tech companies for about five years, but as time passed, I realized I wasn't happy. That dream of wanting to go to pastry school had never disappeared.\n\nI was living in Seattle and making over $100,000 with equity and bonuses as an administrative business partner at Google. I lucked out finding good apartments in cool neighborhoods, and financially, I was OK, but I felt unfulfilled. I was in environments where it was very dog-eat-dog. I'd look around the room and think, \"What am I doing here?\"\n\nI kept asking myself why I wasn't doing something that brought me joy. I would still bake here and there, making cakes and cupcakes for friends, and found myself enjoying the process.\n\nI applied to a pastry school in Paris and got accepted, but the school's fees were high, and I realized I didn't actually have the funds.\n\nI also wasn't mentally prepared. I felt stuck in this frozen state, unable to make the moves I needed to. So I left Big Tech and moved to New York for a year. I became an executive assistant at a meditation company, and it was one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had. It really affirmed my decision to go to pastry school.\n\nI knew that if I went to school in the US, I'd probably be taking on a lot of loans, so I began looking in France again.\n\nI found an accelerated three-month program called Gastronomicon in Agde, a small beach village in the south of France. It provided pastry lessons, French lessons, a four-month internship at a Michelin-level restaurant, and housing for both the school and internship. Everything was $10,000. Any other school I looked at lacked at least one of those things and still had a higher price tag.\n\nWhen I told my parents, they were so supportive. My sister, friends, and everyone rallied around me, which was so helpful during those moments when I had doubts about starting over. I was 33 at the time. I thought, \"OK, I can do this and see where this takes me. I don't know what's going to happen after school, but I'm going to do my best.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy to assimilate right away. I had three hours of French class and three hours of pastry every Monday through Friday.\n\nMy school was scheduled so that each week was a theme, like bread, chocolate, plated desserts, or entremets. I had no idea there were so many desserts in France, so everything was completely brand-new — from the meringues to the pâte à choux.\n\nThere was also a lot of culture shock. I didn't speak much French before going to pastry school. I remember going to the grocery store, just pointing at things, panicking, and apologizing profusely. That forced me to get serious and learn as much as I could before my internship.\n\nSometimes, I struggled with the same imposter syndrome I had while working in tech. Then I found those moments of joy when I'd pull a cake out of the oven, and it came out so well. My whole world exploded in the best way possible because it gave me the gift of having to push myself so much in such a short amount of time.\n\nEven during moments of doubt, I was excited to be in the kitchen and work with people every week, learning where I could grow and what my strengths were.\n\nI found joy every day, even in the French homework. I started out not knowing much French, and then I could actually speak to people in restaurants and navigate around the country. I didn't know what a meringue was, and now I can make a lemon meringue pie.\n\nI pulled myself out of that dark place I had been in while working in Big Tech. My spirits lifted being around people who loved talking about food and nerding out on pastry. We would gather for potlucks and eat all the desserts we could find at local patisseries. It was such a unique bonding experience. I was trusting myself and letting myself be as open as I could be.\n\nI don't miss Big Tech. I'm grateful that chapter of my life has closed, and I can focus on this one. I love working with my hands and not staring at a computer screen for eight hours a day.\n\nAfter pastry school, I was going to move to Paris. Then Disney Cruise Line reached out, and I knew I couldn't say no. I've worked on the Disney Treasure and Disney Wish ships as a demi chef de partie. I'm returning to the Treasure in March.\n\nThe goal is to open up my own patisserie in the Connecticut area. I would love to share my favorite desserts, play with the different ingredients I've learned about in France, and bring new things to the table we haven't seen in the States.\n\nI want to encourage people to follow their dreams. Sometimes, when you're in your 30s or older, you're scared to start over. But the truth is, you're not stuck. Now I get to travel the world and pour energy into my passion.\n\nLife doesn't have to stop just because you get older. If anything, it's beginning to open up — if you just allow it.",

    "fullText": "He was at the heart of 1960s counterculture, then paved the way for the libertarian mindset of Silicon Valley. At 87, Brand is still keen to ensure the world is maintained properly – not just today, but for the next 10,000 years\n\nStewart Brand thinks big and long. He thinks on a planetary scale – as suggested by the title of his celebrated Whole Earth Catalog – and on the longest of timeframes, as with his Long Now Foundation, which looks forward to the next 10,000 years of human civilisation. He has had a lifelong fascination with the future, and anything that could get us there faster, from space travel to psychedelic drugs to computing. In fact, he was arguably the bridge between the San Francisco counterculture of the 60s and present-day Silicon Valley: in his commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005, Steve Jobs eulogised the Whole Earth Catalog and Brand’s philosophy, and echoed its farewell mantra: “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.”\n\nYou could say that Brand has also lived big and long. He is now 87 years old, in the final chapters of an eventful and adventurous life that has crossed paths with some of the most consequential events and figures of his era. He has been a writer, an editor, a publisher, a soldier, a photojournalist, an LSD evangelist, an events organiser, a future-planning consultant, even a government adviser (to the California governor Jerry Brown in the late 70s). “There was a time when people asked me, ‘What do you do?’ I said, ‘I find things and I found things,’” says Brand, as in he is a founder. He is speaking from a library where he likes to work in Petaluma, California, not far from his houseboat in Sausalito. “I’m always searching for good stuff to recommend, and good people.”\n\nIn light of his epic life, Brand’s latest project hinges on what sounds like the most mundane topic imaginable: maintenance. It is “not automatically an exciting concept,” Brand readily admits, but once he started thinking about it, he realised you could view just about everything in terms of it, and a lot could be revealed by doing so: “Maintenance is what keeps everything going. It’s what keeps life going.”\n\nHis new book is titled Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One. It is the first of a planned 13 instalments, Brand explains, and it deals with the most literal, material forms of maintenance. Subsequent instalments will investigate everything from buildings to communities, institutions to the human body, plus planetary and environmental maintenance. So perhaps not such a departure after all in terms of long, big thinking. “I fell into it realising it was a tremendously ambitious thing, because I was going to be writing about a range of things I know nothing about,” he jokes.\n\nIn this first instalment, Brand’s magpie curiosity roves freely across industrial history, from round-the-world yacht racing to vehicle manufacturing to encyclopedias to the refurbishment of the Statue of Liberty. The military comes up a lot, “because the military is so maintenance-dependent and maintenance-aware”, he says, pointing out that he served in the US army himself for two years in the early 60s.\n\nWars have been won and lost on the strength of maintenance, Brand notes. In the Vietnam war, for example, the US army’s M16 rifle was lighter, more accurate and more precisely machined; the Viet-Cong’s AK-47s were more crudely made but therefore easier to fix and less likely to go wrong. Many American GIs lost their lives as a result of jammed M16s. Similarly, Russia’s attempted full-scale invasion of Ukraine faltered in its first days in part due to poorly maintained tyres on its long-mothballed trucks, which reflected a broader Russian doctrine of “treating equipment and soldiers as expendable”, as opposed to Ukraine’s flexible, Nato-influenced maintenance culture.\n\nSurprisingly, perhaps, Brand expresses approval for Elon Musk. “What I find so admirable about Musk is that he keeps pushing the envelope of the possible in manufacturing,” he says. Just as Henry Ford revolutionised car manufacturing in the early 20th century with his Model T (which broke down a lot but was relatively easy to fix), so Musk’s Tesla has been a quantum leap, Brand argues. It catalysed the electric vehicle revolution, which has had an invaluable environmental impact. But Tesla also devised an ingenious way to make the entire underbody of its Model Y cars out of just two pieces of cast aluminium, whereas conventional cars used hundreds of parts that had to be welded, bonded, riveted together. Electric motors also have far fewer parts than internal combustion engines. Fewer parts means less to go wrong, which means less maintenance. This is how technology gets better, he says.\n\nThe flipside is, we now expect things to work all the time. “Most consumer products pretty much don’t require maintenance. You get an electric clock and plug it into the wall or change the batteries from time to time, and it’ll tell perfectly good time. You don’t have to do anything else. So there’s a getting out of the habit of expecting to do maintenance, and then when the thing has a problem, we’re offended: ‘Well, it’s not supposed to do that.’” For this reason Brand is also a huge fan of YouTube, where you can find lessons and instructions on how to fix just about anything. “We have higher expectations of not needing to maintain things, and lots of good ways to find out how to maintain them when we encounter a problem. So that’s basically progress, as far as I’m concerned.”\n\nBrand is now thinking about institutions in terms of maintenance, he says, and he has plenty of material. We’re speaking shortly after the Davos economic forum, where Donald Trump’s attempts to “acquire” Greenland came to a head, and the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, declared that there was a “rupture” in the “rules-based international order”. Rather than progress, we seem to be going in reverse here.\n\nLike the electronic clock, perhaps we’ve become so accustomed to the global order working (at least for powerful western nations), when it starts breaking we don’t know how to fix it. Brand is relatively relaxed, though. Some institutions might falter, others might prevail, or come back in a different form, he says. Davos is a good example of both: “Carney could say: ‘We’re having a rupture. And here’s a way to rethink ordering for the middle-level nations.’ So that was a great case of acknowledging an institution that’s in trouble – at an institution that was not in trouble: Davos.”\n\nBrand has been trying to foster a similar vein of long-term thinking with the Long Now Foundation. He co-founded it 30 years ago “to get people comfortable with thinking about not just the next 10,000 years, but more importantly, the last 10,000 years: we’ve come a long way, baby. How did that happen?” The idea began with an email conversation with the computer scientist and inventor Danny Hillis in 1994. They were discussing the year 2000, which had long been considered “the future”, but was then just six years away. The plan became to create an artwork “that would help pop through this membrane of the year 2000 for people, and let them take on various degrees and sizes of future, and not just the next decade”. Hillis conceived the Clock of the Long Now – a mechanical timepiece that would chronicle the next 10,000 years (the name came from Brian Eno, another collaborator). He had approached a lot of people with the idea, but, typically, it was Brand who responded and said: “OK. Let’s build the clock.”\n\nImprobable as it sounds, the clock is almost finished, buried a few hundred feet into a mountaintop in Texas. The land and the money were donated by the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos. It’s really a giant work of land art, Brand explains. “There’s a statue of liberty in New York, and this is kind of a statue of responsibility. It’s beautifully engineered and beautifully constructed and designed as an experience … it’s going to be a day in your life you’ll never forget.” And maybe it will inspire visitors to think as big and long as Brand does. “It would be nice to have an institution of thinkers and explainers that can last as long as the clock does.” The foundation’s other initiatives have included a series of seminars on long-term thinking (hosted by Brand), a library of “books you would want to restart civilisation from scratch”, and a project to preserve all the world’s languages.\n\nThis benign global scope has always been a hallmark of Brand’s brand, combined, paradoxically, with a sense of entrepreneurship and individualism. The opening words of the first Whole Earth Catalog, for example, were: “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.” Born in Illinois, in relative privilege, he came of age in a postwar America that felt it had largely figured out the “operating manual for spaceship Earth”, as the forward-looking designer Richard Buckminster Fuller put it at the time. Atom bombs, computers, vaccines, space travel – anything seemed possible.\n\nBrand combined these grand ambitions with a human-scaled ethos of empowerment. The strapline of the Whole Earth Catalog was “access to tools”, and it was meant in the broadest sense. The huge, thick directory, first published in 1968, listed all kinds of literal tools for the budding commune-dweller – from seed drills to footwear, kayaks to macrame kits – but it also championed books on all manner of hippy-era interests: esoteric religions, sociology, architecture, philosophy, science, the occult, how to talk to dolphins, you name it. Ideas are tools too, Brand points out. As such, the Whole Earth Catalog offered access to a multitude of alternative lifestyles. “It opened doors for people in a way that invited them to consider, ‘maybe I could just build a guitar, or live off the grid.’ And so it had the impact of conferring agency,” he says.\n\nThe Whole Earth Catalog became a huge bestseller in the late 60s and 70s, which made Brand a lot of money – too much for his liking, in fact. In the early 70s he wound the publication down and founded the Point Foundation, which gave grants to worthy causes, though he continued to publish books and periodicals in a Whole Earth spirit until the early 2000s.\n\nOne of the key schisms of the counterculture was a tension between the technologists and the environmentalists. The former embraced space exploration and computing; the latter condemned industrial civilisation and consumer society as inherently destructive. Brand straddled both camps. He saw how they could complement each other. That Nasa image of the whole Earth, for example, he points out, galvanised conservation movements such as Earth Day and Greenpeace, but it “was a direct result of something that environmentalists hated, which was the space programme”.\n\nPredictably, Brand was in on the ground floor when it came to computers. In 1968 he was a camera operator at what is now known as “the mother of all demos” – a seismic event put on by the Stanford Research Institute showcasing what we would recognise today as the foundations of personal computing: windows, hypertext links, video conferencing, even navigation using a then-unheard-of “mouse”. In a 1972 article for Rolling Stone, Brand declared personal computing to be “good news, maybe the best since psychedelics”. “Actually quite a lot better,” he says today. “Because one of the things that soon became apparent was that psychedelics kind of levelled off”, whereas computers have been “an exponential takeoff”: Moore’s law (the doubling of processing power every two years), the internet, and now artificial intelligence – we’re still on that path.\n\nHaving lived through the rapid rise and fall of the commune movement, Brand saw the potential of online community early on. In 1984 he organised the Hackers Conference (these were the days when “hacking” simply meant “doing cool stuff with computing”), at which he coined the now-familiar maxim “information wants to be free”. A year later he co-founded the Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link (Well) as a sort of proto social media platform, with discussion forums on various topics. Meanwhile, many of Brand’s Whole Earth crew went on to found Wired magazine in 1993 (Brand features in the first issue, interviewing Camille Paglia).\n\nTo his critics, Brand paved the way for the neoliberal, libertarian mindset of today’s Silicon Valley. But he was also a community-focused idealist and a lifelong environmentalist. That technology v nature tension persists – hence his apparent affinity with tech figures such as Bezos and Musk. He’s still ambivalent: “Finding anything that is an absolutely unmitigated benefit is pretty rare,” he says. But “I would say the benefits of personal computers and smartphones and the internet vastly reached beyond, in good terms, what we imagined at the time.”\n\nIn terms of physical maintenance, Brand has always been a healthy, active, outdoorsy person – he was a keen sailor, he was hiking up mountains with rocks in his backpack in his 60s, and he started going to CrossFit when he was 75 – “that built a pretty strong constitution”. Now, though, he has a respiratory illness, he says, “which is progressive, incurable and fatal”. He’s in a stable condition, and still exercises, but uses supplementary oxygen as well. “I’d be very surprised by making it into my 90s,” he says, seemingly without regret: “Imagine the luck, to get to be 87 – it’s just fantastic!”\n\nBrand has always been an optimist, he says, and taking the long view, he still is. “I find optimism in terms of being able to find a way to not only continue but keep getting better.” It might be hard to see a positive way forward right now, but that’s always been the way, he says. Brand brings up yet another of his incarnations, the Global Business Network, a consultancy he was part of in the 90s that mapped out future scenarios to help clients plan ahead. “It’s harder to imagine how something might go well than go badly,” he says. But we do not need to passively accept our fate as if we have no control over it. “If you like some scenarios better than others, you can be aware of the ones you don’t like and look for signs of them, and also look at signs of the ones you want to have come to pass, and lean differentially toward them. That’s how you negotiate your way into a future you were glad of. It’s done incrementally by, among other things, lots of individuals and some institutions, and that’s how we grapple our way, muddle our way forward.”",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Alvi Choudhury claiming damages against Thames Valley police after biased technology confused him with man looking ‘10 years younger’\n\nPolice arrested a man for a burglary in a city he had never visited after face scanning software deployed across the UK confused him with another person of south Asian heritage.\n\nAlvi Choudhury, 26, a software engineer, was working at the home he shares with his parents in Southampton in January when police knocked on his door, handcuffed him and held him in custody for nearly 10 hours before releasing him at 2am.\n\nThames Valley police had used automated facial recognition software which matched him with footage of a suspect of a £3,000 burglary 100 miles away in Milton Keynes, according to documents shared with the Guardian by Liberty Investigates.\n\nBut the CCTV footage showed a noticeably younger man with different features apart from similar curly hair, said Choudhury, who was left confused about why he had been arrested.\n\n“I was very angry, because the kid looked about 10 years younger than me,” said Choudhury, who wears a beard. “Everything was different. Skin was lighter. Suspect looked 18 years old. His nose was bigger. He had no facial hair. His eyes were different. His lips were smaller than mine.\n\n“I just assumed that the investigative officer saw that I was a brown person with curly hair and decided to arrest me.”\n\nUK police forces use an algorithm procured by the Home Office from Cognitec, a German company. It runs about 25,000 monthly searches against around 19m police mugshots held on the UK-wide police national database. Facial matches should be treated as intelligence, not fact, according to the National Police Chiefs’ Council. Thames Valley police said the decision to arrest Choudhury was made after a human visual assessment as well.\n\nBut the technology was revealed in December to produce a far higher rate of false positives for black (5.5 %) and Asian (4.0 %) faces than for white faces (0.04 %) at certain settings, according to Home Office commissioned research. Police and crime commissioners warned of “concerning in-built bias”, and said that while “there is no evidence of adverse impact in any individual case, that is more by luck than design”.\n\nSince December, Thames Valley police has also been deploying live facial recognition technology to scan the public in locations in Oxford, Slough, Reading, Wycombe and Milton Keynes. It has captured about 100,000 faces, leading to six arrests.\n\nGiven the differences between the man on the CCTV and his own face, Choudhury assumed he would be quickly freed. He offered evidence of work meetings in Southampton on the day of the crime but he was instead taken into custody.\n\nChoudhury is claiming damages against Thames Valley police and Hampshire constabulary, which executed his arrest. His neighbours saw him being led away in handcuffs, his father was very anxious about him being held and he was unable to work the following day, he said. He is also calling for greater transparency about the number of wrongful arrests involving facial recognition technology.\n\nChoudhury’s mugshot was held on the police system only because he had been wrongly arrested in 2021 when he had been attacked on a night out while at university in Portsmouth. The police released him with no further action. Now he has had a second mugshot taken he is afraid the automated system could trigger more wrongful arrests.\n\n“In my head, if a brown person in Scotland robs a bank are they going to come and arrest me?” he said.\n\nHe sometimes needs security clearance to work for government clients and he is asked about arrests and said: “This makes me look dodgier and dodgier.”\n\nThames Valley police admitted to Choudhury the arrest “may have been the result of bias within facial recognition technology”. But an officer told him that “as the use of facial recognition is already subject to review at a strategic level, I do not feel the need to raise this issue as part of wider organisational learning”.\n\nA Thames Valley police spokesperson denied the arrest was unlawful and said: “While we apologise for the distress caused to the complainant in this case, their arrest was based on the investigating officers’ own visual assessment that the individual matched the suspect in CCTV footage following a retrospective facial recognition match, and was not influenced by racial profiling.”\n\nBut Choudhury said officers at the Hampshire police station laughed when he asked: “Does this look anything like me?” And he said the Thames Valley police officers who arrived to interview him said “they knew I wasn’t the suspect after looking at footage of the suspect and looking at my picture”.\n\nWarnings have been repeatedly raised about the use of automated facial recognition technology. In December 2024 the UK’s biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner, William Webster, voiced concern that police continued to retain and use images of people who, having been arrested, were never subsequently been charged or summonsed. Last month, South Wales police paid damages to a black man who was wrongfully arrested and held for 13 hours after facial recognition technology.\n\nChoudhury’s lawyer, Iain Gould, a partner at DPP Law, said police “must ensure that artificial intelligence is not substituted for human intelligence and due diligence, but instead is used in careful partnership with it”.\n\nThe Home Office said guidance and training to minimise error and maintain public confidence in retrospective facial recognition was under review by the Police Inspectorate. It said a new national facial matching system is under development, with an improved, independently tested algorithm.",

Goldman expects AI gains to continue broadening from the mega-cap names, but the analysts outline three catalysts that could revive Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet's market leadership in the second half of 2026.\n\n\"Hyperscaler return dispersion should continue in the near-term, but we see three catalysts for a potential inflection later this year,\" the analysts said.\n\nHere are three drivers of a potential turnaround for mega-cap laggards that Goldman is eyeing this year.\n\nCompanies reporting increasing revenue tied to AI will ease concerns about overspending.\n\n\"An acceleration in AI-related revenues would support investor belief in the eventual return on ongoing investment spending and the long-term earnings potential of the hyperscalers,\" the analysts said.\n\nThey added that AI-related revenue growth would offer investors visibility into the pathway to AI monetization, showing that colossal spending is justified.\n\nGoldman says that the latest round of Big Tech earnings demonstrates this idea. All hyperscalers lifted their capital expenditure outlooks, but share prices didn't have a uniform reaction.\n\nMicrosoft fell on weak cloud growth and Amazon dropped on its inline sales guide, while Meta popped on its strong revenue outlook and robust revenue in its ad business.\n\nGoldman expects AI capex growth to peak in 2026 and then decelerate, allowing investors to better assess companies' earnings potential.\n\nHyperscaler spending is on pace to make up 92% of cash flows from operations, above the rate seen in the dot com bubble.\n\n\"A deceleration in capex growth would offer line of sight to a trough in free cash flows, which would help investors value these companies on an earnings basis again,\" the analysts said.\n\nThe stock market has seen a rotation from tech stocks into cyclical names, with recent fears about AI transforming the global economy have dethroning legacy tech leaders.\n\n\"A shift in the macroeconomic backdrop from accelerating growth to decelerating growth should push investors to look for opportunities among secular growth stocks,\" the analysts said.\n\nGoldman economists expect the US economy to grow in the first half of the year, supporting cyclical stocks that generally aren't tied to AI.

    "fullText": "Last year, Joslyn Orgill stood at a crossroads. She could keep her six-figure data engineer job at Google — or leave it behind to pursue something that felt more fulfilling.\n\nOrgill and her husband had bought a home in Austin less than two years earlier, a decision that made staying at Google feel like the practical choice. Still, the reasons to leave began to build. She was concerned about job security in tech, felt somewhat invisible at a large company, and had a growing desire to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science — and potentially a career in academia.\n\nLast August, Orgill quit her Google job and started a Ph.D. program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\n\"Google's an amazing company, but the job just wasn't a great fit for me,\" she said.\n\nOver the past year, I've interviewed more than a dozen workers like Orgill, many of them from Big Tech companies, who chose to quit their jobs without having another role lined up. While some eventually landed at another large company, others stepped away from the corporate world entirely — joining a smaller business, launching their own venture, pursuing a career pivot, or focusing on personal priorities like parenting.\n\nThese individuals have become outliers in an economy where workers are quitting at one of the lowest rates in the past decade — a trend driven by a hiring slowdown across tech and other sectors that's left some clinging to their jobs with few appealing alternatives.\n\nThose who have called it quits told me they did so for a mix of reasons: concerns about job security, shifts in workplace culture, entrepreneurial ambitions, or a desire for more meaningful work. In short, they wanted greater long-term agency over their careers.\n\nLast year, David Chong began thinking about quitting his job at Microsoft. Since joining the company in 2022, he said he had struggled to earn a promotion from his senior software engineer role. To move up the corporate ladder, he said it felt like he needed to develop a \"getting promoted\" skill — one that required a lot of internal self-promotion.\n\nChong also said he had become the most senior engineer on his team, which meant there were fewer experienced colleagues to learn from, limiting his growth.\n\n\"I was growing frustrated with the slow promotion timeline,\" said Chong, who is 37 and lives in Toronto.\n\nAt the same time, Chong was increasingly interested in building an AI sales agent startup, a company developing an AI phone agent that screens inbound leads, filters out nonbuyers, and routes qualified prospects to sales representatives.\n\nHe said this move would be easier because he'd built up savings and had no dependents. In September, he resigned from Microsoft to pursue his venture full-time.\n\n\"My plan is to give myself about three years,\" he said. \"If all else fails, I'll go back into the job market.\"\n\nFrustrations with changing workplace expectations were also among the reasons Nicole Landis Ferragonio and Joe Luchs decided to call it quits. While working together at Amazon, they began talking seriously about building a startup of their own — and both resigned last year to focus on their venture, Datalinx AI.\n\nFerragonio said one of the reasons she decided to leave was Amazon's five-day return-to-office mandate.\n\n\"It raised some questions about how much agency you really have in Big Tech and what would be possible on our own,\" she said.\n\nLuchs said the potential of AI technologies made it seem like there was an immense opportunity to build something new.\n\n\"The FOMO of not being able to get in on this AI opportunity was another driver to make me want to move fast here,\" he said.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe decision to quit and pursue an AI-related startup — and take advantage of the rapid advances in the technology — was a common theme among the quitters I spoke with. However, for some, the decision to resign was more personal than professional.\n\nIn October 2024, Kruthika Jayatheertha took six months of maternity leave from her role as a senior user experience researcher at Microsoft. During that time, she decided to take a more extended career break — and resigned.\n\nJayatheertha said being around her daughter full-time has allowed her to witness many of her \"firsts\" — crawling, standing, wobbly walks — without hearing about them secondhand. She said that having a present mother during a child's early years is crucial to their development.\n\n\"It was clear to me that stepping away from work was the right choice,\" said Jayatheertha, who lives in India. She added that her husband's income made her break possible and that she plans to return to work around the time her daughter turns 18 months in April.\n\nPersonal circumstances also significantly influenced Alyson Isaacs' career decision. After working at a startup that \"completely drained\" her savings to $200, she joined Meta as a product manager in 2022. But her entrepreneurial itch never left, so she began preparing financially for a return to entrepreneurship — including moving to a less expensive area, going to a basic gym, and cooking more at home.\n\nThe question was when to make the leap and leave Meta. Isaacs said the death of her father in 2024 weighed heavily on her decision.\n\n\"That really triggered this thought in my brain of, 'Is being a product manager at a Big Tech company what I want to do for the rest of my life?'\" she said. \"And the answer was resoundingly no.\"\n\nLast July, she resigned to build a startup, which she described as an \"agentic AI solution for personal wellness.\"\n\nWhether it was raising a child, avoiding a daily commute, or building an AI startup, the common constraint was time. And quitting their jobs was the only way to reclaim it.\n\nWhen Jason White began thinking about building an AI startup, he knew it would mean leaving his job at Meta. Trying to juggle the business with his role as a full-time machine-learning engineer wouldn't have made sense for several reasons. For one, he already had two demanding roles as a Meta employee and a parent.\n\nHis other concern was legal, since he would have had to disclose any outside business to Meta, and there could've been non-compete issues.\n\nUltimately, he said, it was his passion for the venture — along with the financial cushion he built over the years — that pushed him to make the leap.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I want to take the swing,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday that top tech companies have to cover their own power needs when they are building data centers.\n\n\"We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs,\" Trump said during his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, adding, \"They can build their own power plants as part of their factory so that no one's prices will go up, and in many cases, prices of electricity will go down for the community.\"\n\nTrump said he negotiated a new \"rate-payer protection pledge.\" He did not specify what the pledge entailed or which companies had agreed to it.\n\n\"They're going to produce their own electricity,\" he said.\n\nTech companies have already begun building their own off-grid infrastructure.\n\nPolitico first reported on the pledge earlier on Tuesday, saying tech companies had agreed to pay more for electricity in places near data centers. A White House spokesperson confirmed the report to Business Insider but did not provide additional details.\n\nThe announcement comes as Big Tech companies spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build AI infrastructure and data centers, driving up electricity demand in the US. Utility costs are rising across the US as a result of the increased electricity demand for data centers, a report from the Center for American Progress found.\n\nTrump has previously said Americans should not have to pay higher electricity costs due to data centers, and that the companies that build them \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nDecisions about utility costs are typically made at the state and local levels. It's unclear how the newly announced pledges would be implemented.",

    "description": "The UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup said on Tuesday it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and global automakers.",
    "fullText": "Wayve is revving up its global robotaxi ambitions with fresh funding as it prepares to take on Waymo in London.\n\nThe UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup announced early Tuesday in the UK that it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and major automakers.\n\nThe funding round, which values the startup at $8.6 billion, includes $1.2 billion from investors including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Uber, as well as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis.\n\nIt also includes additional capital from Uber, which is tied to deployments of Wayve-powered robotaxis across the globe. The two companies have a deal to launch self-driving vehicles on Uber's app in over 10 markets worldwide, starting with London this year.\n\n\"We've been learning to drive on British roads for the last eight years, and so this is our home turf,\" Alex Kendall, CEO of Wayve, told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nThe CEO said the latest funding round is key to pursuing the company's ambition to license its software to major automakers and robotaxi fleet platforms like Uber.\n\nUnlike Tesla or Waymo, Wayve is solely focused on developing software for other companies looking to deploy self-driving cars. It is not building its own fleet of robotaxis.\n\nKendall said owning a fleet is expensive, and Tesla's approach to building its own car can be a constraint since it limits the company to one vehicle platform.\n\n\"Everyone wants autonomy, but not everyone wants to buy a Tesla,\" he said.\n\nKendall added that Wayve's AI driver is designed to be generalizable — the same way a human can quickly learn to drive different cars and in new cities.\n\nThat allows Wayve's technology to quickly adapt to new driving environments and learn new road rules, from switching to the opposite side of the road to right turns at a red light, without relying on high-definition mapping and sensors, the approach taken by rivals like Waymo. It also allows the AI driver to be adapted by different automakers, which may have different sensor configurations on their cars, such as lidar or cameras.\n\n\"Because that's what we've built, it enables us to take this business model that enables high-margin software revenues,\" Kendall said.\n\nWayve says that over the past year, its fleet of Ford Mach-Es outfitted with its AI driver has driven in more than 500 cities across Europe, North America, and Japan without being trained on city-specific data.\n\nThe company is also planning to license its technology to carmakers as an advanced driver-assistance system like Tesla's Full Self-Driving, which handles most driving tasks with human supervision. Wayve has a deal with Nissan that will see its AI tech power the Japanese carmaker's ProPilot driver assistance system from 2027.\n\nThe UK-based startup has been testing its tech in London since 2017, and its public debut comes as the city's robotaxi scene gets increasingly crowded.\n\nWaymo is aiming to begin operating its autonomous vehicles in London, its first international location, this year, while Wayve vehicles will be joined on the Uber app by robotaxis from Chinese tech giant Baidu, which is also partnering with Lyft.",

    "fullText": "Workday is betting on artificial intelligence taking over more work.\n\nWhile software stocks — including Workday's — have sunk recently amid concerns over AI advancements, the company framed the technology as a growth opportunity on its Tuesday earnings call.\n\n\"We're working really hard to figure out how do we improve business process execution for our customers at a lower cost,\" CEO Anil Bhusri said.\n\n\"I think that's where the agentic model fits in. What can agents do to replace human labor?\" he said. \"And then obviously longer term, we've got to figure out what we're going to do with those humans that are displaced.\"\n\nBhusri's remarks came after Workday reported revenue and net-income growth for the January-ended quarter. Shares fell around 10%, however, as the company projected slower subscription revenue growth than Wall Street expected for the fiscal year ahead.\n\nA spokesperson for Workday said that Bhusri's comments were not about Workday planning to replace its employees or its customers' employees, but rather about industry-level shifts.\n\nBhusri said the outlook reflects that the AI products Workday is building aren't expected to generate meaningful revenue until later in the year.\n\nWorkday's stock drop marks another setback for the company, whose shares have slid in recent weeks amid a broader software selloff driven by fears that artificial intelligence could upend the industry.\n\nThe rout began in early February, tipping the sector into a deep bear market and spilling into adjacent industries as investors grapple with AI's disruptive potential. Other companies affected include LegalZoom, Thomson Reuters, and Okta.\n\nOn the call, Workday didn't directly address those concerns directly and instead emphasized its investments in agentic products to expand its footprint in HR and finance software.\n\nEarlier this month, Workday said it was laying off about 400 employees, citing a need to realign its resources to meet its top priorities. A week later, Bhursi was renamed CEO, succeeding Carl Eschenbach, who stepped down. \n\nBhusri has held the top job three times before. He told analysts on Tuesday's earnings call that while he's optimistic about the business, he tends to set guidance cautiously and aim to outperform it.\n\n\"I don't know if you know you remember me when I was a CEO before, but I do try to be conservative on the guide and then beat it,\" he said.",

    "description": "Another day, another sharp sell-off in software stocks. The sector has become a popular lightning rod for tech bearishness.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this month, we wrote about how the software sector had been marked with the scarlet letter of AI disruption. We declared that no matter what it did going forward, it would always have to contend with the perception that it's a sitting duck.\n\nFast-forward a few weeks, and the picture for software has gotten even bleaker. The most popular ETF tracking the sector has tumbled to the lowest since 2023. Wall Street analysts are taking cleavers to their price targets in the space.\n\nWhat's more, software has become the new lightning rod for risk-off AI aversion. If investors are in play-it-safe mode and rotating out of tech, they're dumping the group first and asking questions later. At this point, the sector's reputation precedes it.\n\nThis dynamic played out on Monday as software stocks sold off sharply as the ever-evolving US tariff situation sparked investor uncertainty. Throwing fuel on the flames was a viral blog post from Citrini Research laying out a drastic bearish scenario for the US market and economy.\n\nI won't drag you into the ominous nitty-gritty of the Citrini report, but I will give you a brief summary. The firm lays out a thought-experiment scenario where AI drives large-scale white-collar displacement, which destroys consumer demand and triggers downturns in markets and the economy.\n\nNot exactly the feel-good read of the year. But while the doomsaying was compelling, what struck me the most was how the blog post treated the decline of software as a foregone conclusion — a formative event for a grander AI bubble across many sectors.\n\nAs if the vibes around software weren't negative enough, the sector's narrative is now intersecting with another hot-button topic: private credit. Many of the software companies branded as vulnerable have significant debt loads. And a lot of that debt is due to private credit lenders. Citrini dedicated a whole section of its report to systemic credit risk.\n\nBen McMillan, the chief investment officer at IDX Advisors, told BI recently that he sees lax private-market underwriting as something that could eventually come back to bite.\n\nBigger picture, it's clear that software's role as the ringleader of the so-called AI \"scare trade\" is locked in — but it's far from the only member. Insurance brokers, real estate services companies, and wealth managers have gotten whacked in recent weeks. AI is a fickle, market-value-erasing beast.\n\nBut software should still be monitored closely. Its current role as a punching bag makes it even more important to watch as a bellwether of the AI trade.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic is pushing deeper into the enterprise, embedding its AI model Claude directly into the workplace software employees use every day.\n\nOn Tuesday, the AI startup unveiled \"Cowork & Plugins for the Enterprise,\" a package of AI tools that get Claude operating inside popular work applications, such as Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint. Instead of copying answers from a chatbot into spreadsheets or slide decks, users can now run Claude directly inside those applications, with the system carrying context between programs.\n\n\"Until now, enterprise AI has followed a persistent pattern: you go to the AI, get an answer, then go back to your actual tools to do the work,\" Anthropic wrote in its announcement on Tuesday. \"Now, Claude works inside the tools knowledge workers already use — Excel, PowerPoint, Slack — not as a separate window, but as part of how work actually gets done.\"\n\nThe launch signals Anthropic's clearest attempt yet to challenge Microsoft and OpenAI for control of the digital workplace in the era of AI.\n\nMicrosoft has embedded its own 365 Copilot tool across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams, while also offering Copilot Studio for enterprises to build custom AI agents. OpenAI, meanwhile, launched Frontier earlier this month, a platform built on its ChatGPT enterprise offerings. Google has integrated its Gemini AI throughout Gmail and its Workplace applications. Amazon also offers a similar service called Quick Suite.\n\nAnthropic is hoping to position itself as the default operational layer across enterprise workflows.\n\nAt the center of the launch are customizable \"plugins,\" or specialized AI agents configured for roles including financial analysis, design, operations, and HR.\n\nAnthropic said the plugins are open-source and portable, allowing companies to modify and deploy them without being locked into a single ecosystem. Several were co-developed with partners, including FactSet, S&P, and Slack.\n\nThe AI startup is also rolling out a slate of new connectors to platforms such as Google Drive, Gmail, and DocuSign, enabling Claude to access live enterprise data with administrative controls. Enterprises can create private plugin marketplaces and manage access at scale.\n\nAnthropic said customers, including L'Oréal, Deloitte, and Thomson Reuters, have already built specialized AI agents using Claude to automate workflows and accelerate internal processes.\n\nWith this launch, Anthropic is making clear that it no longer wants to be known primarily as a tool for developers. It wants Claude embedded across the enterprise, supporting finance teams, HR departments, analysts, and executives alike.\n\n\"In 2025, Claude Code transformed how software gets built,\" Anthropic said in Tuesday's announcement. \"In 2026, we're bringing that transformation to all knowledge work.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "A top statistician and markets commentator thinks more pain is coming from the AI-fueled wave of panic that's shaken the tech sector.\n\nNassim Taleb, the author of \"The Black Swan\" and an advisor at Universa Investments, said he believes the disruption will materially affect software firms and will \"definitely\" lead to bankruptcies in the space.\n\nMoreover, Taleb predicts that the gains among the market leaders of the last few years will be erased as the next crop of winners emerge.\n\n\"The previous rally we had was driven by a very small number of names. And now we'll probably have some broadening effects and redistribution, but a lot of the gains in the stock market are going to be eradicated by that,\" he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.\n\nThe AI scare trade has been in full focus lately as new AI products and updates pummel software stocks. The sell-off in recent weeks has also spilled over to sectors ike trucking, wealth management, and insurers.\n\nTaleb used a historical analogy to further illustrate his take on the tech sector, noting that pioneering companies are not necessarily the most successful in the long run. He cited the automotive and airline industries as examples, as well as the original PC makers.\n\n\"I'm sure someone's going to make a lot of money in both software and hardware related to AI, but [that] doesn't necessarily have to be these companies because you have a lot of instability,\" Taleb added.\n\nAs Black Swan events are, by definition, phenomena that no one sees coming, Taleb could not speculate on what the next one will be. However, that doesn't mean he believes the US market isn't facing major risk as AI disruption continues.\n\nTaleb said that while the market may be behaving as if extreme crashes are unlikely, this isn't the case, and investors shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security.\n\n\"I would say the tail risks across all sectors are underpriced,\" he said. \"So it's not the risk of drawdown in the stock market, it's a risk of large drawdown.\"",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Tuesday she is considering legal action following a comment by tech billionaire Elon Musk, the ‌world's richest man, that alleged she was connected to drug cartels.\n\nMusk's post on X ‌followed the capture and killing of Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) leader Nemesio Oseguera, \"El Mencho\", by Mexican security forces.\n\nIn the ​post, Musk responded to a 2025 video of Sheinbaum discussing cartel violence and alleged that she was \"saying what her cartel bosses tell her to say.\" He did not provide further evidence.\n\n\"We are considering whether to take legal action\", Sheinbaum said during her daily morning press conference, adding that government lawyers ‌are currently reviewing the matter.\n\nIn ⁠the 2025 video, Sheinbaum said a return to a \"war on drugs\" was not feasible.\n\n\"Returning to the war on drugs is not an option ... it is ⁠outside the framework of the law,\" she said.\n\nThe military offensive on cartels led by former President Felipe Calderon in 2006 led to bloody turf battles as gangs splintered, triggering a spiral of violence ​that ​many analysts see as a contributing cause to still-high ​homicide rates.\n\nSheinbaum said she expected security ‌to continue to normalize in Mexico after cartel members coordinated a series of roadblocks and arson attacks in the aftermath of the government's Sunday operation against Oseguera.\n\nAsked if the operation marked a return to more a more violent security stance, Sheinbaum said this would never be the case.\n\n\"The detention of a suspected criminal with an arrest warrant can generate this type of ‌circumstance, but we are looking for peace, not war,\" ​she said.\n\nRuling MORENA party president Luisa Alcalde also reacted ​to the post on social media, saying ​Musk should use his platform and X social media network to fight ‌drug consumption, addiction, disinformation and the stop ​the promotion of narco ​culture.\n\n\"Wealth does not give moral authority,\" she said. \"The lives that are lost in this fight, often fueled by consumption in other countries, are worth infinitely more than any fortune ​amassed in Silicon Valley.\"\n\nOver 130,000 ‌people are missing in Mexico, where much of the country's violence is linked ​to drug cartels that sell products to and obtain firearms from the United ​States.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: NCA’s Alex Murray says he hopes new £115m police AI centre can limit unfairness found in tools\n\n‘It’s not Robocop’: UK police embrace AI ‘efficiency’ in complex investigations\n\nA police chief has admitted artificial intelligence used to boost crime fighting will contain bias but pledged to combat the risks.\n\nLabour wants a dramatic expansion of police use of AI within England and Wales, with police chiefs also believing it could help keep law enforcement up to date with new criminal threats.\n\nAlex Murray told the Guardian that a new national police AI centre would recognise the risks of bias and minimise them.\n\nBias in use of AI in policing could result in instances where algorithms – often trained on historical data reflecting past human prejudices – systematically produce unfair outcomes, such as overtargeting minority communities or misidentifying individuals based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\n\nMurray, the director of threat leadership with the National Crime Agency, and the national lead for AI, said: “Once you’ve recognised and minimised [bias], how do you train officers to deal with outputs to ensure that it is further minimised?\n\n“If you talk about live facial recognition or predictive policing, there will be bias, and you need to get in the data scientists and the data engineers to clean the data, to train the model appropriately, and then to test it.\n\n“There is no point releasing something to policing that has bias in it that’s not recognised, and everything should be done to minimise it to a level where it can be understood and mitigated.”\n\nExamples of bias have already surfaced in the police use of retrospective facial recognition, which is powered by AI. That is where a suspect is compared with a database of images after a crime.\n\nLive facial recognition, which is more controversial and is used less by policing, hunts for suspects in real time, and also contains bias. A report in December found that a retrospective facial recognition system used by police had been used with inadequate safeguards.\n\nThe Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), which oversees local forces in England and Wales, said: “System failures have been known for some time, yet these were not shared with those communities affected, nor with leading sector stakeholders.”\n\nThe APCC forensic science lead, Darryl Preston, who is the police and crime commissioner for Cambridgeshire, said: “The discovery of an in-built bias in the police national database’s retrospective facial recognition system, even if only in limited circumstances, demonstrates the need for independent oversight of these powerful tools.\n\n“It is not acceptable for technology to be used unless and until it has been thoroughly tested to eliminate bias. That clearly was not the case in this instance.”\n\nThe new national AI centre, costing £115m, would aim to reduce bias, said Murray, as well as assessing and deciding what products from private suppliers work. Currently each of the forces across the UK makes its own decisions, which is seen as slow and wasteful.\n\nMurray said police were in an “arms race” with criminals who were using the technology: “Anyone with imagination can use AI.”\n\nIn one case a paedophile claimed images showing him involved in the abuse of children was a deepfake, which police then had to disprove to get him convicted.\n\nMurray said the benefits of AI were far beyond the “cliche around Minority Report and predictive policing”.\n\nHe added that across a range of crimes and challenges facing policing, AI ranged from being a help to a gamechanger, but a human police officer will have to make the final decisions about what to do about the results AI produces.\n\nHe said it could help police deal with political agitators who infect social media with fake images to try to trigger violence on the streets.\n\nIn time, Murray said, it could help with manhunts, or speed up searches for cars linked to suspects and save the hundreds of hours it takes for detectives to trawl through extensive CCTV footage, or speed up the search of seized digital devices from suspects in the hunt for incriminating evidence.\n\n“What took days, weeks, sometimes months can potentially take hours,” he said.\n\nIn one recent case, four Luton-based suspects were arrested for attacks on – and thefts from – cashpoints. Police downloaded the data from the suspects’ phones and, thanks to AI, secured guilty pleas within weeks.\n\nThe data was in Romanian and AI scoured through it, translated it, identified the material relating to potential crimes, identified the offences and presented it all in a package for detectives.\n\nTrevor Rodenhurst, chief constable of the Bedfordshire force, told the Guardian: “This allowed us to draw evidence from lots of devices with a vast quantity of data, which we would otherwise not have been able to do.”\n\nRodenhurst said that as officers use AI and see its benefits, it is changing the view of the frontline: “They are no longer suspicious, they are asking when they can have it. That capability is transformative.”",

    "fullText": "We explore the strange food-obsessed world of a new game whose tech was once called ‘an insult to life itself’ by Hayao Miyazaki, the film-maker behind Spirited Away\n\nA strange piece of software has recently landed on the PC gaming store Steam. And “software” feels like the cleanest way to describe it. Existing somewhere between a full-blown life sim, a science project and a kind of haunted fish tank, Anlife: Motion-learning Life Evolution probably would have disappeared without making much impact if it wasn’t for one unusual factor. Several years ago some of its creators were absolutely roasted on camera by one of the genuine legends of Japanese animation.\n\nBack in 2016, Hayao Miyazaki, the director of movies such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, was shown new technology that used AI in order to animate models. Faced with a zombie that utilised its head to move by knocking its skull against the ground and wriggling its body like a fish, Miyazaki declared what he had seen was “an insult to life itself”. It’s hard not to watch the clip without feeling slightly seared – but now, a decade later, the ashen-faced developers from that room have sufficiently recovered to make their work widely available.\n\nJudging by the chatter surrounding the launch, at least some of the people downloading Anlife are doing so in the hope that it might provide some kind of indication of the current state video games’ relationship with AI. Putting aside the often broad use of that term, this is certainly a thing that’s worth trying to understand, whether it’s because of the job losses caused by AI or blamed on AI, or the sheer number of games made with the assistance of AI models now landing on storefronts such as Steam.\n\nThere’s a problem here, though. And it’s that Anlife itself is such a cheerfully inconsequential thing that it’s hard to read too much of anything into it.\n\nAnlife promises players an evolution simulator where “AI-driven block creatures move in unexpected ways.” What this comes down to for the most part involves placing a range of different creatures into a small environment and then watching as they learn to get around.\n\nVisually Anlife is pure Frutiger Aero, offering landscapes of green valleys and sparkling water that could be the kind of soothing images MRI technicians sometimes encourage you to look at during a lengthy scan. Sonically it’s equally inoffensive: with a range of bloops, bleeps and popping sounds, we’re pitched right into the soundtrack of a million 00s day spas.\n\nThis desire to soothe permeates to the level of mechanics, too. Over the course of an idle morning with Anlife you can place a range of simple creatures in the environment and then give them food that will encourage them to breed or mutate. You can expand your territory and then lure creatures towards water or up into the air in order to create more variations. There are plenty of things to unlock (including a shadow tech tree that has you covered if you want to annihilate your digital sea monkeys rather than watching them flourish) but the ecosystem is kept simple. It’s a game about watching how things decide to crawl towards food.\n\nThe thrill of all of this presumably comes down to the “how” in that last sentence. This is where the game’s slightly mysterious use of AI is probably involved. And it’s true that, after a few hours of play, you’ll have Anlife’s funny little blob creatures exploring new kinds of joints and body arrangements as they swim and fly and generally roll around eating.\n\n(AI has a history of being used to make creatures walk around, incidentally, often using small neural networks and computer evolution. In 2009, the UK-based games technology company NaturalMotion developed a project in which a bipedal model learned to walk using evolved neural networks. The company was subsequently bought by Zynga in 2014.\n\nThere are two problems, however, the first being that the focus on unlocking the skill tree gives the opening hours of Anlife the feel of a rather mindless clicker game that it struggles to shake off. The second comes down to something that I gather people studying procedural generation sometimes refer to as “the oatmeal problem”.\n\nThe oatmeal problem, which was first formulated by writer, developer and academic Kate Compton, hinges on the fact that every single bowl of oatmeal in the universe is unique. Just not in a very interesting way. Similarly, when Anlife’s creatures discover a new way of rolling or bouncing or flapping their bodies towards food, they’re still just moving towards food. It makes for a game that’s either about really, really paying attention to tiny variations in detailing, or about completely zoning out and just enjoying the floaty aesthetic. Over the course of my time with Anlife, I’ve generally started with the first approach and then discovered, after 10 minutes, that I’ve slid into the second.\n\nThe more I played Anlife, the more I ended up thinking about something I heard from one of the first AI researchers I ever spoke to, all the way back in 2013. The real value of AI, they explained – and I am paraphrasing here – is that it could one day become a completely alien form of intelligence. Which means that us humans would have the lens of a different kind of mind through which to see ourselves and our quirks and cognitive fallacies – things that can be hard to spot when you’re talking to people who think in a very similar way to you.\n\nSince then the apparent focus for a lot of companies such as OpenAI seems to be completely the opposite: creating mimetic plagiarism machines that sometimes seem to exist only to tell people what they already want to hear.\n\nIt feels as if Anlife is filling a very small and specific niche. It isn’t trying to disguise its AI use, as far as I am aware. It’s actually trying to draw attention to the way it uses AI to allow its little creatures to move around. It’s not just a game born of AI, in other words. It’s a game that in some small way is actually about AI. It wants to be slightly alien. It doesn’t want to hide itself or ingratiate; it wants to examine AI’s innate capacity for otherness.",

    "description": "Tech giants like IBM and LinkedIn are expanding entry-level programs for engineers amid an evolving job landscape for junior workers.",
    "fullText": "Being new to the job market is never easy. But in a field like software engineering, it can feel especially daunting as AI takes over many tasks that used to belong to entry-level workers.\n\nSome companies have grown cautious about hiring recent graduates as they figure out how AI will reshape their teams. Others, however, are celebrating the new wave of talent.\n\nLeaders at Blackstone and Salesforce have told Business Insider that the entry-level talent pool is particularly strong and stands out with its AI fluency.\n\nHere are seven companies, including major tech firms such as IBM, LinkedIn, and Dropbox, who have increased — or plan to increase — hiring of entry-level developers.\n\nLinkedIn is planning on expanding its entry-level engineering internship program by 40%, compared to the year before, Erin Scruggs, vice president and head of global talent acquisition, told Business Insider.\n\n\"We're working closely with our engineering leaders to keep investing in early-career talent, especially engineers who are AI-native and bring a builder mindset,\" Scruggs said in an email.\n\nThe company said it plans to adjust its hiring mix to \"open up more opportunities\" for the next generation of engineers, while continuing to bring in experienced technical leaders.\n\nIBM is tripling its entry-level hiring in 2026, including in software engineering, according to Nickle LaMoreaux, chief human resources officer at IBM.\n\nAt a recent conference hosted by media and insights company Charter, LaMoreaux said that talent professionals will have to \"rewrite every job,\" and communicate the value of entry-level workers to their business because AI can do many of the jobs that entry-level workers were doing a few years ago.\n\n\"If you're going to convince your business leaders that you need to make this investment because it's an investment for the future, then you need to be able to show: What is the real value these individuals can bring now?\" she said.\n\nSoftware developers in 2024 or even 2025 would spend 30 to 40 hours a week coding, LaMoreaux said. Now, she said, they do coding and testing with AI assistance — and they're also building new products, gathering client feedback, and talking to marketing teams.\n\n\"I think the companies three to five years from now that are going to be the most successful are those companies that doubled down on entry-level hiring in this environment,\" LaMoreaux said.\n\nThe CEO of IT-services company Cognizant previously told Business Insider that he expects the entry-level hiring space to grow — and now the company is acting on that. The company told Business Insider it's quadrupling its pipeline of entry-level talent with a plan to hire up to 2,000 early-career talent by the end of the year.\n\n\"Cognizant believes early-in-career talent have a competitive edge in this dynamic moment as AI-natives and lifelong learners,\" Kathy Diaz, chief people officer at Cognizant, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nThe company added that it has various workforce development programs to support early-career candidates, including its Fusion Internship program, which is a project-based internship.\n\nCloud cybersecurity firm Cloudflare announced plans in September to hire 1,111 interns in 2026 to \"train the next generation of technology leaders.\" The plan is a significant increase from its formerly 60-person program, and the aim is to provide students with \"hands-on experience and mentorship,\" the company said in its announcement.\n\nThe program \"offers a chance to work on projects and ship updates that directly impact millions of Internet users, from securing network infrastructure to developing cutting-edge server-less applications,\" the company said.\n\nCloudflare said it would also make developer tools available to US university students at no cost for a year.\n\nThe move comes after the company noted that entry-level technical opportunities have declined across the industry.\n\n\"Without hiring emerging talent, industries risk a critical shortage of experienced workers in the future,\" the company said.\n\nDropbox said it's expanding its internship and new-graduate programs by 25% to capitalize on younger workers' AI fluency. That includes engineering hires, the company told Business Insider.\n\nMelanie Rosenwasser, chief people officer at Dropbox, said that when it comes to entry-level workers using AI, \"it's like they're biking in the Tour de France, and the rest of us still have training wheels,\" Bloomberg reported.\n\nCybersecurity firm ThreatLocker said it plans to nearly double its headcount to 1,200 employees over the next 18 months. The company said a significant number of those hires will be entry-level, expanding its talent pool of junior developers.\n\nThe CEO and cofounder, Danny Jenkins, said in a statement to Business Insider that it maintains a highly demanding training standard for engineers at every level to \"reflect the real pressure of defending critical systems.\" The company has experienced a spike in growth as it responds to a new age of threats in the AI era, the CEO previously told Business Insider.\n\nThe company also offers a free, in-person, 60-hour cybersecurity bootcamp to immerse college students and recent grads in \"live fire\" training scenarios.\n\nInvisible Technologies, an AI software platform for businesses, said it has hired 160 engineers in the past 18 months. Roughly half of them were entry-level or \"quite junior,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nThe CEO, Matt Fitzpatrick, told Business Insider that he has found entry-level engineers to be \"some of the most thoughtful about using gen AI, because they've grown up using this in their schooling.\" He said the entry-level talent pool is \"incredibly proficient\" and \"more useful than ever.\"",

    "description": "There is no GPS at the Red Planet, but a new technology called Mars Global Localization lets Perseverance determine precisely where it is — without human",
    "fullText": "There is no GPS at the Red Planet, but a new technology called Mars Global Localization lets Perseverance determine precisely where it is — without human help.\n\nImagine you’re all alone, driving along in a rocky, unforgiving desert with no roads, no map, no GPS, and no more than one phone call a day for someone to inform you exactly where you are. That’s what NASA’s Perseverance rover has been experiencing since landing on Mars five years ago. Though it carries time-tested tools for determining its general location, the rover has needed operators on Earth to tell it precisely where it is — until now.\n\nA new technology developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California enables Perseverance to figure out its whereabouts without calling humans for help. Dubbed Mars Global Localization, the technology features an algorithm that rapidly compares panoramic images from the rover’s navigation cameras with onboard orbital terrain maps. Running on a powerful processor that Perseverance originally used to communicate with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, the algorithm takes about two minutes to pinpoint the rover’s location within some 10 inches (25 centimeters). Mars Global Localization was first used successfully in regular mission operations on Feb. 2, then again Feb. 16.\n\n“This is kind of like giving the rover GPS. Now it can determine its own location on Mars,” said JPL’s Vandi Verma, chief engineer of robotics operations for the mission. “It means the rover will be able to drive for much longer distances autonomously, so we’ll explore more of the planet and get more science. And it could be used by almost any other rover traveling fast and far.”\n\nThe upgrade is especially valuable given how well Perseverance’s auto-navigation self-driving system has been working. Enabling the rover to re-plan its path around obstacles en route to a preestablished destination, AutoNav has proved so capable that the distance Perseverance can drive without instructions from Earth is largely limited by the rover’s uncertainty about its whereabouts. Now that it can stop and determine its exact location, Perseverance can be commanded to drive to potentially unlimited distances without calling home.  Implementation of Mars Global Localization comes on the heels of another innovation from the Perseverance team: the first use of generative artificial intelligence to help plan a drive route by selecting waypoints for the rover, which are normally chosen by human rover operators. Both technologies enable Perseverance to travel farther and faster while minimizing team workload.\n\nUnlike on Earth, there is no network of GPS satellites in deep space to locate spacecraft on planetary surfaces. So missions — whether robotic or crewed — must come up with other ways to determine their location.\n\nAs with NASA’s previous Mars rovers, Perseverance tracks its position using what’s called visual odometry, analyzing geologic features in camera images taken every few feet while accounting for wheel slippage. But as tiny errors in the process add up over the course of each drive, the rover becomes increasingly unsure about its exact location. On long drives, the rover’s sense of its position can be off by more than 100 feet (up to 35 meters). Believing it may be too close to hazardous terrain, Perseverance may prematurely end its drive and wait for instructions from Earth.\n\n“Humans have to tell it, ‘You’re not lost, you’re safe. Keep going,’” Verma said. “We knew if we addressed this problem, the rover could travel much farther every day.”\n\nAfter each drive comes to a halt, the rover sends a 360-degree panorama to Earth, where mapping experts match the imagery with shots from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The team then sends the rover its location and instructions for its next drive. That process can take a day or more, but with Mars Global Localization, the rover is able to compare the images itself, determine its location, and roll ahead on its preplanned route.\n\n“We’ve given the rover a new ability,” said Jeremy Nash, a JPL robotics engineer who led the team working on the project under Verma. “This has been an open problem in robotics research for decades, and it’s been super exciting to deploy this solution in space for the first time.”\n\nThe small team began working in 2023, testing the accuracy of the algorithm they’d developed using data from 264 previous rover stops. The algorithm compared rover panoramic photos to MRO imagery and correctly pinpointed the rover’s location for every single stop.\n\nKey to Mars Global Localization is the rover’s Helicopter Base Station (HBS), which Perseverance used to communicate with the now-retired Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. Equipped with a commercial processor that powered many consumer smartphones in the mid-2010s, the HBS runs more than 100 times faster than the rover’s two main computers, which, built to survive the radiation-heavy Martian environment, are based on hardware introduced in 1997.\n\nAs a technology demonstration designed to test capabilities, the Ingenuity mission was able to risk employing more powerful commercial chips in the HBS and the helicopter even though they hadn’t been proven in space. It paid off: Expected to fly no more than five times, the rotorcraft completed 72 flights.\n\nThe power of the HBS processor inspired Verma to look for ways the Perseverance mission might harness it. “It’s almost like a gift. Ingenuity blazed the trail, proving we could use commercial processors on Mars,” Verma said.\n\nTapping into the HBS computer has had its challenges. To address reliability, the team developed a “sanity check”: The algorithm runs on the HBS multiple times before one of the rover’s main computers checks to ensure the results match. During testing, the team repeatedly found the rover’s position was off by 1 millimeter. They discovered damage to about 25 bits — a minuscule fraction of the processor’s 1 gigabyte of memory — and developed a solution to isolate those bits while the algorithm runs.\n\nAlongside the broader Mars Global Localization process, the team’s sanity check and memory solutions are expected to find new uses as faster commercial processors are employed in future missions. In the meantime, the team has already turned their sights to the Moon, where difficult lighting conditions and long, cold lunar nights make knowing exactly where spacecraft are located all the more critical.\n\nNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover on behalf of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, as part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program portfolio.\n\nTo learn more about Perseverance:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance\n\nMelissa Pamer / DC Agle \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n626-314-4928 / 818-393-9011\nmelissa.pamer@jpl.nasa.gov / agle@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nKaren Fox / Molly Wasser\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov",

    "fullText": "Amid talk of artificial intelligence taking our jobs, the big unasked question is: how will we be fed?\n\nHow will we be fed? That’s the biggest question not seriously being addressed amid all this talk about whether or not artificial intelligence will end up taking over all of our jobs.\n\nFormidable though the technology appears, similar fears have popped up repeatedly since the Industrial Revolution, and most working-age adults remain employed. Still, what is sorely missing is a serious debate about what to do if this future in fact materializes.\n\nFor Open AI’s Sam Altman “the future can be vastly better than the present” because AI will make us stinking rich. But that seems like a risky assumption, for almost everyone except Altman and his fellow techno-oligarchs.\n\nEven if AI generates enormous economic prosperity, its distribution will remain a political challenge. This juncture calls for a serious, open debate about how the fruits of this prosperity will be apportioned among humanity.\n\nAddressing the question has two parts. The first is about how to design a technically efficacious system to redistribute the fruits of the economy as machines take over and labor’s share of income drops eventually near zero.\n\nThe more important question, though, is about how this economic reorganization will restructure power. Who will decide what to tax once AI destroys labor income, which provides the main source of government revenue in most advanced countries? Who decides how much everyday people who do not have an equity stake in the AI revolution get to consume?\n\nHow will society be organized in a world in which machines generate most or all economic output and a few dozen techno-billionaires get to decide what share of the world’s resources – money, energy, minerals – should be allocated to further expand superhuman intelligence? Who else gets a say on whether to direct more resources to, say, healthcare or agriculture, or education instead?\n\n“We need guardrails that preserve human agency, human oversight and human accountability,” noted United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi last week. The future of AI “cannot be decided by a handful of countries or left to the whims of a few billionaires”.\n\nIn AI circles, there is a lively debate about the “alignment” challenge – ensuring that the machines operate in ways that serve the goals of whoever runs them. The bigger challenge is to align the goals of AI systems and their owners with the broader goals of society. AIs will do lots of things of consequence to all of us. Our democratic governance tools seem too feeble to constrain the urges of the oligarchs at the helm of these new technologies.\n\nTechnological change drove democracy’s spread around the world as the rise of an urban working class proved indispensable to the economy and political systems adjusted to represent them. But if the work of ordinary people becomes irrelevant, what happens to people’s power to affect their system of government?\n\nAnton Korinek and Lee Lockwood of the University of Virginia put together a primer with ideas about how public finance might work in the AI era. They propose that consumer taxes will pick up the slack at first, as labor income shrinks to zero. In a world dominated by artificial superintelligence, though, the footprint of human consumption would shrink as most of the returns from machines’ economic output were reinvested, calling for a tax on capital to shoulder most of the burden.\n\nMaybe taxes could also be used to slow down the transition. Another idea discussed by Korinek and Joe Stiglitz from Columbia University is that in early stages, when human labor retains its relevance, taxes could be used to steer tech investments toward technologies that help workers do their jobs better rather than replace them. Korinek and Lockwood propose other taxes, on fixed factors like land, spectrum or data, or monopoly rents, that add nothing to society’s wellbeing.\n\nIt sounds doable. The problem is that the owners of these disruptive technologies must be convinced to do something that does not come naturally to them: share. Taxes in the US amount to less than 26% of GDP, eight percentage points less than the OECD average. Capital taxation amounts to just over 2% of GDP. These numbers will have to go much higher, since people will no longer have wages to live on and will rely more heavily on government largesse.\n\nDon’t hold your breath. The OECD’s global tax deal, finalized in 2021, was designed to curtail the ability of American tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Meta to engage in tax shifting, parking profits in the lowest tax jurisdiction they could find. But while the Biden administration was broadly supportive of the deal, Donald Trump – whose campaign benefited from nearly $400m in donations from various tech oligarchs – unilaterally withdrew in early 2025.\n\nUnusual ideas may be called for to keep society afloat, given the scale and breadth of the expected AI revolution. One would be to directly distribute the equity of artificial intelligence ventures. Taxes might be collected in shares rather than cash, to amass a public stake over time. Rather than tax the returns on AI investments, a more radical proposal would be for the government to expropriate a chunk of equity upfront to redistribute among the population and directly grant Americans a share in AI’s promised cornucopia.\n\n“If AI development stalls, returns remain modest; if AI transforms the economy, returns are likely to rise,” Korineck and Lockwood wrote. “This automatic adjustment proves valuable given radical uncertainty surrounding AI development.”\n\nBut these big ideas face big challenges. Governments will have to act before artificial intelligence gets too big, which seems unlikely in the current climate.\n\nThe technology oligarchs at the helm of this revolution have also vigorously resisted government efforts to curb their power or take their cash. Despite her best efforts, Silicon Valley nemesis Lina Kahn was largely unable to crack tech monopolies during her stint as President Joe Biden’s main trustbuster at the head of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nIn the meantime, the moneyed in Silicon Valley are not only mobilizing vast resources to steer American politics. As a plan B they are working to build their own “network-states”, whether in Greenland or Nigeria, Honduras or the Caribbean island of Nevis, hoping to evade democratic governance if they can’t get their way under America’s democracy.\n\nWho knows what they might do when they have replaced all human labor. If artificial intelligence grows as powerful as Silicon Valley’s oligarchs expect it to become, the only available strategy to keep us all fed in the world after work might be to go hat in hand and ask the moguls, politely.",

    "description": "An AI product manager who worked at a Chinese tech giant explains what makes Chinese AI different from the West.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yilin Zhang, an AI product manager at AI startup Kuse who worked at Meituan for more than three years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.\n\nI graduated from Tsinghua University with a master's degree in computer science in 2021 and then joined Meituan — one of China's biggest tech firms — as a product manager.\n\nAt Meituan, China's platform for local services, especially known for food delivery, I worked on two AI projects. One was a consumer-facing AI assistant that helps users complete various tasks, including ordering food. The other was a merchant-facing AI agent designed to help businesses manage their daily operations, including handling reservations, managing orders, and supporting routine operational tasks.\n\nThe main difference between how products are built in China and in the US comes down to the market.\n\nAcross most large Chinese tech companies, AI product development accelerated more aggressively around 2025.\n\nThe AI initiatives I worked on at Meituan started around April or May of that year. It coincided with the surge of interest around DeepSeek, when attention around AI agents took off.\n\nLarge companies began racing to build AI projects, and almost every business unit launched its AI initiative.\n\nFor a long time, especially before 2021 or 2022, Chinese tech companies were primarily focused on domestic competition rather than overseas expansion. Because competition in China is intense, tech companies were forced to become extremely efficient. Their execution methods have been sharpened to an almost frightening degree.\n\nConstraints have also pushed Chinese AI companies to pursue different paths, with a strong focus on open-source models and cost efficiency. These limitations forced exploration in new directions, and those paths have proven valuable in their own way.\n\nDeepSeek is a good example. Because of international restrictions, it couldn't access large numbers of GPUs and was forced to innovate around efficiency instead.\n\nChinese and overseas markets are fundamentally different, leading to distinct user bases, expectations, and product designs.\n\nChinese users have a much lower willingness to pay for software; hence, many mass-market AI products, such as Doubao, tend to be free. The core objective is often to scale active usage.\n\nMany capabilities are packaged into a single prompt you can ask, essentially a chatbox interface with a low barrier to entry.\n\nInternational AI products target users doing high-value tasks. They are more often designed for desktops than for mobile devices, with interfaces better suited to work contexts. These products explore how AI and humans can collaborate and intersect across different work scenarios, helping users complete tasks more effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn China, that user group is relatively small. That makes it harder for its mainstream AI products to move beyond chat-based forms into more advanced products.\n\nChina's internet success over the past decade has also largely come from consumer-facing apps. That environment forces product managers to obsess over user feedback and relentlessly polish even the smallest features.\n\nTeams may spend enormous effort refining a tiny feature just to win over a small group of users. In markets with less competition, that level of detail isn't always necessary.\n\nAfter three to four years at Meituan, I felt I had learned most of what I could from that environment. I left to join the AI startup Kuse in October.\n\nAI is evolving extremely fast. In large companies, iteration speed can be slower. Many of my friends across different Big Tech companies share this same frustration. Smaller, more agile companies can adapt faster.\n\nIn the past, top graduates had basically two paths: becoming a civil servant or joining a Big Tech company.\n\nThat's changing. Especially over the past year, many AI startups have emerged, and more young people are choosing entrepreneurship. AI has created a new path outside Big Tech.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working in a Chinese tech company? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "fullText": "Your $1,000 laptop deserves a protective home on the road. A tech journalist and frequent traveler recommends his nine favorites\n\nThe four best personal-item backpacks that fit under US airline seats\n\nWhether you’re flying across the country on vacation, meeting with an important client downtown or just heading to your local coffee shop for work, there is a good chance you’re bringing a backpack along, with a laptop squirreled away inside.\n\nWhile you can toss a laptop into just about any bag, the best laptop backpacks are specially tailored to pamper what is probably one of your most expensive (and delicate) possessions. That means a padded pocket lined with soft non-scratch material, easy access to your computer without unpacking everything and lots of extra pockets for portable mice, chargers and other accessories. Add in all of the standard backpack considerations such as capacity, comfort and durability, and you have a lot of factors to consider.\n\nTo find the very best laptop backpack, I rounded up 11 of the top models and tested them over several months and many miles.\n\nBest overall: \n\n Mission Workshop Meridian backpack\n\nBest for travel:\n\n Peak Design Travel Backpack\n\nBest budget: \n\n The North Face Vault\n\nBest sling bag: \n\n Tomtoc Navigator – T24 Sling Bag (Small)\n\nBest rugged bag: \n\n Pelican PX25 Aegis Travel Pack\n\nI’ve been a tech journalist for 13 years, and a frequent traveler – in 2025 I flew more than 70,000 miles, across 41 flights and a total of seven days and six hours in the air. I visited 12 airports and six countries, to say nothing of countless steps, ride shares and hotels.\n\nAs someone who tends to pack more than I really need and has a bad back, I’m uniquely motivated to find the perfect backpack, and it’s been an obsessive quest of mine for years. Backpacks also speak to my love for planning and organization, which the testing process let me fully indulge.\n\nThe first thing I did to test these 11 backpacks was to pack for a trip. I put everything I typically carry for a work trip on to a table: a laptop that is anywhere from 13 to 16in, a tablet, several phones – because I have a weird job – multiple plugs, chargers, batteries and, of course, plenty of bungee cords. My loadout also includes three tech bags: one with video gear like a selfie stick and lav mics, one with flight essentials like snacks and battery packs and one with chargers, cables and adapters.\n\nThen, I packed up each backpack using the various compartments and pockets as designed, threw each backpack on to my back and I walked a half mile each. Since water is the mortal enemy of laptops, I also tested each backpack (empty – and thank goodness!) in my shower for one minute to simulate getting caught in the rain. I fully let out all the straps and donned the backpack to see how easily the straps adjusted. I zipped and unzipped each zipper 25 times to see how easy it was to use. Finally, I put a deck of playing cards in an easy-access pocket (if there was one) and timed how long it took for me to get it off my back and the cards in hand.\n\nMany manufacturers provided samples to test for this article, which I donated to my local library upon completion. It’d be a treat to see a school kid or even an adult strutting around town with one of these.\n\nMission Workshop’s Meridian backpack has pockets for days, a semi-modular design that lets you customize it with add-ons and tons of space.\n\nWhy we love it\nThis bag easily held everything I wanted to pack with room to spare, and a home for everything. All three of my tech bags fit in the main compartment, and everything else had its own pocket, making it very clear where everything lives. The sample I received included two add-ons: a slim side pouch that’s perfect for phones, battery packs or even a slim flashlight, and a bottle pouch. Laptop access on this bag is particularly nice because it has its own compartment, separate from the main compartment. It scored the highest on our waterproof testing, as well – everything inside was bone dry. The straps didn’t rest along my rib cage as well as I’d like, but it was definitely wearable.\n\nThis bag is probably overkill for a student just looking to tote a laptop and some books around campus, but it’s great for a professional who needs to schlep a bunch of gear comfortably and with easy access to everything.\n\nIt’s a shame that … It’s so big it might strain the personal item rules on most airlines. And there are no locks or hidden pockets if you’re worried about security. While it has a sleeve to slide over the handle on a roller bag, it’s situated sideways, which interferes with the side pouches and struck me as a silly design choice.\n\nMax laptop size: 17in\nCapacity: 28 litres\nEmpty weight: 2.74lbs\n\nThis bag has an unusual design: to pack it you need to rest it on its face and open the back, which hinges 180 degrees and gives you easy access to the whole main compartment.\n\nWhy we love it\nIf you’re headed out for a weekend, this is a lovely bag to comfortably bring a few changes of clothes, your laptop and all the goodies that go with it. Aside from the large main compartment, you’ll find a good amount of organization around the periphery of the main pouch, smaller zipped pockets along the side and two larger zipped pockets on the inside of the front of the bag.\n\nLoops along the periphery of the bag inside and out allow you strap even more gear to the bag, and Peak even includes tie-downs. With 30 litres of capacity, you probably won’t need to, though.\n\nIt’s a shame that … The unique design takes some getting used to. Adjusting the straps and fit is very difficult, and waterproofing was just OK. There was some water ingress, making the paper towels inside the bag damp, but not wet. The lining is also not absorbant, so it dries quickly.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 33 liters\nEmpty weight: 3.17lbs\n\nWhile it’s the most basic bag I tested, the North Face Vault is a perfectly competent laptop hauler at a fraction of the cost of most other bags on this list.\n\nWhy we love it\nBeing basic isn’t necessarily a bad thing – not every backpack needs 700 pockets for every little item. The Vault has a generous main compartment and a smaller top compartment with a few pouches and pockets for very small items, such as pencils and thumb drives. The top pouch takes away a bit of room into the main pouch, but the latter opens wide enough to easily work around it if you’re digging around for something.\n\nThis bag is deceptively deep, and it holds a lot, if pressed into service. I found it very serviceable for most tasks – the Toyota Corolla of backpacks. It will get you from A to B with no complaints. Just please don’t get caught out in the rain.\n\nIt’s a shame that … It’s not waterproof at all – water quickly works its way inside. It’s also not terribly comfortable for extended periods due to thin straps and little padding on the shoulder straps and back.\n\nMax laptop size: 15in \nCapacity: 27 liters\nEmpty weight: 1.68lbs\n\nThis isn’t technically a backpack – it’s a sling bag, but it’s delightfully small, it holds a ton of gear, and yet has enough space for a 14in laptop.\n\nWhy we love it\nThis is a great day pack, if you’re heading out for a day on the town. It only holds 7 liters, but those 7 liters are impeccably organized: there are pockets for your laptop, tablet and e-reader, plus smaller pockets for additional organization. An outer pocket is perfect for things you need to grab on the go, and a security pocket facing your back lets you safely stow your wallet, keys or passport in a tough-to-swipe location.\n\nIt’s a shame that … Adjusting the strap is very hard with the overengineered buckle. This is also the smallest bag on the list by a lot, and probably won’t hold everything you’ll want for plane rides.\n\nMax laptop size: 14in\nCapacity: 7 liters\nEmpty weight: 1.23lbs\n\nPelican is perhaps best known for its hardened cases used to carry delicate equipment, and the Aegis stays true to its roots with a super tough hard-shell design.\n\nWhy we love it\nUnlike all the soft options on our list, this model has a rigid exterior built to shrug off impact and general roughhousing. I didn’t drop the bag from my roof or anything, but if you find yourself in a harsh environment with gear that doesn’t take kindly to impact, this should be your first choice.\n\nThe backpack is essentially one large compartment, except for one small compartment at the top for odds and ends, and a laptop sleeve. If you want to more, Pelican sells stick-on Velcro “ModPaks” that add various pockets. Personally, I would need three or more, but if you want a lot of open space to work with, this is a good bag to consider. Like the Peak Design bag, it has tie-down loops inside to ratchet down your gear with cord or bungees.\n\nIt’s a shame that … There is virtually no organization in the bag – plan to use packing cubes. It also has almost no water resistance. Also, if you have a dog with not-black fur, carry a lint roller with you!\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 25 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.9lbs\n\nI prefer a messenger bag (AKA sling bag) when I need to dig into it frequently, like at a trade show, but a backpack is more comfortable for extended wear. Since I switch between them frequently, this convertible bag piqued my interest. It offers the best of both worlds: when you want to convert it, the backpack straps zip up into their own pocket, and you attach the shoulder strap to two loops and just like that, you have a messenger bag.\n\nThe main pocket is surprisingly large, and the two auxiliary pockets also hold a lot. When I was done packing in the items I used to test these bags, this one had a lot of space left over. But it didn’t reign in any one category, which knocked it down a few pegs from its competitors.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … There is no organization nor security in the bag.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 25 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.09lbs\n\nThe Knack Medium Backpack has a highly unusual design that expands out to leap from 24 to 35 litres. You actually access the laptop sleeve from the side, rather than the top, which is a novel approach. While there are some smaller pockets around the periphery of the bag, the main pocket is just one big open space with a divider, which is designed to separate clothes from other gear.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … It felt like the designers had a few clever ideas, but couldn’t quite bring them together coherently. It’s also not water-resistant at all.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in \nCapacity: 35 liters \nEmpty weight: 3lbs\n\nIf you’ve ever found yourself with the unexpected need to check a bag for a flight as I have, a lockable backpack provides welcome piece of mind. This Tomtoc has lock latches – holes where you can insert a lock to attach the zippers to each other – on both of its sets of zippers. You can’t lock up the front pockets, which is unfortunate, but you can secure the main pouch, which is probably where your most expensive goodies live.\n\nTwo zippers access the main pocket: one in the back that facilitates slipping a laptop into the sleeve, and a second one at the front that gives you a wide mouth to put other items in. They both open to the same space, which seemed a bit redundant.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … It has terrible water resistance, and it’s not terribly comfortable to carry.\n\nMax laptop size: 17.3in\nCapacity: 24 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.2lbs\n\nIf you’re a new parent, this bag is a no-brainer, but it’s also great for travelers. I’ve taken it on several trips with no screaming babies in tow and I really dig it. It offers tons of places to stick items like phones, a top pocket for quick-access items and a large stretchy pocket on the front of random odds and ends. If you’re using it as intended, there’s a space at the bottom designed to hold dirty diapers and one pocket designed for baby wipes.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … There’s no security in the bag at all, and the baby features waste a bit of space for non-parents.\n\nMax laptop size: 17in\nCapacity: 20 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.1lbs\n\nPeak Design Everyday Backpack 20L\n\nThink about capacity, organization, security, waterproofing and comfort. To prioritize, consider what you’ll be carrying and in what circumstances. A bag for day tripping to the coffee shop requires less capacity than a weekend travel bag, for instance.\n\nObviously, nothing beats trying it on. Fully extend out the straps, put it on your back and then adjust the straps to fit. If you can, toss in some dummy weight.\n\nIf you’re shopping online, examine how the straps are sewn to the backpack. If they attach vertically, they’ll run along your torso more comfortably than those attached horizontally. Also, consider the zipper pulls. As you get older, zippers with fabric or cord loops can be much easier to pull than bare metal tabs. Also look for retailers with a good return policy in case reality doesn’t match expectations.\n\nBottom padding matters more than anything. Backpacks will be slung down off your back and on to the floor hundreds, if not thousands, of times, and bottom padding is the only thing between your $2,000 laptop and a concrete floor. Also consider waterproofing – if the bag isn’t very waterproof and you get stuck out in the rain, the padding of the sleeve might absorb water and take a long time to dry out.\n\nWhile I prefer a backpack with a pocket for everything, others prefer the versatility of an open compartment. To prevent all your gear from mixing together, use packing cubes and specialized tech bags, like the Peak Design Tech Pouch I use, to hold cables and chargers. Many companies offering backpacks with open compartments also sell organizational packs to go inside.\n\nSome high-end backpacks shed water like ducks; others may as well be made of gauze. If you’re stuck in the rain with the latter, find a garbage bag to put over the backpack, making a slit for the straps if necessary (or just carry it by the handle if it has one, and most all of the bags in this list do). A friendly business may even let you have one if you ask nicely.\n\nWhen you get home, empty the backpack completely, place it in a room with a lot of air circulation and place something inside the laptop sleeve to prop it open so it can dry out. If you don’t, water can get trapped in there for days.\n\nAdam Doud is a freelance product journalist and frequent traveler who carries a ton of tech with him wherever he goes. He’s been on a low-key quest to find the perfect bag/backpack since 2020, and he has strapped more gear to his back than Hannibal’s elephants – though not all at one time. He is also a compulsive organizer, so the more pockets the better",

    "title": "The U.S. spent $30 billion to ditch textbooks for laptops and tablets: The result is the first generation less cognitively capable than their parents",
    "description": "Neuroscientist Jared Cooney Horvath said older generations “screwed up” giving students access to so much technology: “I genuinely hope Gen Z quickly figures that out and gets mad.”",
    "fullText": "In 2002, Maine became the first state to implement a statewide laptop program to some grade levels. Then-Governor Angus King saw the program as a way to put the internet at the fingertips of more children, who would be able to immerse themselves in information.\n\nKing’s initial efforts have been mirrored across the country. In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $30 billion putting laptops and tablets in school. But more than a quarter century and numerous evolving models of technology later, psychologists and learning experts see a different outcome than the one King intended. Rather than empowering the generation with access to more knowledge, the technology had the opposite effect.\n\nEarlier this year, in written testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, neuroscientist Jared Cooney Horvath said that Gen Z is less cognitively capable than previous generations, despite its unprecedented access to technology. He said Gen Z is the first generation in modern history to score lower on standardized tests than the previous one.\n\nWhile skills measured by these tests, like literacy and numeracy, aren’t always indicative of intelligence, they are a reflection of cognitive capability, which Horvath said has been on the decline over the last decade or so.\n\nCiting Program for International Student Assessment data taken from 15-year-olds across the world and other standardized tests, Horvath noted not only dipping test scores, but also a stark correlation in scores and time spent on computers in school, such that more screen time was related to worse scores. He blamed students having unfettered access to technology that atrophied rather than bolstered learning capabilities. The introduction of the iPhone in 2007 also didn’t help.\n\n“This is not a debate about rejecting technology,” Horvath wrote. “It is a question of aligning educational tools with how human learning actually works. Evidence indicates that indiscriminate digital expansion has weakened learning environments rather than strengthened them.”\n\nThe writing was perhaps already on the wall. Fortune reported in 2017 that Maine’s public school test scores had not improved in the 15 years the state had implemented its technology initiative. Then-Governor Paul LePage called the program a “massive failure,” even as the state poured money into contracts with Apple.\n\nGen Z will now have to face the ramifications of eroding learning capabilities. The generation has already been hit hard by the transformations of the 21st century’s other technological revolution: generative AI.\n\nEarly data from a first-of-its-kind Stanford University study published last year found AI advancements to have “significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the U.S. labor market.” But a less capable population means more than just poorer job prospects and less promotions, Horvath warned; it endangers how humans are able to overcome existential challenges in the decades to come.\n\n“We’re facing challenges more complex and far-reaching than any in human history—from overpopulation to evolving diseases to moral drift,” he told Fortune. “Now, more than ever, we need a generation able to grapple with nuance, hold multiple truths in tension, and creatively tackle problems that are stumping the greatest adult minds of today.”\n\nClassroom technology usage has ballooned in recent years. A 2021 EdWeek Research Center poll of 846 teachers found 55% said they are spending one to four hours per day with educational tech. Another quarter reported using the digital tools five hours per day.\n\nWhile teachers may be intending for these tools to be strictly educational, students often have different ideas. According to a 2014 study, which surveyed and observed 3,000 university students, students engaged in off-task activities on their computers nearly two-thirds of the time.\n\nHorvath blamed this tendency to get off-track as a key contributor to technology hindering learning. When one’s attention is interrupted, it takes time to refocus. Task-switching also is associated with weaker memory formation and greater rates of error. Grappling with a challenging singular subject matter is hard, Horvath said. For the best learning to happen, it’s supposed to be.\n\n“Unfortunately, ease has never been a defining characteristic of learning,” he said. “Learning is effortful, difficult, and oftentimes uncomfortable. But it’s the friction that makes learning deep and transferable into the future.”\n\nSustained attention to a singular subject is anathema to how technology today has been deployed, argues Jean Twenge, San Diego State University psychology professor studying generational differences and the author of 10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World. More time on screens isn’t just ineffective in facilitating learnings; it’s counterproductive.\n\n“Many apps, including social media and gaming apps, are designed to be addictive,” Twenge told Fortune. “Their business model is based on users spending the most time possible on the apps, and checking back as frequently as possible.”\n\nA Baylor University-led study published in November 2025 uncovered why this is: TikTok required the least amount of effort to use, even less than Instagram Reels and YouTube shorts, by balancing relevant videos with surprising and unexpected content.\n\nConcerns over social media addiction have become so dire that 1,600 plaintiffs, across 350 families and 250 school districts, filed a lawsuit alleging Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube created addictive platforms leading to mental health challenges like depression and self-harm in children.\n\nHorvath proposed a swath of solutions to Gen Z’s tech problem, at least as it pertains to classroom use. Congress, he suggested, could impose efficacy standards to fund research on what digital tools are actually effective in the classroom. The legislature could also require strong limits on tracking behavior, building profiles, and collecting data on minors using tech.\n\nSome schools have taken matters into their own hands. As of August 2025, 17 states have cracked down on cellphone use in school, banning the technology during instructional time; and 35 states have laws limiting the use of phones in the classroom. In fact, more than 75% of schools have said they have policies prohibiting cellphone use for non-academic purposes, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, though enforcing those bans have been met with variable success.\n\nUltimately, Horvath said, the loss of critical thinking and learning skills is less of a personal failure and more of a policy one, calling the generation of Americans educated with gadgets victims of a failed pedagogical experiment.\n\n“Whenever I work with teenagers I tell them, ‘This is not your fault. None of you asked to be sat in front of a computer for your entire K-12 schooling,’” Horvath said. “That means we…screwed up—and I genuinely hope Gen Z quickly figures that out and gets mad.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "A longtime HR pro says AI is making everyone's résumé look the same, when it can provide job seekers with so much more value.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Trent Cotton, an HR industry veteran who is head of talent-acquisition insights at recruiting-software company iCIMS. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs someone who works in the talent space, I've lately noticed that many people think AI helps make their résumés look better. My response to that is: You know your AI agent is cheating on you, right? It's doing the same thing for everyone, so your effort to try to stand out is actually making you blend in.\n\nIt's OK to use an AI agent to improve your résumé, but instead of asking it to do a rewrite, which can introduce errors, prompt it to behave like an expert career coach. Have it analyze your résumé and ask you probing questions to help you further build out your experience profile.\n\nNext, ask the agent what roles you might qualify for based on your skill set. The results may include ones you didn't know about, so have it explain what those jobs involve. Sometimes you just need to get a different perspective.\n\nIn my job at iCIMS, I analyze millions of data points collected from our recruiting software. Each month, I take a look at a specific sector or hot topic and dive deep.\n\nOne thing I saw last year was a pretty decent increase in application volume in manufacturing. If I'm sitting in tech, manufacturing isn't the sector I'm thinking of, but manufacturing needs tech to do things like track what's coming in and out of warehouses. AI can provide that kind of insight — but only if you ask for it.\n\nSticking with this example, you want to ask the AI: What are some of the top manufacturing companies looking to hire tech talent, and for what kind of positions? Keep going down that rabbit hole to really understand what opportunities are out there.\n\nOnce you find job listings that interest you, plug the descriptions into your AI agent and tell it to start interviewing you. When I was in college, you always went through mock interviews. They would just be absolutely brutal with you, but they prepared you. I think we've skipped a couple of generations in doing that. AI can bring mock interviews back.\n\nTell the AI agent that you want the interviewer to be like someone with business savvy, such as Steven Bartlett from the podcast \"Diary of a CEO.\" But also say you want feedback from the likes of chef and TV personality Gordon Ramsay, because he's known for providing his employees with brutally honest, constructive feedback. Say you want a true grade about your interview performance and recommendations for ways you can get better.\n\nMost AI agents will say your answers are great if you don't give them a persona like that of Ramsay. The AI version of him is going to tell you the good, the bad, and the ugly, and you're going to be better off because of it.",

    "title": "California tried to protect students' data. Tech companies found loopholes",
    "description": "A legislative battle is under way over gaps that allow companies to collect and sell students’ personal information.",
    "fullText": "The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, uses investigative reporting, data analysis, and software engineering to challenge technology to serve the public good. \n\nFor every aspect of a student’s life, there’s a tech company trying to digitize it. Inside the classroom, online tools proctor exams, create flashcards and submit assignments. Outside, technology coordinates school sports, helps bus drivers find the right route and maintains students’ health records.\n\nCalifornia has a number of laws aimed at protecting children’s data privacy, but those laws have exceptions that allow many tech companies to continue packaging and selling students’ personal information.\n\nThis year, Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a San Luis Obispo Democrat, is carrying a high-profile state bill that would add new protections for students. She says it’s important, especially as the Trump admin is trying to collect data about California residents’ immigration status, gender identity, and their use of certain public benefits.\n\nHistorically, California has been a leader in data privacy. In 2014, California passed a landmark student privacy law that prohibited technology companies from selling students’ data, targeting students in advertising, or disclosing their personal information. Then in 2018, the state passed another unprecedented bill that required all companies give California users certain privacy rights, such as a chance to opt out of data collection and delete some of their information.\n\nBut as technology evolved and proliferated, privacy laws repeatedly fell short in protecting California’s students — at the same time that the federal government has tried to collect increasing amounts of personal information, Addis said.\n\nHer bill would restrict how AI companies use student data and create new data protections for college students. Some of Sacramento’s most powerful players are paying close attention to the measure, including the California Labor Federation, which supports the bill, and the California Chamber of Commerce, which opposes it. Combined, these two groups spent nearly $8 million on campaign donations to state legislators or other political activities in 2024, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database. TechNet, a trade association that represents many of the most powerful tech companies, also opposes the bill.\n\nThe proposal, Assembly Bill 1159, would close certain loopholes in the state’s 2014 education privacy law, but experts say it may not be enough to prevent companies from selling students’ data.\n\nJen King is a privacy and data policy fellow at Stanford’s institute for AI, where she studies the tricks that companies use to gather users’ data and prevent them from opting out, sometimes known as “dark patterns.” In her personal life, she’s vigilant about avoiding online data tracking and maintains a landline in her Bay Area home to avoid giving out her cell phone number.\n\nKing doesn’t want her children’s information available online or for any company to sell, though sometimes it happens before she can stop it.\n\nIn the fall, King got an email about a platform called TeamSnap, which her 12-year-old son’s cross country coaches were using to manage the team’s roster. The company wanted her information, including her name, date of birth, gender, email address, and phone number. Once she logged in to the platform, she could see some of her son’s information, such as his name, email, and date of birth, were already listed. Photos and personal information from all of her son’s teammates were also available for her to see.\n\n“I was super irritated,” she said. “You don’t need my birth date — I’m a freaking parent.” She acknowledged some personal information could be useful for a coach but said that other questions seem designed to help the platform sell information to data brokers and ultimately, to advertisers.\n\nHer 17-year-old son’s data is also on TeamSnap, she later learned, because his robotics team uses it. This month, when King tried to show The Markup and CalMatters her TeamSnap account, a pop-up appeared, asking her if the company could track her activity across other apps and websites.\n\nFederal law requires companies to get parental consent before knowingly collecting or selling data from children 12 and under, but once a child turns 13, their data is generally treated much like an adult’s information, especially when that child is interacting with tech platforms outside of school. TeamSnap’s privacy policy says it doesn’t knowingly collect personal information about users under 13 “without express parental consent,” though it says in some cases a team or organization may provide information on behalf of the child.\n\nThe policy also says that TeamSnap has “not sold the personal information of any consumer for monetary consideration” in the last 12 months, but that its “use of cookies and other tracking technologies may be considered a sale of personal information under the CCPA (California privacy law).” Information sold to advertisers and marketers included users’ names, contact information, purchase history and geolocation, the policy says.\n\nCalifornia privacy law specifically requires certain large for-profit companies to get consent to collect data from anyone under 16. Often, consent happens when a user first opens a website and a pop-up appears, asking if the website can sell your data or track your cookies.\n\nIf a teacher, coach, or other authority figure tells a student that they have to use a website or an app, then the student cannot realistically opt out, King said. They may be too young to understand how to opt out, she added. “Most 15-, 16-year-olds don’t have any idea what this is about.”\n\nEven older college students may have little agency in the technology they use, especially if it’s required for class or residential life. At Stanford, for example, King said her undergraduate students are often required to create Facebook accounts for student groups.\n\nThe same is true for parents. King said she reluctantly gave TeamSnap her personal information, including her name, email, date of birth, and the landline number for her home, because it was the only way to get updates about her son’s team.\n\nIn 2014, California became the first state in the country to regulate education technology companies directly, but being first comes with its drawbacks. “We didn’t have examples of what best practice was,” said Amelia Vance, the president of the Public Interest Privacy Center, a nonprofit organization. The law only applies to products that “primarily” serve K-12 schools and that are designed and marketed for students.\n\nMany tech companies argue that their products aren’t primarily intended for students or at least that they were not designed or marketed that way. The language-learning app DuoLingo, for example, has a version for schools, but the app is also popular for adults. Apps or technologies serving extracurricular programs or sports teams can claim they weren’t designed and marketed for the classroom, or that their use isn’t mandatory, said Vance. “You have this sort of black hole where there haven’t been protections.”\n\nAddis’ bill expands the number of education technology companies that fall under the state’s student privacy laws, but the language is murky when it comes to apps or online services used outside of class.\n\nIn the case of TeamSnap, Addis’ communications director Alexis Garcia-Arrazola said the company would “most likely” fall under the scope of the bill if its technology is marketed to schools, if schools direct students to use it, and if the sports team is sponsored by the school.\n\nPublic records show that Piedmont Unified School District in Alameda County, Tamalpais Union High School District in Marin County, and Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District all purchased versions of TeamSnap, but only the Santa Monica Malibu district responded to questions about any privacy restriction imposed on the company. Brandyi Phillips, the chief communications officer for the Santa Monica Malibu schools, said the district has an annual subscription with TeamSnap, which is only available to sports staff and parents. She said there’s an agreement with the company “to protect District information and to prevent unauthorized access” but did not clarify if that agreement prevents the district from selling students’ information.\n\nBerkeley Unified School District, where King’s children attend school, did not respond to questions about any contracts, purchase orders or agreements with TeamSnap.\n\nLocally, school districts and colleges have the power to negotiate the privacy terms of any contract they make with a technology company, but many websites and apps offer free versions that a teacher or coach might recommend without getting formal approval from their district.\n\nLast year, the California State University system signed a nearly $17 million contract with Open AI, the company that operates ChatGPT, including an agreement that the company will not train its models on student data. Advocates for Addis’ bill say the same privacy restrictions should apply to any AI company with access to California student data, regardless of whether the company has an agreement with the student’s school district or college.\n\nAddis’ bill comes as privacy laws in California and across the country are in flux. In 2020, California voters approved a proposition to create a new state agency to enforce data privacy rules and regulate the businesses that collect data. Advocates for the proposition contributed over $6.7 million to the campaign, compared to just over $50,000 contributed by the opposition, according to state data. The state agency that the proposition formed, now known as CalPrivacy, released new rules this year, restricting the use of automated decision-making technology, such as the use of AI to make admissions or hiring decisions. Those rules were originally stricter but businesses, lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom pressured the CalPrivacy board to water them down.\n\nIn Washington D.C., Congress is considering changing federal law to limit how companies interact with children under 17. Separately, Congress is considering a bill that would require social media companies to prevent and mitigate children’s sexual exploitation, bullying, and self-harm. California Attorney General Rob Bonta is concerned that one version of the social media bill contains language that could erode existing protections in California law.\n\nBonta’s office is responsible for enforcing many of the state’s existing privacy laws. In November, he said the state worked with Connecticut and New York to reach $5.1 million in settlements against Illuminate, an education technology company that uses data to track and evaluate students’ progress, such as their testing scores and developmental milestones. The company had a data breach, exposing “sensitive information” from over 434,000 California students, the state attorney general’s office said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time California successfully went after a company for violating the state’s landmark 2014 education privacy law.\n\nTo increase enforcement, Addis’ bill contains a new provision — the right for students and parents to sue tech companies in certain cases for privacy violations. Business and technology groups have opposed the bill, arguing that the new regulations and the right to sue would stifle investment in AI-powered learning tools.\n\nKing said that giving consumers the right to sue is often the only way to increase enforcement. Otherwise, the onus is on individual consumers to find concerning practices and try to opt out.\n\nDespite being an expert in data privacy, King said that she struggled at first to figure out how to delete her TeamSnap account, only later to discover that she needed to send an email to the company. She laughed at the irony, since it’s these kinds of dark patterns in user design that fuel part of her research.\n\nIn academia, the strategy of trapping customers is sometimes called the “roach motel,” she explained, a reference to a popular television ad from the late 1970s for a cockroach trap.\n\n“You can check in,” she said, “but you can never check out.”",

    "fullText": "Like a modern-day Paul Revere, Ben Dziobek's voice rang across the night as he ran toward a crowd waiting outside New Brunswick City Hall on Wednesday.\n\nThe news? Members of the city council struck down potential plans to build a data center.\n\n\"They canceled it! They canceled it!\" Dziobek shouts in footage shared by New Jersey's Climate Revolution Action Network. Loud cheers followed, and then a chant: \"The people, united, will never be defeated!\"\n\nThe New Brunswick City Council had just decided to remove data centers from the list of permitted uses in a plan to redevelop several parcels of land. While no data center had yet been proposed, even the possibility that a data center could someday end up there raised alarm among city residents.\n\n\"The city administration is asking the council to amend the redevelopment plan to remove data centers as a permitted use, and to reinsert the requirement for inclusion of a park on the site that's provided in the prior redevelopment,\" New Brunswick's city planner Daniel Dominguez said at the meeting.\n\nLarge, warehouse-style data centers have become a flash point for many communities across America as Big Tech and other AI companies look to power the large language models and chatbots they say are going to change the world. Those data centers, however, can be a drain on water resources and power grids, increase pollution, and decrease the quality of life.\n\nAn investigation by Business Insider published last year found that over 1,200 data centers had been approved for construction across the US by the end of 2024. These data centers, the report found, could consume as much power as entire US states and guzzle enormous amounts of water daily in drought-stricken regions.\n\nIn New Brunswick, those environmental concerns were top of mind.\n\n\"Community members cited concerns over environmental impact, energy consumption, water usage, noise pollution, and the broader implications of allowing large‐scale artificial intelligence and data infrastructure to expand into residential and public community spaces,\" the Climate Revolution Action Network, a local environmental activist group that helped organize opposition to the redevelopment plan, said in a press release.\n\nOn Wednesday, residents and environmental advocates attended a New Brunswick City Council meeting to discuss the proposal.\n\nDuring the meeting, Dominguez said the inclusion of a potential data center in the redevelopment plan was intended to \"diversify the commercial development site,\" but that it was \"not critical to the project.\"\n\nAttendees cheered after the city council ultimately voted to nix the data center.\n\n\"I'd like to thank the council for deciding to scrap what many people did not want in their neighborhoods,\" one attendee said. \"We don't want these kinds of centers in here that are going to take resources from the community.\"\n\nNew Brunswick is one among many communities across the country fighting potential data center developments.\n\nA large group of residents opposing a proposed data center in Clarmore, Oklahoma, turned out for a council meeting to discuss the project last week. Police arrested one of them for speaking for 30 seconds over their allotted three minutes. In San Marcos, Texas, hundreds of residents showed up at City Hall on Tuesday to protest a data center. The city council eventually scrapped that plan after a nearly 9-hour debate, according to local reports.",

    "title": "Early pecking order and Verstappen’s concerns: 7 key takeaways from F1 testing",
    "description": "After three weeks in Barcelona and Bahrain, F1 heads to Melbourne. But what are the main lessons from pre-season testing? From Mercedes’ favourite status to interesting tech solutions, here are the key takeaways",
    "fullText": "Prior to winter testing, George Russell was already the bookmakers’ top favourite for the 2026 Formula 1 world title, and that picture has not changed after three weeks of running.\n\nYes, Ferrari ultimately topped the timesheets, but that says little. Traditionally, the Scuderia tends to show a bit more than some of its rivals and Charles Leclerc even bolted on a set of C4 tyres, a softer compound than Pirelli normally brings to Bahrain. Mercedes did not feel that necessity, which in itself may be a sign of confidence.\n\nF1 Bahrain pre-season test: Ferrari tops testing overall by 0.8s\n\nAs McLaren team boss Andrea Stella explained on Friday evening: individual lap times say little, only the long runs reveal a first indication. In that respect, Mercedes has made a good impression at various moments. Moreover, rivals – not least Max Verstappen – have expressed the view that Toto Wolff’s outfit is still holding quite a bit of performance in reserve. In that regard, it was telling that Pirelli has indicated that the lap times in Bahrain (in contrast to those in Barcelona) were slower than anticipated, which may also point to sandbagging.\n\nMercedes remains the favourite after the first on-track action of the year, but that does not take away from the fact that Ferrari has started well. The long runs looked relatively consistent, also in terms of energy deployment over multiple laps. There is cautious reason for optimism in Maranello, although it is not something that should make anyone in Brackley or Brixworth nervous.\n\nWhen Stella shared his own view on the early pecking order, the message was clear: Mercedes and Ferrari are a step ahead, behind them McLaren and Red Bull seem relatively close to each other – with Oscar Piastri slightly quicker than Verstappen in Thursday’s long runs.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that not all Mercedes customer teams seemed to have used the exact same mappings as the factory team in Bahrain – an aspect Alpine alluded to. Perhaps there is still a bit more to come for the likes of McLaren in that regard.\n\nThis, however, does nothing to diminish the good impression Red Bull has made with its own power unit. Wolff described the DM01 as “the benchmark”, although that praise seemed rather politically charged. Moreover, technical director Pierre Wache explained that Red Bull had mastered certain aspects of the energy management slightly earlier than its competitors, but he was quick to add that the rest of the pack had since taken steps in the same direction.\n\nIt may not make Red Bull Powertrains the absolute benchmark, contrary to what Wolff said, but it remains impressive how that project has come out of the blocks. The power unit has proven reliable so far and Red Bull looks competitive. As Mekies rightly pointed out on Friday evening: that in itself is already quite an achievement for a newcomer.\n\nBased on early evidence, the four top teams from last year still appear to be the four top teams in 2026. With changes to both the engine and chassis regulations, in theory, the door was open for a major surprise, but a fairytale à la Brawn GP in 2009 has not materialised.\n\nSeveral factors underlie this. The most important one is that the big four still have the most potential. Yes, the budget cap is meant to ensure a level playing field, but structurally the larger outfits still retain some crucial advantages. That applies both in terms of facilities and personnel, although there is one team on the grid that should theoretically be able to match that – but more on that below.\n\nTeam by team: How Bahrain's double pre-season test went for the F1 2026 field\n\nAs for the ‘best of the rest’ position, Alpine and Haas seem to hold good cards for now. Alpine had virtually written off 2025 to perform better this season and that approach appears to be paying off, at least in the early days. The Mercedes power unit naturally helps, although team members acknowledge that its integration and adjusting the working methods after years of being a factory team will take some time. Still, Alpine seems back in a position to fight for something – and that is already an important step forward compared to last season.\n\nThe biggest loser of pre-season testing is easy to guess: Aston Martin. That message was already audible during its season launch in Saudi Arabia. From all corners at the home of title sponsor Aramco came the same line: “It’s not about where we stand in Melbourne, it’s all about our development and the second half of the season.” In Bahrain it became clear why that message was being emphasised so strongly: the team has work to do, a lot of it in fact.\n\nAn important part of that seems related to Honda. The F1 project of the Japanese brand now looks very different compared to the successful years with Red Bull. After the decision to officially quit F1 at the end of 2021, many people left or were reallocated to other R&D divisions within the company. Honda therefore largely had to rebuild the project from scratch. Add to that the integration with a new partner, and the fact that Aston Martin is now running its own gearbox for the first time, and the complexity of the whole project becomes clear.\n\nHonda ‘unhappy’ with its own F1 performance, not just reliability\n\nIn that respect it did not help that Adrian Newey, by his own admission, was only able to start late, and that the new wind tunnel with its 2026 car became operational four months later than planned. As the integration of the engine into the chassis was considered a key advantage of this partnership, that delay is now being felt in other areas. With Newey, Honda and the hyper-modern Silverstone campus, all the ingredients for long-term success appear to be in place, but if pre-season testing has made one thing clear, it is that this project will take time – perhaps a lot of time. The follow-up question is whether Fernando Alonso still has that time behind the wheel.\n\nA fear that technical directors usually express ahead of a regulation change is that the new rules might be too restrictive. This time it was said by, among others, Newey. But in practice this ruleset seems to offer enough room for distinctive designs. In pre-season, the creation of Newey himself stood out, not least because of the rather extreme suspension choices at the rear.\n\nDuring testing in Bahrain a few more interesting solutions emerged. Audi came up with completely new sidepods – a concept that differed from what the other teams had shown up to that point – and Ferrari drew attention with a rotating rear wing. Team boss Frederic Vasseur emphasised that it was a test item and that it has to be analysed whether it will be raced in Melbourne, although the FIA has confirmed that it is legal and usable if Ferrari wishes to run it.\n\nSuch creative interpretations are still possible in 2026, and that in itself is good news. It not only fits the innovative nature of the pinnacle of motorsport, but also underlines the continuous arms race between all teams. Under a new set of regulations that applies more than ever, which means this has only been the first glimpse of what will be an extreme development rate – in Australia and beyond, the pace of teams introducing new parts will remain relentless.\n\nWhile that aspect – the development race – is still “peak F1”, that does not apply, according to all drivers, to the experience behind the wheel. Verstappen voiced his objections first and in the most outspoken way. The Dutchman called F1’s new era “Formula E on steroids” and added that he did not even want to test the 2026 car in the simulator last year, simply because it felt so bad.\n\nMax Verstappen on F1 2026 flaws: ‘I already said that in 2023, but nobody listened’\n\nAlthough the overall picture cannot easily be remedied and is linked to how these regulations came about (politically) – first finalising the engine rules for Audi and Honda and only then looking at the chassis and aerodynamics – it is clear that teams are learning quickly. In terms of energy management and avoiding unnatural things, such as lifting and extra downshifting, it already looks slightly better than in Barcelona, although the real challenges are still to come.\n\nThose challenges will confront teams in Melbourne. Energy harvesting will be a much greater challenge there, as Stella explained, which may require more ‘unnatural things’ from drivers. A potential workaround could be running 300kW electric power in race trim rather than 350kW and relying on ‘super clipping’ (charging to 350kW instead of 250kW while flat-out), although the FIA wants to monitor the early races before taking any action. Until then, the hope will be that the image does not become too alienating for diehard fans. Despite teams having learned a lot, drivers’ concerns have not disappeared – certainly not for some of the tracks that are to come.\n\nThe final point is not directly related to the on-track action, but after the past few months it cannot be omitted: the political discussion about the compression ratio. While the pure racing may not be “peak F1”, the political chess game certainly is. It is alive like never before, with the Mercedes engine dominating the discussions in Bahrain.\n\nWolff has indicated that Mercedes kept the FIA “in the loop” throughout the entire development process, although the governing body nevertheless saw the need – after questions from other manufacturers – to put the compression ratio tests to a vote. If a double test is indeed introduced – one of which at a temperature of 130 degrees Celsius – that tightening will only take effect on 1 August, meaning everyone loses a little – the textbook example of an F1 compromise – and the issue will continue to simmer in the background for a while.\n\nNikolas Tombazis said on behalf of the FIA that the performance advantage is much smaller than some in the paddock suspect and that, in his view, the topic does not deserve that much attention at all. But that too is typical F1; every grey area and every potential performance differentiator – no matter how small – is fiercely contested. During the testing days in Barcelona and Bahrain many things in F1 turned out to be different, but this aspect certainly did not.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "As governments race to restrict minors’ social media use, the tech billionaires who built the platforms are imposing strict screen limits at home.",
    "fullText": "Despite building an increasingly screen-focused world, billionaire tech leaders are keeping their own children away from the tech they helped create.\n\nAs far back as 2010, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs told a New York Times reporter his kids had never used an iPad and that, “We limit how much technology our kids use at home.”\n\nSince then, the trend of Silicon Valley billionaires keeping their families away from technology has become even more pronounced, thanks in part to the rise of social media and short-form video.\n\nExcessive device use among children has become more common in recent years as busy parents turn to screens to find some peace. The trend has accelerated so much that some young children accustomed to extensive screen time are dubbed “iPad kids.” On average, children in the U.S. ages 8 to 18 spend 7.5 hours per day watching or using screens, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n\nYouTube cofounder Steve Chen said at a talk at the Stanford Graduate School of Business last year that he wouldn’t want his kids consuming only short-form content, noting that it might be better to limit kids to videos longer than 15 minutes.\n\n“Shorter-form content equates to shorter attention spans,” he said.\n\nAt the 2024 Aspen Ideas Festival, early Facebook investor and billionaire Peter Thiel joined Chen among the ranks of tech leaders who are setting strict limits on screens. Thiel said he only lets his two young children use screens for an hour-and-a-half per week, a revelation that prompted audible gasps from the audience.\n\nOther tech CEOs, including Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Snap’s Evan Spiegel, and Tesla’s Elon Musk, have also spoken about limiting their children’s access to devices. Gates has said he did not give his children smartphones until age 14 and banned phones at the dinner table entirely. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, in 2018, said he limits his child to the same 1.5 hours per week of screen time as Thiel. And finally, Musk, who bought the social media company X, formerly Twitter, in 2022, said it “might’ve been a mistake” to not set any rules on social media for his children.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who once said his own children were too young to use TikTok, clarified in 2023 that if his children lived in the U.S. and had access to the rigorous protections associated with the platform’s under-13 settings, he would let them use the app. He said even an 8-year-old could use the platform in the under-13 experience, which, among other protections, includes vetted content, no access to posting, and no advertisements.\n\nScientific research backs up their parenting instincts. A 2025 study of nearly 100,000 people found that short-form video use was consistently associated with poorer cognition and a decline in many aspects of mental health across both younger and older social media users.\n\nAs young people increasingly spend most of their waking moments online, the backlash against social media, and especially minors’ use of social media, has reached a breaking point.\n\nIn the past year, Australia and Malaysia became the first countries to ban adolescents under 16 from using social media. And several other countries, including France, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, are considering similar legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand earlier this week to defend his company against claims from a 20-year-old plaintiff that the social media giant built its platforms to hook young children.\n\nAnd yet, far from being a new phenomenon, the idea that social media use is harmful for young people has been around for years. Still, it’s the tech leaders who created the attention economy who have been the most attentive to this fact.\n\nTo be sure, several social media CEOs have publicly pushed back on claims that their platforms are harmful. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri testified earlier this month in the trial against Meta that social media does not constitute “clinical addiction.” Meta’s lawyers during the trial also outlined a range of safety features Instagram has introduced for younger users, including limits on the visibility of adult content and muted notifications at night.\n\nYet, as the trials against social media companies continue and country after country moves toward legislating what Silicon Valley’s billionaires have quietly practiced for years, the private behavior of the world’s most powerful tech figures stands in contrast to what they’re promoting and building.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Although he never worked in Big Tech, Brian Jenney earned more than he ever imagined in software development using this salary negotiation strategy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brian Jenney, 42, who lives in California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got into tech in my early 30s, I had no clue how crazy lucrative the industry was.\n\nI started as a web application developer in 2015, earning roughly $60,000 a year.\n\nOver the years, I became savvier at negotiating my salary, and by 2023, I was making over $250,000.\n\nI've earned more than I could have ever imagined, without working in Big Tech, where people often assume the big money is made.\n\nHere's what I've learned along the way.\n\nI used to have addiction issues, so I didn't really work from the ages of 25 to 30 and lost knowledge that people gain from white collar jobs at this stage of life.\n\nI was naive about the salary potential of my industry, and when people in tech said they were on $150,000, it blew my mind, and I began to feel underpaid.\n\nIn 2017, after two years in the web developer role, I landed a job at a startup. I was so impressed when I was offered $120,000 that I didn't negotiate my salary, which was dumb in retrospect.\n\nThe environment was extremely fast-paced and high-caliber. I struggled with imposter syndrome as one of the team's more junior members. I felt like one of the worst developers there and that I was already being paid more than I deserved. It discouraged me from asking for a raise.\n\nIn 2019, I joined the media intelligence company Zignal Labs. I was so happy about the job offer that I didn't negotiate the salary, so my pay initially stayed roughly the same as in my previous job. It felt like I had plateaued, even though I had more money than I needed. An unfortunate symptom of working in tech is that you get drawn to wanting more.\n\nChoosing this role turned out to be the right move, though. I had more room to grow and was in a better learning environment at a larger company.\n\nDuring the tech hiring spree of 2020, my peers said they were getting crazy offers, and I didn't want to miss out. That August, I joined The Clorox Company, a manufacturing firm, as a software engineer. By 2023, I was making over $250,000: the peak of my earnings in tech.\n\nIn 2024, I was laid off, and I've continued to work in various software engineering roles. I bought a business in 2023, and my focus has shifted to seeking out flexibility and time to build it, instead of maximizing corporate compensation.\n\nInterviews are like a carnival game where you can win big money by performing well, and you can't get to the negotiation stage without passing them. They're structured, learnable, and winnable with the right preparation.\n\nWhen I have job interviews lined up, I do technical practice and use a platform called Pramp, which pairs you with strangers for practice interviews. I've found this helps simulate the nerves and pressure of real interviews better than practicing with friends.\n\nI'll try to do at least two mock interviews before an interview I really care about.\n\nOver the years, I've benefited a lot from people in tech being open about their salaries and career paths, which helped me understand what was possible and gave me confidence to negotiate and aim higher.\n\nI've learned that salary negotiation is a game you have to play, and if you don't, you lose money.\n\nI began consistently negotiating pay in the late 2010s. I usually tell the employer that I'm really excited to start the job, but that I was hoping to come in at a higher salary range, usually 10 to 20% more.\n\nI've found this to be very effective, and it has never gone badly for me. If an employer sounds firm on their offer, I usually try to explore whether a sign-on bonus is possible instead, but I don't push aggressively beyond that.\n\nI've interviewed with but never been hired by the Big Tech companies. Besides, I like working at smaller startups and non-tech companies where I think you can have a greater impact.\n\nBig Tech employees are going to \"beat me\" on pay because their stock compensation will outpace my earnings. But I see my current lifestyle as comparable to theirs. I believe there's a reason software engineers aren't driving around Mountain View in Ferraris: they can't cash out all their stock money yet.\n\nThere's always more you can earn, but when my salary hit the $150,000 mark, I knew it was more than I needed. I'd rather prioritize jobs where I'm happy, I'm learning, and I can cover my needs while still saving. That's all I really need.\n\nDo you have a story to share about growing your salary in tech?

    "description": "Toyota’s most senior software executive has revealed that the carmaker is considering banning drivers from switching off vehicle safety features in the Combination of increasing government regulations and Toyota’s goal of zero traffic accidents are forcing hard questions about turning safety technology off",
    "fullText": "Toyota’s most senior software executive has revealed that the carmaker is considering banning drivers from switching off vehicle safety features in the future.\n\nGovernment regulations normally shape the degree of strictness a carmaker imposes, and Australian and European safety regulations in recent years have started to impose various lane keeping, speed limit awareness and driver monitoring systems in cars.\n\nAt present, those systems can typically be switched off manually at the touch of a button or swipe of a screen, if the driver deems that they would prefer to manage these processes themselves.\n\nBut Toyota software development centre president Akihiro Sarada says that the Japanese carmaker is serious about its mission of “zero traffic accidents” — not just deaths, but all car accidents.\n\n“Our ultimate goal is to eradicate all traffic accidents, and of course, autonomous driving is a technology that is necessary to realise a safe environment,” said Sarada.\n\n“We have to study and decide if we would enable an ‘off’ button.”\n\nAllowing drivers to operate the vehicle however they see fit, including by exceeding the speed limit or approaching lane markings to hit a corner apex, may not be compatible with achieving Toyota’s goal of eliminating accidents.\n\nSarada said that Toyota was considering allowing drivers to temporarily disable safety features — or drive in the manner they see fit — in two environments: on roads where the car’s software knows no other cars or pedestrians are around, and on the racetrack.\n\n“If it is safe, for example, if it is on the circuit, [autonomous driving and sporty human driving] can co-exist,” said Sarada.\n\n“In the area[s] where drivers are able to have fun driving, then we want them to have the discretion to decide the way they drive their cars.\n\n“We have to really study in detail whether or not it is really mandatory for us to control that detail, to the level where we have to forbid them to enjoy their driving.”\n\nToyota’s software boss also hinted that connected-car technology — online systems that detect other cars, pedestrians and road conditions — might even allow keen drivers to drive as they see fit on the public road, but that warnings would kick in if risks increased.\n\n“Drivers want to have excitement in driving. By using connected data, they can receive announcements that under [certain] conditions they can have more fun, that right now it is safe, but several seconds later, [if] there is a risk [they can] receive a warning beforehand,” Sarada explained.\n\nBut even this ‘leniency’ could, in theory, stop a driver from disabling safety technologies like lane-centring or speed limit controls on country roads if other cars, cyclists or particularly pedestrians are present in the area.\n\nIt’s a balancing act within Toyota between departments like Sarada’s — tasked with deploying software that reduces accidents, injury and death — and performance-arm GR, which must convince buyers that they should spend their cash on sporty, fun-to-drive cars.\n\nFor decades, Toyota has run ahead of some vehicle safety regulations. For more than 20 years, drivers and passengers in Toyota and Lexus models have been unable to input satellite navigation destinations while the vehicle is in motion.\n\nThat’s a common practice that other carmakers would typically allow, sometimes via rotary dials — often perceived as ‘safer’ to use while moving — but also often via simple touchscreen inputs.\n\nIn recent years other firms have followed Toyota’s lead on blocking some touchscreen functions while the vehicle is in motion. The two key smartphone mirroring products, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both prevent most on-screen keyboard use while driving.\n\nEuropean regulations have also started to encroach on touchscreen use via that continent’s Advanced Driver Distraction Warning requirements, which will come into force for all new vehicles registered in the EU from July 2026.\n\nEven in the EU, however, safety features — including speed warning, stability control and lane-keeping are typically allowed be switched off, though all restart at the next vehicle ignition and a driver would be held responsible for increasing the risk of a crash if a safety system is deactivated.\n\nTypically, governments — including in Australia and Europe — issue broad guidelines for how safety features should work, leaving precise implementation decisions up to carmakers.",

    "fullText": "After meeting with unspecified tech leaders, senator calls for urgent policy action as companies race to build ever more powerful systems\n\nBernie Sanders has warned that Congress and the American public have “not a clue” about the scale and speed of the coming AI revolution, pressing for urgent policy action to “slow this thing down” as tech companies race to build ever-more powerful systems.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford University on Friday alongside congressman Ro Khanna after a series of meetings with industry leaders in California, Sanders was blunt about what he called the “most dangerous moment in the modern history of this country”.\n\n“The Congress and the American people are very unprepared for the tsunami that is coming,” he said.\n\nKhanna, a progressive Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, shared Sanders’s concerns, warning that the country was experiencing a “new gilded age” run by tech billionaires who believe “they would have been heroic conquerors in a different era”.\n\n“That’s just not my observation,” Khanna said. “That’s what they tell me.”\n\nKhanna and Sanders declined to specify which tech executives they met with during the senator’s visit to California, but the congressman said it was “senior leaders” at the “most prominent tech companies”.\n\n“I think it was important for both Senator Sanders to hear from tech leaders and tech leaders to hear from Senator Sanders, who represents and understands the concerns of so many working-class Americans,” Khanna said in an interview after the event.\n\nDuring his remarks, Sanders reissued his call for a moratorium on the expansion of AI data centers to “slow down the revolution and protect workers” while policymakers catch up.\n\nKhanna does not want a moratorium, but has instead pushed to “steer” AI, advocating for the US to adopt a “Singapore model” for data center growth, with an emphasis on renewable energy and water efficiency. In his remarks before an auditorium of mostly students, Khanna outlined seven principles to guard against “oligarchic capture and dominance” of wealth generated by AI innovation.\n\n“We must ask not what America can do for Silicon Valley, but what Silicon Valley must do for America,” said the congressman, who is eyed as considering a 2028 presidential bid.\n\nThe event capped a days-long visit to California, a state he won in the 2020 presidential primary and where he returned to rally thousands during his Fight Oligarchy tour last year. In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Sanders delivered a scathing denunciation of the “greed” of the billionaire class. There he helped formally launch a campaign for a ballot initiative that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth more than $1bn – a proposal that has already prompted some ultra-wealthy tech leaders to flee, or threaten to do so.\n\nAt Stanford, Sanders focused his remarks on his concerns over how AI would impact not only the labor force but personal wellbeing and people’s ability to interact with one another. He mentioned that a restaurant in DC offered a Valentine’s Day special for people and their “AI buddies”, which drew laughs from the students.\n\nIt may seem funny, Sanders said, “but the truth is that a lot of people are becoming dependent upon AI for their emotional support. What is the long-term impact of that? What is the long-term impact if we lose work as an important part of our lives? What do we do with our lives?”\n\nSanders read statements from industry leaders who have predicted widespread automation, and cited projections that AI and robotics could eliminate tens of millions of jobs in the coming decade – from truck drivers to fast‑food workers and many white‑collar roles.\n\nPolling has found Americans are deeply concerned, as federal regulators and states debate how to impose guardrails on the nascent but fast-developing technology. A 2025 Pew survey found that 64% of the public thinks AI “will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”. Just 17% of Americans say “AI will have a very or somewhat positive impact on the United States” over the same period.\n\nThe tech CEOs leading the AI race have argued that AI will drive productivity, innovation and new kinds of employment as technological advancements have always done. But critics, like Sanders, say the “unprecedented” speed and scale of the changes threaten to enrich the “multibillionaires” while deepening inequality and leaving policymakers and the public ill-equipped to mount a response in time.\n\nSander urged his colleagues in Washington – and the public – to begin a serious public debate about the future of work as AI disrupts the economy, democracy and people’s emotional lives.\n\n“AI and robotics are neither good nor bad,” he said. “The question is: will a handful of billionaires benefit from it, or will the general public benefit?”",

    "description": "As tech CEOs predict mass job displacement, billionaire former Shark Tank star Mark Cuban just revealed the “smartest counter” to that narrative.",
    "fullText": "Despite ongoing fears that artificial intelligence could wipe out entire career fields, billionaire Mark Cuban says the concerns may be overblown—for now.\n\nThe former Shark Tank star took to X to respond to a viral clip from the All-In podcast, in which investors Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya revealed the real-world expense of deploying AI agents to enhance productivity: In some cases AI agents are costing more than $300 per day—adding up to over $100,000 annually. For Palihapitiya, founder of Social Capital, the price has forced him to rethink the budget he’s willing to give top developers, warning that otherwise, “I’ll run out of money.”\n\nHave AI-driven layoffs materialized as predicted?\n\nHow do AI agents compare to human workers currently?\n\nWhat are the actual costs of deploying AI agents?\n\nWhy does Mark Cuban think AI won't replace workers soon?\n\nFor Cuban, that reality is the “smartest counter” he has seen so far to predictions that AI will replace large numbers of workers—at least in the short term.\n\nEven if the technology is capable, he said, companies still need to prove the economics make sense, and he’s not convinced the high price tag outweighs the value humans continue to bring.\n\n“Humans have a far greater capacity to know the outcomes of their actions,” Cuban said. “Agents, and LLMs as well, never do.”\n\nAI systems still lack real-world judgment in ways that make replacing workers risky, Cuban added. He pointed to a simple example: An 18-month-old who pushes a sippy cup off a high chair quickly learns the consequences from their parents’ reaction. AI, on the other hand, lacks awareness.\n\n“Agents can tell you the sippy cup will fall,” Cuban said. “But they have no idea of the context and what will happen next.”\n\nThe technology also lacks consistency, often “spac[ing] out” and failing to recognize why and when mistakes occur, he said—a level of competency on par with the youngest Gen Z talent.\n\n“Agents are still like college interns that come in hungover, make mistakes, and don’t take responsibility for them,” he added.\n\nTaken together, Cuban’s argument suggests that the biggest obstacle to AI replacing workers may not be the technology itself—but whether companies can trust it to perform consistently at a price that makes sense.\n\nCuban declined to elaborate further after Fortune reached out for comment.\n\nDespite AI’s current flaws, business leaders continue to warn that rapid technological advances could soon reshape the workforce.\n\nDario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level jobs within one to five years. More recently, he suggested the technology could become capable of performing most jobs, if not all, in “much less than five years.”",

    "fullText": "Two memory-product entrepreneurs have seen their fortunes rocket this year thanks to heady demand from AI giants.\n\nDavid Sun, 74, and John Tu, 84, are the cofounders and 50-50 owners of Kingston Technology, a leading maker of computer drives and memory modules. Sun is the California company's operating chief, while Tu is president and CEO.\n\nThe pair have seen their respective net worths soar by 44%, or nearly $14 billion, since the start of January, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nOnly Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Czechoslovak Group CEO Michal Strnad, and Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim have gained more wealth so far this year.\n\nSun and Tu have even outpaced Jim, Alice, and Rob Walton; the heirs to the Walmart fortune were up about $13 billion each for the year at Thursday's close.\n\nThe memory magnates are both worth about $45 billion, putting them in 45th and 46th place respectively on the rich list — ahead of the likes of MacKenzie Scott, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, and Miriam Adelson.\n\nSun and Tu were born in Taiwan and mainland China, respectively, studied electrical engineering in college, and emigrated to the US in the 1970s, per Bloomberg. They met in Los Angeles, where they bonded over basketball and went into business together.\n\nThe pair founded a memory-device company, Camintonn, in 1982, and sold it four years later for $6 million, Bloomberg says. They lost all their savings in the Black Monday crash of 1987, but went on to found Kingston and sell 80% of it to SoftBank for $1.5 billion in 1996. They bought back the stake for $450 million in 1999.\n\nAI hyperscalers have been clamoring for memory chips to build out data centers, fueling a severe global shortage that has driven prices skyward.\n\nThis \"memory supercycle\" promises to boost revenues and profits at memory-product companies, which has propelled their stock prices in recent months.\n\nFor example, Micron Technology stock has more than quadrupled over the past 12 months, valuing the memory-chip maker at $470 billion — more than Mastercard, Oracle, Costco, Bank of America, or Home Depot are worth.",

    "title": "Now That Trump's Tariffs Have Been Ruled Illegal, Will Tech Prices Lower?",
    "description": "It's not clear whether prices will come down now that these tariffs are ending.",
    "fullText": "It's official: Most of President Trump's tariffs are illegal. The Supreme Court struck down the president's signature economic orders on Friday in a 6-3 ruling, spelling the end of a controversial policy that added an estimated $1,000 tax increase for each American household, raised prices on consumer goods, and alienated key U.S. allies.\n\nNot all of Trump's tariffs need to end because of this ruling. The court acknowledged that presidents have the power to \"unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope.\" Instead, the court found that tariffs enacted based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) were done so improperly, as the administration \"points to no statute\" from Congress that says the IEEPA could be used for tariffs. That means tariffs against steel and aluminum could continue, since those were enacted from other laws, but both the \"reciprocal\" tariffs placed against other countries, and the flat 25% tariff placed on goods from countries like Canada, China, and Mexico, cannot currently stand.\n\nThat raises a lot of questions. Will the Trump administration seek to impose these tariffs through other means, avoiding the IEEPA altogether? Will companies that have paid tariffs already get their money back? And, perhaps most pressing to the average consumer, will prices for common goods, like tech, finally come down?\n\nThere's no clear answer to this one, since there's really no precedent here. Trump is the first president to use the IEEPA as a reasoning to enact tariffs, and, as such, this is an enormous flip-flop that doesn't have a previous framework to look back to.\n\nThe reason tariffs are inflationary, or raise prices on goods, is because they make it more expensive for U.S. companies to import foreign goods. People can confuse this point: Tariffs place a tax on the importer of a good, not necessarily the manufacturer of that good. When a company exports its products to the U.S. with a tariff in place, it does not directly pay the tariff: The company that imports those products pays. As a result, importers raise their prices to compensate. Look at Nintendo: The company raised its original MSRPs for Switch 2 accessories like the Pro Controller and Joy-Con 2, as well as the original Switch, in the wake of tariffs. As these products cost more to import to the U.S., prices go up to give the company a cushion. It could've been worse, too, since Nintendo didn't raise the price of the Switch 2 or its games—though there's no telling whether those MSRPs were set with tariffs in mind, too.\n\nAs such, you might expect that if these tariffs disappear, these prices will come down. If Nintendo felt the need to raise Pro Controller prices by $15 in response to tariffs, it might reverse course now that Trump's tax is no longer placing a burden on U.S. importers. While anything's possible, I don't think it's very likely. For many goods, prices can rise quickly, especially with factors like tariffs, but can take a long time to fall—if at all. Some economists think that ending tariffs would cause prices to rise slower, but not stop: a disinflationary effect, rather than deflationary.\n\nWe the consumer may be to blame. If companies raise prices in response to tariffs, and consumers continue to buy those products regardless, it shows that the market supports those prices. The consumer doesn't necessarily see the impact of the tariff going away, so why lower prices? It's only in that company's best interest anyway, since they'll sell goods at higher prices without paying the tariff tax. If the company was struggling to sell inflated goods, perhaps prices will come down: If Nintendo is selling far fewer Switch units following its tariff increases, maybe it'll cut the price back down to encourage sales. But it's truly difficult to say without being on the inside.\n\nThen, of course, there are the forces at play that push prices north besides tariffs. Computer components come to mind, particularly RAM. These components are becoming more expensive—and harder to find—not necessarily because of tariffs, but because AI companies are scooping them up for data processing. All of a sudden, everything that runs on these components is at risk of rising in price, since one section of the market has such a high demand. It doesn't matter if RAM is cheaper to import next month after tariffs are gone, if there's no RAM left to buy.\n\nThat means your gaming consoles, laptops, smart displays, cars—anything that runs on RAM, GPUs, and CPUs—could rise in price, unless more components can be made to meet demand. SCOTUS might've taken the burden of tariffs away from these imports, but it might not bring prices down, or, worse yet, do anything to stop them skyrocketing. Micron, the only American-based producer of RAM, didn't think memory shortages would end this year, even ahead of the tariff news. The company is investing in more facilities to produce components, but that takes time, which means price increases could continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe can speculate all day about how the end of these tariffs will affect prices, but it's just that: speculation. Companies will do what they're going to do with the prices, and there's nothing in the Supreme Court's ruling to tell us whether our iPhones, Switches, or Echos are going to be cheaper later this year or not. Prices could plummet, come down slightly, stay the same, go up slowly, or go up quickly. My best guess is that the average consumer product previously affected by these tariffs will stay about the same price it is now, barring some other major change in the markets—but again, that's just a guess.\n\nAs such, my advice is to make your purchase decisions based on other, more stable factors: Research the products you're interested in to determine which has the best value; compare prices across different stores, both in-person and online; wait for traditional sales events if you're looking for major deals.\n\nThe most concrete risk of price increases right now comes from that computer-component shortage. If you've been in the market for a new computer, or a device that relies heavily on these components (like gaming consoles), it might be a good time to buy. Prices can easily go up, but take a long time to come back down.",

    "fullText": "Narendra Modi’s thirst to supercharge economic growth is matched by US desire to inject AI into world’s biggest democracy\n\nIndia celebrates 80 years of independence from the UK in August 2027. At about that same moment, “early versions of true super intelligence” could emerge, Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, said this week.\n\nIt’s a looming coincidence that raised a charged question at the AI Impact summit in Delhi, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi: can India avoid returning to the status of a vassal state when it imports AI to raise the prospects of its 1.4 billion people?\n\nModi’s hunger to harness AI’s capability is great. He compared it on Thursday to a turning point that resets the direction of civilisation, such as “when the first sparks were struck from stone”. The most common analogy heard among the thousands of visitors to the summit was the dawn of electricity, but Modi was talking about fire.\n\nHis desire to use AI to supercharge Indian economic growth is matched by that of the big US tech companies. OpenAI, Google and Anthropic all played prominent roles at the summit, announcing deals to get ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude AIs into more people’s hands.\n\nThe Trump administration, seeing AI as central to its battle for supremacy with China, was clearing the path for the three AI companies. The US government signed the Pax Silica, a technology agreement that binds India closer to US tech and away from Beijing.\n\nAt the signing, Jacob Helberg, the US under secretary of state for economic affairs, emphasised the threat from China if India should even think about looking elsewhere for its AI. “We have seen the lights of a great Indian city extinguished by a keystroke,” he said, in an apparent reference to a suspected Chinese cyber-attack on Mumbai in 2020.\n\nIndia lacks the semiconductors, power plants and vast gigawatt datacentres to go it alone. In common with most other countries, it faces a choice between US and Chinese AI models. Which they choose could have profound consequences for who controls India’s future, because if AI’s power emerges as predicted, it will not only tweak economic and social structures, but become their new bedrock.\n\nStuart Russell, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, who closely follows India’s progress, said: “If we get to AGI [artificial general intelligence], AI is going to be producing 80% of the global economy. All manufacturing, most agriculture, all services will be just done; managed by AI, produced by AI.”\n\nImagine, he said, an Indian village priced out of having a health centre. In the future, AI could design the hospital and “along comes a bunch of giant quad copters carrying the materials, and a bunch of robots come and assemble everything. Two weeks later, you’ve got a hospital.”\n\nIn this scenario, technology becomes integral to a country’s wellbeing. Elements of sovereignty can be fought over, but how successful that will be remains to be seen. AI’s power is such that its controller gains enormous leverage.\n\nAnthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, told the summit: “It may sound absurd, but AI can even help India achieve a standout 25% economic growth.” If that were to happen, it would take India to a per-capita GDP in a decade that is equivalent to Greece today. How could a leader resist?\n\nModi’s tech secretary, Shri Krishnan, said India realised it must ally with like-minded countries to ensure it did not become “enslaved”. It is a high-stakes decision.\n\nIndia appears unlikely to turn to China, for now. It has the AI models, but there are tensions on the Himalayan border, and Chinese companies and leaders were scarce at the summit.\n\nWill India thrive with US AI? Silicon Valley companies talk of cooperation not control. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global policy, said: “We don’t see India as a customer, we see it as a strategic partner.”\n\nUS officials framed the deal with India as an alliance of two nations that “broke centuries of colonial rule”, and as “two great democracies saying we will build together”.\n\nThe Guardian asked Michael Kratsios, Donald Trump’s science and technology adviser, if India risked being controlled by the US under a form of digital colonialism.\n\n“I would say it is actually the opposite,” he said. “Any country that builds on top of the American AI stack will have the most open, independently controlled, secured stack the world has to offer. And that is why we are soon keen to share it with so many countries that are prioritising their AI sovereignty.”\n\nRussell sees another possibility. “I think the American companies want to get in at that high-school and middle-school level to create basically a bunch of AI addicts who can’t tie their shoelaces without the help of AI,” he said. “Silicon Valley has always been about eyeballs. You monetise later and it works. Google and Facebook generate vast amounts of money.”\n\nCould India build its own AI? It is investing billions in datacentres and semiconductor capacity, but it takes years to come online.\n\nAltman was asked on Thursday how Indian entrepreneurs could build their own AI and his response was blunt. “Look, the way this works is we’re going to tell you it’s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation and you shouldn’t even try, and it’s your job to try anyway and I believe both of those things.”\n\nIndia can press US tech companies to adapt their AIs to its kaleidoscope of languages and cultures, and attempt to insist on guardrails. There is much at stake. As the summit came to a close, Joanna Shields, a former Facebook and Google executive and a UK minister for internet safety, warned: “If we have a world where we are accepting models from just the global north, we will lose so much of our cultural diversity, our uniqueness as people, wherever we come from … We don’t want to develop a monoculture based on a handful of models that everybody uses around the world and we lose that richness of who we are, what makes us human.”",

    "fullText": "Matthew Ramirez started at Western Governors University as a computer science major in 2025, drawn by the promise of a high-paying, flexible career as a programmer. But as headlines mounted about tech layoffs and AI’s potential to replace entry-level coders, he began to question whether that path would actually lead to a job.\n\nWhen the 20-year-old interviewed for a datacenter technician role that June and never heard back, his doubts deepened. In December, Ramirez decided on what he thought was a safer bet: turning away from computer science entirely. He dropped his planned major to instead apply to nursing school. He comes from a family of nurses, and sees the field as more stable and harder to automate than coding.\n\n“Even though AI might not be at the point where it will overtake all these entry-level jobs now, by the time I graduate, it likely will,” Ramirez said.\n\nRamirez is not alone in reshaping his career out of anxiety over AI. As students like him are reconsidering their majors over concerns that AI may disrupt their employment prospects, more established workers – some with decades of experience – are rethinking their trajectories because they’re encountering AI at work and share the same unease. Some workers are eschewing it entirely; others are embracing it.\n\nIt’s not clear when AI will become advanced enough to replace certain white-collar workers and just how many jobs it will be capable of taking over. But jitters around its potential impact are already pushing people to change course, reshaping the labor market before automation fully arrives.\n\nWhat is clear is why workers are feeling on edge. The World Economic Forum projects that AI could displace 92m roles worldwide by 2030, including many white-collar positions. In the US, employers cited AI as a factor in nearly 55,000 job cuts in 2025, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a consulting firm, as job seekers navigate a tougher market.\n\nWhile AI is still just one factor among many that are leading to layoffs, ADP, the largest payroll company in the US, found that professional and business services roles, alongside information services jobs in media, telecom and IT, collectively lost 41,000 jobs in December 2025. In that same month, employment grew in healthcare, education and hospitality, per the firm’s data.\n\nMany of those white-collar roles involve writing, data analysis and coding – tasks generative AI tools can increasingly perform. Hands-on, people-facing work remains less exposed.\n\nJobs that emphasize interpersonal and hands-on skills are increasingly appealing to young people who are wary of automation, according to Dr Jasmine Escalera, a career development expert at Zety, a professional development platform.\n\nShe pointed to research showing that 43% of gen Z workers who are anxious about AI are moving away from entry-level corporate and administrative roles and toward careers that rely on what she calls “human skills”, including creativity, interpersonal connection and hands-on expertise.\n\nIn that same report, 53% of young respondents said they were seriously considering blue-collar or skilled trade work. Escalera said it was a move that workers were making to reduce their exposure to AI and one that the Wall Street Journal, the paper of record of white-collar work, had recently urged its readers to consider.\n\nBut the pivot may come with sacrifices. Many of the white-collar roles that workers worry could be automated – from software development to financial analysis – are paid median salaries well above $75,000 a year, with developers raking in about $133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Blue-collar jobs pay less. Many skilled trades, like electricians and plumbers, receive closer to $60,000 a year. These types of jobs also often require in-person work, physical labor and less predictable schedules – all trade-offs workers may accept in their attempts to future-proof their careers.\n\nFor some job seekers, any mention of AI is a red flag in job listings, so they’re skipping them entirely.\n\nAfter getting laid off last January, Roman Callaghan, 30, spent nine months hunting for his next job. As a medical coder at a medication access firm for four years, Callaghan handled administrative tasks like calling insurance providers and entering medical data. After his employer started rolling out AI across the company to streamline workflows, he wondered whether the move would one day affect his job. When he was laid off two years later, he suspected his fears had come true, though his employer didn’t specifically cite AI as a reason.\n\nWhen he looked for new work, he avoided any roles that mentioned phrases like “integrating AI”, “AI-first” or “developing AI” in job descriptions. Callaghan wanted a new job, but his AI anxiety steered him away from roles that now felt short-term to him. He just didn’t want to risk being laid off again because a future employer would eventually use AI to cull its ranks.\n\nIn the past nine months, he said, he applied to at least 100 jobs across data entry, medical coding, call centers and paralegal work, while deliberately skipping 30 to 40 postings that referenced AI. While he searched, he took odd gigs to make ends meet, first at a local fish store and later at a call center. He stayed there until mid-October, when he landed a data entry job.\n\nAvoiding AI-centric jobs “felt like it narrowed the amount of companies I could work for”, Callaghan said. “Even though my options were limited, sticking to my convictions felt worth it.”\n\n​​Recruiters say that kind of avoidance is becoming more common. Marshall Scabet, the CEO of Precision Sales Recruiting, which helps manufacturers hire sales professionals, said that roughly a quarter of sales candidates he spoke with over the past six months were trying to pivot away from software-as-a-service (SaaS) jobs.\n\nMany clients told him they worried their tech sales roles could be replaced by AI, Scabet said, and believed selling industrial equipment was safer from automation. Doing so, he said, requires building human relationships with vendors.\n\n“In their opinion, there was less likelihood of that job being taken by AI,” Scabet said. “AI isn’t just going to walk into a factory and give a pitch about a machine.”\n\nFor more experienced workers, their encounters with AI in the workplace are pushing them to reconsider entire industries or build new skill sets.\n\nLiam Robinson, a 45-year-old animation artist, says he is actively avoiding jobs in the mobile gaming industry he has worked in for more than a decade. In his last role as an art director, his employer encouraged staff to use generative AI to speed up production. Robinson, who refused to use AI in his own work, said he watched the quality of animation suffer around him as his colleagues began relying on the tech.\n\nLast September, after disclosing in a self-evaluation survey that he wasn’t using AI, Robinson was laid off. It left him disillusioned with the direction of the industry. He believes AI flattens creativity, erodes craftsmanship and hurts the environment, fueling his resistance to work for companies building or deploying it.\n\nHe is not actively applying for new roles and instead is focused on creating webtoon comics. But if money runs dry, he said, he would take on other work, from driving for Uber to trash disposal. “As long as I’m useful and making a little money, that’s enough,” Robinson said.\n\nAs professionals like Robinson confront the possibility that skills they spent years mastering are no longer highly valued, many are redefining what stability looks like, according to Arianny Mercedes, founder of the career strategy firm Revamped.\n\nRather than chasing prestige or high salaries, Mercedes said her job-seeking clients increasingly prioritize roles tied to regulated or essential parts of an organization, such as healthcare administration, education or compliance.\n\n“The objective isn’t to avoid AI,” Mercedes said. “It’s to be in roles where AI changes the tools of work without undermining authority or decision-making.”\n\nFor others, the safest response to AI is to lean into it.\n\nAfter designing and developing websites for four years, Dmitry Zozulya decided to leave his work behind. As AI tools have proliferated and make it possible to code and create branding at a fraction of what it used to cost, the 29-year-old found it increasingly difficult to sell website and landing page work.\n\nInstead, Zozulya began offering AI-driven automation services, helping businesses streamline workflows. He now runs a small consultancy while building personal projects to deepen his experience.\n\n“I believe it’s very important to adapt,” Zozulya said. “Even when it’s uncomfortable.”\n\nWhether the rise of AI is steering workers away from entire industries or just certain roles, it is disrupting many people’s calculus for what their future at work will look like – and it’s happening abruptly.\n\nFor Ramirez, that recalculation began before he had even entered the workforce. He believes switching from computer science to nursing means he’ll find work after graduation, even if it means letting go of the future he once imagined.\n\n“When you throw AI into the picture, the likelihood of healthcare jobs disappearing is slim as of right now,” Ramirez said. “I can’t speak for the future, but in the next few years, they’re still going to be there.”",

    "description": "The discourse around \"taste\" as a future-proof skill seemed inescapable in recent days, as tech leaders from Paul Graham to Greg Brockman weighed in.",
    "fullText": "Good news, connoisseurs — your judgment may be highly prized in the AI age.\n\nA debate about the importance of \"taste\" has seemed inescapable on X in recent days, prompting bold declarations, a fair share of eye-rolling, and, yes, plenty of memes.\n\nBut there might be some truth to the idea.\n\nThe most recent wave of taste discourse began when Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham — who coined \"founder mode\" — posted a prediction on Saturday.\n\n\"When anyone can make anything, the big differentiator is what you choose to make,\" Graham wrote on X.\n\nThis wasn't Graham's first time writing about the importance of taste; in his post over the weekend, he linked to an old essay of his from 2002, titled \"Taste for Makers,\" and he also wrote about the topic again in 2021.\n\nThen, OpenAI's president weighed in.\n\nOpenAI president Greg Brockman went even stronger, declaring, \"Taste is a new core skill.\"\n\nA variety of leaders across Silicon Valley also came out in support of the benefits of cultivating taste. As engineers grow into managing more agents and making more decisions, having strong judgment skills (or \"taste,\" as they'd call it) could be crucial.\n\nCloudflare CTO Dane Knecht agreed with Graham and linked back to an earlier post he'd written in January that stated, \"In 2026, taste is the engineering differentiator.\"\n\nEngineers across the industry chimed in. \"The AI will make anything but it takes human taste to decide if it's worth keeping,\" one Google software engineer wrote.\n\nWhat even is taste? The term is slippery.\n\n\"The taste thing works because it's nebulous, unassailable, and it feeds the ego,\" Poggio cofounder Matt Slotnick wrote on X, weighing in on the discourse.\n\nGraham gave one glimpse, writing that it was about \"being honest with yourself\" and moving beyond the mindset of \"I like what I like.\"\n\nNot everyone agreed that taste would become a future-proof skill of the future. Linear head of product Nan Yu wrote that \"you probably don't have better taste than AI.\"\n\n\"There are plenty of other distinctly human things that we can contribute, but 'having better taste' isn't one of them,\" he wrote.\n\nMatt Schumer, the author of the viral \"Something Big is Happening\" essay on AI, agreed.\n\n\"There's a good chance AI will have better ideas than us within a few years,\" he wrote. \"I don't see why \"taste\" and direction are uniquely human, like many people say. If an AI can train on it, it can learn it.\"\n\nThere's another high-profile figure who championed taste (and basically built his career around it): Def Jam cofounder Rick Rubin.\n\nThere's an interview making the rounds of Rubin, in which he says he has \"no technical ability\" when it comes to music. Anderson Cooper asks what he's being paid for. Rubin responds: \"The confidence that I have in my taste.\"\n\nIs that what software engineers will soon look like? Several meme accounts on X seem to think so, commenting photos of Rubin's bearded face on Brockman's post.\n\nSoftware engineers in 2030 be like pic.twitter.com/Vmfx8Qydzg\n\nIt also begs the question: Do engineers even have good taste to begin with? The answer depends on who you ask — and how you define taste.\n\nGeneral Catalyst creative director Reggie James wrote that techies would be \"ruffled\" when they learn they're not the top of the taste pyramid.\n\nStripe alum Sam Gerstenzan wrote that taste was \"so rare\" in Silicon Valley that, if asked to name the five people with the best taste, everyone would name the same people.\n\nits almost like these tech guys understand that they dont have good taste so they are trying to turn it into this quantifiable set of data points instead of this mysterious, ineffable quality derived from going out and engaging with culture!\n\nThe irony, of course, is that tech bros aren't known to have the best taste in one specific arena: style.\n\nThe same people prizing taste are wearing backpacks to the bar, Very AI growth head Abril Zucchi wrote. Another user shared a \"Person in tech that has 'taste' starter pack.\"\n\nPerson in tech that has “taste” starter pack https://t.co/jQw0PYESAM pic.twitter.com/4gPjDWAZOB\n\nThe sneaker brand Allbirds was a popular punching bag.\n\n\"'Taste is the new core skill' says men who kept Allbirds afloat,\" Vercel CMO Keith Messick wrote.\n\n“in the ai era, taste is the new core skill” pic.twitter.com/1vsvJZmnK8\n\nGraham responded to one of the memes, which showed \"taste\" as a polo and cargo shorts.\n\n\"Taste in clothing isn't important,\" he wrote. \"If your goal is to think well, clothing should just be as comfortable as possible.\"\n\nRick Rubin — famous for his disheveled, DGAF appearance — would likely agree.",

    "title": "PwC engineers built an AI agent to tackle the corporate world's least sexy task: spreadsheets",
    "description": "When tech exec Matt Wood arrived at PwC, he found that massive spreadsheets were \"all anybody was working on.\"",
    "fullText": "The real way to judge a company's AI expertise isn't in the flashy headlines, but by looking at the \"unsexy\" work rolling out behind the scenes, Matt Wood, PwC's global and US commercial technology and innovation officer, told Business Insider.\n\nIf Wood's theory holds — that real AI prowess shows up in unglamorous advances — PwC's latest launch is certainly notable. After all, what could be less sexy than spreadsheets?\n\nThe Big Four firm announced this week that it has developed a \"frontier AI agent\" capable of reasoning over vast, enterprise-grade spreadsheets — something that conventional AI systems struggle with because of their complexity, size, and interdependencies.\n\nThe agent can understand and navigate spreadsheets, mimicking \"how experienced practitioners work: scanning, searching, jumping across tabs, integrating charts and receipts, and reasoning,\" PwC said in a press release.\n\nWood, who joined PwC in 2024 from a role as vice president of AI at Amazon Web Services, said that when he started, he'd noticed the wraparound, ultra-wide monitors filled with spreadsheets: \"That's all anybody was working on,\" he said.\n\nBut these were not \"your school soccer team budget spreadsheet,\" said Wood. The spreadsheets that power large enterprises are enormously complex, often containing millions of cells, charts, graphs, images, receipts, and dozens of interlinked workbooks. \"They are more like financial engines than they are spreadsheets,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThese files often underpin business-critical decisions, yet PwC \"found that even today's modern AI was very poorly suited to managing these big enterprise spreadsheets,\" Wood said.\n\n\"They just kind of shrug and give up for want of a better word.\"\n\nCreating an AI capable of understanding and reasoning across large, complicated spreadsheet applications is what PwC's engineers set out to solve. Their solution was a \"genuine advance in the field,\" Wood said.\n\nThe agent has unlocked use cases across assurance, advisory, and tax, and boosts time saving on some tasks \"from literally days to hours,\" said Wood.\n\nHe gave the example of audit walkthroughs, where teams previously spent weeks manually gathering and validating evidence across numerous complex spreadsheets that existing AI tools couldn't handle.\n\nNow, users simply upload the files, and the frontier agent automatically maps their structure, extracts relevant data, and performs validation and consistency checks — tasks that would otherwise require combing through millions of rows by hand.\n\nThe result is faster meetings, less back-and-forth with clients, and cleaner, structured data ready for deeper AI-driven analysis, he said.\n\nPwC's AI spreadsheet agent was built in-house by engineers — a function the firm has been rapidly expanding as it shifts beyond the traditional roles associated with the Big Four.\n\nIn January, PwC launched a dedicated tech engineering career track to attract more technical talent, saying it wants to become \"a destination for top engineering talent.\"\n\nPreviously, the firm offered only consulting and accounting career paths. Wood told Business Insider that adding the engineering track is \"a signpost\" of its future plans.\n\nAt the same time, PwC is retraining non-technical employees. The US branch of the firm recently announced a companywide workplace learning strategy focused on knowledge sharing and on developing a mix of human and AI skills needed for the future.\n\nWood described the work engineers do at PwC as having two modes: \"transforming today\" and \"building for tomorrow.\"\n\nThe first focuses on improving current workflows — reducing back-and-forth with clients, increasing trust, and delivering work more efficiently. The second reimagines professional services from scratch: \"If you were to start from a blank piece of paper, what would professional services look like in an AI agent world?\" said Wood.\n\nPwC engineers also work directly on client engagements, building AI systems tailored to specific projects. For example, they help organizations reorganize and redesign their finance functions from the ground up using agents, Wood said.\n\nMany of the consulting industry's top players are pursuing similar investments in technical talent as AI reshapes the work they do.\n\nAccenture, already one of consulting's most technically sophisticated players, has added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global headcount.\n\nEY, another Big Four firm, has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday invited leaders of some of the top artificial intelligence companies to gather on stage as part of a commitment to build more “inclusive and multilingual” AI around the world.\n\nAnd they did. But what caught some of the audience's attention, and later went viral on social media, was an awkward interaction between two rival tech leaders: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.\n\nModi, host of the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, clasped hands with those closest to him — Altman to his left and Google CEO Sundar Pichai to his right — and beckoned all 13 tech leaders to lift their hands up in a chain, like theater actors at the end of a show.\n\nEveryone was holding hands except for Altman and Amodei, who stood next to each other but for several seconds awkwardly avoided hand contact. Both eventually put up their fists instead.\n\nThe interaction quickly became a visual symbol of the deep rivalries in the AI industry, particularly between OpenAI and Anthropic, though Altman sought to brush off any deeper meaning.\n\n“I didn't know what was happening,” Altman later said in a video interview with Indian media outlet Moneycontrol. He said he was “confused, like when (Modi) grabbed my hand and put it up, and I just wasn’t sure what we were supposed to be doing.”\n\nThe two AI developers have a history, one that predates the creation of OpenAI's hit product, ChatGPT, and Anthropic's competing chatbot Claude.\n\nAmodei worked at OpenAI before he and a group that included his sister, Daniela Amodei, quit to form Anthropic in 2021. The newer company promised a clearer focus on the safety of the better-than-human technology called artificial general intelligence that both San Francisco firms aim to build.\n\nOpenAI first released ChatGPT in late 2022, revealing the huge commercial potential of AI large language models that could help write emails and computer code and answer questions. Anthropic followed with its first version of Claude in 2023.\n\nTheir different approaches spilled over into public debate earlier this month in the United States when Anthropic aired TV commercials during the Super Bowl that ridiculed OpenAI for the digital advertising it’s beginning to place in free and cheaper versions of ChatGPT.\n\nWhile Anthropic has centered its revenue model on selling Claude to other businesses, OpenAI has opened the doors to ads as a way of making money from the hundreds of millions of consumers who get ChatGPT for free. Altman took to social media to criticize the TV commercials as dishonest.\n\nO'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.",

    "description": "Some economists are warning there’s no sign of AI-related job displacement appearing in the labor data. Altman claimed it’s just a matter of time until it does.",
    "fullText": "As debate continues over AI’s true impact on the labor force, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said some companies are engaging in “AI washing” when it comes to layoffs, or falsely attributing workforce reductions to the technology’s impact.\n\n“I don’t know what the exact percentage is, but there’s some AI washing where people are blaming AI for layoffs that they would otherwise do, and then there’s some real displacement by AI of different kinds of jobs,” Altman told CNBC-TV18 at the India AI Impact Summit on Thursday.\n\nAI washing has gained traction as emerging data on the tech’s impact on the labor market tells a muddied, inconclusive story about how the technology is destroying human jobs—or if it has yet to touch them.\n\nA study published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, found that of thousands of surveyed C-suite executives across the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Australia, nearly 90% said AI had no impact on workplace employment over the past three years following the late-2022 release of ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, prominent tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have warned of a white-collar bloodbath, with AI potentially wiping out 50% of entry-level office jobs. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski suggested this week the buy-now, pay-later firm would reduce its 3,000-person workforce by one-third by 2030 in part because of the acceleration of AI. Around 40% of employers expect to follow Siemiatkowski’s lead in culling staff down the line as a result of AI, according to the 2025 World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report.\n\nAltman clarified he anticipates more job displacement as a result of AI, as well as the emergence of new roles complementing the technology.\n\n“We’ll find new kinds of jobs, as we do with every tech revolution,” he said. “But I would expect that the real impact of AI doing jobs in the next few years will begin to be palpable.”\n\nData from a recent Yale Budget Lab report suggests Altman and Amodei’s vision of mass worker displacement from AI is not certain and is not yet here. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Population Survey, the research found no significant differences in the rate of change of occupations mix or length of unemployment for individuals with jobs that have high exposure to AI from the release of ChatGPT through November 2025. The numbers suggested no significant AI-related labor changes at this juncture.\n\n“No matter which way you look at the data, at this exact moment, it just doesn’t seem like there’s major macroeconomic effects here,” Martha Gimbel, executive director and cofounder of the Yale Budget Lab, told Fortune earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "In 2026, it’s a scary time to work for a living.\n\nGone are the days of quiet quitting, the Great Resignation, and the highly visible union-organizing battles that began the decade and signaled that perhaps worker power was on the rise again in the US. Instead, much of that momentum is being crowded out of our minds by anxieties: a worsening affordability crisis, geopolitical instability, and the specter of artificial intelligence looming over the workplace.\n\nFor the tech CEOs leading the AI race and enriching themselves as they jostle for dominance, AI isn’t a phantasm at all, but a glimmering unicorn. When they predict AI is just months away from being able to do everything a software engineer does, or that it will one day take over CEOs’ jobs, their excitement for the future is palpable. For the rest of us, it’s hard to feel confident in their offhand remarks about how “some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs will be created”. A 2025 Pew survey found that “64% of the public thinks AI will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”, which is probably why only 17% of Americans say AI will have a positive effect on the US over the same time period.\n\nUncertain times like these call for scrutiny. Throughout 2026, the Guardian will publish Reworked, a reporting series that centers the human stakes as AI disrupts our workplaces, in ways both thrilling and alarming. Like this essay, the stories in this series will focus on workers’ real-world power and plights as well as the realities and exaggerations of the hype surrounding AI’s transformative possibilities.\n\nSo which version of the future of work awaits us? It is yet to be settled, which means there is still time to shift course.\n\nBlue-collar workers who have long grappled with algorithmic surveillance and optimization at work are now worrying that technological advancements will only make their jobs more dehumanizing. “[For] lower wage workers, there is concern about being replaced by robots. But on the other hand, there’s a lot of concern about being turned into robots,” Lisa Kresge, a senior researcher at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, told me.\n\nAnd white-collar workers are now wondering if their work will begin to resemble blue-collar labor – either because they will be similarly tracked and managed, or because they will need to switch to more manual work that’s resistant to being taken over by AI.\n\nIt may seem that workers haven’t been this vulnerable in a long time. In some ways, that’s true. But this is also a pivotal moment, one in which something unexpected is happening: society’s collective anxiety over AI is catalyzing workers to push back.\n\n“It is creating an opportunity,” Sarita Gupta, the Ford Foundation’s Vice President of US Programs and co-author of The Future We Need: Organizing for a Better Democracy in the Twenty-First Century, told me. “When you have a young Silicon Valley software engineer realize that their performance is tracked or undermined by the same logic as a working class warehouse picker, class divisions dissolve, and larger working-class movements for dignity are possible. That is what we’re starting to see.”\n\nPeople across industries and income brackets are anxious and frustrated, quite like they were when the Covid pandemic placed punishing demands on frontline workers and erased the boundaries between work and life for everyone else. Those struggles prompted power shifts: At the same time that workers led unionization efforts at Amazon warehouses and Starbucks locations around the US, the Great Resignation saw a record number of employees quit their jobs, and the ones who remained in the workforce began negotiating for and gaining better pay and conditions.\n\n“It was not a pretty time for a lot of workers. And so part of the resurgence of labor organizing from that period of time was in response to a lot of fears,” Kresge said.\n\nShe also sees the rise of AI as an opening for the labor movement to regain some of the power it’s lost after decades of attacks from employers. “I’m hopeful about the opportunity for technology to lift up some of the issues that have been under way in our economy for decades … in terms of how workers are treated and how we are distributing the rewards of productivity.”\n\nConditions for workers have been rough for a long while now. “Over time, unions have lost collective bargaining power, and a lot of that is due to the lack of laws that we need and enforcement of laws,” Gupta said. “For four decades, productivity soared while wages stayed flat, and unionization hit historic lows.” In 2025, only 9.9% of US workers were union members – the same percentage as 2024, but still the lowest numbers in almost 40 years.\n\nToday, the advent of AI is drawing the world’s attention to the extreme imbalance of power between employers and their employees – and people are getting worked up. Even if the outcomes are still undetermined, that’s a glimmer of possibility in bleak times.\n\nAI is still a nascent technology. Many of the predictions about what it will be capable of and how it will transform labor and the economy are just that – predictions. The question of worker power in the age of AI hasn’t been decided yet, even if billionaire CEOs with a vested interest in the unregulated dominance of AI keep implying that it has.\n\n“There is a concerted effort among many tech leaders to basically create mystification around AI as a tactic, to a large extent, to disempower workers, policymakers, and anyone who might be critical of the growing concentration of funding and resources in our society toward this goal,” Kresge told me.\n\nIn other words, take what these billionaires say with a grain of salt. The rise of AI is already transforming society, the economy, and our relationship to work, but a lot of these shifts are anticipatory, based on our belief in the potential of a technology that’s still being built.\n\n“We have to always remind ourselves that the direction of technology is a choice, right? We can use AI to build a surveillance economy that squeezes every drop of value out of a worker, or we can use it to build an era of shared prosperity,” Gupta said. “We know if technology were designed and deployed and governed by the people doing the work, AI wouldn’t be such a threat.”",

    "fullText": "In Wednesday’s ACC Action, Virginia clocked Georgia Tech, 94-68, and Wake Forest surprised Clemson, 85-77.\n\nWake Forest basically dominated the entire game. A week or two ago, who would have expected that?\n\nWell, here’s something you may have missed – Clemson has lost three straight, to Virginia Tech, Duke and now Wake Forest. And all three losses were by double figures. Prior to this, the Tigers were 13-1 in their last 14 games. Brad Brownell has work to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Wake Forest, despite not really having anyone inside to speak of, is catching fire late. Too late, probably, but it’s still impressive that the Deacs have won three straight.\n\nSteve Forbes has continued to tinker with his lineup. In this one, he went with Tre’Von Spillers, Cooper Schwieger and Sebastian Akins up front and Juke Harris and Myles Colvin the backcourt. Harris led the way with 20 points.\n\nJake Wahlin paced the Tigers with 17.\n\nAs for Virginia, remember that scene in Braveheart when Longshanks realizes that if Wallace can take York, he can get the rest of England?\n\nVirginia shot up 39-9 in the first half. Obviously, the game was over at that point. Georgia Tech gave up 59 points in the first half, en route to losing their eighth straight game.\n\nThe question isn’t really how bad it was. The question is the fallout. NC State got nuked at Louisville two games ago but bounced back nicely against UNC and is still on target for a tournament bid. Meanwhile, Georgia Tech is on target to miss the ACC Tournament, since the bottom three teams won’t go anymore.\n\nHowever, it could still escape this fate as BC and Pitt also have just two ACC wins. We’ll see.\n\nThe other question is this: was it because the Yellow Jackets are really bad or because Virginia is really good?\n\nVirginia has certainly been winning and has won eight straight road games, which is tremendous. However, the Wahoos beat SMU by 4, lost to UNC by 5, nipped Notre Dame by 3, BC by 13, FSU by 3 and Ohio State by 4. We’re tentatively going with the Yellow Jackets being that bad.\n\nOver at WRAL, Pat Welter and Chris Lea discuss Hubert Davis’s UNC and reach the same conclusion we’ve discussed from time to time: Davis has no idea how to communicate with his team.\n\nThat doesn’t mean they won’t win games of course, but it does go a long way to explaining why guys who transfer from UNC do so well at their new schools. Consider Michigan’s Elliott Cadeau, Minnesota’s Cade Tyson and Vanderbilt’s Tyler Nickel for a few quick examples. Consider also that Caleb Love became a consistent and reliable presence at Arizona in his final two years.\n\nRecap: Big First Half Fuels Wake Past Clemson 85-77\n\nWake Forest answers questions about toughness against Clemson 85-77\n\nClemson Jr. Forward Jake Wahlin postgame following loss to Wake Forest\n\nClemson Tigers Fall Behind Early Again, Lose Third Straight Game to Wake Forest\n\nWake Forest remains hot, extends Clemson’s slide\n\nVirginia overwhelms Georgia Tech with historic first half\n\nAnother bad start sends Georgia Tech to eighth straight loss\n\nUVA Basketball: ‘Hoos dominant in 94-68 blowout win at Georgia Tech\n\nEvaluating UVA basketball’s resumé after 26-point win at Georgia Tech\n\nGo to the DBR Boards to find Blue Healer Auctions | Drop us a line",

    "description": "OpenAI and Meta alum Philip Su said that AI was turning software engineers into managers. The IC role is \"dead,\" he wrote.",
    "fullText": "Use AI at work? You might be a manager and not even know it.\n\nPhilip Su is on the frontline of AI. He worked at OpenAI until 2025, when he left to found his startup, Superphonic. Before that, he worked at Microsoft and Meta.\n\nIn January, Su made a provocative claim on Substack: \"AI Killed the Individual Contributor.\"\n\nSu wrote that software engineers are asked to perform tasks once reserved for managers: set priorities, resolve conflicts, and give feedback. Rather than building, they're spending time \"pondering and tweaking the machine that builds the thing.\"\n\n\"The halcyon days of the IC are over,\" Su wrote. \"Not because AI codes better than you, but because maximizing your productivity necessitates focusing your time on all the things that are, at the end of the day, manager tasks.\"\n\nSu doubled down this week on the podcast \"A Life Engineered.\" He said the IC role was \"probably over\" because engineers were delegating their work to AI.\n\nIf everyone's a manager (of AI), do we need managers (of humans) anymore? Su said yes. There's a \"human coordination problem\" that AI cannot solve, he said.\n\nSu's theory of managerial takeover comes amid the \"great flattening\" in Big Tech. Flat org charts are all the rage: few managers, many ICs. Elon Musk's companies are known for their lack of managers; Amazon and Meta have recently culled management layers as they aim to increase their IC-to-manager ratios.\n\nMeanwhile, tech CEOs are also embracing \"founder mode.\" The reviled opposite of that, according to Paul Graham's 2024 essay, is \"manager mode.\"\n\nBut maybe managers are back en vogue — so long as they're managing AI agents. Vercel COO Jeanne DeWitt Grosser told Business Insider that companies will see a new role: the \"agent manager.\"\n\nThe tools will get better, too. Su already finds that he has to review AI-written code \"less carefully\" than he used to.\n\n\"It might currently feel like managing a team of barely-competent interns,\" he wrote in his essay. \"It'll soon feel like managing a team of very high performers, each better, faster, and smarter than you.\"",

    "fullText": "AI's biggest power players showed up in India on Thursday.\n\nOpenAI's Sam Altman, Anthropic's Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Scale AI's Alexandr Wang, and Mistral's Arthur Mensch spoke in succession at the AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi.\n\nFrom a potential \"AI divide\" to calls for stronger global coordination, here are five of the biggest takeaways from the summit so far.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said the world must not let the digital divide \"become an AI divide.\" He said expanding access to compute infrastructure, connectivity, and training is essential as AI reshapes economies.\n\nPichai said AI represents \"the biggest platform shift of our lifetimes\" and could drive \"hyper progress\" across science, healthcare, and economic development. But its benefits are neither \"guaranteed nor automatic.\"\n\n\"We must be equally bold in tackling problems in regions that have lacked access to technology,\" Pichai said. \"We cannot allow the digital divide to become an AI divide. That means investing in compute infrastructure and connectivity.\"\n\nGovernments must act both as regulators and innovators to ensure AI improves public services and broadens opportunity, he added.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that while AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, there's a gap between those capabilities and real-world impact.\n\n\"There is this duality between the fundamental capabilities of the technology and the time that it takes for those capabilities to diffuse into the world,\" he said.\n\n\"There are just frictions to adopt things through enterprises, and I think even more so in the developing world,\" he added.\n\nThe Google DeepMind CEO said India will be a \"powerhouse for AI\" across the world. He praised summits that bring together scientists, policymakers, and technologists, the latter of whom he said can't be left alone navigating AI.\n\nHassabis said we're in \"one of the most momentous\" times in human history and compared AI to the advent of fire and electricity.\n\n\"It's gonna be something like 10 times the impact of the Industrial Revolution, but happening at 10 times the speed, probably unfolding in a matter of a decade rather than a century,\" he said.\n\nGiven this level of impact, he said we need to use a scientific approach to understand AI's capabilities and build guardrails so that the technology \"serves the purposes that we want.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said rapid advances in AI could require new global governance mechanisms, something akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\"In particular, we expect the world may need something like the IAEA for international coordination of AI,\" Altman said, adding that such a body would need \"the ability to rapidly respond to change in circumstances.\"\n\nAltman said AI's trajectory could create risks that no single company or country can manage alone.\n\n\"We need a society-wide approach about how we're going to defend against this,\" he said, referring to the possibility of highly capable \"bio models\" becoming available.\n\nLong-term AI development is a responsibility to future generations, Altman also said, adding that it is a \"moral imperative\" to ensure future generations can benefit from and build upon technological progress.\n\nMeta's former chief scientist said we're still missing something \"big\" in AI.\n\n\"Why do we have systems that can pass the bar exam and win mathematics olympiads? But we don't have domestic robots. We don't even have self-driving cars,\" LeCun said. \"We certainly do not have several cars that can teach themselves to drive in 20 hours of practice like in 17-year-old.\"\n\nHe said that babies and animals have a much better understanding of the physical world around them than any AI systems today, which is why we don't have \"smart robots\" yet.\n\nHe said what is needed is world models — \"mental models of the world that allow us to think ahead, apprehend new situations, plan, sequence of actions, reason, and predict the consequences of our actions.\"\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company. His new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said we need to make AI effective for the Global South, and that needs conscious planning.\n\n\"We need to make AI as effective in every language as it is in English, and today, it is not,\" he said. \"Performance tests show that's the case.\"\n\n\"One of the good things to come out of this week is new announcements to better data in other languages, to provide better tools and measurement systems for AI that is built in other languages,\" he added.\n\nThe other thing that needs to be done is to work on problems that matter to the Global South. That means focusing on improvements in agriculture for India, and addressing food security in Africa.",

    "description": "Some tech workers are about to get caught \"sleepwalking\" as the culture shifts under their feet.",
    "fullText": "It's a tough time to be just average.\n\nWorkers who are decent at their jobs — but not superstars — are facing a tougher slog in industries like tech, where employers have the upper hand, and AI threatens to automate their roles.\n\nWhat used to be a spectrum of employee performance is hardening into something more binary. Companies are focusing more on two camps: hotshots and underachievers.\n\nThis corporate sorting risks leaving the solid performers who make up the bulk of healthy companies feeling overlooked — and potentially vulnerable, workplace observers told Business Insider.\n\n\"Good-enough, B player is the most dangerous place to be,\" said Jeff Hyman, who has been a recruiter for about 30 years. In part, that's because poor workers don't last long, and midlevel workers might have a false sense of security.\n\n\"They're sleepwalking,\" Hyman said. \"They're spending time polishing their LinkedIn while AI is just starting to, task by task, nibble at their job description.\"\n\nThe split-screen is particularly apparent in tech: Dell is revamping its sales compensation program to boost rewards for its highest performers and trim what goes to those who don't meet their full quota, Business Insider reported this month. In January, Business Insider reported that Meta plans to reward its strongest performers with larger payouts, while Amazon has said it's looking closely at each worker's impact.\n\nIt's an idea long used in marketing — like segmenting a customer base — to reimagine how they manage their workforce, said Richard Smith, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. The thinking goes that leaders should focus on the MVPs who hold \"strategic importance\" for a company in the long term.\n\nLast year, for example, Microsoft gave managers what it described as new and enhanced tools to help them accelerate high performance and \"swiftly address low performance,\" Business Insider reported.\n\nRewarding the stars has \"always been the case, and now it's just more unapologetically so,\" said Alan Stein, a career coach who worked at Facebook, Google, and Salesforce. In part, that's because of a crush of available workers.\n\nWith US companies hiring at one of the lowest rates in over a decade, employers have more leverage and potentially less incentive to invest heavily in developing middle-tier employees, said Smith, who runs the Human Capital Development Lab at Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe tech industry's latest approach, Stein said, marks a departure from what he saw as an \"everybody has potential\" ethos that emerged during the pandemic-era hiring boom.\n\n\"It was a lot of talk,\" said Stein, CEO of Kadima Careers, which offers job seekers coaching on how to get six-figure roles.\n\nIt was little surprise, he said, that Big Tech would ultimately direct a bigger share of payouts to those who get it done — just as pro sports teams reward their standouts.\n\nAt many large organizations, Stein said, about 10% to 20% of employees fall into the \"walks on water camp,\" with a similar share marked as underperformers. The majority sit in the middle — the solid, reliable \"worker bees,\" he said.\n\n\"They can't all be Zuckerberg,\" Stein said, referring to Meta's CEO. \"They need people that get the work done.\"\n\nOne risk for employers that focus heavily on their upper crust is that it can damage morale on the B team and signal to people at other firms — including the rock stars — that a company isn't a great place to work.\n\nBeyond recruiting headaches, a workplace where fear dominates tends to undercut what CEOs often say they want: innovation, creativity, and collaboration.\n\nSmith frames it as a math problem: Is it more valuable to improve the top 5% of your workforce by 20%, or 80% of your workforce by 5%?\n\nFinding ways to create that broad-based improvement creates \"a lot more impact,\" Smith said.\n\nThat risk of middle-child syndrome extends beyond tech to professional services such as law, auditing, engineering, and consulting — all of which are experiencing major shifts, thanks in part to AI, he said.\n\nNot all companies are stepping up efforts to trim their lowest-rated people. After online speculation that it would make a round of performance-based layoffs, Meta told Business Insider this month that it's not planning to cut the bottom 5% of workers this year, as it did in 2025.\n\nThe news isn't necessarily all bad for mid-tier workers either, Stein said. Even in tech, good-enough performers often still receive raises and enviable perks.\n\n\"You still have the free lunch. You still have the equity, and you're still a free agent. You can go somewhere else,\" he said.\n\nHyman, who's CEO of Recruit Rockstars, a recruiting and career management firm, said he advises B players to \"make yourself irreplaceable\" by honing skills AI can't yet do well. That includes showing superior judgment, building relationships with customers, and navigating ambiguity.\n\nIt might also mean learning AI to the point where you can go to your manager and announce that you've created an agent to automate work.\n\n\"That at least buys you time,\" Hyman said.\n\nYet, as soon as AI reaches a tipping point where it can handle a sufficient number of tasks that an average or above-average worker can do, Hyman said, \"that B player is in trouble.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Apple's small but mighty Mac Mini is flying off the shelves.\n\nThe sudden increase in demand is confusing some store workers, who are wondering why now?\n\nIn a TikTok video posted February 9, an employee can be heard telling a customer at Best Buy: \"I don't know what's with the Mac Mini, everyone keeps buying them a lot. Is this some AI thing?\"\n\nYes, it is an AI thing, and it's giving the Mac Mini a moment with tech enthusiasts.\n\n“is this some AI thing??” me trying to explain to Best Buy employees why everyone is coming in to buy the Mac mini #ai #openclaw #clawdbot\n\nOpenClaw is a rapidly evolving, open-source, autonomous AI agent previously known as Clawdbot or Moltbolt. Its creator, Peter Steinberger, recently joined OpenAI after being courted by AI CEOs, including Sam Altman and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg. OpenClaw can organize users' schedules, monitor vibe-coding sessions, and run other AI agents. It can also be locally run on your computer, which can eat up a lot of memory. That's driven a bit of a frenzy for devices with higher memory, like some Mac Minis.\n\nPeople are buying up the 5\"-by-5\" computer at a pace Apple can't seem to keep up with, as the tech giant shows weekslong wait times for the higher-memory Mac Minis. New York-based shoppers, for example, can get the 16-gigabyte Mac Mini by this weekend, while the 24-gigabyte and 32-gigabyte options have shipping and pick-up windows that extend until March 18, as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCustom and higher-memory configurations often take longer to ship, but the online buzz around the Mac Mini and OpenClaw is easy to link.\n\nResellers on eBay are also trying to cash in on the hype. There are dozens of new Mac Mini listings asking for the retail price or more for brand-new and pre-owned computers.\n\nBefore you snap up your M4 chip Mac Mini, you might consider waiting for a new wave of devices to drop. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, known for his inside information on Apple, reported that new Mac computers, including a new mini, are expected in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Nostalgia is everywhere on the internet right now.\n\nWith doomsayers predicting that AI could bring about the apocalypse, this January marking the highest number of layoffs to kick off a year since 2009, and ongoing political unrest, people are harking back to simpler times.\n\nRather than looking forward to the year ahead, many people hailed in 2026 by reminiscing about 2016 — posting throwback pictures and declaring that 2026 will be the new 2016, set to songs released around that time, such as Zara Larsson's \"Lush Life.\"\n\nMany have thrown it back even further — think pieces and experts have dubbed 2026 the \"year of analog.\" This trend is less about trying to live like it's 2016, but more 2006 — or 1996.\n\nThe tech-induced nostalgia is shining through in recent Reddit posts that ask: \"What is a luxury item from 20 years ago that is basically worthless trash today?\"\n\nThis question has been posted on Reddit in several threads over the last few months. These threads have amassed thousands of comments in the past few weeks.\n\nAmong the items people are discussing are portable GPS devices, digital cameras, iPods, and paying for novelty ringtones.\n\n\"I paid $700 for one of those in... 2003?\" one Reddit user says of a portable GPS device. \"Best purchase ever because I'm directionally challenged and relied on MapQuest (!) printouts on the passenger seat.\"\n\n\"Ringtones. Oh you want one of your ringtones to be a 5 seconds snippets from Lose yourself. That'll be 8.50$. People would flex about their ringtones,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nIn another post, a Redditor reminisced about USB storage drives.\n\n\"I remember in 5th grade, a flash drive was on our required supplies list, and I got one that was 512mb. A teacher told me that was more than I would need for the rest of my life,\" they wrote.\n\nThe PalmPilot, BlackBerry, plasma TVs, and SD cards have also gotten repeat mentions.\n\nSome of these pieces of tech — namely the digital camera — have been reborn in recent years as status symbols for a generation craving a time that felt more authentic.\n\nAs part of the push to get offline, many Gen Z and millennials are rejecting new technology by Bricking their phones — blocking certain apps and websites — and leaning into in-person hobbies.\n\nKathryn Jezer-Morton recently wrote for The Cut that 2026 is all about \"friction-maxxing\" — a rejection of the numbing convenience that AI and technology bring us, which Jezer-Morton says is distancing us from life itself.\n\nIt's as if consumers are harking back to a time when it felt as though technology was made to work for us, rather than make our lives more complicated.\n\n\"After a period of intense euphoria and excitement with regards to AI, we are coming down on the other side of the hill,\" Thomas Roulet, a professor of organizational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The tool is democratised and has become normalised, and people realise it hasn't made their work easier or less intense — quite the opposite,\" he added.\n\n\"So it's normal to find GenZ employees — who will have to go through their entire career using those tools — to be disillusioned,\" he said.\n\nWhen the future of AI is being predicted by some tech execs and experts as a white-collar bloodbath with millions of workers laid off, or that those living without AI glasses could be at a \"cognitive disadvantage,\" it's no wonder.\n\nIn an uncertain time, one thing that's sure in 2026: de-digitalizing your life is officially a status symbol.",

In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.\n\nThe DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.\n\nThe judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.\n\nThe reprieve from the California DMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.",

    "description": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat",
    "fullText": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US quietly funded a global effort to keep the internet from splintering into fiefdoms run by authoritarian governments. Now that money is seriously threatened and a large part of it is already gone, putting into jeopardy internet freedoms around the world.\n\nManaged by the US state department and the US Agency for Global Media, the programme – broadly called Internet Freedom – funds small groups all over the world, from Iran to China to the Philippines, who built grassroots technologies to evade internet controls imposed by governments. It has dispensed well over $500m (£370m) in the past decade, according to an analysis by the Guardian, including $94m in 2024.\n\nThen came Doge, Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency, tasked with reducing the size of US government agencies and initiatives. Career employees who staffed Internet Freedom resigned or were sacked in 2025 as part of larger reductions. Many of its programmes were cut permanently; its main granting office issued no money in 2025. The Open Technology Fund (OTF), a nonprofit that works with the government to direct roughly half of this money, won a lawsuit to get some of this funding restored in December; the Trump administration is now appealing against that ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration this January withdrew from the Freedom Online Coalition, a global alliance set up by the US to defend digital rights.\n\nThe cuts risk curtailing technologies that helped Iranians to coordinate during recent anti-government protests, and that allowed videos and images of massacres to reach the outside world. They could have a major impact in other nations too; the efforts of groups in Myanmar to get past the junta’s “digital iron curtain”, and the ability of users in China to avoid surveillance.\n\n“The programme was effectively gutted,” said a former US official. “They didn’t issue any grants this year.”\n\n“I would like to live in a world where a single US programme is not such a linchpin, such a load-bearing programme, but it has been. It’s hard to deny it has been,” said one digital rights expert based in Europe who has worked on a number of projects for Internet Freedom.\n\nTo report this story, the Guardian spoke to 10 people with knowledge of Internet Freedom, including six of its grantees, and reviewed documents related to its operations and budget.\n\nThe US Department of State has been approached for comment. The OTF declined to comment.\n\nThe purpose of the programme was to make it extremely difficult to do what North Korea has accomplished through decades of censorship efforts, and what Iran succeeded in doing this January during a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests: cut an entire population off from the global internet.\n\nThe US aimed to circumvent this by funding groups capable of building and harnessing technologies that evade such restrictions and censorship. These include familiar tools, such as the encrypted messaging service Signal and the Tor browser, which allows users to be anonymous online.\n\nThey also include far more powerful tools. Advanced circumvention technologies can make it possible to get past even extremely powerful censorship regimes – to leap the firewall in China, for example, or to obtain international news in Iran even when mobile phone networks are out, through methods like satellite datacasting, in which data is broadcast in a similar way to television signal.\n\nAnother technology has allowed Iranians to securely communicate during recent anti-government protests, alerting each other to shootings and police presence, even as the rest of the internet has been cut off.\n\nThe soft-power aim behind this was to keep the internet as it is: mostly accessible, mostly a global commons. The groups it funded made censorship costly and difficult. “When you challenge censorship, the long-term effect is that oppressive governments must either open their internet, or to go in the direction of North Korea,” said the former US official.\n\n“But because each of those options is costly for them, they’ll keep trying to censor their networks so as to have the economic benefits of the internet without the drawbacks of freedom of speech and access to information. So the fight continues.”\n\n“Internet Freedom funded the development of many of the censorship-circumvention technologies that millions of people around the world depend on to maintain a link to the outside world,” said Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who works closely with many of these groups.\n\nTheir makers are “often operating on a shoestring and passion. They believe in the cause. There’s no fancy offices, they’re working out of their apartments. It’s not a moneyed industry.”\n\nMost recipients of this money keep it quiet; it’s a dangerous thing, in some places, to take state department funds. But even as the funds run out, more and more organisations – journalists, activists, and civil society – are seeking out these technologies, and the groups that build them. Censorship regimes are getting worse worldwide.\n\n“It’s a massive blow. The need is bigger and other funding is also gone. Organisations that provide these tools are being overwhelmed,” said the digital rights expert. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\nSome of the groups working on these technologies have laid off staff; others are continuing without pay. A few hold out hope that some money can be restored – although they fear that the Trump administration might more overtly politicise its aims. While a recent appropriations bill contains a budget line for Internet Freedom, it names no specific programmes as recipients of this cash.\n\nOthers say they’re existing in a brief grace period as the rest of the funds run out.\n\n“Everybody’s just waiting right now, to be honest. But at the same time, wait at your own risk,” said an Iranian technologist funded through Internet Freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, censorship tech is growing cheaper and easier to access. Chinese companies have exported sophisticated middleboxes – devices that sit on network cables and allow authorities to monitor internet traffic – to countries across Africa and Asia in the past year. These allow regimes such as Iran’s to fine-tune their control over the domestic internet – allowing commerce to continue, for example, while communication is throttled.\n\nSeveral recipients of the US money expressed hope that Europe might fund these technologies in the future; some have already petitioned EU officials for funding.\n\nThe cuts “make it easier to build a ‘digital iron curtain’. It makes it easier for the Kremlin to put Russians in a digital information bubble that reinforces specific narratives about people outside of Russia. This makes it easier for China to do this. For Iran to do this,” one said.",

    "fullText": "China didn't just celebrate Lunar New Year this week. It staged a robotics flex.\n\nAt the annual Spring Festival Gala, the Lunar New Year show in China, humanoid robots from Chinese startup Unitree Robotics flipped, lunged, and swung swords and nunchucks just feet from child performers in a tightly choreographed kung fu routine.\n\nIn one sequence inspired by \"drunken boxing,\" a traditional Chinese martial arts style, the robots staggered, fell backward, then rose again — showcasing advances in control and coordination.\n\nClips circulating online quickly drew comparisons to last year's broadcast, which featured Unitree humanoid robots performing a Chinese folk dance. The choreography then was noticeably simpler.\n\nThe gala, often likened to the US Super Bowl for its massive audience, also featured other Chinese robotics firms, including MagicLab, Galbot, and Noetix, in separate segments throughout the broadcast on Monday evening.\n\nReactions on Chinese social media showed viewers being struck by how quickly the technology has advanced.\n\nOn RedNote, a user who goes by Ma Xiao said in a video posted on Wednesday that during last year's performance, the robots were only \"doing very simple things.\"\n\n\"Now, they're doing kung fu, they're doing flips, they're doing synchronized dancing,\" he said. \"Everybody's shocked.\"\n\n\"Now the rest of the world knows what China's speed is,\" he added.\n\nAnother RedNote user, DKKD, posted a video of friends reacting to the performance on Tuesday, captioning it: \"Three Americans were scared by the Spring Festival robot.\"\n\n\"They were all shocked by the robot's level of evolution (including me),\" the user wrote.\n\nOne viewer in the video can be heard saying: \"It's way more impressive than last year. It's crazy.\"\n\nUnitree CEO Wang Xingxing said in an interview with Chinese media following the gala that the company expects to ship up to 20,000 humanoid robots this year, up from about 5,500 in 2025.\n\nGlobal shipments of humanoid robots could reach \"tens of thousands\" this year, with Unitree potentially contributing between 10,000 and 20,000 units, Wang said on Tuesday.\n\nChinese companies developing humanoid robots and autonomous systems are racing to outdo global rivals.\n\nIn September, Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, unveiled R1, a humanoid robot that drew comparisons to Tesla's Optimus. Two months later, EV and robotics maker XPeng introduced the latest version of its humanoid, Iron, which the company described as \"highly human-like.\"\n\nChina's elite universities are also moving to build talent for the sector. In November, China's Ministry of Education issued a notice stating that top institutions are preparing to launch a new undergraduate major in \"embodied intelligence,\" a field that combines AI with robotics.\n\nStill, China's rapid push into robotics hasn't been seamless.\n\nXPeng's Iron fell face-first during its first public appearance in China earlier this year. Its CEO, He Xiaopeng, later wrote on Chinese social media that the mishap was part of \"learning to walk.\"\n\nLast month, a Unitree humanoid kicked an engineer in the groin during a test. Humanoid robots stumbled and fell while racing against humans in a half-marathon in Beijing in April last year.",

    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a landmark trial about social media addiction. Parents who attended hope the 'tide will turn' against Big Tech.",
    "fullText": "Lori Schott, a mother from rural Colorado, said she stared down Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg as he walked into court in Los Angeles on Wednesday to testify in a landmark trial regarding social media addiction.\n\nSchott lost her 18-year-old daughter, Annalee, to suicide in 2020. She believes the content Annalee saw on social media platforms \"destroyed\" her mental health.\n\n\"I made eye contact with him for quite a long time,\" Schott said of Zuckerberg. \"I was not backing down.\"\n\nSchott is not a plaintiff in the case where Zuckerberg testified on Wednesday, but is among more than 2,000 individuals who have similar personal injury lawsuits pending regarding social media addiction and harm.\n\nThe case underway in Los Angeles centers on a 20-year-old woman, identified by the initials KGM, who says her use of social media throughout her childhood negatively affected her mental health, contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts. It is considered a bellwether trial that could indicate how other similar lawsuits related to social media harm, like Schott's, could play out.\n\nMeta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, was named as a defendant alongside Google-owned YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat. TikTok and Snapchat both settled the lawsuit out of court.\n\nLast month, Meta warned investors that its mounting legal battles over youth safety could \"significantly impact\" its 2026 financial results. Attorneys for more than 100,000 individual arbitration claimants have \"sent mass arbitration demands relating to 'social media addiction'\" since late 2024, the company said in a 2026 10-K, which warned that potential damages in certain cases could reach into the \"high tens of billions of dollars.\"\n\nIn a statement, Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokesperson, said: \"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\" Otway highlighted changes the company has made over the past decade, including Teen Accounts, which give parents tools to manage their teens' accounts.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. A Snapchat spokesperson said in a statement: \"The Parties are pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, parents showed up hours before the courthouse opened in hopes of getting a seat inside. Many of them had personal stories about how they believed social media use harmed their children.\n\n\"We face a lot of stigma from people telling us we're bad parents,\" said Amy Neville, another parent who attended to show her support. She said that once the evidence comes out in the trial, she believes \"the tide will turn, and the general public will be on board with us.\"\n\n\"It is by design that social media is tearing their family apart,\" Neville said.\n\nOn the stand, Zuckerberg said that teens represent less than 1% of Meta's ad revenue and that most teens don't have disposable income, so it's not especially valuable to advertisers to reach them.\n\nZuckerberg said it's in Meta's best interest to create a platform that inspires people and makes them want to stick around for the long term.\n\n\"If people aren't happy with a service, eventually over time they'll stop using it and use something better,\" he said.\n\nSarah Gardner said that regardless of the outcome of the trial, she hopes it raises awareness about how the social media companies, and specifically Zuckerberg, have been operating. Gardner is the CEO of the Heat Initiative, an advocacy group that pressures Big Tech companies to make their platforms safer for kids. She was at the courthouse with the parents who believe they have been affected.\n\nGardner said she's hopeful the trial will empower more people to say, \"I don't want to be on Instagram anymore.\"",

He argued that the era of “static” tools—where businesses must bend their workflows to fit a software's limitations—is rapidly ending.\n\n\"Software is dead because everything's going to be customized to your unique utilization,\" Cuban stated, citing a shift where AI models mold themselves around specific business needs in real time.\n\nThis AI Helps Fortune 1000 Brands Avoid Costly Ad Mistakes — See Why Investors Are Paying Attention\n\nOwn the Characters, Not Just the Content: Inside a Fast-Growing Pre-IPO IP Company\n\nHe noted that even industry titans like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) are recognizing this shift toward “unique usage” over general-purpose platforms.\n\nThe ETFs tracking the software stocks in the U.S. have underperformed so far in 2026. iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV) dropped 19.34%, and State Street SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF (NYSE:XSW) declined 17.56%.\n\nMark Cuban just pronounced software dead, and the implications will destroy industries before most people understand what happened.\n\nCuban: \"Software is dead because everything's going to be customized to your unique utilization.\"\n\nRigid SaaS dies.

    "fullText": "Australia experienced a boom in smart-home technology at the start of the 2020s. Years on, some early adopters are experiencing buyer’s remorse\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nWhen the smart home devices Elly Bailey was expecting in the post never showed up at her Gold Coast home, she was frustrated. As a technology reviewer, these products were crucial for her work.\n\nWhen she eventually found the cause, she had to laugh. It wasn’t a sticky-fingered neighbour or a rogue delivery driver causing her to miss parcels, but her smart doorbell – the very thing she’d hoped would prevent missed deliveries, and part of exactly the range of internet-connected devices she was meant to be reviewing.\n\n“It’s pretty funny,” says Bailey, 33, who goes by the handle @ellyawesome on TikTok, where she has more than 1.1 million followers. She’d been loving her Google Nest doorbell up until then. She could see who was at the front door from upstairs and speak to delivery people through her phone while she was out.\n\nBut it had one obvious flaw: “When someone presses this doorbell, all it does is send a notification to my phone.” She says this feature is “great” when she’s out, but without a telltale chime she was missing deliveries while at home and away from her phone. She complained about this to her followers in a clip that’s been liked more than 1,400 times.\n\n“The crazy irony is the doorbell itself does make a little ding-dong sound when you press the doorbell button, but it’s only loud enough for the person at the door to hear it,” she says.\n\nBailey is far from alone in her scepticism around smart home technology – many adoptees have realised the devices designed to make life easier regularly achieve the opposite. Stories of people being locked out of their homes by faulty smart locks, woken up by pets activating cameras on the driveway, and being left in the dark by broken smart lights are rife on social media and product review websites.\n\n“Technology is brilliant … until it isn’t,” says Georgina Wilson, an architect in Sydney who learned this the hard way when her husband pressure-hosed the front of the house and accidentally watered their smart keypad unit. The incident hasn’t changed her mind on the convenience of a smart lock, but it did result in an expensive emergency locksmith callout – and quickly forced her to put a backup plan in place: keys in a hidden lockbox, with copies distributed to family members and neighbours.\n\nShe says some of her clients have had similar, or worse, experiences. “We’ve seen clients unable to flush toilets, lock front doors, or exit garages during power outages.”\n\nSince smart home technology uptake spiked during Covid lockdowns, Daniel Vasilevski, an electrician in Sydney, says he’s seen many smart tech horror stories. One client in Maroubra got locked out of their house for two days. Others have ended up with no working lights. Subscription complaints are also rife, with even some relatively simple devices like smart doorbells and thermostats requiring monthly fees. Vasilevski estimates 15 to 20% of his callouts these days are for problems with smart tech – some are simple repair jobs, while others want their smart systems demolished altogether.\n\nThere can be a more sinister side, too. Experts say smart homes are prime targets for cybercriminals. More than 120,000 smart home cameras were hacked in South Korea last year and the Australian Signals Directorate recently warned that Chinese hackers are exploiting people’s home routers and smart devices.\n\nWhile cases of spying fridges and doorbells being hacked are still rare, Emily Holyoake, a cyber and home-security expert based in Canberra, says technology facilitated domestic abuse is a significant issue.\n\n“The scariest things I’ve heard are about loss of privacy, where ex-partners have still had access to their partner’s home and made changes either locking them out, letting themselves in or watching their every move,” she says.\n\nRenters, too, have privacy concerns, as smart locks can allow landlords to keep tabs on their every move.\n\nJulie Provenzano, a real estate broker with 83,000 TikTok followers, believes it might be smarter to stick with an analogue home. She recently told fans she was “apped-out”. “Hi-tech doesn’t necessarily mean easier … It leaves people in a hostage situation with IT departments,” she said.\n\nVasilevski’s clients have faced similar issues. When something goes wrong, it’s not just the tech that’s a problem, but finding someone to fix it. Many locksmiths are not trained to work with sophisticated, connected devices. He says electricians will sometimes turn away smart home repair jobs because of how faffy and time-consuming they can be to troubleshoot. “It isn’t worth the hassle, most of the time,” he says. This is particularly true with lower-end smart tech suppliers who offer little in the way of after-sale support.\n\nGaby Albutros, a project manager at Sydney firm RSE Home Automation, says that when brands shut down or devices are discontinued, as was the case with Belkin’s Wemo smart home range in January, customers can be left high and dry.“The only option when they go wrong is to have them ripped out.”\n\nCurtains and blinds seem to be among the few smart-control devices that experts in the industry agree upon. Provenzano says they’re one of the only smart devices she endorses, and Vasilevski agrees, saying he wouldn’t install smart tech in his home because of the issues he sees at work, but that “smart control curtains are pretty reliable because they only get used twice a day”.\n\nWhile Holyoake doesn’t suggest eschewing the Internet of Things entirely, she says the key is to be intentional about the technology you’re putting in your home. In her household, she uses smart security cameras, lighting, a robot vacuum and even a digital whiteboard – all things she says make family life easier, especially with neurodivergent kids.\n\nMindful of the risks, she suggests smart-home adopters make time to check their security settings once a month. “Make sure only the people you know and trust have access, always make sure you change the default password, check for security and software updates, and always ask: who has access to my data and where is it stored? Do I need a subscription to access my own data? Can I still access devices if the internet goes out?”\n\nBailey might be a likely champion for all things smart, but even she prefers a hybrid setup. She’s been offered everything from smart lights to smart washing machines as part of her job, so she could have the world’s most connected home if she wanted to, but aside from the smart doorbell – which she’s kept because she still thinks the benefits outweigh the drawbacks – she’s chosen to keep most parts of her home “consciously dumb”.\n\n“Ultimately I’m an old-school millennial who’s very happy to put my washing on myself,” she says. “I think that keeps me smart, to be honest.”",

    "fullText": "AI's next target? Helping you kick your phone addiction.\n\nAI devices are a top priority for Big Tech companies that view it as the future of how humans and AI interact, writes BI's Amanda Hoover.\n\nYou've likely heard of this hardware before, which acts as a sort of AI sidekick for your life. From the Rabbit R1 and Humane to Friend, the names are different, but the stories are the same: big expectations, difficult execution.\n\nAmanda's story covers how it's not just upstarts looking to shake things up. Tech giants like Apple, Meta, and OpenAI are working on their own solutions.\n\nIt's an uphill battle considering how addicted most of us are to our phones. However, the push for phone-free lifestyles, especially among Gen Z, does create an opening.\n\nThese tech giants also don't have much of a choice.\n\nApple, for example, has largely sat out the AI wars, saving a ton of money on model development. That only works if the iPhone remains a key distribution channel for the AI it's skipping out on developing.\n\nMeta's business is also heavily reliant on smartphone usage. (How often do you check Instagram on your desktop computer? Do you even have a desktop computer?) If user behavior around phones changes in a meaningful way, you can bet Meta wants to be ahead of it.\n\nAI devices also give companies a front-row seat to your life.\n\nYou could argue that's already the case with these AI chatbots. I'd argue the relationship between you and your chatbot of choice is still mostly transactional. You have a question/problem/thought; the chatbot has an answer (hopefully).\n\nThe relationship with AI wearables is more fluid. It's always listening, learning, and collecting. The pitch is that makes it a better copilot. Understanding your habits means it can figure out the best way to serve you.\n\nThat's putting a lot of faith, and your personal data, into an AI device, though\n\nMany executives I've spoken to have said this is the future. Truly leveraging AI is about incorporating it into your daily routine, not treating it as a one-off for specific problems.\n\nThe irony is that strategy has the potential to make AI even more addictive than the smartphones it's trying to replace.",

    "description": "Western militaries often view new technology as precious and valuable. Ukraine shows that they can't afford to view small drones that way.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's large-scale drone war is pushing Western militaries to treat small drones less as high-end equipment and more as expendable ammunition that isn't meant to come back.\n\nUS Army and British Army officials, as well as a NATO veteran who volunteered to fight in Ukraine, told Business Insider that effective drone warfare requires sending large numbers forward — and accepting many will be lost as a routine cost.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the US Army's new drone lethality course, told Business Insider that the conflict shows that \"if you're going to flood the zone with drones,\" especially in a combat situation where electronic warfare is heavy, \"you're going to lose a lot of drones.\"\n\nShe said it's a \"transition from the army of old,\" where a lost drone was \"a significant emotional event\" that was reported to senior leadership. In Ukraine, it's different. \"Drones go down all the time.\" There, losses are typically shrugged off, rather than investigated.\n\nThat shifting mindset is shaping how Western militaries train.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the British Army's 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards, told Business Insider that his battalion has changed its training to allow drones to be damaged or even destroyed to reflect battlefield realities. \"I absolutely think they need to be disposable because otherwise you're not training realistically,\" he said.\n\nJakub Jajcay, a former special forces member from Slovakia who fought in Ukraine, told Business Insider that if NATO militaries want to start using drones for real missions, they \"need to get used to the fact that they're basically expendable material more akin to ammunition or fuel or gasoline, things like that, rather than specialized high-end pieces of equipment that need to be looked after.\"\n\nHe said when he was serving in the military for his home country, \"drones were very specialized pieces of equipment.\"\n\nThe drones were fairly expensive, he shared, \"and there was always a sort of bureaucratic process\" in using them. Sometimes, only designated individuals were allowed to use the drones.\n\nIf something happened to a drone, \"that would've been a big problem in training. If we had lost a drone, somebody would've been in big trouble for that.\" The war in Ukraine shows how poorly that peacetime mindset fits large-scale combat.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has featured drones on an unprecedented scale. Ukraine says roughly 80% of its strikes are carried out using drones rather than other weapons. Many never reach their targets and are lost along the way, though.\n\nCheap drones worth several hundred dollars have destroyed weaponry worth millions. But many of them don't have any effect. A report last year from the UK's Royal United Services Institute said that \"between 60 and 80% of Ukrainian FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators.\"\n\nSome drones are jammed or disrupted by electronic warfare, while others are shot down or get their cables cut. Sometimes they're knocked out by soldiers on their own side.\n\nMany of the drones on the battlefield are single-use, designed to explode when they hit their target, but many of them are destroyed, damaged, or disabled before they even reach that point.\n\nJajcay said that even drones designed to be used again and again \"have a lifespan of maybe a few dozen missions at most.\"\n\nHe also said that drones failed \"all the time,\" and those losses were expected.\n\nThe US Army is recognizing and learning from these dynamics in Ukraine, as are other Western militaries, as they incorporate the idea that drones cannot be treated as overly precious assets into their drone warfare training and doctrine.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider that out of the thousands of drones used daily, only around 30% of them hit their targets, while many others don't have a significant impact on their targets.\n\nThe Army is learning that lots of drones need to be sent forward.\n\nIrwin-Clark told Business Insider that the way the UK sees drones has also shifted. He said \"every time there's an iterative change in technology in the battlefield, everyone gets very excited about it and the ownership of that asset tends to be far too high.\"\n\nHe said that often when a new and powerful technology emerges, senior leaders will try to tightly control it, arguing that because there are only a handful available, only a select few should have the authority to decide when it's used. The assets are carefully protected, at least initially. Later on, trust is imparted to soldiers to handle technology previously in the charge of higher-ups.\n\nThat pattern, Irwin-Clark said, is \"exactly what's happening with drones.\"\n\nHis battalion wrapped the first drones it received years ago in bubble wrap, \"and we didn't fly them very often,\" he said. \"When we did,\" he continued, \"we made sure we flew in the middle of a field with nothing, no obstacles around.\"\n\nNow, his battalion is deliberately crashing its latest drone delivery into targets, while looking at how to make repairs. \"It really doesn't matter if we break them,\" Irwin-Clark said.\n\nThe US is coming at it the same way. Martin, who previously commanded a Gray Eagle drone company, said her course takes into account that \"drones crash. I'll say that to the day I die having owned drones as a commander: drones crash.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last year that the defense department needs to view small drones as consumables rather than \"durable property\" — more like ammunition than valuable equipment. It's a change that Jajcay described as \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nWestern armies were using various drones in warfare before Russia's invasion, often using them as surveillance platforms or tools for launching missile strikes. Small drones weren't used the way they're being used in Ukraine, but the US, UK, and others are learning drone lessons from the war.\n\nMartin said the ongoing conflict in Ukraine shows that even when you lose drones, it's ultimately \"still cheaper than employing missiles on specific targets.\" That's an equation the US Army can't totally ignore.\n\n\"They're cheaper, and you're not putting human lives in danger\" to carry out the mission, she shared. And the Army knows that \"they're going to crash. It's going to happen.\"",

    "fullText": "There's one corner of the tech sector where investors can hide out from AI disruption while still benefiting from the technology's adoption, Wedbush says.\n\nAnalysts led by Dan Ives, a vocal AI mega bull, flagged cybersecurity as a space that will see rising demand driven by AI, while steering clear of the AI worries that have rattled the market so far in 2026.\n\nExperts have called AI a double-edged sword for the cybersecurity industry, as the evolving technology is strengthening the capabilities of both cyber attackers and defenders.\n\n\"AI will be a major tailwind to the cyber security sector over the coming years as protection of use cases, data, and end points expand markedly,\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"As attack frequency, success rates, and blast radius rise with AI deployments, cybersecurity becomes even more mission-critical risk management, reinforcing budget resilience in this new AI driven IT budget world,\" they added.\n\nCybersecurity is among the fastest growing areas of enterprise IT spending. Gartner expects global AI cybersecurity spending to hit $51 billion in 2026, roughly doubling from the year prior.\n\nWedbush highlighted three stocks as the best-positioned in the space: Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler.\n\nWhat Wedbush says: \"We believe that CRWD's position as the gold standard of cybersecurity remains firmly unchanged in the face of this software sell-off with the company's innovative, best-in-class Falcon platform becoming increasingly effective in the modern threat landscape as AI adversaries become an incrementally larger threat for enterprises heading down the AI path.\"\n\nWhat Wedbush says: '\"AI is not displacing PANW's value proposition, but has actually made it more relevant, not less, as it is forcing customers to consolidate vendors, improve visibility, and automate response as threats become more adaptive and effective.\"\n\nWhat Wedbush says: \"AI is amplifying the need to secure access to data, models, and applications everywhere, reinforcing the mission-critical nature of ZS's offering, driving durable subscription growth and high renewal visibility.\"",

    "description": "Microsoft says it is on track to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring artificial intelligence to lower-income countries, as concerns mount over the technology’s potential to deepen inequality.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft says it is on track to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring artificial intelligence to lower-income countries, as concerns mount over the technology’s potential to deepen inequality.\n\nThe announcement was made Wednesday at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where leading tech executives, government officials and AI researchers are debating how to use AI to solve real-world problems.\n\nPolicymakers globally are increasingly worried that the unequal adoption of AI risks widening income and development gaps between rich and poor countries. In December, the United Nations Development Project called for global cooperation on standards and safety to ensure the technology “functions as a shared public good rather than a concentrated advantage.”\n\nAt the summit, Microsoft likewise expressed the need for cross-border partnerships to prevent poorer countries from being left behind.\n\n“We need to act with urgency to address the growing AI divide,” Microsoft president Brad Smith and chief responsible AI officer Natasha Crampton said in a joint statement. “Artificial intelligence is diffusing at an impressive speed, but its adoption around the world remains profoundly uneven.”\n\nThe company’s $50 billion commitment to developing economies by 2030 compares with the roughly $80 billion that Microsoft invested into data centers last year alone, more than half of which was directed to a single economy: the United States.\n\nA recent Microsoft report found that AI usage in the global north, a catch-all term for developed and high-income countries, is roughly twice that of the global south — and growing.\n\n“This disparity impacts not only national and regional economic growth, but whether AI can deliver on its broader promise of expanding opportunity and prosperity around the world,” Smith and Crampton said.\n\nThey warned that, just as unequal access to electricity has exacerbated a growing economic gap between the global north and south, without urgent action, the AI divide could perpetuate that disparity in the century ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, the technology could be used positively to help poor countries leapfrog older development pathways. “If AI is deployed broadly and used well by a young and growing population, it offers a real prospect for catch-up economic growth for the Global South,” said Smith and Crampton.\n\n“It might even provide the biggest such opportunity of the 21st century,” the pair said.\n\nMicrosoft’s $50 billion investment will, among other things, help to build the data centers crucial to providing the computing power needed to run AI models. Extending internet access is another focus.\n\nOnly about 36% of Africa’s population had broadband internet access in 2022, according to the World Bank. That compares with some 90% of US households, official figures show.\n\nThe AI Impact Summit, hosted by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highlights the country’s ambition to position itself as an AI leader in the global south.\n\nHigh-profile attendees include Sam Altman of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai who is due to deliver a keynote address on Friday.",

    "title": "OpenAI, Meta, and Apple's latest battle: Breaking your phone addiction",
    "description": "The tech companies that created our phone addiction are trying to cure us with AI wearables.",
    "fullText": "The average American picks up their phone more than 200 times a day. Teens are pinged with some 250 notifications a day — during school, after school, and overnight. The apps meant to prevent you from checking apps have done little to stop the problem. Now, some of the tech companies that helped create our screen dependence are trying to disrupt it.\n\nLater this year, OpenAI plans to debut a small, screenless device that Sam Altman describes as more \"peaceful\" than a smartphone. Apple, the Oz of screentime, is developing smart glasses, a pin, and AirPods with more AI built in, according to a Tuesday report from Bloomberg, with the rumored pendants featuring microphones and cameras to be the \"eyes and ears\" of the iPhone. Meta has teased its fully augmented reality Orion glasses since 2024. While that device doesn't have a release date, the company last year sold some 7 million pairs of its smart glasses, which is the start of the post-smartphone future Mark Zuckerberg has predicted. Eventual smart specs could be more screen all-the-time than screenless, but they also rely on AI to make the experience much more hands-free than swiping and scrolling on a phone.\n\nCould AI be what finally breaks our phone addiction?\n\nSince 2007, no device out of Silicon Valley has captured universal imagination the way Steve Jobs did when he put your iPod, your phone, and the internet together on a 3.5-inch screen. Competitors have tried for a decade-plus to get people to shift us from the iPhone to smart glasses, and largely failed. The awe around smartphones has turned to derision, as excessive screen time is linked to disrupted sleep, anxiety, and fractured attention. Now, developers are hoping the AI boom can give us the next big thing.\n\nBeating the smartphone would mean replacing a device that 91% of American adults now carry — a device for which millions of apps have been developed and people now depend on in lieu of wallets and cameras and health monitors. New AI devices can't just copy what smartphones do, says Ramon Llamas, a research director at a technology intelligence firm IDC: They have to show they have a solution to an everyday problem. If they don't, Llama says, \"these things are just gonna really end up as solutions looking for a problem to solve.\"\n\nCritiques of screen time can be as blunt and smoothbrained as what the critics say excessive screen time makes you. A seven-hour daily log may seem like a staggering amount of dependence, but what did the person spend those seven hours doing? Doomscrolling late into the night, or FaceTiming with a far-away friend? With AI wearables, there's the risk of becoming dependent on the device for different reasons.\n\n\"The screen may not be there, but what's getting filled in the back is already this problem of AI companionship,\" says Olivia Gambelin, an AI ethicist and author of the book \"Responsible AI.\" An AI device designed to do something very specific — like listen to a meeting and then send follow-up emails or messages related to action points discussed — could save people time and keep them from writing tedious emails and Slack messages from their desk. But that same device listening in to personal conversations with family and friends could compromise a relationship, and erode the positive effects that texting a friend to check-in can have on both people (already, my friends are tiring of AI summaries on the iPhone that summarize our group text and become an intermediary into our threads of gossip and jokes in the name of efficiency). Wearing microphones and cameras to social interactions and into businesses is likely to really weird out some of the people around you. More people are entering into romantic, dependent relationships with AI companions, and a swell of loud dissenters are criticizing the technology for taking jobs and attempting to replicate human relationships.\n\nBut OpenAI is betting that it can package its technology in a device in a way that calms the user. \"When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way,\" Altman said in November. OpenAI's device, he said, would be less Time Square, more \"sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm.\" That's because the AI device would learn \"contextual awareness of your whole life,\" and when best to send you alerts.\n\nOther AI wearables have failed by falling short of that goal. Humane AI sold a wearable pin, priced at $700 plus a monthly fee to connect it, but pulled it from the market a year ago. It failed perhaps because it tried too hard to replace our phones — it didn't interact with them, but provided a shoddy replacement. Novelty wasn't a factor that could outshine usability. The AI Friend pendant, which can't search the internet or help with tasks outside of sending reminders and acts instead as an eavesdropping sycophant around its user's neck, was mocked relentlessly and sold just a few thousand devices after it hit the market last year.\n\nCompanies trying to make AI hardware should focus on \"transformative features,\" Jason Low, research director at Omdia, tells me in an email. AI wearables must be more than \"marginally more convenient,\" should integrate with our existing products, and have a clear, stated value. For example, glasses that provide real-time language translation or devices for fitness and health tracking offer features our smartphones can't do as well. The Oura ring continues to grow in popularity, particularly among women after starting out as a niche tech bro buy, for the novel insights it can offer; the company announced last fall it has sold 5.5 million rings since 2015, with more than 2.5 million sold between June 2024 and September 2025. \"These devices often deliver a more polished user experience compared to general-purpose, do-it-all AI devices,\" Low says.\n\nLlamas tells me that the AI functions of a wearable have to be \"contextual, personalized, and actionable,\" like reminding the wearer to send birthday flowers or responding accurately to being asked to direct the user to the nearest Starbucks. A first attempt device shouldn't try to replace the smartphone, but to integrate with the Apple or Google ecosystems, he says. Apple and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment about their rumored products for this story.\n\nIf anything has hyped Silicon Valley like the iPhone, it's been AI. But three years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, the value generative AI in the white collar workforce has yet to be fully realized. That could make a product for consumers a hard sell, too. \"Some of the overwhelm that's coming with AI that I see in general users is you can use it for everything, or it's promoted that way, which is actually quite stifling,\" Gambelin says.\n\nIn our quest to find a peaceful equilibrium with tech, the screen itself may not be the problem; it's what's summoning us to the screen. Its bright colors, games, and infinite scroll give quick dopamine hits that entice us to stay glued to it. But much of what pings my phone throughout the day are useless notifications trying to get me to reopen one of the dozens of apps — a markdown moment on a clothing thrifting app, a like on the Instagram story I've posted of my dog from my best friend, and ironically, a report of how much time I've already logged. There's a relentless business model at play to keep us on these apps. No screens would mean no infinite scroll through TikTok, no Candy Crush — but app developers and companies may need to find new ways to reach people if wearables caught on, and an always-there AI device and companion might not be as peaceful as Altman describes. Our collective screen time is a problem, but the AI wearable will have to surprise us all with something novel to be useful.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "fullText": "Last year, the bears came out of hibernation.\n\nThere were 166 short-selling campaigns launched in 2025, according to industry tracker Diligent Market Intelligence — a 55% bump compared to 2024. The vast majority were based in the US.\n\nThe most targeted companies were technology stocks that had been boosted by market-wide optimism about artificial intelligence, Josh Black, the author of Diligent's report, told Business Insider. The report identified Applovin, a company that helps iPhone apps monetize users via advertising technology, as an example of a common short. The company's stock is down nearly 40% this year.\n\nThe spike in short-selling campaigns may be a sign of pain to come in 2026. In 2021, one year before a global market plunge brought on in part by concerns over lofty tech valuations, there were 128 campaigns — the most in the last five years until 2025.\n\nOf last year's 166 campaigns, 55 of them were focused on technology companies, by far the most of any sector.\n\nThe slide in software stocks such as Salesforce and Oracle this year has added fuel to short-sellers' questions about the industry's valuations in the age of AI.\n\nNew shortseller BMF Capital, run by Frankie Gerola and based in Arizona, told Diligent that one of the firm's first bets, against defense AI company BigBear.ai, came about in part due to what it viewed as a \"lack of true AI innovation.\" BigBear, which has attracted other short sellers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the short-sellers' critiques.\n\nBMF Capital is also keeping an eye on companies \"that repeatedly change narratives in search of relevance, such as a sports company pivoting into AI dating.\"\n\n\"That kind of identity drift usually precedes capital stress or poor fundamentals,\" BMF Capital said.\n\nLast year, the average short campaign generated returns of 7.2% 30 days after launch, according to Diligent. So far in 2026, the software-stock crash has generated billions for those betting against the stocks, short-seller tracker S3 Partners said.",

    "description": "Investors are drawing their battle lines as AI sorts tech companies into winners and losers.",
    "fullText": "The once relentless rally in AI-fueled stocks has lost momentum, as investors confront the unsettling idea that advances in artificial intelligence could erode the very value propositions that made tech giants dominant in the first place. Yet some executives and market veterans warn against short-term panic, calling the selloff a rare opportunity to buy into the next phase of the AI boom.\n\nThe AI growth story has been tempered by a widespread selloff in software stocks. Call it the software-mageddon or the SaaSpocalypse, but companies who specialize in designing, selling, and maintaining digital software products are getting battered. Earlier this month, JPMorgan analysts wrote that software companies had lost around $2 trillion in value over the past year, calling it “the largest non-recessionary 12-month drawdown in over 30 years.”\n\nThe culprit has been an increasingly widespread feeling among investors that AI is sorting tech players into winners and losers. Under this view, software companies could fall into the latter camp as the capabilities of newer AI models promise to replace expensive digital services, rendering the business models of companies like Salesforce and Atlassian obsolete.\n\nBut not all investors are convinced these companies are destined for irrelevance. Hidden within the chaos could lie an undervalued chance to buy these tech stocks at a discount, a relative rarity in an age of soaring valuations and speculative growth. It all depends on whether bullish buyers consider AI as complementary to existing software services, or capable enough to replace them entirely.\n\n“I think this software selloff will go down as a generational opportunity to own some of the stalwarts,” Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a Yahoo Finance interview Friday. “I feel more emboldened about the bull thesis on tech and AI this year, despite obviously this massive pullback.”\n\nIves named three industry leaders that he sees as being unfairly punished in today’s market, and that could be in for a powerful rebound:\n\nIves called the software stock correction a “structural selloff” that was the largest in scale he’d seen in 25 years. But instead of spelling doom for these companies, he framed the wipeout as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in enterprise technology, arguing that software developers will remain a “core part of the use cases,” even in an AI-powered future.",

The data analytics company, criticized for its role in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, joins a host of other businesses and billionaires that recently moved to Florida in search of a more business-friendly climate.\n\nPalantir’s move across state lines comes after its chair, Peter Thiel, announced on 31 December that he opened a Miami office for his private investment firm. Thiel already has a mansion in Miami Beach. The company, previously headquartered in Palo Alto, announced the move on X but did not provide further details or respond to a request for comment. Palantir’s stay in Colorado lasted about six years; the company exited California in August 2020 – with its CEO, Alex Karp, citing disagreements with the state’s values.\n\nPalantir’s Denver office has frequently been the site of protest, as the company faces heated criticism for its involvement in the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants. Tools and platforms built by Palantir have been used by the federal government in efforts to surveil and detain immigrants. The company has also inked a major contract with the UK’s National Health Service.\n\nColorado’s immigration and tech activists view Palantir’s departure as a result of their sustained organizing. Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee and organizer for AI regulation in Denver, said that a coalition of unions and grassroots organizations, including Denver Anti-War Action, held a few dozen town halls, strikes and protests that mounted pressure on Palantir’s presence in the city. Pinto also said that Palantir may have been dissuaded by Colorado’s state lawmakers taking the lead on AI regulation with proposals to limit surveillance and discrimination.\n\n“Colorado has rejected the values of Palantir – the values of an economy built on exploitation of people’s data, whether it’s for warfare or for immigration enforcement,” Pinto said.\n\nMany of California’s wealthiest billionaires seem to be considering a move to Florida – spooked by the state’s consideration of a billionaire tax. There has also been a concerted effort by the business leaders Ken Griffin and Stephen Ross to convince billionaires to move to south Florida and to bring their businesses with them.\n\nPalantir has tried to distance itself from Trump’s immigration apparatus, but that has not quelled protest. Some of the company’s employees appear to be disturbed, too. Karp recorded a video about Palantir’s involvement with ICE for staff and said they could sign NDAs if they wanted more details, according to Wired.\n\nJames Fishback, a Republican candidate for Florida governor, wrote on X in response to Palantir’s move, saying he would ban Palantir from all government contracts if elected. “You are a threat to our civil liberties,” Fishback wrote. He had voiced the same position last month. Fishback’s commitment comes amid increasing pressure on lawmakers to evaluate their relationship with Palantir. The nationwide campaign Purge Palantir has been documenting politicians who received funds from the company’s executives and pressuring them not to accept their donations. The campaign has had some success so far. The Colorado Sun reported that the Colorado representative Jason Crow and Colorado senator John Hickenlooper planned to donate more than $50,000 each, in campaign contributions from Palantir, to immigrant rights groups.\n\nPalantir blew past Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter of 2025 and reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m. Its stock, however, has sunk 20% since the start of 2026.",

    "fullText": "Prof Michael Wooldridge says scenario such as deadly self-driving car update or AI hack could destroy global interest\n\nThe race to get artificial intelligence to market has raised the risk of a Hindenburg-style disaster that shatters global confidence in the technology, a leading researcher has warned.\n\nMichael Wooldridge, a professor of AI at Oxford University, said the danger arose from the immense commercial pressures that technology firms were under to release new AI tools, with companies desperate to win customers before the products’ capabilities and potential flaws are fully understood.\n\nThe surge in AI chatbots with guardrails that are easily bypassed showed how commercial incentives were prioritised over more cautious development and safety testing, he said.\n\n“It’s the classic technology scenario,” he said. “You’ve got a technology that’s very, very promising, but not as rigorously tested as you would like it to be, and the commercial pressure behind it is unbearable.”\n\nWooldridge, who will deliver the Royal Society’s Michael Faraday prize lecture on Wednesday evening, titled “This is not the AI we were promised”, said a Hindenburg moment was “very plausible” as companies rushed to deploy more advanced AI tools.\n\nThe Hindenburg, a 245-metre airship that made round trips across the Atlantic, was preparing to land in New Jersey in 1937 when it burst into flames, killing 36 crew, passengers and ground staff. The inferno was caused by a spark that ignited the 200,000 cubic metres of hydrogen that kept the airship aloft.\n\n“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Wooldridge said. Because AI is embedded in so many systems, a major incident could strike almost any sector.\n\nThe scenarios Wooldridge imagines include a deadly software update for self-driving cars, an AI-powered hack that grounds global airlines, or a Barings bank-style collapse of a major company, triggered by AI doing something stupid. “These are very, very plausible scenarios,” he said. “There are all sorts of ways AI could very publicly go wrong.”\n\nDespite the concerns, Wooldridge said he did not intend to attack modern AI. His starting point is the gap between what researchers expected and what has emerged. Many experts anticipated AI that computed solutions to problems and provided answers that were sound and complete. “Contemporary AI is neither sound nor complete: it’s very, very approximate,” he said.\n\nThis arises because large language models, which underpin today’s AI chatbots, rattle out answers by predicting the next word, or part of a word, based on probability distributions learned in training. It leads to AIs with jagged capabilities: incredibly effective at some tasks, yet terrible at others.\n\nThe problem, Wooldridge said, was that AI chatbots failed in unpredictable ways and had no idea when they were wrong, but were designed to provide confident answers regardless. When delivered in human-like and sycophantic responses, the answers could easily mislead people, he added. The risk is that people start treating AIs as if they were human. In a 2025 survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology, nearly a third of students reported that they or a friend had had a romantic relationship with an AI.\n\n“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge said. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”\n\nWooldridge sees positives in the kind of AI depicted in the early years of Star Trek. In one 1968 episode, The Day of the Dove, Mr Spock quizzes the Enterprise’s computer only to be told in a distinctly non-human voice that it has insufficient data to answer. “That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he said. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the Star Trek computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”",

    "fullText": "Google, Anthropic and OpenAI bosses to mingle with global south leaders wrestling for control over technology\n\nSilicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.\n\nDuring the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.\n\nAmid a push to speed up AI adoption across the globe, Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, the heads of Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, will all be there. Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.\n\nMeanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioning India as the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.\n\nModi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raised serious concerns about India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”\n\nSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.\n\nIndian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.\n\nIf a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.\n\nIndia’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”\n\nSafety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.\n\n“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”\n\nOne of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”\n\nBut the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.\n\n“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.\n\nCompanies such as Google are focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.\n\n“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”\n\nGoogle’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: ICE more than tripled the amount of data stored in Microsoft’s cloud at the same time that its arsenal of surveillance technology ballooned\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deepened its reliance on Microsoft’s cloud technology last year as the agency ramped up arrest and deportation operations, leaked documents reveal.\n\nICE more than tripled the amount of data it stored in Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform in the six months leading up to January 2026, a period in which the agency’s budget swelled and its workforce rapidly expanded, according to the files.\n\nICE appears to be using a range of Microsoft’s productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyse the data it holds in Azure. Files suggest some of the agency’s own tools and systems may also be running on Microsoft servers.\n\nThe documents – obtained by the Guardian and its partners +972 Magazine and Local Call – raise questions about whether Microsoft technology is facilitating an immigration crackdown by an agency accused of conducting unlawful operations and using excessive force on a large scale.\n\nICE enforcement operations have surged over the past year as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign. The agency is now at the centre of a battle in Congress over its funding, sparked by the deaths of two people in Minneapolis, that has led to a partial shutdown of the US government.\n\nIn July, ICE received a $75bn budget increase, making it the highest-funded US law enforcement body. With this unprecedented increase in funds, the agency has embarked on a spending spree on technology, awarding contracts to large firms such as Palantir alongside lesser-known providers.\n\nICE, which has been likened to a domestic surveillance agency, enjoys access to vast troves of data on people living in the US. It has a growing arsenal of surveillance technology, including facial recognition apps, phone location databases, drones and invasive spyware.\n\nAs the agency expanded through 2025, it boosted spending on cloud computing. Amazon and Microsoft, both longtime providers to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have emerged as beneficiaries of deals worth tens of millions of dollars struck by third-party resellers.\n\nThe leaked documents do not specify the kinds of information stored by ICE on Microsoft servers. However, they indicate the agency has used Azure services including “blob storage” of raw data, as well as AI tools that analyse images and videos, and translate text.\n\nIn January, according to the files, ICE held almost 1,400 terabytes in Azure, which if only comprised of photographs would be equivalent to approximately 490m images. This was up from 400 terabytes in July 2025 after climbing through the second half of last year, files suggest.\n\nICE is also using virtual machines on Azure, according to the documents. These are effectively computers that run in the cloud but that can be accessed remotely. ICE appears to be renting these high-powered computers to run software.\n\nThe agency, which has more than doubled its workforce since January 2025, is also understood to have significantly expanded its access to Microsoft’s suite of productivity apps which provide users with access to document management tools and an AI chatbot.\n\nIt’s unclear from the files whether ICE is using Azure to store or analyse information collected through any of its surveillance or intelligence gathering activities, or whether the cloud platform supports other functions, such as the running of detention centres or deportation flights. ICE did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft said it “provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS and ICE, delivered through our key partners”. They said Microsoft’s policies and terms of service “do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity”.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “There are currently many public issues relating to immigration enforcement, and we believe Congress, the executive branch, and the courts have the opportunity to draw clear legal lines regarding the allowable use of emerging technologies by law enforcement.”\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company later appeared to narrow this position. It acknowledged to employees it had contracts with ICE and DHS, but said it “does not presently maintain AI services contracts tied specifically to enforcement activities”.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in facing disquiet among employees over its business with federal immigration authorities. For large US tech groups, ICE and sister agency Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have long been customers, but have become increasingly controversial for their aggressive tactics and involvement in fatal shootings.\n\nLast week, Amazon workers and activists protested outside the company’s Seattle headquarters, demanding the company cut ties with federal immigration agencies. The company benefits from a series of large cloud deals with DHS to provide cloud infrastructure to ICE and CBP.\n\nAt Google, which provides cloud services to both agencies, more than 1,300 workers have signed a recent petition with a similar set of demands. “DHS is violating civil and national law as well as civil and human rights,” the petition reads. “We must end our complicity in powering them.”\n\nBeyond the headlines: inside stories from the Guardian’s investigations team.

    "description": "Anni Chen says vibe coding is hard to resist. It speeds up her productivity, but she doesn't trust it blindly.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Anni Chen, who has worked at Amazon for about three-and-a-half years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified her employment history.\n\nI'm a tech lead at Amazon responsible for deploying large-scale generative AI and LLM-driven systems. I focus on what we call memory, which powers personalization in generative AI experiences across Amazon.\n\nI vibe code every day. It's definitely a productivity boost.\n\nFor debugging or small tasks, I sometimes treat it like a lottery. Maybe it will produce something amazing. Sometimes, it does.\n\nVibe coding helps me brainstorm what the solution could look like, even if I don't adopt the final solution it proposes. Vibe coding also speeds up the time spent rewriting code when you realize a requirement wasn't covered.\n\nWhen I vibe code, it's always iterative. I give it the basic information it needs, it produces a version, then I check it — similar to a code review with coworkers. I might say, \"You missed this part\" or \"You missed that part.\"\n\nThe AI sometimes fixes issues but introduces something new. You have to keep an eye on it.\n\nFor complex tasks, you need more double-checking. But even with the extra checking, it's still faster.\n\nI was working with a partner team and ran into complex locking issues. Without an LLM, I might have taken a day to research possible solutions, especially since it was relatively new to me.\n\nWithin 15 minutes, I brainstormed with the LLM about possible solutions. I pointed out weaknesses in its suggestions and asked it to improve them. In 15 minutes, I had a proposal to send to the team.\n\nTechnical knowledge helps — you know what's a good solution and what's not. You know what tastes good, but you don't know what dishes are available. The LLM brings up all the dishes, and you choose.\n\nStill, I'm hesitant to use vibe coding directly in production.\n\nLLMs are very good at solving problems, but sometimes they make implicit assumptions you don't realize they're making. If you don't tell it explicitly, for example, that something needs to work for multi-threading, it might just produce the minimum version that works, but when it's large-scale or productionized, it could crash.\n\nNon-technical builders could tell an LLM to build something that handles millions of users. But if you have zero technical knowledge, it's hard to anticipate constraints upfront. If you don't tell the model the implicit assumptions, it won't respect those constraints. Later, you'll run into problems.\n\nNon-technical people might use the LLM to fix issues reactively. But technical people can anticipate constraints proactively and prevent problems in the first place.\n\nTechnical people also understand vibe-coded content better, and they're in a better position to understand what LLMs are good at and not good at. For example, knowing how they're trained and why they're weaker at certain tasks like math. That understanding helps you master them as tools.\n\nWhen you scale to one million or 100 million customers, systems need to be coded differently to handle that scale.\n\nInitially, leadership pushed vibe coding. Our team is a GenAI team, so we were naturally more receptive. In non-GenAI teams, engineers initially reacted like, \"No, I won't let AI do my job. I don't trust AI-generated code.\"\n\nAfter people tried it, attitudes shifted. People realized it's pretty good sometimes. Now it's more widely adopted.\n\nIt's very hard to resist vibe coding nowadays. If you're an employee, leadership sees the productivity boost and will encourage you to use it.\n\nWhen your peers are using it and coding faster, it's hard to resist. If you can't keep up with the speed, it becomes difficult to collaborate.\n\nEven if you resist, you still consume AI passively. AI comments are embedded in code reviews. So even if you don't vibe code directly, you're still interacting with AI outputs.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding? Contact this reporter at cmlee@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "In Europe, there's been a lot of handwringing over why there are very few large, successful tech companies in the region. Peter Steinberger, the creator of the agentic AI hit OpenClaw, has an answer.\n\nSteinberger was recently hired by OpenAI and is moving from Europe to the US. An Austrian by birth, he previously split his time between London and Vienna.\n\nOn X, a professor from a European university asked why Europe couldn't retain this tech talent.\n\nSteinberger replied that most people in the US are enthusiastic, while in Europe, he's scolded about responsibility and regulations.\n\nIf he built a company in Europe, he would struggle with strict labor regulations and similar rules, he added.\n\nAt OpenAI, he said most employees work 6 to 7 days a week and are paid accordingly. In Europe, that would be illegal, he added.\n\nThe most valuable company in Europe is Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML, valued at about $550 billion. In contrast, there are 10 US companies worth more than $1 trillion. Most of these are tech companies.\n\nIn 2024, a landmark EU report found that the region had fallen behind the US, particularly in innovation. It proposed a series of changes to tackle the problem, but by the end of 2025, few of the recommendations had been implemented.\n\nSteinberger said he was hopeful about EU INC, an effort to create a single corporate legal framework to make it simpler to run a business across the region.\n\nBut this seems to be \"fizzling out,\" he wrote on X. \"Watered down, too much egoistic national interest that ultimately hurts everyone.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Why an A.I. Video of Tom Cruise Battling Brad Pitt Spooked Hollywood",
    "description": "A 15-second clip created by an artificial intelligence tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance appears more cinematic than anything so far.",
    "fullText": "It took only a 15-second clip of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt duking it out on a crumbling rooftop at twilight to draw swift outrage, and sizable fear, from Hollywood over the last few days.\n\nThe widely circulated video was created by the Irish director Ruairi Robinson using Seedance 2.0, a powerful artificial intelligence video generation tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance. It had plenty of the bells and whistles of a big-budget Hollywood film: sweeping camera angles, stunt choreography, crisp sound effects and haunting music.\n\nWith a two-sentence prompt and the click of a button, Seedance had produced a stunningly realistic result that was a drastic improvement over previously generated artificial intelligence videos, often shoddy clips known as A.I. slop. This video was so convincing that it drew near immediate condemnation from some of Hollywood’s top organizations and companies.\n\nRhett Reese, a scriptwriter known for his “Deadpool” films, said in an interview that the Cruise-Pitt video had sent a “cold shiver” up his spine.\n\n“For all of us who work in the industry and devoted our careers and lives to it, I just think it’s nothing short of terrifying,” he said. “I could just see it costing jobs all over the place.”\n\nByteDance released Seedance 2.0 last week, nearly two months after a previous version had failed to prompt much anger. A news release from the company praised the updated tool’s “physical accuracy, realism and controllability,” which it said was suitable for the needs of “professional-grade creative scenarios.”\n\n“The creation process,” the release went on, “is more natural and efficient, allowing users to control their creations like a true ‘director.’”\n\nUsers promptly flocked to the platform to spin up their own content. An alternate ending to “Game of Thrones” went viral, as did a video of the notoriously beefing rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake burying the hatchet on “The Tonight Show,” and one of Samara Morgan, the vengeful girl in “The Ring” horror films, emerging from an old television set to pet a cat.\n\nRobinson himself posted additional videos, including of Pitt and Cruise battling a robot, and of Pitt sparring with a sword-wielding “zombie ninja.”\n\nAt the same time, Hollywood was swift to sit up straight. Charles Rivkin, the chairman and chief executive of the Motion Picture Association, called on ByteDance to “immediately cease its infringing activity,” saying in a statement that Seedance 2.0 had engaged in the unauthorized use of copyrighted works on a “massive scale.” Human Artistry Campaign, a global coalition that advocates using A.I. “with respect for the irreplaceable artists, performers and creatives,” said on social media that unauthorized works generated by Seedance 2.0 violated the “most basic aspects of personal autonomy.”\n\nDisney, which in a watershed $1 billion deal last year agreed to allow OpenAI’s Sora users to generate video content with its characters, sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing it of supplying Seedance with a “pirated library” of Disney’s characters — “as if Disney’s coveted intellectual property were free public-domain clip art.”\n\nByteDance, which also owns TikTok and has been valued at $480 billion in the private markets, said in a statement that it respected intellectual property rights and was aware of the concerns about Seedance.\n\n“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” the statement said.\n\nAs last year’s deal between Disney and OpenAI suggests, Hollywood has for years wrestled with how to manage the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence. The concerns outlined by Reese echoed the Writers Guild strike in 2023, when for months thousands of union members demanded that studios institute guardrails protecting them from having their jobs or their intellectual property stolen by A.I. In the end, the group won guarantees that A.I. would not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation.\n\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors and media artists, said its contracts had specific and enforceable rules about digital replication. The kind of material represented by the Cruise-Pitt battle, he said, “could not be produced by any of the signatories to our contracts — the studios, the streamers — without the specific, informed consent of those individuals.”\n\nAccording to Crabtree-Ireland, the real concern is that, even if videos generated by Seedance and other A.I. platforms “are not malicious in intent,” they could “really violate someone’s right to control how their image, their likeness and their voice is used.”\n\nNot everyone is awed by Seedance’s latest technology. Heather Anne Campbell, an executive producer and a writer on the animated series “Rick and Morty,” said her social media accounts last week had been inundated with Seedance-generated clips of anime, sci-fi and unlikely superhero battles. But she is not yet worried, she said, about losing her job to the technology.\n\n“Everybody is, I think, swept up by the circus that came to town and is showing off,” she said. “I haven’t seen anything good yet. Nothing that has taken my breath away, nothing that is poignant, nothing that is provocative even. It’s all just garbage.”\n\nCampbell added that A.I. services like Seedance were at best “averaging machines,” and argued that the greatest art was never made quickly or impersonally.\n\nStill, some people working in Hollywood find it difficult to imagine that studios will not come to see A.I. as a cost-saving shortcut. “It would be cheaper to have A.I. write a screenplay than it would be for me to write a screenplay,” Reese, the “Deadpool” writer, said. “I just know that in the back of my mind, that’s where the terror comes from.”\n\nFor Reese, a long-term answer to the unease that A.I. will reorder Hollywood could not come quickly enough.\n\n“If I could wave my magic wand and make A.I. go away, at least in the creative field,” he said, “I would absolutely wave the wand.”",

    "description": "The United States plans to deploy more high-tech missile systems to the Philippines to help deter aggression in the South China Sea, where the treaty allies on Tuesday condemned what they called China...",
    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States plans to deploy more high-tech missile systems to the Philippines to help deter aggression in the South China Sea, where the treaty allies on Tuesday condemned what they called China’s “illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities.”\n\nBeijing has repeatedly expressed alarm over the installation in the northern Philippines of a U.S. mid-range missile system called the Typhon in 2024 and of an anti-ship missile launcher last year. It said the U.S. weapons were aimed at containing China’s rise and warned that these were a threat to regional stability.\n\nChina has asked the Philippines to withdraw the missile launchers from its territory, but officials led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have rejected the demand.\n\nU.S. and Philippine officials held annual talks Monday in Manila on broadening security, political and economic engagements and boosting collaboration with regional security allies.\n\nThe U.S. and the Philippines outlined in a joint statement Tuesday specific defense and security plans for this year, including joint military exercises, Washington's support to help modernize the Philippine military and efforts “to increase deployments of U.S. cutting-edge missile and unmanned systems to the Philippines.”\n\nThe longtime allies \"underscored their support for preserving freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and other lawful uses of the sea for all nations,” the statement said.\n\n“Both sides condemned China’s illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive activities in the South China Sea, recognizing their adverse effects on regional peace and stability and the economies of the Indo-Pacific and beyond,” it added.\n\nConfrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard forces have spiked in the disputed waters in recent years. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in the territorial standoffs.\n\nNeither side elaborated on the planned missile deployments but Philippine ambassador to Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, who took part in Monday’s talks, said U.S. and Filipino defense officials discussed the possible deployment this year of “upgraded” types of U.S. missile launchers that the Philippines may eventually decide to purchase.\n\n“It’s a kind of system that’s really very sophisticated and will be deployed here in the hope that, down the road, we will be able to get our own,” Romualdez told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Typhon missile system that the U.S. Army deployed to the main northern Philippine region of Luzon in April 2024 and an anti-missile launcher called the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System that was deployed in April last year also to Luzon have remained in the Philippines, Romualdez said.\n\nDuring joint drills, U.S. forces have exhibited the missile systems to batches of Filipino forces to familiarize them with the weapons’ capabilities and usage, military officials said.\n\nRomualdez said the U.S. missile deployments to the Philippines did not aim to antagonize any country.\n\n“It’s purely for deterrence,” he said. “Every time the Chinese show any kind of aggression, it only strengthens our resolve to have these types.”\n\nThe Typhon missile launchers, a land-based weapon, can fire the Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range, from the northern Philippine region of Luzon.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Marines deployed the anti-ship missile launcher, the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System, to Batan island in the northernmost Philippine province of Batanes, which faces the Bashi Channel just south of Taiwan.\n\nThe sea passage is a critical trade and military route that the U.S. and Chinese militaries have tried to gain strategic control of.",
