Business Insider reached out to the contact provided on the website and did not immediately get a response.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has been aggressively executing on immigration enforcement; some of the tactics have led to highly publicized clashes between local community members and ICE agents.\n\nMinneapolis — the city where George Floyd was killed by a police officer — recently became a focal point of an immigration crackdown, and where an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Good, a US citizen.\n\nThe Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, an AFL-CIO affiliate, endorsed a move on Saturday encouraging local residents to skip work on January 23.\n\nThe White House has also targeted the tech industry by attaching a higher fee to the H-1B visa — a program tech companies and other industries have relied on to hire overseas talent.\n\nThe move has seen ripple effects from Big Tech, down to higher education.\n\nData from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center showed a 5.9% decline in enrollment at US universities by graduate international students for the Fall 2025 semester.",

    "fullText": "Feel like X's algorithm needs work? Elon Musk agrees.\n\nMusk isn't a fan of X's algorithm, and he's documenting the company's efforts to improve the technology that decides what you see in the platform's \"For You\" feed.\n\nMusk said he is overhauling the recommendation system that decides which user-generated posts and advertisements are shown when you open the app. He also pledged to make that system transparent in the process, with the underlying code getting published on GitHub every four weeks. Musk said any changes to the code will be explained with every post.\n\n\"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote on X. \"No other social media companies do this.\"\n\nX's engineering team has also said the new recommendation system is built on the same architecture as Grok, the chatbot developed by Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nWhile X has not said the two systems share training data or model weights, the comparison signals a shift toward more AI-driven content ranking, moving beyond the rules-based and engagement-heavy systems the app has historically relied on.\n\nKey questions remain about how the system operates in practice. X did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for more specifics on the algorithm.\n\nThe social media app, formerly known as Twitter, hasn't always relied on algorithms to serve its users.\n\nFrom its launch in 2006 through 2015, it presented posts in reverse chronological order, showing users the most recent tweets from accounts they followed.\n\nBut, in 2016, after several updates, a \"Show me the best tweets first\" option became the default for all users.\n\nOver time, the system grew more complex, incorporating engagement signals such as likes, replies, shares, and blocks to predict what content users were most likely to interact with or remove.\n\nMusk has long voiced frustrations with that algorithm.\n\nBefore acquiring Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he repeatedly described the platform's algorithm as a \"black box,\" arguing that it introduced political bias and failed to reflect users' true preferences — particularly for politically conservative users.\n\nHis complaints continued after the purchase. In a 2024 post, he said the rules-based algorithms had become too divisive.\n\n\"One of the strongest signals is if you forward X posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot, because it takes effort to forward,\" Musk wrote. \"Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realize that.\"\n\nHe recommended that users send videos of puppies to friends to combat the issue.",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk are at it again, with each of the tech titans taking aim at the other in a series of heated posts on X.\n\nMusk appeared to start the latest escalation early on Tuesday morning, when he posted \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT\" in response to a post that said that use of OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to the deaths of nine children and adults since it was released in 2022.\n\nAltman fired back, first in defense of ChatGPT and OpenAI's desire to protect its users, and then blasting Tesla's Autopilot technology, calling it unsafe.\n\n\"It is genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman continued, calling out Autopilot.\n\n\"I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released,\" he wrote. \"I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions.\"\n\nAltman added: \"You take 'every accusation is a confession' so far.\"\n\nThere have been at least eight wrongful-death lawsuits filed against OpenAI that allege use of ChatGPT has contributed to worsening mental health conditions, leading to instances of suicide and murder, including among children and young adults.\n\nSafety concerns around Tesla's self-driving technology have also been central to multiple wrongful-death lawsuits, including one surrounding a 2019 crash in Florida that left a 22-year-old woman dead. A jury determined Tesla was 33% liable for the crash and awarded the plaintiffs $329 million in total damages, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe social media feud comes as the pair is stuck in the middle of a long-running legal battle over OpenAI's status as a nonprofit company. Musk sued Altman, and other leaders of OpenAI, alleging that they misled him when they decided to pursue a for-profit structure, moving the company away from its original nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit.",

Because automakers see vehicle tech as a brand-defining component, a Tesla license can become a hard sell.\n\nRivian, for example, is going deeper into vertical integration by designing a proprietary chip for the brain behind the company's autonomous driving computer. CEO RJ Scaringe even broached the idea of pursuing a robotaxi business at Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day in early December.\n\nLegacy automakers aren't taking the same ambitious route of designing custom chips, but they have begun to seek in-house solutions.\n\nFord announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that it plans to develop eyes-off driving software for public roads by 2028. The company said going in-house cuts costs by 30% and provides more control over how the software is integrated and deployed.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" Paul Costa, Ford's head of electrical engineering, told Business Insider. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nMusk said in a X post in November that it was \"crazy\" that legacy automakers didn't want to license Tesla FSD, an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that the EV maker has said will enable fully autonomous driving.\n\n\"When legacy auto does occasionally reach out, they tepidly discuss implementing FSD for a tiny program in 5 years with unworkable requirements for Tesla, so pointless,\" Musk said in the post.\n\nMusk didn't specify what those requirements were. A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExperts who track the software side of the automotive industry told Business Insider there's a practical reason to go in-house, even if there are near-term challenges.\n\nChris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte who consults for key automakers, told Business Insider that companies have to decide what level of autonomy their customer base will want and how to achieve it, like using lidar or using a cameras-only system.",

    "fullText": "Tesla boss clashed with Michael O’Leary when airline boss rejected installing Starlink technology on aircraft\n\nElon Musk has floated the idea of buying the budget airline Ryanair, escalating his public spat with the Irish carrier’s boss, Michael O’Leary.\n\nThe two outspoken businessmen have locked horns since last week, when O’Leary was asked whether he would follow Lufthansa and British Airways in installing Musk’s Starlink satellite internet technology on his fleet of 650 aircraft.\n\nThe Ryanair chief executive rejected the idea, saying that adding antennas to the jets would result in “2% fuel drag”, adding an extra $200m-$250m to its $5bn (£3.71bn) annual kerosene bill.\n\nMusk said that interpretation was “misinformed” in a post on his X platform, prompting a tit-for-tat exchange of insults, with each calling the other an “idiot” and then the Tesla and SpaceX CEO saying O’Leary should be fired.\n\nOn Friday, the world’s richest person asked his followers on X whether he should buy Europe’s biggest airline, which is valued at €30bn (£26bn), posting: “Should I buy Ryan Air and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?”\n\nHe followed it up with a poll asking whether he should “Buy Ryan Air and restore Ryan as their rightful ruler”. More than three-quarters of the nearly 900,000 respondents said yes, three hours before the poll closed. Tony Ryan, the Irish billionaire businessman who co-founded the budget airline in 1984, died in 2007.\n\nRyanair’s X account also mocked Musk, posting in response to an X outage across the US last week: “Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?”\n\nMusk wrote in a reply to a post from the airline teasing him: “How much would it cost to buy you?”\n\nAll this may look like idle talk, but the billionaire has followed through on such threats before. In a social media exchange in 2017 he tweeted that he loved Twitter and when a journalist suggested he should buy it, Musk replied: “How much is it?” He bought the platform almost five years later in a $44bn deal, later renaming it X.\n\nHowever, movements in the airline’s share price on Tuesday suggested investors were not taking the idea of a takeover seriously, with Ryanair shares closing nearly 1% down.\n\nMusk was born in South Africa and, after a stint in Canada, now lives in the US. Airlines based in the EU must be majority-owned by EU nationals or citizens of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein under the bloc’s rules.\n\nThe row began when O’Leary spoke on Irish radio on Friday, telling an interviewer that he would take no notice of what the Tesla CEO had to say about installing wifi on Ryanair planes.\n\n“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,” he told Newstalk. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot … What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”\n\nHe claimed that adding a Starlink antenna to every jet would push the fuel bill up by “an extra dollar for every passenger we fly and the reality for us is we can’t afford those costs. Passengers won’t pay for internet usage; if it’s free, they’ll use it – but they won’t pay one euro each to use the internet.”\n\nO’Leary, 64, also said he was “thankfully” too old to have any social media accounts.\n\nRyanair was contacted for comment.",

    "fullText": "Inside the big rewards tech titans have reaped from caving to Trump. Plus, a look at the US datacenter boom and the effects of Australia’s social media ban\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, the Guardian’s US tech editor.\n\nOne year ago today, Donald Trump was inaugurated as president of the United States. Standing alongside him that day were the leaders of the tech industry’s most powerful companies, who had donated to him in an unprecedented bending of the knee. In the ensuing year, the companies have reaped enormous rewards from their alliance with Trump, which my colleague Nick Robins-Early and I wrote about last month after Trump signed an executive order prohibiting states from passing laws regulating AI. Trump has sponsored the tech industry with billions in government funding and with diplomatic visits that featured CEOs as his fellow negotiators in massive, lucrative deals.\n\nAs year two of Trump’s second term begins, Silicon Valley’s titans appear poised to enrich themselves even more with the president’s enthusiastic aid.\n\nToday in tech, we’re exploring the political consequences of the expansion of datacenters in the US and Europe as well as taking stock of Australia’s under-16 social media ban.\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his goal of total deregulation of AI and his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nTrump’s anxiety is evident in two actions last week. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n““We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nAnd then on Friday, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as my colleagues Oliver Milman and Dharna Noor reported over the weekend, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue which has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On Thursday, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like the rest of us (Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon). Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters, but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those of the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost of living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021.

    "fullText": "DoorDash, one of the biggest names in delivery, is trying to deliver even more.\n\nThe company's couriers, known internally as \"dashers,\" are a common sight as they zip around the US delivering food, groceries, and other goods to customers.\n\nNow, DoorDash is investing in new tech, including autonomous vehicles, as it looks to the future. CEO Tony Xu said on an earnings call in November that DoorDash would invest hundreds of millions of dollars this year in key initiatives, including a global tech platform for all its brands and autonomous tech.\n\nDoorDash employees don't just work on big problems, though. The company requires its corporate workforce to periodically make deliveries themselves through a program called WeDash.\n\nSome of the people making all of that happen at DoorDash corporate have joined the company from outside the US, and the company has sponsored H-1B visas.\n\nEmployers include salary information when submitting applications to the US Department of Labor for H-1B work visas. The publicly available data includes ranges for base pay, but excludes equity or other benefits that companies often offer employees. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers in similar roles.\n\nIn the year ending September 30, 2025, DoorDash submitted roughly 540 H-1B visa applications, which can offer insight into what the delivery company pays for certain jobs.\n\nThe H-1B visa application process is changing under President Donald Trump.\n\nIn September, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications. He's also proposed changes to work visa rules that could tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nHere's a look at some of the jobs for which DoorDash has disclosed salaries in the work visa data. DoorDash did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter at abitter@businessinsider.com or via encrypted messaging app Signal at 808-854-4501.

    "title": "Elon Musk said automakers don't want to license Tesla FSD. We're starting to see why.",
    "description": "Legacy automakers and Tesla rival Rivian have recently announced roadmaps to pursue autonomous driving technology in-house.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has called legacy automakers' hesitancy to license Tesla's Full Self-Driving software \"crazy,\" but a slew of industry moves show that their reluctance is strategic.\n\nIn recent weeks, more automakers have released roadmaps to build key pieces of automated driving software rather than outsourcing the technology. Because automakers see vehicle tech as a brand-defining component, a Tesla license can become a hard sell.\n\nRivian, for example, is going deeper into vertical integration by designing a proprietary chip for the brain behind the company's autonomous driving computer. CEO RJ Scaringe even broached the idea of pursuing a robotaxi business at Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day in early December.\n\nLegacy automakers aren't taking the same ambitious route of designing custom chips, but they have begun to seek in-house solutions.\n\nFord announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that it plans to develop eyes-off driving software for public roads by 2028. The company said going in-house cuts costs by 30% and provides more control over how the software is integrated and deployed.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" Paul Costa, Ford's head of electrical engineering, told Business Insider. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nMusk said in a X post in November that it was \"crazy\" that legacy automakers didn't want to license Tesla FSD, an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that the EV maker has said will enable fully autonomous driving.\n\n\"When legacy auto does occasionally reach out, they tepidly discuss implementing FSD for a tiny program in 5 years with unworkable requirements for Tesla, so pointless,\" Musk said in the post.\n\nMusk didn't specify what those requirements were. A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExperts who track the software side of the automotive industry told Business Insider there's a practical reason to go in-house, even if there are near-term challenges.\n\nChris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte who consults for key automakers, told Business Insider that companies have to decide what level of autonomy their customer base will want and how to achieve it, like using lidar or using a cameras-only system.\n\n\"It's not so much like, 'I'm taking it in-house because I don't want to use somebody's technology.' But this is a competitive business for them,\" Ahn said. \"People who own Fords own Fords for certain reasons that are probably different reasons than why people who own Mercedes own Mercedes. And I think each of these automakers are going to have to define what does ADAS mean for the user base of my brand today.\"\n\nSteve Man, a senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider that the technology stack of autonomous vehicles could be thought of as three interconnected parts: the software, the sensors, and the actuators — the components that control the physical movement of the car.\n\nAll three components need to be able to \"talk\" to each other within a vehicle platform, Man said, which can be challenging and costly to do when an automaker relies on multiple suppliers.\n\n\"It's actually cheaper to bring everything in-house to integrate those three buckets of things,\" Man said.\n\nAs automakers seek more control over their technology, the tools to build autonomy are becoming more accessible. That makes a Tesla FSD license a less compelling business case.\n\nAt CES, Nvidia introduced Alpamayo, a package of AI reasoning models, simulation tools, and datasets automakers can use to develop self-driving technology.\n\nMercedes-Benz was revealed to be Nvidia's first major customer; the automaker plans to launch a Tesla FSD-level ADAS built on Alpamayo by the end of the year.\n\nAlpamayo isn't a full-stack autonomous driving software that automakers simply plug in. An Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider it's a toolset that can \"strengthen and speed up an OEM's own ADAS or autonomy program, whether they're building end-to-end systems or upgrading existing architectures.\"\n\nAutomakers still need proprietary data and talent to implement and develop their autonomous systems.\n\nHugh Nguyen, a KPMG partner who specializes in autonomous driving systems, told Business Insider that Alpamayo \"democratizes\" AV development by reducing the cost and time for training self-driving systems.\n\nDuring a Q&A session at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Tesla FSD \"completely world-class,\" before drawing a distinction between Tesla's goals and Nvidia's.\n\n\"We're not a self-driving car company,\" he said. \"We just want to enable the world's autonomous industry. Everything that moves should be autonomous.\"",

    "title": "Open source's new mission: Rebuild the EU tech stack",
    "description": "Opinion: Freedom can be very contagious if it grows on its own terms. Europe of all places should know that",
    "fullText": "Opinion Europe is famous for having the most tightly regulated non-existent tech sector in the world. This is a mildly unfair characterization, as there are plenty of tech enterprises across the continent, quite a respectable smattering if it wasn't for the US doing everything at least ten times bigger.\n\nQuite the problem, sighed the EU’s 2024 Draghi Report on European competitiveness. Those regulations regressively hit startups and SMEs the hardest, there's no central capital market for funding innovation, while Uncle Sam's wallet opens wide for the ambitious and talented. It looked bad in 2024, when tech deficit was primarily an economic matter. Mix in the changes since then, and you can apply the five word version of all Russian history — \"And then it got worse.\"\n\nWhich is why the EU is now eagerly looking to open source as part of digital decolonization. It wants to end dependency on American software and services, not just for a healthier and more influential home sector, but to protect itself from hostile leverage.\n\nThe EU being the way it is, it wants to think big, and there's no doubt that FOSS has an infinite appetite for resources and relevance. FOSS is also mostly immune to EU regulations, which exist to protect citizens from systematic abuse. That possibility barely exists in open source development. You don't have to tell a bird not to rob banks.\n\nIt's just that you couldn't find a bigger culture clash between top-down and bottom-up if you invested a billion euros on a 27-nation research project. Finding the sweet spot where EU involvement can make the biggest difference to FOSS enterprise adoption, while maintaining the essential spark of agility and freedom that brings FOSS alive, that's where technical, economic and cultural engineering needs to happen. Fast.\n\nOpen source by itself is no guarantee of independence. Linux is the giant hogweed of European open source, even if it started four years before its home nation of Finland joined the EU. It has kept the internet and supercomputing free of commercial or state monopoly. The best it could do in mobile, though, is maintenance of an American OS duopoly. In the enterprise and public sector, it has done nothing to crimp Microsoft's tendrils. Which is where the EU most desperately needs it to succeed.\n\nAnd this is not for want of technical prowess, nor interoperability. In fact, there is far too much. Linux desktops have been enterprise-class for more than a decade, and of late the options for integration with Windows apps and functionality have flowered like fridge contents in a midsummer power cut. As Windows has got worse, the interoperable Linux choices have become better.\n\nThere are many options. Wine just gets better and better, no matter what distro you use. Windows-focused distros like Zorin OS come with lots of ways to look and function like Windows, including web app integration so online Word and Outlook integrate with the desktop. Products like Winboat offer highly optimized containerization to bring Windows apps to near-native Linux behavior. High performance specialized emulations like Winlator can run native x86 games — the good ones — on Android.\n\nWhat all these show is that small teams, even one-man bands, can use the very high quality software components freely available to almost completely remove old ideas of performance and functionality as batteries to platform-independent computing. The skills, the tools, the hardware and the whole production chain have been democratized. Given motivation and modest resources, FOSS designers can work miracles — and will. The downside is that there are too many good choices, making selection and support untenable in most organizations. Windows is Windows is Windows. Or it would be, if Microsoft stopped mucking about.\n\nWhat FOSS per se is bad at, is synchronizing with specific needs. It can do it with the right people, see Red Hat, but those people can also take it into darkness. Stare too long into the abyss, and the enterprise stares back at you. Focus, alignment, the disciplines of documentation, support and detail, get harder the more complex a system becomes.\n\nThis is where the EU could start to make an immediate difference to open source. It can say that it wants an open source desktop system that has explicit Windows migration support through a mix of technologies that will remain stable and supportable, and that reflects the particular needs of the EU's public and private sectors. This will be a state requirement that absolutely does not need state resources to meet.\n\nThen comes the support structure. Whatever team builds the distro will be the top tier of support, with everything else handled elsewhere. The EU's job will be to co-ordinate support for states, doing so in as transparent a way as possible so that the private sector can create and integrate support for itself. It's no different in the broadest terms to how support should work with departmental, company, and contracted support tiers, but with many more options, no secrets, and resources flowing into FOSS development as requirements evolve.\n\nThis whole process can be argued as necessary for EU state security and sovereignty, arguments we already hear loudly from Europe's erstwhile allies as reasons for far more than a new desktop OS. The initial migration will be as incremental and non-disruptive as possible, the aim being to demonstrate and sustain a new model of infrastructure evolution, one that can go on to power a roadmap of accelerating replacement and renewal.\n\nIt is very difficult to force the evolution of FOSS if the environment is wrong. It is very difficult to stop it, or even slow it down, when the environment is right. The EU knows what it wants and why it wants it. It also knows it can't force it. What it can do is create the right conditions and step back. Open source asks for no more than that. ®",

    "description": "Tech News News: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims .",
    "fullText": "MacKenzie Scott's ex-wife, Jeff Bezos, has donated millions to the Solidaire Network, which funds groups facing FBI and congressional investigations for alleged Hamas ties. While Scott's donations are unrestricted, the network supports organizations like Students for Justice in Palestine. Scott has given billions to various causes, impacting diversity programs and higher education. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims that the billionaire philanthropist donated millions of dollars to a funding network that supports organisations now facing FBI and congressional investigations over alleged ties to Hamas. In 2025, Scott reportedly donated $5 million, and in 2021, $10 million, to the Solidaire Network through her charity, Yield Giving. The network describes itself as connecting social movements with donors to build systems based on love and justice.However, Solidaire Network has funded groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), according to tax records and press releases reviewed by Fortune. Both organisations are under investigation by the House and Senate for allegedly working with the terror group Hamas to organise anti-Israel protests in the United States.The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent a letter to AMP's executive director in May 2024 expressing concern that groups spreading pro-Hamas messages and breaking laws on college campuses may be receiving money from sources supporting Hamas or other terrorist organisations.US Senator Tom Cotton also asked the FBI in September 2025 to investigate the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), calling it hateful toward Jewish people after its leader, Aisha Nizar, urged supporters to disrupt the US F-35 fighter jet supply chain, the report noted.In a statement (shared by Fortune), Cotton said, “Nizar’s statements constitute direct incitement of violence against U.S. national security interests by advocating for actions against the men and women who build the F-35 and seeking to imperil the delivery of one of the nation’s most strategic assets.”Scott donated more than $7 billion in 2025 alone, bringing her total giving since 2020 to $26 billion across over 2,700 donations. With a net worth of about $40 billion, mostly from her divorce settlement, she ranks among the world's biggest donors alongside Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett. Most of her 2025 donations supported diversity programmes, disaster relief, and colleges.What the Solidaire Network said about MacKenzie Scott’s donationsIt's important to note that the Solidaire Network also funds other progressive groups working on racial and gender equality, climate change, and economic fairness. Scott was also just one of more than 280 people who donated to Solidaire Network in 2021.\"Funding social movements while transforming our own relationship to wealth is clearly the way to go for philanthropy. MacKenzie's generous, no-strings-attached gift honours our bold ambitions for our collective work,” the Solidaire Network noted.Around that time, Solidaire Network had just given out multimillion-dollar grants through its Black Liberation Pooled Fund, Movement Protection Fund, and Movement Infrastructure Fund.As Scott's donations have no restrictions, which means the receiving organisation can spend the money however it chooses, there's no proof that her 2021 or 2025 gifts went directly to SJP or AMP.On January 30, 2024, Solidaire Network also announced it started a Unity & Power Fund to support the “movement for a permanent ceasefire and against Islamophobia and antisemitism.” SJP and AMP mainly focus on \"Palestinian freedom\" and firm opposition to Israel.“We need more philanthropic partners to show up during these flashpoints, and we also need their longer-term support to grow and sustain our work beyond this crisis moment. We are only able to do this work because of the multi-year funding we have received through committed partners like Solidaire Network,” Stacey Krueger of Palestine Legal said in a statement.While some people have criticised Scott's donation to Solidaire Network, she's widely recognised as one of the most impactful charitable donors in recent years. She's made a real difference for diversity-focused organisations and groups working on higher education, veterans' issues, social justice, disaster relief, and climate change. For example, Scott gave $80 million to Howard University last fall, and the school said the gift came at an “opportune time” as the US government shutdown delayed annual federal money the university receives to support students, academic programs, research, and hospital operations.Scott has also said her giving was inspired by her college roommate, who lent her $1,000 so she wouldn't have to quit school, and her dentist, who gave her free dental work after seeing her use denture glue to fix a broken tooth in college.In a blog post from December 2025, Scott wrote, “Generosity and kindness engage the same pleasure centres in the brain as sex, food, and receiving gifts, and they improve our health and long-term happiness as well. The peace-fostering byproducts of one unexpected act of kindness toward a stranger of a different background or beliefs might inspire a beneficial chain reaction that goes on for years.”Sotheby's International Realty said Scott has donated an estimated $14 billion to causes, including racial equality, LGBTQ+ equality, strengthening functional democracy, and climate action. She now ranks sixth on the list of the world's top 10 philanthropists, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The Sotheby's list adds that Scott's gifts support nonprofit groups working against racial injustice, advancing gender equality, and backing public health programs.",

    "description": "Vay is rental car service startup that is fully embracing remote-driving technology in order to deliver cars to users without a human inside.",
    "fullText": "In the world of robotaxis, there's a stigma around remote driving. Are you really \"driverless\" if there's a person — even remotely — at the wheel?\n\nOne startup is fully embracing it.\n\nVay is a Berlin-based startup founded by two engineers and a former Zoox employee.\n\nThe company is taking a somewhat contrarian approach to what it calls a \"driverless car.\"\n\nInstead of automating the ride-hailing service, which can be technically challenging and costly to scale, Vay wants to rethink how we rent cars.\n\nTo do so, Vay wants to leverage remote-driving technology and, eventually, autonomy to deliver cars without humans inside to people who need a private vehicle for less than a day.\n\nThomas von der Ohe, cofounder and CEO of Vay, told Business Insider that the goal is to be cheaper than an Uber and more convenient than a traditional brick-and-mortar rental program.\n\n\"It's basically by far the most affordable A to B transport,\" von der Ohe, a former technical program manager during the early days of Zoox, said. \"It's half the price of Uber and half the price of robotaxis. How it works: We just bring the car, you then drive, and then when you're done, you don't have to park.\"\n\nVon der Ohe spent less than two years at Zoox when the company was just 60 people large and had yet to be acquired by Amazon. The Vay cofounder said he oversaw some of the first public testing of Zoox cars when there were safety drivers inside the vehicle.\n\nAt the robotaxi company, von der Ohe said he saw a goal with an ever-shifting timeline.\n\n\"It always felt like it was three years out,\" he said of autonomous driving. \"And then every year it shifted by a year. So we wanted to have self-driving cars everywhere in 2020 at Zoox. And then it was 2021 and so forth.\"\n\nVon der Ohe left Zoox in 2018. Instead of fixating on robotaxis, von der Ohe wanted to stay in mobility but work on something that could be faster to bring to market and easier to scale with less capital. Vay was born.\n\nCustomers order a car the same way they hail an Uber or Lyft through Vay's app. To rent a car, users have to upload a driver's license and a photo of themselves.\n\nVay proposes that users can get a car delivered to them without a driver within minutes, as long as they're within the service area or geofence. If you're out of the service area, then you're out of luck.\n\nOnce the car is delivered, the renter takes over.\n\nThe startup services Las Vegas, where it manages a fleet of 100 Kia Niros, a compact, all-electric SUV. Each Kia is retrofitted with four cameras. There are no other sensors, von der Ohe said.\n\nThe Vay cofounder told Business Insider that the service area is about twice the size of San Francisco.\n\nInside Vay's Vegas office, there are about eight driving stations, in which a trained human operator remotely controls Vay's vehicle fleet. The setup looks like a video game simulation with three computer screens and a disembodied driver's seat.\n\nA large red button to the left of the driver's seat activates an emergency protocol during which the car pulls over to the side of the road.\n\nVincent Reddy, an operations lead for Vay, said that there are several criteria a remote driver needs to meet, including completing about 1,000 kilometers of remote driving. Reddy remotely drove Business Insider during a demo ride.\n\n\"It's similar to kind of like a high-grade racing sim,\" Reddy said of the driving experience. \"The thing that feels the most different is not having the feedback of what it feels like driving over bumps and things on the road because the seat doesn't move. There's no G-force, or you don't get the feeling of accelerating or braking.\"\n\nTo deliver the cars, Vay only uses the remote-driving technology on local roads and stays under 25 mph. The car can go on the highway once the customer takes over the vehicle.\n\nThere were no notable incidents during a 10-minute driverless ride around the block of Vay's Vegas office.\n\nVay's value proposition to customers is that the service is cheaper and more flexible than hailing an Uber.\n\nVon der Ohe told Business Insider that the service should be about 50% cheaper than the average Uber ride.\n\nUsers are charged by the minute, with a decreased price if they are parked, in case they, for example, need to grab groceries or hit the gym.\n\nWhen Business Insider viewed the app, the pricing was at $0.35 per minute while driving and $0.05 per minute while parked. At those prices, a 30-minute drive to and from a destination, including an hour-and-a-half stop, would cost around $25.\n\nWhen asked if the pricing will change based on demand, von der Ohe said the company doesn't yet have a pricing mechanism, such as surge pricing, in place, but expects there will be changes to the structure.\n\nThe CEO said he can keep the costs low because Vay's vehicle fleet doesn't have a complex sensor suite, and the remote operators manage multiple cars.\n\nVon der Ohe said that as of January 2026, there is one remote operator for every 10 vehicles. However, that doesn't mean a remote driver is operating 10 vehicles at the same time. Instead, a remote operator can deliver one car and immediately move on to the next vehicle.\n\n\"So I have much more cars and remote drivers, and that's why we make it half the price,\" he said.\n\nVay employs about 200 people and raised more than $200 million, including a $60 million investment from Grab Holdings, the Singaporean tech company that owns Grab, the super app of Southeast Asia.\n\nWhile von der Ohe told Business Insider that building a fully autonomous ride experience like Waymo is not on Vay's road map, the CEO said his startup will gradually add autonomous driving features.\n\n\"We're not in competition with them,\" von der Ohe said of robotaxi operators.\n\nSince its founding, Vay has provided 35,000 trips, according to the CEO.\n\nHe said the service has especially seen high demand during the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nWhen Von der Ohe opened the app, the wait time to get a car was 31 minutes.\n\n\"It's extremely busy today already,\" he said. \"It's a long way. It should be five.\"",

    "fullText": "I am a science-fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to.\n\nWhat I do not do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean we couldn’t change it.\n\nNow, not everyone understands the distinction. They think science-fiction writers are oracles. Even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that we can “see the future”.\n\nThen there are science-fiction fans who believe that they are reading the future. A depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. These guys can’t shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI.\n\nThat’s something I used to strenuously resist doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentlessly bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn’t understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, they insisted that I must be a paid shill.\n\nThis is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is just too short. That said, people would not stop asking – so I’m going to explain what I think about AI and how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: “How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm.”\n\nIn automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete.\n\nA reverse centaur is a machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.\n\nFor example, an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras that monitor the driver’s eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver’s mouth because singing is not allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they do not make quota.\n\nThe driver is in that van because the van cannot drive itself and cannot get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance.\n\nObviously, it’s nice to be a centaur, and it’s horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaurlike, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse centaurs, which none of us want to be.\n\nBut like I said, the job of a science-fiction writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it is technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it is impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you to think that it is for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite.\n\nThis is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher’s mantra was: “There is no alternative.” She repeated this so often they called her “Tina” Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative.\n\n“There is no alternative” is a cheap rhetorical slight. It’s a demand dressed up as an observation. “There is no alternative” means: “stop trying to think of an alternative.”\n\nI’m a science-fiction writer – my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast.\n\nSo let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble and who the reverse-centaur army is serving, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality.\n\nStart with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don’t compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels.\n\nGoogle and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than $20bn a year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% search market share.\n\nNow, you would think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector.\n\nBut it’s actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a “growth stock”, and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you are making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the “price to earnings ratio” or “PE ratio”.\n\nBut once a company stops growing, it is a “mature” stock, and it trades at a much lower PE ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth $10. It has a PE ratio of 10, while Amazon has a PE ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36.\n\nIt’s wonderful to run a company that has a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeros into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors.\n\nSo when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeros into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars.\n\nThat’s the upside of having a growth stock. But here is the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you going to grow?\n\nIf you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you are not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the US than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, $240bn sell-off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history.\n\nThat’s a monopolist’s worst nightmare, because once you’re presiding over a “mature” firm, the key employees you have been compensating with stock experience a precipitous pay drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars – not shares.\n\nThis is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they do not trust your pricing power.\n\nWhich is why growth-stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video or cryptocurrency or NFTs or the metaverse or AI.\n\nI am not saying that tech bosses are making bets they do not plan on winning. But winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along.\n\nSo this is why they’re hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment.\n\nNow I want to talk about how they’re selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use “disrupt” here in its most disreputable tech-bro sense.\n\nThe promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AI that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself and give the other half to the AI company.\n\nThat is the $13tn growth story that Morgan Stanley is telling. It’s why big investors are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family’s financial security.\n\nNow, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We would have to figure out what to do with all these unemployed people.\n\nBut AI can’t do your job. It can help you do your job, but that does not mean it is going to save anyone money.\n\nTake radiology: there is some evidence that AI can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss. Look, I’ve got cancer. Thankfully, it’s very treatable, but I’ve got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible.\n\nLet’s say my hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: “Hey folks, here’s the deal. Today, you’re processing about 100 X-rays per day. From now on, we’re going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you’ve missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you’re only processing 98 X-rays per day. That’s fine, we just care about finding all those tumors.”\n\nIf that’s what they said, I’d be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market’s bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: “Look, you fire nine out of 10 of your radiologists, saving $20m a year. You give us $10m a year, and you net $10m a year, and the remaining radiologists’ job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed – and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it’s catastrophically wrong.\n\n“And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist’s fault, because they are the ‘human in the loop’. It’s their signature on the diagnosis.”\n\nThis is a reverse centaur, and it is a specific kind of reverse centaur: it is what Dan Davies calls an “accountability sink”. The radiologist’s job is not really to oversee the AI’s work, it is to take the blame for the AI’s mistakes.\n\nThis is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can’t do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can’t do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble.\n\nIf you are someone who is worried about cancer, and you are being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we are going to have to rehouse America’s 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say: “Well, OK, I’m sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I’m on.”\n\nAI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs’ labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers.\n\nNow, some people will be on the workers’ side because of politics or aesthetics. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you.\n\nWill those products be substandard? There is every reason to think so.\n\nThink of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI. Using AI for simple tasks can genuinely make them more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it’s clear they are not hoping to make some centaurs.\n\nThey want to fire a lot of tech workers – 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AI’s code.\n\nAnd because AI is just a word-guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are nearly indistinguishable from working code.\n\nFor example: programmers routinely use standard “code libraries” to handle routine tasks. Say you want your program to slurp in a document and make some kind of sense of it – find all the addresses, say, or all the credit card numbers. Rather than writing a program to break down a document into its constituent parts, you’ll just grab a library that does it for you.\n\nThese libraries come in families, and they have predictable names. If it’s a library for pulling in an html file, it might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it’s a for docx file, it’ll be lib.docx.text.parsing.\n\nBut reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there will be another library, say, one for parsing pdfs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it’s called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Someone just entered an incorrect library name and it stuck. Like I said, the world is messy.\n\nNow, AI is a statistical inference engine. All it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past. That means that it will “hallucinate” a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing, because that matches the pattern it’s already seen. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into the AI’s program, and it will do things like steal user data or try to penetrate other computers on the same network.\n\nAnd you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard-to-find error, this bug that is indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they have been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire.\n\nBut guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don’t think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company’s top management. The kind of coder who would lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google $10bn in 2018.\n\nFor AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the workers who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors.\n\nIf you can replace coders with AI, who can’t you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI.\n\nWhich brings me to AI art – or “art” – which is often used as an ad for AI, even though it is not part of AI’s business model.\n\nLet me explain: on average, illustrators do not make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precarious groups of workers out there. If AI image-generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of OpenAI’s campuses.\n\nThe purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It is to create buzz. Which is not to say that it is not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that “some creative jobs shouldn’t have been there in the first place”.\n\nIt’s supposed to be disgusting. It’s supposed to get artists to run around and say: “The AI can do my job, and it’s going to steal my job, and isn’t that terrible?“\n\nBut can AI do an illustrator’s job? Or any artist’s job?\n\nLet’s think about that for a second. I have been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story. Here’s what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, a poem, a painting, a drawing, a dance, a book or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind.\n\nBut the image-generation program does not know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred-thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero.\n\nIt is possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or the Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, interesting or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human.\n\nAnd in the meantime, it’s bad art. It’s bad art in the sense of being “eerie”, the word that cultural theorist Mark Fisher used to describe “when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something”.\n\nAI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it is missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it is undetectable.\n\nWe should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism’s fatalism: “There is no alternative.”\n\nSo what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model.\n\nAnd I am here to tell you they are wrong. Wrong because this would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason. I’ll explain:\n\nAI training involves scraping a bunch of webpages, which is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for.\n\nAnd after you count all the pixels or the words, it is time for the final step: publishing them. Because that is what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array.\n\nAnd again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which factual statements you can publish.\n\nBut hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I’m full of shit. That’s fine. It wouldn’t be the first time someone thought that.\n\nAfter all, even if I’m right about how copyright works now, there’s no reason we couldn’t change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there’s even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don’t like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing – such as search engines and academic scholarship.\n\nWell, even then, you’re not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. We have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer.\n\nAnd today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also – the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than it has ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators’ bosses at the media company.\n\nIn a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming: “Think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!”\n\nCreative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what’s good for you.\n\nA new copyright to train models will not get us a world where models are not used to destroy artists, it will just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss.\n\nWhen really what they’re demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders’ pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal?\n\nWe need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment.\n\nIncredibly enough, there is a really simple way to do that. After more than 20 years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists’ rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That is why the “monkey selfie” is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium.\n\nAnd not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they have defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle.\n\nThe fact that every AI-created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them or give them away for nothing. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission.\n\nThe US Copyright Office’s position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you are a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that’s no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you are a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted.\n\nBut creative workers do not have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers’ strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in “sectoral bargaining”, whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector.\n\nThat has been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright.\n\nAI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible.\n\nBubbles transfer the life savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it.\n\nBut not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It’s still in the ground. At my home, I’ve got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber.\n\nIt would have been better if Worldcom had not ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage.\n\nI do not think we will salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. When crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey jpegs.\n\nAI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the datacenters will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind?\n\nWe will have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We will have a lot of cheap GPUs, which will be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who will be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we will have the open-source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video; describing images; summarizing documents; and automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing – such as removing backgrounds or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open-source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamed of.\n\nIf there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We would call them “plugins”.\n\nIt’s the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn’t want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, “disruptive” things: big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year.\n\nWhen the AI-investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won’t be economical to keep the datacenters running. As Stein’s law has it: “Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops.”\n\nThe collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100bn IOU.\n\nAI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more.\n\nTo pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever more outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side.\n\nBecause the AI bubble really is very bad news, it’s worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with hi-tech asbestos.\n\nCory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist.

    "description": "Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a senior software engineer, explains how AI integration and prompt engineering are changing hiring in Big Tech software roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a 29-year-old senior software engineer based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a Big Tech employee for the past eight years, working at Google, Amazon, Splunk, and now Salesforce. I've had a front-row seat to witness the changes in the tech landscape.\n\nI've learned which skill sets software engineers need to land a job offer in the AI era. Tech companies agree that AI makes engineers more productive, so engineers are expected to use it to build things more quickly and reliably.\n\nI personally make heavy use of AI to help me with boilerplate stuff so that I can concentrate on the hard stuff, like system design and complex business logic.\n\nWhen I was interviewing for software engineering jobs in 2020, LeetCode and system design were the de facto standards for cracking a job interview. Job seekers who had an advanced understanding of data structures and algorithms would come out on top.\n\nToday, this is just the baseline expectation. AI is now widely used for coding, review, and design, so tech companies, especially startups, expect more from candidates.\n\nSome skills remain the same: Software engineers still need a problem-solving mindset and should know how to scale systems and leverage cloud services. New hires must now also understand prompt engineering — how to leverage AI to code a solution more efficiently.\n\nYou need to be able to use AI for error handling and bug fixing. AI systems integration is another important new skill that involves incorporating AI into existing workflows, scaling AI systems, and determining when to use traditional versus AI solutions for business decisions.\n\nYou're still expected to have fundamental knowledge of core system design, data structures, and algorithms. You can still expect interviewers to test your problem-solving approaches, and if you know how to make the correct tradeoffs in time and space. Interviewers still care about debugging skills, since AI makes a lot of fundamental logic errors.\n\nYou also need to be prepared for some new things. I've seen firsthand that working with AI assistants in live screen-sharing mode is now allowed in some interviews. Interviewers are looking to see if you can help them achieve their business outcomes by combining software engineering skills with AI prompting.\n\nIn an interview I had with a Silicon Valley startup in 2024, I expected the hiring team to give traditional coding challenges. I was taken aback when I was given a huge code file and asked to debug a buggy behavior, and the interviewers explicitly said I could use AI assistance.\n\nI ignored the invitation to use AI, thinking I was supposed to do it myself, and ended up spending a lot of time on the problem to no avail. I failed that interview. That was an eye-opener for me about AI's new role in this field.\n\nYou may also be asked system design questions about where AI should be integrated into the current business workflow, or to discuss the trade-offs of using AI and traditional approaches in various problem contexts.\n\nDuring my own system design interviews, I noticed companies starting to ask questions about how to integrate AI to enhance existing systems and support a particular model lifecycle in terms of infrastructure. What I've seen is that companies give access to a small codebase and expect you to deliver a small feature in about one hour, which is impossible without AI. With AI, you can roll it out easily.\n\nI've also been asked behavioral questions, like \"How do you plan to evaluate the use of AI in order to make the workflow better?\" and \"How do you plan to balance automation and manual oversight?\"\n\nFor new graduates, here's how to show hiring teams that you're equipped for the emerging needs of the software engineering role.\n\nStart by contributing to open-source projects on AI or any other GitHub project. This demonstrates that you can navigate a production codebase and work on it independently to build a new feature or fix a bug. For solo repositories, include a README that explains the rationale for your decision.\n\nIncorporate the use of AI in traditional repositories to demonstrate hands-on experience with AI integration. Don't just deploy and run it locally — try to deploy it to the cloud. Many cloud providers provide free student credits.\n\nFocus on prompting AI to drive intended outcomes more effectively by providing structured input and output. Skills like AWS or GCP cloud certifications demonstrate your ability to be a keen learner.\n\nLearn different problem-solving patterns and practice these skills regularly. Muscle memory and pattern recognition go a long way.\n\nFor experienced software engineers, your biggest asset is your deep engineering experience — here are three tips that will help you in 2026 and beyond.\n\nPairing years of engineering expertise with impressive AI skills will get the attention of hiring managers. Consider boning up on these complementary skills:\n\nSenior software engineers don't just build; they also need to strategize and innovate. Try to understand the trade-offs of relying on a third-party API versus using an open-source one and fine-tuning it for your business purposes. Questions on cost, reliability, and maintainability should always be top of mind as you develop an AI product mindset.\n\nIdentify workflows that have a great deal of manual involvement in your current job, and use AI to see if you can improve them. You can leverage AI to help you brainstorm on how to make it more efficient.\n\nBoth veteran and newbie engineers should stay curious: find out the cool technologies and AI agents available in today's market, but don't abandon fundamental engineering approaches. The hybrid understanding of these technologies is what makes you valuable.\n\nIf I were interviewing, I'd position myself as a 'hybrid engineer.' Don't just be a pure coder or just a prompt engineer. Be the bridge.",

    "fullText": "China is now a key market for global carmakers, and, surprisingly, buyers there are shifting back to sedans that offer serious tech. Automakers are pushing boundaries to get noticed, and Nissan is one of them. The brand launched two new electrified sedans and a refreshed Teana late last year – the latter being the more premium take on the Altima sold in the US.\n\nThe new Teana, built by Dongfeng Nissan, puts a big emphasis on tech and interior quality. It looks a class above what you’d expect from an Altima-based sedan. Part of that comes from a glowing AI speaker on the dash, but the real surprise is the material choice. Nissan worked with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC) to use Durabio, a plant-based plastic that looks and feels closer to crystal than the usual trim.\n\nIn China, buyers care about big screens, lighting, and how upscale a car feels. The Teana’s interior is built to make a strong first impression, and it stands out even more when you see it lit up at night.\n\nDurabio is more than just a marketing fluff. MCC developed it as a bio-based plastic using plant-derived isosorbide. It’s clearer and handles light better than regular polycarbonate, which helps create lighting that looks deep and high-end instead of cheap or artificial.\n\nOn the Teana, Durabio is used for the inverted-pyramid AI speaker that lights up with six pillars glowing in up to 256 colors. The material refracts light cleanly, giving it a crystal-like look without needing a clear coat. That saves manufacturing steps, lowers environmental footprint, and still meets automotive durability standards.\n\nTeana runs a Huawei-based operating system to go with Durabio. The end result is an interior that feels modern and thoughtfully put together (at least visually), not just a quick update.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-market Altima heads into 2026 with almost no changes from last year. It remains affordable and practical, but next to the Teana, it comes across as very restrained. Nissan still sells a lot of sedans in the US, with over 255,000 units last year (out of the brand's over 760,000-unit sales), but the Altima’s own sales dropped to 93,268 in 2025, down 18 percent from the year before.\n\nThat drop probably comes from the Altima’s age. The current model dates back to 2018, with its last big update in 2022. It no longer stands out for design or interior appeal. After seeing what Nissan has done with the Teana, it’s fair to ask (hope, even) if a more upscale, more distinctive Altima could bring buyers back to the midsize sedan segment.\n\nFor now, there’s no clear answer. But with China getting the more ambitious upgrades, it’s easy to see how a bit of that Durabio-inspired thinking could only help the Altima.\n\nView the 9 images of this gallery on the original article",

Indeed's list of top jobs also highlights accessible on-ramps for career switchers, with roles such as ServiceNow developer and full-stack developer that emphasize skills and real-world experience over formal credentials.\n\nNotably, trade jobs are rising alongside tech. Electricians, HVAC technicians, and electrical foremen are increasingly in demand, a trend likely fueled by large-scale AI data center construction.\n\nAs AI reshapes white-collar work, specialized tech roles and skilled trades are emerging as durable, future-proof career paths.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "If you follow me, you might already know Tech Workers Coalition (TWC). For everybody else, TWC is an international organization that supports union and political organizing of workers within the tech sector. It's heavily decentralized and has chapters spread throughout North America and Europe. It includes every kind of profession in the field: developers, content moderators, designers, testers, sysadmins, data workers, customer service, and so on.\n\nThe organization, over the years, tried different paths to communicate to the outside what it does, why it does what it does, and what it would like to do in the future. The most recent iteration is probably this Identity Document, which gets regularly printed into flyers and handed to newcomers during onboarding sessions.\n\nThe challenge comes from different factors:\n\nI've been part of TWC for 7 years now. I helped start the Berlin chapter, then the Italian chapter, and in the last two years, the Global chapter. I've talked with hundreds of people participating in the communities, coached many chapter organizers, given workshops and onboarding sessions, and facilitated hundreds of meetings within TWC. It is now an integral part of my present and my past.\n\nIn this article, I want to give my take on why I do this, why I think it's important, and why some of you might want to join us. Because, ultimately, it is not so obvious and linear why somebody should be contributing their time to TWC rather than, for example, a union.\n\nLet me preface by saying that I strongly believe that any healthy political ecosystem is composed of organizations aware of their own role. Constructive relationships are also built by behaving in a way that fosters the success of your peers and the health of the whole ecology, rather than by exclusively pursuing the success of your own ideas, your own model, and your own issues. In the context of political participation and activation, this often translates into growing the organization with just the right people, rather than growing indefinitely. Trying to incorporate everybody and preventing them from joining organizations with slightly different values or goals turns political engagement into a zero-sum game. That means that we often invite workers NOT to join TWC if it's not the right thing for them, and rather do direct workplace organizing, join a union, or a party.\n\nThis article, then, while advocating for the merit and worth of participating in TWC, should be seen primarily as a useful tool to decide if you might be a good fit for TWC or if you should rather join a different space.\n\nSo, why Tech Workers Coalition? Why should you join? And how would your effort translate into impact?\n\nOne of the most recognized contributions of TWC has always been its ability to complement unions at the local level. Often stuck in a Fordist mindset, unions struggle to grasp the implications of cognitive labor and its specificities, worsening the gap of language, culture, and aesthetics between unions and office workers in the tech sector.\n\nThis doesn't happen magically: TWC organizers create offline and online community spaces, conferences, and events for green and experienced tech organizers to connect. They develop relationships with unions and link them to workplaces that are interested in organizing. They translate in both directions and facilitate interactions. They offer educational activities specific to labor organizing in the tech sector that unions overlook.\n\nUnions are often big organizations, slow to adapt and transform. Cognitive work poses deep challenges that are still unsolved at a global strategic level. TWC allows tech unions to still develop and thrive on the ground by filling the gaps in the areas traditional unions cannot yet see.\n\nThe more we go on, the more we realize how the tech elites, especially in the USA, are openly supporting a return to Fascism and other forms of oppression. They are reshaping the global economy to entrench themselves in the productive processes and state machinery. They imprint their values and beliefs on the psychic landscape of the ever-increasingly alienated modern and post-modern worlds.\n\nMany are fighting the tech oligarchs from without: hackers and FOSS communities, environmental activists, NGOs, and sometimes even governments. The truth is, though, that the real leverage is between the office chair and the keyboard. We could talk extensively about economics, infrastructure, power analysis, and even draw historical comparisons with the organizing of early factory workers, when only a few, like Marx, were advocating for focusing on them rather than organizing farmers, like most socialists were doing. It would be a long and boring analysis. Suffice to say that there's a lot of power in the tech industry, and that's a lot of power that could be contested and won by tech workers. We are uniquely positioned to bind such power enough to, at the very least, limit the harm the tech industry is doing to the rest of the world or, in the best scenario, reshape how and why technology is produced.\n\nWhat if you believe this, but you don't work in tech? Well, join TWC anyway. Workplace organizing is not possible for everybody: geography, workplace conditions, or, as I said, a different career path might prevent you from doing “the Thing”. TWC is a space where you can help others do “the Thing”. It's meta-organizing, baby. For some, it is frustrating: they want to be directly involved, they want the tension of a high-stakes union election, or the thrill and risk of a direct action during a protest. For others, it is cozy and reassuring: you help a hundred plants grow, and some of them for sure will bear fruit.\n\nThe tech labor movement is, worldwide, a relatively young phenomenon. In some countries, it's unheard of. In some others, it is growing and exploring what's possible. While we are beginning to understand what works and what doesn't, nobody really has found a magic formula that solves it all. Contrary to other forms of labor organizing, where ideas decades old are crystallized and organizations struggle to keep up with social and political changes, in the tech sector there's a lot of experimentation going on.\n\nOn one side it is stressful for many: some workers just want to improve their workplace and would like to have a cookiecutter strategy to apply. On the other side, for the more creative and ambitious, there's a lot of room to try new approaches. For example, we are still not set on what a strike in tech looks like. Some workers just stop working. Some employ traditional forms like picketing or marching instead of going to the office. Some others do more fun and creative stuff to keep busy and attract attention: live streaming, union-themed game jams and hackathons, and so on and so forth.\n\nTWC acts as a network throuch which these ideas travel. Traditional media or social media don't always cover these topics, especially outside the USA. Established networks of unions often talk high-level strategy and rarely go into such level of detail. TWC instead often sees meetings with tech workers from all over, sharing their stories and circulating know-how they didn't know they had. In a way, being in TWC feels like the early internet: tech labor is fragmented and disconnected across national boundaries, and absent from traditional media. TWC acts as a network for the first time, allowing tech workers to discover that in Czechia, India, or the Philippines, there are people like them, with similar issues, but maybe completely different approaches, ideas, and aesthetics.\n\nAs we said, the fight against Big Tech takes many shapes. TWC doesn't collaborate only with labor organizations, but, especially at a local level, acts as an aggregator for people working professionally on the political side of technology: researchers, investigators, artists, occultists, cooperative entrepreneurs, sometimes even party politicians.\n\nThis means that many members of TWC get involved in a lot of different and interesting initiatives happening at the fringes of our network: experimental commoning of technology, litigations, hackatons, policy-making, campaigns, performances, exhibitions, and so on.\n\nIn many places, especially smaller cities, TWC becomes a beacon for anybody working with radical technology but dissatisfied with the more traditional aggregation around hackerspaces or technical communities.\n\nFor some of us, this turned into a whole new career. Workplace organizing is fundamental, but after you're done, after you have your union in place, the company will probably still be working on how to feed the souls of innocent babies into a spirit-grinding, high-performance, demonic contraption. It takes a long time before the union is strong enough to push the company away from the business of butchering baby souls and towards more useful endeavors.\n\nThere are many cases of members that, after several years of TWC, decide to abandon their career in the tech startup or corporate world and go do something different. Some get employed by unions. Some start their own cooperative with their friends. Others join TWC meetings after waking up early to work on a farm. Some go teach in a movement school or join an NGO. Personally, participating in TWC allowed me to connect with people who eventually got me involved into AI Forensics first, and Reversing.works later. The full story here.\n\nI hope this article gave a compelling overview of what I helped build through a whole fifth of my life and I will keep building going forward. A journey that thought me agency, compassion, patience, dedication, and especially the ecstactic joy of seeing the world and the life of people around you change and get better over time.\n\nIf you're tired of arguing on the internet, if you think there's nothing to be done to form a union at work, if you're forced to “monitor the situation”, join TWC.",

    "description": "\"It's time to build\" means there's no time to bone.",
    "fullText": "There's two things that I care about the most: the gym and my work,\" says Mahir Laul.\n\nThe 18-year-old took a leave of absence from New York University this past fall to work full-time on his HR tech startup, Velric. While his classmates are taking shots and hooking up, Laul is coding and lifting. That means almost no time for romance.\n\n\"I am obsessed with work,\" he tells me. \"My love life is in the gutters.\"\n\nHis young founder friends are a similar story, he says. The few who are dating found their partners before they started their companies, while the rest are \"locked in\" on building — and locking themselves out of the dating pool.\n\nSilicon Valley has long been the land where mixing work with play was seen as crucial to its growth. While Google and Facebook were being built, their staff were also tripping on ayahuasca and canoodling in \"cuddle puddles.\" Now, amid the white-collar job apocalypse and the cutthroat AI race, tech has gone hardcore. Ramp has seen a spike in corporate card purchases on Saturdays in the Bay Area. Foot traffic at San Francisco office buildings was up 21.6% year over year in July, per Placer.ai, the highest uptick among major cities. And as I found in conversations with more than two dozen young tech professionals, the industry's upstarts are pounding through hourslong coding sprints, working 996 schedules (9 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week), and proudly telling their investors and X followers how they've gone \"monk mode\" in service of scaling their startups.\n\nFor many in Silicon Valley's young hustle class, \"it's time to build\" means there's no time to bone. They're on one type of grind, and it's not on the dance floor, which shuts down early in San Francisco anyway. Tech's dating scene, never particularly hot, has frozen over.\n\nHackathons, pitch decks, scrambling for investors — the life of a startup founder has never been amenable to a rich dating life. Lauren Kay, a former dating app founder who now runs a literary business, tells me that when she was a member of the 2014 Y Combinator class, she had to ask her cofounder for permission to go on a first date at 10 p.m. on a Saturday. Still, she did meet her husband in that YC class. Douglas Feigelson, a member of that same class, says \"there was opportunity to drink and date when I was in YC.\"\n\nA decade later, many founders feel like they can't afford to make the time.\n\nA good relationship is like a good startup, says Daivik Goel, the 27-year-old founder of the payroll platform Shor. \"It takes a lot of time to nurture at the beginning if you want to do them right.\" For now, he only has the bandwidth to nurture one. Like many of his founder friends, he says, he's not on any dating apps, and he doesn't seek out hookups at bars. \"I haven't had the time to really invest yet.\"\n\nSeveral founders I spoke to described dating in founder terms. \"The opportunity cost is really high,\" says Annie Liao, the 24-year-old founder of AI learning startup Build Club. \"Every night you spent out is time you could have spent building your startup.\" She adds, \"Most founders wait until the startup is more stable, like Series B.\"\n\nLiao says her founder roommates aren't dating either. They hook up sometimes for fun — so long as they don't get \"emotionally attached.\" For those working seven days a week on their startup, opening Hinge is \"a big, big distraction,\" she says.\n\nSome blame the dating recession on tech workers treating dating like an extension of their work. Liao says her male friends often give women ratings, \"like KPIs.\" These ratings are out of 10, and offer a \"numerical logical quantification justified in their brains to help them make an informed decision on who to date.\" Allie Hoffman, founder of dating event The Feels, tells me her San Francisco clients often ask her: \"Am I going to meet my unicorn here?\"\n\nAmy Andersen, CEO of Linx Dating, says that founders who have spent years focusing on \"optimization\" and \"ROI\" are now approaching her, looking for an equally perfect partner.\n\n\"People want to biohack love,\" she says. \"They're not necessarily thinking intelligently.\"\n\nStartup advisor Dylan Oriundo has another theory: fear. Founders aren't just afraid to give up precious building time; they're also skeptical of the motives of their potential suitors as they build their potential unicorns.\n\n\"They're not going to want me because I don't have enough money,\" Oriundo says. \"Once I reach a certain goal, they're just going to want me for my money.\"\n\nTony Bennett notwithstanding, the city has long had a reputation for its poor dating scene. Some blame it on San Francisco's wealth gap; others blame the \"ratio\" — the perceived numbers gap between men and women. The city is comprised of 51% men and 49% women, which some men say gives women the dating edge. The gender disparities likely grow even wider within tight tech circles, with women accounting for 13.2% of startup founders in 2023, and about a quarter of the tech workforce.\n\n\"If you're straight and a guy, there's just not that many women,\" says Wesley Tian, cofounder of the AI photo platform Aragon. Fed up with San Francisco dating, he says that some of his friends \"import\" people from other cities: They'll travel to another hub, meet someone, convince them to do long-distance, and eventually get them to move to the Bay Area. Some of Tian's friends in tech are moving to New York so they can date.\n\nFilip Kozera, founder of the Y-Combinator-backed Wordware and a native of Poland, tells me that he's interested in women who have creative interests like painting or singing, but finds that most of the women in San Francisco are interested in tech. So he mainly goes to Europe to date. He also shares his plan to fix the city: Take 10,000 women in Miami, teach them that having \"a boat is not the most important thing in life,\" and ship them to San Francisco. (Maybe if these women were swapped with 10,000 deep learning engineers, Miami's long-promised tech scene would finally arrive.)\n\nAnd still others say the \"ratio\" is more of a mirage, and an excuse. Joyce Zhang, a San Francisco-based dating coach and former Stripe product manager, tells me that when her male clients complain about the ratio, she asks them: \"What is in your control that you can change?\"\n\n\"Who are the men who are actually emotionally available?\" she tells them. \"If you can do the work to be that, there will be plenty of options for you.\"\n\nThose in tech's rising class who are dating, I found, had been in their relationships long before they began building and pitching.\n\nYang Fan Yun met his girlfriend during his first semester at Stanford, years before he cofounded the browser assistant startup Composite. They dated for all of college, and eventually went long distance when she moved to New York and he stayed in the Bay Area.\n\nThe New York-San Francisco long-distance relationship was common among Yun's tech friends. Even more common: \"not dating.\"\n\n\"Being in a relationship is really helpful for building the company,\" he said, describing his girlfriend, who works at a bank, as a constant supporter and the company's first product tester.\n\nSeveral of the tech workers I spoke to seemed to hope for the same thing, to have an unconditional support system through the grueling slog of building a startup. The future Zucks and Bezoses yearn for their Priscilla Chans and MacKenzie Scotts. (Those entrepreneurial forebearers are even pushing for marriage. Tech titans like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel warn about a fertility crisis. Anduril cofounder Palmer Luckey says that people should have kids in their teens.)\n\n\"You've always heard the mentality, 'Behind every successful man, there's the right woman,'\" Laul say. \"Rather than looking for hookups, I tend to look for someone as a life partner. But it's been difficult.\"\n\nSean Horan, a professor of communications at Fairfield University who studies romance and the workplace, points to some theories of \"positive life-to-work spillover.\"\n\n\"If my personal life is fulfilled, I'll actually be happier at work, which should contribute to productivity,\" he says.\n\nAnd there are exceptions to tech's dating dry spell. Queer daters may be better off. They're unencumbered by San Francisco's ratio, and find a flourishing LGBTQ+ scene in the city.\n\nSorcerer cofounder Jia Chen grew up in Michigan. Moving to San Francisco, she's found bigger populations of queer and East Asian daters. \"There are so many accomplished girls that are very multidimensional,\" she says.\n\nSome of the locked-in and lonely, meanwhile, are turning to other solutions. I heard founders describe first dates where the pair worked side-by-side. Other tech couples are finding each other on the hottest new dating app: LinkedIn. When I ask Shruti Gandhi, an investor at Array Ventures, if young founders are using actual dating apps, she laughs. \"Yeah, she says, \"to network.\"\n\nHenry Chandonnet is a reporter on the Business News desk.

    "description": "Shiyao Tang quit her $390K job at DoorDash to build a silk womenswear brand. Five months of careful planning helped her exit her corporate job.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shiyao Tang, a 34-year-old business owner based in New York City and Paris. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was on a very strong upward trajectory in my manager role at DoorDash when I quit in 2025. I was making $390,000 and felt that I still had room to grow, but when I was honest with myself, my heart wasn't in it.\n\nLeaving to start my own silk womenswear brand wasn't an instantaneous decision; it was a long-term calling inside of me. It took a lot of courage to quit and choose the unknown.\n\nI still constantly ask myself if I made a huge mistake. I think to myself, \"How could I just leave a job that most people would dream of?\" It was high-paying, the benefits were great, and there was room for learning. But I don't want to look back and think I climbed the wrong mountain.\n\nIn 2022, I was hired as a strategy and operations manager on the homepage team at DoorDash. My job was challenging, and I got to wear a lot of hats. I also developed deep friendships with some truly talented people.\n\nHowever, I realized I missed the feeling of being close to the people I was building for.\n\nEarlier in my career, I had a small entrepreneurial chapter where I worked on a fashion wholesale startup. I built my own customers from the ground up and interacted with them every day.\n\nWhen I was 16, I moved from China to the US and later spent a year studying abroad in Paris. I've always lived between cultures and felt super energized by working with people from distinct backgrounds and creative disciplines. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I wanted my career to reflect that part of me, too.\n\nTech created a structure for me to learn and expand my horizon, but I was ready to try entrepreneurship again. I spent a lot of time journaling and reflecting on what business I really wanted to make.\n\nEvery weekend was dedicated to foundational discovery work and even talking to potential customers or friends to get some early feedback on different ideas. I even started connecting with other young, inspiring entrepreneurs at founder events, which expanded my horizons regarding what life might look like as an entrepreneur.\n\nFrankly, I was extremely scared every day, but seeing people thrive gave me more confidence to envision what it might look like for me. I decided on my business, Soir Si, where I make simple, minimal sculptural silk pieces. The mission is to make luxury accessible.\n\nEven though I was sure of my decision, walking away was scary, and honestly, it was really sad for me. However, the thought of not pushing to the edge of my potential was scarier than quitting.\n\nI have my own apartment in NYC, and I spend half my time in Paris, typically staying with friends or family, to fuel my creative inspiration during the design process.\n\nThe first month after quitting, I focused on building a strong visual and emotional identity for Soir Si by enrolling in online courses and even partnering with a freelancer. The next stages were developing my website, connecting directly with customers, and using my branding and website to open up my supply chain.\n\nNow I'm focused on securing and strengthening those relationships while sprinting toward product development.\n\nRight after quitting, I was so focused on transitioning into entrepreneurship that I didn't have time for self-doubt. I felt a mix of grief and sadness about leaving, but I also felt excitement about what was ahead of me. The doubts didn't start bubbling up until several weeks later, when I hit a steep learning curve. I realized I had no idea what went into manufacturing or production, or even how to find a pattern-maker.\n\nI remember the first time I visited some manufacturers in New York, they treated me like I had no idea what I was doing. I knew I didn't speak their \"language,\" and it felt alienating. However, those moments of self-doubt were always counterbalanced by the highs, such as building relationships with potential partners. For example, my branding designer is based in Italy, and my manufacturers are based in Portugal. Establishing those relationships from scratch without any experience gave me the assurance that I can really do this.\n\nEvery day, I wake up knowing I need to work really hard and give it my all to make this dream a reality. The gradual, positive feedback from peers or my audience feeds me every day, and it's fulfilling to work with people from around the world and get to talk about silk and the region it comes from.\n\nThere are still moments when I'm super scared about the path I chose. The self-doubt bubbles up, and it all feels overwhelming, but underneath it all is a steady sense that I'm building something that aligns with who I am, not just the perception of success or stability. I'm finally excited about life again.\n\nPeople might say this is a risky move, but everyone starts from nothing. I just had to be willing to take the first step.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting your six-figure job for a riskier path? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Experts warn use of VPNs makes it hard to limit access to technology that can create nonconsensual explicit images\n\nDays after Malaysia made global headlines by announcing it would temporarily ban Grok over its ability to generate “grossly offensive and nonconsensual manipulated images”, the generative AI tool was conversing breezily with accounts registered in the country.\n\n“Still here! That DNS block in Malaysia is pretty lightweight – easy to bypass with a VPN or DNS tweak,” Grok’s account on X said in response to a question from a user.\n\nGrok’s ability to allow users to create sexually explicit images, including images of children, has created a global outcry over recent weeks, with regulators and politicians around the world launching investigations. Indonesia and Malaysia became the first two countries to announce blocks on the technology, with Malaysia’s regulatory body saying last Sunday it had “directed a temporary restriction” on access to Grok, effective as of 11 January 2026. Officials in the Philippines have said they too plan to ban the technology.\n\nBlocking access to Grok is not straightforward, however. The technology not only exists across multiple platforms, including a standalone app and website, but is also integrated across X, which, along with Grok, is owned by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nOver the past week, X users, and even Grok itself, have advised people on how to bypass restrictions. This includes using a VPN – many of which are available for free – or changing domain name system (DNS), the protocol on the internet that turns address names into IP addresses that load websites.\n\nWhen the Guardian tried to use Grok in Indonesia, its website was working even without a VPN, though the Grok app did not work. Grok was also still responding to Indonesian accounts on X, where it functions as an integrated chatbot. X has not been subject to a ban.\n\nEven if governments could completely restrict Grok, though, this is not a real solution, said Nana Nwachukwu, an AI governance expert and PhD researcher at Trinity College Dublin.\n\n“Blocking Grok is like slapping a Band-Aid on a weeping wound that you haven’t cleaned,” she said. “You block Grok, and then you go around shouting you’ve done something. Meanwhile, people can use VPNs to access the same platforms.” Or, they could simply turn to one of the many other platforms that offer the same functions, including “smaller, general purpose AI systems that are largely unknown”, Nwachukwu added.\n\nGovernments should instead focus on law enforcement and investigating individuals who use such tools to break the law, she added. “Platforms are required by law to provide information to law enforcement when a crime has been committed,” Nwachukwu said. “If we see people being arrested, people being tried in courts, people being jailed for these offences, that’s a sign that this is a real crime.”\n\nX should build accountability into its platform – and clean itself up, said Nwachukwu: “All of those offending images should be removed from the platform.”\n\nOn Wednesday, X announced additional safeguards in response to continued public anger, saying it would stop the @Grok account on X from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”, including paid subscribers. However, the Guardian found that it was possible to get around such restrictions by using the standalone version of Grok, easily accessible through a web browser, to create short videos in which clothes are removed from images of real women.\n\nThis could then be posted to X’s public platform, where it could be viewed by users around the world within seconds.\n\nMusk’s company also said that, in jurisdictions where such content is illegal, it will geoblock the ability of all users in those locations to generate images of real people in bikinis, or similar attire, in Grok on X, adding that “xAI is implementing similar geoblocking measures for the Grok app”.\n\nExperts warn users may still be able to get around such “geoblocks” through a VPN. It is also not clear in which countries such restrictions will be implemented.\n\nIn Malaysia, the communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, has said restrictions on Grok would only be lifted once the ability to produce harmful content had been disabled, according to local media reports.\n\nDr Nuurrianti Jalli, a visiting fellow at the media, technology and society programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the threat of blocking Grok could be a useful way to apply pressure to companies to respond quickly, adding that it “shifts the debate from ‘individual bad actors’ to questions of platform responsibility, safety by design, and accountability when safeguards fail”. It could also “slow the spread of abuse, reduce casual misuse and create a clear boundary around what authorities consider unacceptable”, she said.\n\nIn Indonesia, Grok has been used to create nonconsensual sexualised images of singers and celebrities, including one of the country’s most popular girl groups, JKT48, while in Malaysia, women report similar abuses, including cases where the tool has been used to remove their hijabs, according to Malaysian media.\n\nSome women resorted to publicly telling Grok on X that they do not authorise it to “crawl, take, process or edit” any of their photos.\n\nJalli said governments should push for greater transparency “about how safety measures are implemented, how abuse reports are handled and what enforcement steps are taken when harmful content is generated or circulated”.\n\nThe Malaysian communications and multimedia commission and the ministry of communications did not respond to a request for comment. Indonesia’s ministry of communication and digital affairs also did not respond.\n\nNwachukwu said safeguards should be built into the AI system, rather than “gates” built around it. “Both the [geographic] restriction from X, [and] the restriction from the government is gated access, and gates can be broken down,” she said.\n\nAdditional reporting from Hidayatullah",

    "fullText": "Big tech treats our attention like a resource to be mercilessly extracted. The fightback begins here\n\nIn the last 15 years, a linked series of unprecedented technologies have changed the experience of personhood across most of the world. It is estimated that nearly 70% of the human population of the Earth currently possesses a smartphone, and these devices constitute about 95% of internet access-points on the planet. Globally, on average, people seem to spend close to half their waking hours looking at screens, and among young people in the rich world the number is a good deal higher than that.\n\nHistory teaches that new technologies always make possible new forms of exploitation, and this basic fact has been spectacularly exemplified by the rise of society-scale digital platforms. It has been driven by a remarkable new way of extracting money from human beings: call it “human fracking”. Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetisable black gold to the surface, human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.\n\nFracking (of the Earth and of our minds) produces tectonic instability, toxicity and the despoliation of our landscapes, natural and social. We now know that the heedless exploitation of our external environment has been so relentless and irresponsible that human survival on Earth has been placed in actual jeopardy. The new “gold rush” into the inner environment of the human psyche is well on its way to effecting parallel, if even more insidious destruction.\n\nThe stakes are existential. And that is because, rightly understood, our actual human “attention” – the thing the frackers want, in the form of our eyes on their screens – is nothing less than our ability to care, our ability to think, our ability to give our minds, time and senses to ourselves, the world and each other. To commodify that is to commodify our very beings. The problem isn’t “phones”, and it isn’t “social media”. The problem is human fracking, a world-spanning land-grab into human consciousness – which big tech is treating as a vast, unclaimed territory, ripe for sacking and empire.\n\nThat’s the bad news. The good news is that novel forms of exploitation produce novel forms of resistance. What fills the coffers of the six largest corporations on the planet is nothing other than the stuff of our humanity. Which is to say this new fight for our attention stands in a long line of clashes between those who are willing to reduce people (their labour, their eyeballs) to cash value and those who insist on a higher view of human flourishing. This history is long and complex, and often painful. But it tells us this much: we can fight back. Indeed, we must.\n\nSo what is to be done about this new kind of human exploitation that is harming us – harming children and adults, compromising our deliberative politics and our psychological wellbeing? Regulatory efforts are piecemeal and actively thwarted by the powerful interests in play. Psychopharmacological fixes for the ever-expanding damage merely monetise the destruction in a complementary way and render us better able to submit to conditions that are palpably at odds with human flourishing. How to confront a problem that is both unspeakably intimate and unthinkably extensive?\n\nThe answer is clear: we, the actual people of this planet, must come together in decisive solidarity; we must say no to the human frackers, and do so by insisting, in new ways, that human attention is human, and it is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds in which we want to live. In other words, we need a movement.\n\nThink that sounds quixotic? Well, keep in mind that’s how actual change actually happens. And it can happen fast. The environmental movement as we know it did not exist in 1950, but by 1970 it was a global force. In 1946 Reynolds Tobacco was using doctors to promote cigarettes. Fewer than 20 years later, the American Medical Association and the US surgeon general publicly averred that smoking caused lung cancer.\n\nAnd the changes get much bigger than that. Precious few do-gooders devoted themselves to environmental politics in 1925. That’s because “environmental politics” wasn’t even a thing. It took a cultural shift (and the work of advocates such as Rachel Carson) across the mid-20th century to establish the physical environment – the unity of land, water, and air that produces shared life – as a politically tractable object around which diverse groups could organise. This is to say that the very structures of politics, not just our beliefs and hopes, are themselves emergent forms. New things come into being, and old things pass away.\n\nWhere attention is concerned, there are mounting signs that we are reaching an inflection point. People of all sorts, Maga Republicans and Mamdani progressives, hipsters in Portland and evangelicals in Arkansas – people who don’t agree about anything – all actually do agree that something is totally wrong with a world in which everyone spends nearly all their time scrolling endlessly through the algorithmic feeds of their social media, a world where military-grade technology and trillion-dollar corporations take aim at children, and feed them whatever it takes to keep them hooked.\n\nYou can only abuse people so much, and then, eventually, they turn, they rise, they insist on something else. Already politicians on the right and the left are identifying this issue as one that moves the electorate. In 30 years, we will look back, and this era – the wild west of the tech princes’ smash-and-grab into our hearts, souls and relationships – will be difficult to explain to our grandkids. “How did you all let that happen?” they will ask. And we’ll have to say: “It’s hard to explain: it happened before we noticed; it was so much fun, especially at first; it took us time to figure out what was going on … ”\n\nBut we are figuring it out. We write as representatives of a fast-growing and increasingly well-organised movement, focused on pushing back against the human frackers, and giving shape to a new politics of human attention. At the heart of our efforts? The formation of broad coalitions devoted to the politics of human attention, the practice of diverse forms of study that call forth the life-giving powers of the mind and senses, and the promotion of sanctuary spaces for the protection and cultivation of the kinds of attention that make life good. We call this work attention activism.\n\nOur claim? That all of us already have the tools to resist the frackers, because all of us already have things we do and care about that put us beyond the reach of the algorithms. We all already know the deepest truth: that true human attention isn’t the click and swipe of screen time. True human attention is love, curiosity, daydreaming and taking care of ourselves and others.\n\nYes, new technologies give rise to new kinds of exploitation and resistance. But new forms of exploitation can even give rise to genuinely new forms of politics. You couldn’t brutalise an industrial proletariat before the factory system. Steam engines set the conditions of possibility for this development. They weren’t themselves a “problem”, of course; they gleamed and were precise and powerful. Who could see them operate without awe? But they also created a world in which it was possible to aggregate and extract physical labour from human beings in a revolutionary way. Along the way, they created a new kind of political subject, Homo economicus, a person who had been reduced, in the calculus of modernity, to “labuor value”. Actual revolutions followed – and a new kind of politics was born which reflected a new world of industrial labour, and new forms of labour solidarity, such as unions and workers’ parties.\n\nThe new system of human fracking is turning all of us into attentional subjects in a powerful new way. Homo attentus is the end user of every networked system – economic, political, expressive. With this new form of life comes, as we have discovered, appalling new vulnerability. But we are on the brink of understanding the new power that has come into our hands in the fracklands. We believe a new kind of politics beckons. What will it look like? It is hard to say. And there are reasons to be fearful. But if we, the people, can take up the banner of a new kind of freedom movement – a movement for the true freedom of attention itself, what we call attensity – and deploy our truly human attention in new ways, with a new understanding of the stakes, we can defy the frackers, and insist on creating, together, a human world.\n\nD Graham Burnett is professor of history at Princeton University.

Watts then hit another 3, and stole a pass at the other end to set up Anderson from long range for a 72-65 lead.\n\nRichie Saunders scored 18 points for BYU, while Dybantsa had just two points on 1-of-6 shooting after halftime.\n\nBYU: Utah visits next Saturday, two weeks after the Cougars’ 89-84 road win over their biggest rival.\n\nTexas Tech: At Baylor on Tuesday night.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame relayed a Warren Buffett story to warn of wasteful tech spending, and took aim at Nvidia and Palantir again.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a recent Substack exchange, calling out market darlings and warning that a prolonged slump is coming.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame took aim at the tech boom in a written debate with Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark and podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.\n\nBurry cautioned that so-called hyperscalers, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting huge sums on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, to power AI tools such as chatbots that will become commoditized.\n\nHe drew a parallel to a Baltimore department store briefly owned by Warren Buffett in the 1960s: Hochschild-Kohn.\n\n\"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too,\" Burry wrote. \"In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out.\"\n\nWhen one of the local department stores upgraded its window displays or debuted a new cash-register system, \"the others had to follow suit,\" author Alice Schroeder wrote in \"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life.\"\n\nBuffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, compared the situation to \"standing on tiptoe at a parade,\" she added. \"Once anybody did it, everybody had to do it.\"\n\nBurry wrote on Substack: \"This is why trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning. Most will not benefit, because their competitors will benefit to the same extent, and neither will have a competitive advantage because of it.\"\n\nBased on how previous capital-spending booms have played out, Burry wrote that we're now \"past the point where stocks will reward investors for further buildout, and getting into the period where the true costs and the lack of revenue will start to show themselves.\"\n\nLooking forward, he predicted that tech industry employment will \"be lower, or not much higher, because I think we are headed for a very long downturn.\"\n\nBurry shot to fame after his contrarian bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short,\" and actor Christian Bale portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nHe pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack late last year. Several of his early posts have taken aim at high-flying AI stocks, warning they're overvalued and destined to tumble.\n\n\"I think the market is most wrong about the two poster children for AI: Nvidia and Palantir,\" he told Clark and Patel.\n\nThe chipmaker and data-analysis specialist are \"two of the luckiest companies\" because their products were inadvertently well-suited to AI from the get-go, he added.\n\n\"Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe also said Palantir CEO Alex Karp criticizing him for being short the stock showed he's \"not a confident CEO.\"\n\n\"He's marketing as hard as he can to keep this going, but it will slip,\" Burry added.\n\nPalantir and Nvidia didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe value investor shared three things that have surprised him about the AI boom. The first was that Google \"fumbled it and gave an opening to competitors with far less going for them,\" he said. \"Google playing catch-up to a startup in AI: that is mind-blowing.\"\n\nThe second was that ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot, \"kicked off a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure race.\"\n\n\"It's like someone built a prototype robot and every business in the world started investing for a robot future,\" he wrote.\n\nThe third was Nvidia's continued dominance when he expected more power-efficient chips to have taken off by now.\n\nSpeaking about AI's real-world impacts, Burry cast doubt on the idea that trade careers are an \"AI-proof choice.\"\n\n\"If I'm middle class and am facing an $800 plumber or electrician call, I might just use Claude,\" he said, referring to Anthropic's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I love that I can take a picture and figure out everything I need to do to fix it,\" he added.\n\nBurry also raised the prospect that AI chatbots will \"make people dumber,\" such as doctors who overuse them and start to forget their medical knowledge.",

    "fullText": "Technophile Anne Goldberg has become accustomed to formatting PowerPoint presentations in her career as a recruiter.\n\nAs a result, when she found herself between jobs in the fall of 2013, she was happy when a friend paid her a fee to create a slideshow for a relative's 80th birthday party.\n\nThe guests loved the display and congratulated Golberg, then 61, on her digital prowess, which dates back to being an early adopter of computers in the 1980s. She thought nothing more of it.\n\nOver the next 10 days, she was surprised to receive a series of calls from older adults seeking her advice on operating their laptops, iPads, and iPhones.\n\nTheir queries led to a lightbulb moment. \"What if I turn this into a business?\" she thought.\n\nThe next day, harnessing the cold-calling skills she'd deployed in recruitment, she contacted an independent living facility in her home city of Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nShe spoke with the activities coordinator and asked whether the residents might be interested in a beginner's course in operating electronic devices such as smartphones.\n\n\"I got the gig,\" Goldberg told Business Insider. She hosted her first class within a week when seniors turned up with their seldom-used iPhones and Android devices.\n\nMany had been coerced by their families, who had tried unsuccessfully to show them the ropes. Golberg broke the ice by joking, \"I know you hate the idea of being here.\"\n\nBut the session was a resounding success. Twelve years later, she teaches classes at retirement homes in Florida.\n\nShe recently published her book, \"Take This Phone and Shove It!: A Frustrated Senior's Guide to Smartphones.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly rewarding,\" Goldberg, whose average client is 85 years old, said. \"It's great to see the glint in their eyes and the sense of achievement when someone finally 'gets it.'\"\n\nMost of the seniors, she said, are drawn to the fact that she's in her 70s. \"They prefer the advice of someone from their generation — or close enough — who understands the challenges.\"\n\nHere are three tips that Goldberg shares with her clientele.\n\nGoldberg said that many of her clients are scared of looking incompetent in the face of technology.\n\n\"They think they are dumb and feel threatened by having to learn,\" she said.\n\nStill, they soon prove to themselves — and others — that their fears are unfounded.\n\nShe recalled helping an octogenarian save a photo to her iPhone that had been sent by text.\n\nThe boomer talked her through the process, and she was amazed by how easy it was. \"She said, 'Are you kidding me? Is that all I have to do?\"\n\nCuriosity and a positive attitude go a long way. \"Don't say, 'I can't do it,'\" Goldberg said. \"Say, 'I can't do it yet.'\"\n\nIt's tempting to hark back to the \"golden age\" before every Tom, Dick, and Harry owned iPhones.\n\nThey might seem like halcyon days — and Goldberg respects that point of view — but the reality is that modern technology is here to stay.\n\nShe encourages her students to think about the benefits of electronic devices, especially when their families live far away.\n\n\"I say, 'You can talk to them and see them at the same time nowadays,'\" she said. \"'You couldn't do that 50 years ago.'\"\n\nAs soon as they learn how to use FaceTime, they wish they'd known about it sooner.\n\nGoldberg recalls the thrill of receiving a FaceTime tour of her son's new apartment in Colorado. \"I want other seniors to experience the same feeling.\"\n\nGoldberg understands people's misgivings about breaking their expensive devices.\n\nHowever, she said there are only a handful of ways to make that happen.\n\n\"If you throw your phone against the wall in frustration, it will break,\" she tells her clients with a laugh. Crushing it with your car wheels is not a smart idea.\n\nShe used to say that dropping an iPhone into the toilet was curtains, too. More recent Apple models can withstand immersion in water up to 6 meters for 30 minutes.\n\nStudents often tell her they're scared of damaging their screen by tapping it too hard. Goldberg asks if they've ever licked their finger and touched an iron to test the level of heat.\n\n\"Everybody nods their heads except for the rich people who never had to,\" she joked. \"I say, 'You touch the iron fast because you don't want to get burned — and that's exactly how you tap on your phone.'\"",

The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds.

    "fullText": "2 minute read | Jan 16, 2026 \nmanagement, product\n\nIf you’re worried about being left behind by technology, stop obsessing over tools.\n\nBefore alarm clocks were common, people paid humans to wake them up - called knocker uppers.\n\nIf you were alive during the 1800s Industrial Revolution, you had to start your factory shift before dawn. Being late would mean being fined or losing your livelihood. Alarm clocks were expensive and unreliable. To solve this you would pay knocker uppers to tap on your window to wake you up.\n\nAnd for over 100 years this worked.\n\nBut, technology improved. Alarm clocks became affordable and the human alarm clocks became obsolete. They resisted change by defending their tools - reaching clients without waking neighbours, tapping without breaking glass, waiting to confirm clients were awake.\n\nInstead of resisting change, they should have obsessed over the Job To Be Done:\n“Help me be ready for my shift.”\n\nIf they framed it this way, the future could have looked different. They had the customer relationships and could have sold alarm clocks instead of competing, or expanded into new services such as breakfast delivery - the original DoorDash perhaps.\n\nPeople fear both technology disruption and FOMO. Jensen Huang of NVIDIA frames technology as enabling new ideas:\n\n“If you think about a company and say if we improve productivity, then they need fewer people - well that’s because the company has no more ideas.\n\nBut that’s not true for most companies. If you become more productive and the company becomes more profitable, then usually they hire more people to expand into new areas.\n\nSo long as humans have more ideas, the prosperity of the industry which comes from improved productivity, results in hiring more people, more ideas.”\n\nIf you don’t want to be left behind by technology like the human alarm clock, stop obsessing over tools and start obsessing over problems and ideas on how to solve them.\n\nGet future posts with actionable tips in under 5 minutes and a bonus cheat sheet on '10 Biases Everyone Should Know'.\n\nYour email stays private.

    "description": "From Elon Musk to Mark Zuckerberg, here's a look back at what industry titans were doing 10 years ago and what has changed.",
    "fullText": "Forget what you were doing in 2016 — what about the world's tech elite?\n\nMillennials are posting throwback pictures on social media and reminiscing over what many see as simpler times.\n\nIn some ways, the tech world was, too. Then, it was the era of apps. Today, it's the age of AI. Tech founders were more likely to be celebrated as disruptors, but in 2026, there is greater wariness about the billionaire class providing the tools we use every day.\n\nHere's what tech leaders were up to in 2016, and how their companies, personal brands, and net worths have changed in the decade since.\n\nA lot has changed for Elon Musk since 2016. The Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder is now worth over half a trillion dollars and wields extraordinary influence across the worlds of business and politics. But 10 years ago, he had a net worth of just over $11 billion, expressed little interest in politics, and was better known as an ambitious entrepreneur pioneering clean energy and rocket technology.\n\nIn July 2016, Musk released Tesla's \"masterplan part deux,\" which outlined the company's goals of building more affordable EVs and rolling out fleets of self-driving cars that make money for Tesla owners even when they're not using them. While Tesla has achieved the first goal, introducing the Model 3 and Y and dominating the US EV market, the second has proven more elusive.\n\nMusk also spent 2016 helping set up a mysterious new startup with an ambitious mission of building superintelligent AI — OpenAI. A decade later, he's suing the company and his former cochair, Sam Altman, over claims he was misled over the ChatGPT maker's abandonment of its nonprofit mission.\n\nIt's not just Mark Zuckerberg's personal look that's changed over the last decade — his company has a completely different name.\n\nIn 2016, Facebook was focused on social media and advertising growth. After rebranding to Meta in 2021 to focus on the metaverse, the company today is all in on the AI boom. Oh, and Zuckerberg wears chains now.\n\nA decade ago, Facebook was starting to come under scrutiny for its political influence, including the 2016 election that put Donald Trump in the White House. That's changed. Now, Zuckerberg openly embraces the Trump administration, and Meta this month hired his former advisor and official.\n\nZuckerberg was already a billionaire tech elite in 2016, but today he is the sixth-richest person in the world with a net worth of $220 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWhile Altman was influential in Silicon Valley in 2016, he was nowhere near the global name he is today. In 2016, Altman was leading the transformation of startup seed accelerator Y Combinator as its president, having launched a VC arm, a fellowship program, and a research lab.\n\nThe year before, Altman and Musk became co-chairs of OpenAI, having formed part of the team that founded the company. The company had already raised $1 billion in 2015 toward conducting research to benefit humanity. At the time, Altman told Business Insider that OpenAI's specific research goals were still being debated.\n\nAltman launched the website Voteplz in 2016 to streamline the voting process in the presidential election, and said in a tweet he was voting against Trump because he believed \"the principles he stands for represent an unacceptable threat to America.\"\n\nDespite this early opposition, Altman lauded Trump last year as a \"pro-business, pro-innovation president\".\n\nSame leather jacket. A whole different status. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, may have kept the same style, but his company has evolved from a gaming chip giant into the world's most valuable company that's also critical to the AI boom.\n\nThe graphics processing units designed by Nvidia were mostly sold to gamers in 2016, but its chips were already being used in AI research labs. Now they are stacked up in data centers across the world to power AI models like ChatGPT. They have become so important to the global economy that any signs of weakness in Nvidia's results prompt fears of an AI bubble.\n\nDespite founding the world's most valuable company, his net worth of $155 billion puts him in ninth place on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. Still, that's a huge jump from his net worth of about $3 billion at the end of 2016.\n\nPhilanthropy continues to dominate Bill Gates' public life. The Microsoft cofounder has ramped up donations through the Gates Foundation — formerly known as The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — as part of his plan to give away nearly all his wealth over the next 20 years.\n\nIn 2016, Gates was the richest person in the world with a net worth of $87.4 billion. With his then-wife, Melinda French Gates, the two dedicated their 2016 annual letter to clean-energy development, writing about making zero-carbon emissions a priority and bringing energy to the world's poorest people.\n\nThe foundation focused on eliminating HIV, malaria, and other infectious diseases — a mission that has continued to 2026.\n\nIn 2016, Amazon was already dominating the online retail market, and Jeff Bezos was still the company's CEO.\n\nDespite a barrage of negative media attention the year before based on reports that Amazon warehouses were high-pressure, toxic work environments — claims Bezos disputed — the company's dominance in cloud was growing. This trajectory has continued with Amazon Web Services seeing a 20% cloud sales growth in the third quarter of 2025, with plans to double capacity by the end of 2027.\n\nBezos said in 2016 that his ambition for his space technology company, Blue Origin, was to move heavy, polluting industry away from Earth to one day save the planet. In November 2025, the firm had its first successful booster recovery, bringing Blue Origin closer to rivaling SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nBezos was still married to MacKenzie Scott before the two filed for divorce in 2019. He stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021 and married Lauren Sánchez in a lavish multi-day celebration in Venice in June 2025.",

    "description": "Selkirk Sport's R&D lab puts its pickleball paddles through rigorous stress testing using cannons and CT scanners. See inside.",
    "fullText": "Selkirk isn't just producing pickleball paddles. They're running science experiments.\n\nOne such experiment involves firing pickleballs at a stationary paddle at up to 120 miles per hour — over and over and over again.\n\nWhen the ball leaves the \"durability cannon,\" which the engineers nicknamed Mjölnir after Thor's hammer, and makes contact with the paddle, it emits a booming sound that resembles, well, a cannon. Impressive for a perforated plastic sphere.\n\nThor's hammer is just one of the fancy and expensive pieces of machinery I got to see in action when I toured Selkirk LABS, the research and development division of Selkirk Sport, in mid-January.\n\nSelkirk is a leading pickleball equipment brand. If you play the sport, chances are you or your opponent is wielding one of their sticks. The shipping department manager, who works out of the company's 87,000-square-foot warehouse, told me they fulfill roughly 1,000 orders a day and up to 2,500 during the holiday season.\n\nThe company was founded in 2014 by two brothers, Rob and Mike Barnes, and their father, Jim, well before pickleball became popular.\n\n\"Pickleball had a connotation of being a senior sport for a while,\" Rob told me at the Selkirk headquarters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where the brothers grew up and started their first business as teens selling airsoft guns out of their dad's basement.\n\nThey sold the airsoft business to pivot to pickleball, a game they discovered in 2009 and couldn't get enough of. It seemed impossible that it wouldn't take off. They were right about that, but it took years, and a global pandemic that encouraged socially distant activities, before the rest of the world would catch on.\n\nAs the sport has exploded, so has the competition. The Barnes brothers believe in staying ahead by continuing to invest in R&D and deliver premium products. They have the only private sports science lab in pickleball, which they've invested roughly $1 million into, and one of the few private sports labs in racket sports in general.\n\nThe youngest Barnes brother, Tom, joined the family business after a career in the Marines. He's the director of R&D and spent nearly three hours walking me through the lab, explaining in detail how each machine works and why it's important.\n\nWhile the paddle is their hero product, Selkirk also makes shoes, apparel, balls, and nets — \"everything except the court surface,\" said Tom, as long as it's in the pickleball realm. He and his brothers don't have any interest in expanding into the myriad of racket sports: tennis, padel, squash, etc. \"We will only ever do pickleball. This was intentional from day one. It's called Selkirk Sport; it's not called Selkirk Sports.\"\n\nTom greeted me at the unassuming entrance of the facility, nicknamed \"Aqua.\" It makes up about 22,000 square feet of Selkirk's 160,000-square-foot campus.\n\nThe lab portion of the building, which has been up and running for about a year, is split into two rooms. We started in the larger of the two, which houses a bunch of machines, including this one designed to perform a \"pull test.\" They'll place a specimen of the paddle material between these two clamps and essentially rip it apart to test its resilience.\n\n\"This is aerospace material science,\" Tom told me — a phrase I never thought I'd include in the same sentence as \"pickleball.\"\n\nHe also showed me what's called the \"optical profilometer,\" a digital microscope that lets you examine the paddle's face in detail. The texture — or, grit — on a paddle is important. It creates spin and influences ball control.\n\nThanks to the fancy microscope, \"we can see every little crystal of our grit,\" said Tom. \"We can see every dot of the ink on here. And we can see defects.\"\n\nHere's a much better photo of the machine than the one I snapped:\n\nNext up is my personal favorite: Thor's hammer. Tom describes it as \"a really fancy potato cannon.\"\n\nAfter scanning a fresh paddle, engineers will place it inside this big, red cage, and the durability cannon will fire pickleballs at it every six seconds, about 1,000 times. Then it goes back to the profilometer for another scan to see what happened to the surface after all the abuse.\n\nIt's a bulky machine they sourced from China and originally intended for tennis racket testing. Tom describes it as \"big and slow,\" but it gets the job done for now. He was excited to share that his team is working on their own version of Thor's hammer that will be smaller and fire balls even faster.\n\nThere's also a CT scanner in this room. While the profilometer performs an external scan, the CT performs an internal scan.\n\nI asked what he's looking for in the images. \"Everything,\" he said. \"We can look at every microscopic detail inside the paddle and make sure everything is where we want it to be.\"\n\nBefore they had the CT scanner, the only way they could see what was going on inside the paddle was to saw it open and manually inspect it. The method worked, but destroyed the paddle.\n\n\"You can only do that once,\" said Tom. Whereas, with the CT scanner, the paddle is still playable after the inspection. \"This is the biggest, most important thing we've ever bought for non-destructive testing.\"\n\nThe second, smaller room of the lab has machines that test for swing and twist weight. It also houses what Tom likes to call their \"academic research cannon\" or \"performance cannon.\" Its main job is to help figure out the physics involved in the sport: What happens when a plastic ball hits a paddle?\n\nLike Thor's hammer, it involves firing pickleballs at a stationary paddle.\n\n\"It's measuring how efficient the collision is, which is basically how efficient the paddle is — not too dissimilar to how many miles a car can go on a gallon a gas,\" said Tom. \"The reason this is important is because in our sport, due to our limited court dimensions, we cannot have this ball come off too fast. We have to limit the power because if you don't limit power, the court gets really small and the game doesn't work anymore.\"\n\nAqua isn't just for R&D. Some of the paddles get finished here. About 30 employees work various stations of the production line, adding edge guards, caps, and grips to the paddles.\n\nThis employee is finishing the popular Boomstik paddle, which Selkirk launched in the summer of 2025. It's their most premium model, retailing for $333. He's spraying it with \"InfiniGrit\" — a spin coating that took thousands of trials and years to develop, said Tom: \"We call it that because it's gritty and it's infinite because it lasts really long.\"\n\nThis Boomstik is very close to being done. It just needs a grip.\n\nThe gripping station is fascinating, where employees use a machine that spins and guides the grip onto the paddle. The speed at which it spins is controlled by a pedal.\n\nOnce the paddles are gripped, they head to quality control for inspection. To pass, \"it needs to look perfect,\" Tom told me.\n\nThe ones that don't pass — maybe they have a scratch or a chip or a scuff — are deemed \"seconds\" and sold as used paddles or turned into demos.\n\nHere are the boxes of \"seconds.\"\n\nThe lab setup is overwhelmingly impressive, but Tom isn't yet satisfied.\n\n\"Even today, with all of this, I feel like we're 5% of the way there,\" he told me. \"Five years from now, I think our company will be insane.\"\n\nI guess I'll have to return in five years to see what they've cooked up.",

    "description": "\"Strategically, this is an attractive early entry market.\"",
    "fullText": "A San Diego battery maker has an impressive sodium-ion product designed to replace long-standing lead-acid batteries in multiple settings.\n\nWith it, UNIGRID is staking a greater claim in the replaceable battery market — valued by Fortune Business Insights at nearly $50 billion annually.\n\nThe 12-volt product, dubbed Na⁺ Fleet, is designed to better start internal combustion engines in cars, trucks, forklifts, and other technology, as well as power lights and electronics in electric vehicles.\n\n\"Strategically, this is an attractive early entry market for sodium-ion; it is a large, already-existing market using an outdated technology that is primed for disruption,\" UNIGRID co-founder Darren H. S. Tan said in a press release.\n\nThe downside is that it's an investment in a product that's included in pollution-chugging transportation. In addition to reducing local air quality, tailpipe exhaust can increase cancer risks, according to the American Lung Association.\n\nHowever, the battery is also an advancement for sodium-ion chemistry, which is being developed by experts around the world as a cheaper, better-performing alternative to lithium-ion and lead-acid versions.\n\nUNIGRID said in a press release that its battery's lifetime is 10 times greater than lead-acid, which has been used for more than a century.\n\nThe breakthrough could replace these types of batteries, thereby reducing the amount of harmful waste generated by improperly disposed lead-acid packs. The Environmental Protection Agency detailed a number of problems they pose, such as lead exposure that can lead to brain, kidney, and hearing damage.\n\nNa⁺ Fleet can last for 5,000 cycles in hot or cold weather, requires no maintenance, and is lighter, UNIGRID noted among a list of perks.\n\n\"Sodium-ion … beats lead-acid in almost all metrics … including total cost,\" Tan said in the release.\n\nDo you worry about the longevity of EV batteries?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSodium-ion packs are also being developed to power EVs, and UNIGRID's progress could be part of the path to next-generation technology for cleaner rides.\n\nEVs prevent thousands of pounds of air pollution annually when compared to gas cars, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Interesting Engineering added that Na⁺ Fleet can be used to power EV auxiliary systems, replacing lead-acid for that work, too.\n\nGlobal sales of EVs reached 18.5 million vehicles year-to-date through November, a 21% increase over 2024, according to supply chain analysts Rho Motion.\n\nOverseas markets are stronger than the stateside one, where growth has been \"subdued\" due to well-documented policy changes and the end of federal EV tax credits, the report added.\n\nBut it's still a great time to make the switch, as many states offer perks for buying and charging EVs, which provide yearly gas and service savings of up to $1,500. That's thanks to no oil changes, spark plug replacements, and other common maintenance.\n\nAdding home solar to charge the rides increases the savings. The Cool Down's Solar Explorer can help get you started with curated quotes, installer recommendations, and other tips.\n\nIn the meantime, UNIGRID continues to log sodium-ion innovations in a quickly advancing battery sector.\n\nThe latest one offers \"a substantially longer operational lifespan,\" the company said.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles. That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.\n\nExperts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”\n\n“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”\n\nOthers say the shift is inevitable.\n\n“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nWhat makes Chinese vehicles stand out?\n\nChinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.\n\n“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”\n\nThese vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.\n\nChinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle's driving range.\n\n“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. \"These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”\n\nMany automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.",

    "title": "Apple is losing its grip on the world's tech supply chain",
    "description": "Apple once set the bar for suppliers including TSMC. Now it's being unseated by Nvidia and AI cloud giants.",
    "fullText": "For over a decade, Apple sat at the center of the tech supply chain. Its enormous scale let it dictate pricing, lock up capacity, and steer the roadmaps of suppliers that made everything from chips and memory to substrates and packaging. That era is ending.\n\n\"Apple is no longer the gravitational center of the hardware universe,\" said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology, who tracks the industry's supply chain.\n\n\"Apple still moves huge volumes and has unmatched brand strength. But the company is no longer the anchor client for fabs, substrate makers, or key component suppliers. That's a fundamental change.\"\n\nThis is important because the tech companies that control the supply chain are more likely to win. When you can order the largest amount of a key component, you get better pricing and a more reliable supply. That results in better-priced products that are available sooner than your rivals. This power is now shifting toward AI giants, including Nvidia and huge cloud players such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (aka \"AMG\").\n\nThe most visible sign is at TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker. It's famous for churning out cutting-edge iPhone chips, which gave Apple a huge advantage over other consumer hardware players.\n\nWhen TSMC reported results this week, it became very clear that its smartphone business is no longer its most important segment. High-performance computing — a category dominated by AI chips for companies like Nvidia and hyperscale cloud providers — now accounts for roughly 58% of TSMC's revenue, far surpassing smartphone processors.\n\nTSMC makes chips for Nvidia's AI servers, which are being snapped up in huge volumes by the cloud giants. They pack this gear into huge data centers that train and run AI models to power new services such as ChatGPT. Is that a better business than making iPhone chips?\n\nTSMC's CEO C.C. Wei answered that. He's been talking to these AI giants a lot lately. Here's what he said on this week's earnings call:\n\n\"They show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business. So they grow their business successfully and see the financial return. So I also double-checked their financial status. They are very rich.\"\n\nSuppliers go where the money is. Increasingly, the biggest Benjamins are coming from AI and cloud giants, not Apple.\n\nThis shift is rippling through the rest of the supply chain. Memory chip makers are reallocating capacity away from phones and PCs to feed AI data centers hungry for DRAM, dynamic random access memory. This is a common type of memory chip that's used in AI servers and iPhones.\n\nMemory prices have surged lately, and that's likely to push up smartphone costs and potentially squeeze margins. Nvidia has locked in long-term memory supply, leaving smartphone makers with less negotiating power.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, Apple's scale let it dictate component supply, pricing, and roadmaps,\" Gastwirth said. \"That leverage diminishes when suppliers earn higher margins and higher growth from AI customers than from smartphones.\"\n\nBottlenecks are emerging in unexpected places, too. A shortage of high-end glass cloth, a critical input for chip substrates, has suppliers prioritizing AI customers who pre-pay and sign multi-year contracts.\n\nApple, which uses these substrates across nearly all its products, is now competing with AI chipmakers for limited supply and even sending engineers to help smaller suppliers qualify alternative materials, according to a report this week from Nikkei.\n\nManufacturing partners are also re-prioritizing. Foxconn, once synonymous with iPhone assembly, now generates more revenue from AI servers than from consumer electronics. Its fastest-growing customers are hyperscalers and Nvidia, not Apple.\n\nNone of this makes Apple irrelevant. The company remains one of the world's largest buyers of components. However, in a supply chain increasingly shaped by AI, pricing, allocation, and capacity planning are being set elsewhere — and Apple is learning what it's like to be just another very large customer.\n\n\"In the 2010s, Apple set the pace for the supply chain,\" Gastwirth said. \"In the late 2020s, Nvidia, hyperscalers, and AI infrastructure now dictate pricing, allocation, and long‑term capacity planning.\"\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

To keep up, Xiao said investors are going to need to be as technical as the founders.\n\nIf she has one piece of advice for investors who haven't gone deep into the technical side, it's that they should know \"AI progress isn't linear,\" she said.\n\nThey should know AI progress happens in \"lumps,\" she said. So, questions about why AI progress is slowing down or speeding up aren't the best way to characterize the rate of development.\n\n\"It's neither of those two extremes,\" she said. \"It's somewhere in between.\"\n\nLeonis Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Writing at the end of the world, from Hveragerði, Iceland",
    "fullText": "It’s now been roughly six months since I slowed down this newsletter to give me space to think and reconsider.\n\nI’ve done this before – several times in the history of this website, in fact. Sometimes the blog has stayed sporadic for a couple of years. Sometimes only a few weeks passed until I found my motivation again.\n\nWriting just for yourself is its own kind of fun. Whatever else is going on in my life, even when the mental landscape that is my blog or newsletter is lying fallow and slowly regaining its fertility, I still update it occasionally because writing is both fun and a tool that helps me make sense of the world around me.\n\nBut writing – any media – only reaches its full potential if it’s done with an audience – not just for an audience, but written as a part of the field or community in discourse with others.\n\nAnd that kind of writing has to have a purpose. It needs to be of service and add value to the field that frames it.\n\nThat’s the bargain. That’s why people read what you write and, occasionally, help support the writer in some way.\n\nWhen you feel that you’re burning out on writing, one of the possible reasons is that the bargain that’s specific to the writing you’ve been doing isn’t working for you.\n\nWhen an audience wants anger and hostility, feeding that can be the writing bargain you offer and the audience will often reward you with attention, praise, and waves of hostility that lift you up, as if it were support, because the poison is directed elsewhere.\n\nBut the poison is still there. Feeding hostility in others requires feeding the hostility in yourself.\n\nThis is why I’ve been struggling for a while now to write constructively about tech and “AI” specifically. Constructive criticism has a purpose, but we’re at a point in the current iteration of “irrational exuberance” where the stakes for the pro- side are so high that nothing constructive registers and what we’re left with are anger and the expert chroniclers of “just how bad is it anyway?”\n\nAcademics and researchers who specialise in machine learning and related fields catalogue the hype and promises. The few genuinely numerate journalists, such as Ed Zitron, do the maths on just how big and potentially catastrophic the bubble is. We’re at a point where the finances, environmental impact (which is currently expressing itself mostly on a community level), workplace dysfunction, and outright debasement of the entire software industry’s user experience mean that there is simply no reasonable justification for supporting these tools. They are obviously destructive.\n\nSensible criticism is unnecessary in this environment. You need chroniclers – the experts who are cataloguing the various examples that show just how damaging these systems are – and you need the analysts – the journalists who can tell us just how many orders of magnitude the industry numbers are off by – but there is little outright need for low-key constructive criticism.\n\nBecause the correct response to those who are explicitly collaborating with authoritarians and fascists, as much of the “AI” industry is doing, isn’t to tell them that their tech is likely to cause substantial delays at the organisations that adopt it.\n\nThe correct response is to tell them to fuck off and then move on.\n\nWallowing in the anger isn’t productive. Mockery always works, but I’ve never been much of a humour writer so I already know that I should be leaving that kind of writing to others.\n\nSo I had to do a bit of contemplation. I’m not a particularly fast thinker. I tend to linger on details for too long and overthink things, but with enough time I get there and I think it’s time to put this newsletter back on a schedule. I’m putting together something that wraps up my coverage of “AI” specifically, at least for now, but other than that I’d like to continue my explorations of the impact of and problems caused by tech, but with a slight shift in focus:\n\nSoftware as a mass medium and the effect it has on other media.\n\nThe reason is straightforward: pretending software isn’t a medium, pretending that it doesn’t have \n\nIt doesn’t work for those of us who have been making software.\n\nIt doesn’t work for those of us who need to use the software.\n\nIt doesn’t work for the societies that have, inadvisedly, come to depend on what’s effectively a bunch of flared jeans designers cosplaying as engineers as the fundamental drivers of their economies.\n\nPretending this made-up bullshit makes sense doesn’t work any more. At least, it doesn’t work any more for those of us who have avoided getting caught up in the bubble irrationality.\n\nThe best way to deal with software – making it, using it, dealing with it as a creative medium, coping with it as a maker of other creative media – is to understand it as it really is:\n\nA creative medium driven by fashion that operates with limited regard for practicality or productivity.\n\nThis isn’t far off from what I was already doing. Systems-thinking is still one of the lenses I apply and I’m firmly of the school of media analysis that takes business factors and processes into account, so it’s mostly a question of broadening the focus slightly, coupled with a small change in perspective.\n\nMaybe it won’t work and I’ll have to rethink things again, which is fine. Maybe it’ll only work for a few weeks until the topic runs out of steam, which is also fine.\n\nBut at least it should be a bit fun.\n\nI’ve finally released print versions of all my books:\n\nIf you’d like to support this newsletter and make it likelier that I continue to publish in print in the future, this would be the time to order a copy. 🙂",

    "fullText": "Patrick Vallance says robots would take away ‘repetitive’ tasks, but Sadiq Khan warns AI will usher in ‘new era of mass unemployment’\n\nAdvances in AI and robotics will transform human jobs, starting with roles in warehouses and factories, the UK science minister has said, as the government announced plans to reduce red tape for robot and defence tech companies.\n\nPatrick Vallance said technological progress was creating a “whole new area” for robots to work in. “What’s really changing now is the combination of AI and robotics. It is opening up a whole new area, particularly in the sorts of things like humanoid robotics. And that will increase productivity, it will change the human job,” he told the Guardian.\n\nLord Vallance spoke as a government unit helping to deploy new technologies in Britain announced robots and defence as new sectors receiving its support.\n\nHe said factories and warehouses, already at the forefront of robot deployment, will undergo further change as a result of the new generation of humanoid robots.\n\n“Activities that require movement around warehouses and factories, or those sorts of things that can be made robotic, will be made robotic. I think they will be made robotic in many cases and therefore, will change the nature of those jobs. That’s going to be the first wave,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has warned that AI could “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nSpeaking in his annual Mansion House speech on Thursday, Khan said artificial intelligence could destroy a significant amount of jobs in London unless ministers act to help replace jobs taken over by the technology.\n\nAsked to comment on Khan’s speech, Vallance said robots would take away “repetitive” tasks. “You take away some of the things which are less interesting, repetitive things that can be done in another way,” he said.\n\nVallance, formerly the government’s chief scientific adviser, added that the example of robotics assisting in surgery showed how the technology can enhance jobs.\n\n“Robotics is not displacing surgeons, it’s radically improving how those surgeons work and allowing things to be done with more precision,” he said.\n\nThe government announced on Friday that the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO) is expanding its remit to defence tech and robotics, with the aim of slashing red tape for companies operating in those spaces.\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is also releasing £52m for new hubs to drive robotics adoption in British businesses. These hubs will offer companies advice on using robots and live demonstrations. “The RIO will aim to streamline overlapping requirements to bring products to market safely, but more quickly, to improve lives and grow our economy,” it said.\n\nThe department added that autonomous drones could benefit from the wider RIO remit. Such technology could require separate approvals for aviation, data protection, and sector-specific safety rules, in an expensive process that could take months.\n\nVallance was speaking during a visit to Humanoid, a UK-based robotics company that has already deployed its prototypes in a factory operated by German industrial group Siemens.\n\nAdam Kelsall, Humanoid’s head of product management, said the company welcomed “anything that gets us into the real world and testing [robots] sooner”.",

    "fullText": "Move comes as calls for Australia-style social media ban for under-16s grow around world\n\nTikTok will begin to roll out new age-verification technology across the EU in the coming weeks, as calls grow for an Australia-style social media ban for under-16s in countries including the UK.\n\nByteDance-owned TikTok, and other major platforms popular with young people such as YouTube, are coming under increasing pressure to better identify and remove accounts belonging to children.\n\nThe system, which has been quietly piloted in the EU over the past year, analyses profile information, posted videos and behavioural signals to predict whether an account may be belong to a user under the age of 13.\n\nAs well as analysing information the account holder provides about themselves, the technology looks at behaviour such as the videos a user publishes, and “other on-platform behaviour”.\n\nTikTok said accounts flagged by the system would be reviewed by specialist moderators rather than face an automatic ban, and may then be removed.\n\nIt also said users would have an opportunity to appeal against the removal of an account if an error had been made.\n\nOptions for age identification offered by TikTok during the appeal process include facial age estimation by the verification company Yoti, credit card authorisation or government-approved identification.\n\nThe European pilot led to the removal of thousands of accounts.\n\nThe rollout of the system comes as European authorities scrutinise how platforms verify users’ ages under data protection rules.\n\nTikTok said its system complied with data and privacy laws. “The prediction of the likelihood that someone is under the age of 13 is not used for purposes other than to decide whether to send an account to human moderators and to monitor and improve the technology,” the company said in a blogpost.\n\n“By adopting this approach, we are able to deliver safety for teens in a privacy-preserving manner. We take our responsibility to protect our community, and teens in particular, incredibly seriously.”\n\nIt said other features to protect younger users on its service included not allowing under-16s to direct-message, while under-18s have a 60-minute screen-time limit and do not receive notifications “after bed time”.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also uses Yoti to verify users’ ages on Facebook.\n\nIn December, Australia implemented a social media ban for people under the age of 16. On Thursday, the country’s eSafety commissioner revealed that more than 4.7m accounts had been removed across 10 platforms – including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snap and Facebook – since the ban was implemented on 10 December.\n\nEarlier this week, Keir Starmer told MPs he was open to a social media ban for young people in the UK after becoming concerned about the amount of time children and teenagers were spending on their smartphones.\n\nThe prime minister told Labour MPs he had become alarmed at reports of five-year-olds spending hours in front of screens each day, as well as increasingly worried about the damage social media was doing to under-16s.\n\nStarmer has previously opposed banning social media for children, believing such a move would be difficult to police and could push teenagers towards the dark web.\n\nEarlier this month, Ellen Roome, whose 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong, called for more rights for parents to access social media accounts of their children if they die.\n\nThe European parliament is pushing for age limits on social media, while Denmark wants to ban social media for those under 15.\n\nTikTok told Reuters the new technology was built specifically to comply with the EU’s regulatory requirements. The company has worked with Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, its lead EU privacy regulator, while developing the system.\n\nIn 2023, a Guardian investigation found that moderators were being told to allow under-13s to stay on the platform if they claimed their parents were overseeing their accounts.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - India has issued a final warning to Apple that it will proceed in an antitrust case ​against the U.S. tech giant as the company has delayed responses to ‌officials for over a year and undermined the investigation, a confidential order shows.\n\nApple has said it fears ‌it could be fined up to $38 billion if India's competition watchdog uses its global turnover calculation for penalties, after an investigation found it had abused its position on its app store. Apple, which denies the allegations, has challenged the penalty rules in ⁠an Indian court, and the ‌matter is pending.\n\nWhile the Delhi High Court is still hearing that challenge, a confidential December 31 order from the Competition Commission of ‍India (CCI) shows Apple privately sought to pause the entire case while the penalty‑rules dispute is before the court. The CCI rejected the request.\n\nThe watchdog said it asked Apple in October ​2024 to file objections to the investigation’s findings and provide financial details typically ‌used to assess penalties, but the company has received \"repeated extensions\" since then.\n\n\"The Commission is of the considered view that repeated extensions, despite unambiguous directions, undermine procedural discipline and impede the timely conclusion of proceedings,\" CCI noted in its order, seen by Reuters.\n\n\"Such indulgence cannot be continued indefinitely,\" it added, giving Apple a final warning ⁠that it will proceed in the case unilaterally ​if no response is received by next week.\n\nApple ​did not respond to Reuters queries.\n\nA source familiar with the matter said Apple views CCI's December order as a move to preempt the ‍ongoing court proceedings and ⁠the company was not likely to respond to it before the judges hear it next on January 27.\n\nSince 2022, Tinder-owner Match and Indian startups ⁠have been locked in an antitrust battle with Apple.

    "fullText": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson says he's hopeful about AI in the long term, but right now, he's just not seeing enough to meaningfully change his approach.\n\n\"I feel like it's a little bit like a flickering light bulb,\" Hansson said during a recent episode of \"Next Token.\" \"You're in total darkness and then it'll flicker on and you go like, 'I can see everything.' And then two seconds later, boom, pitch black.\"\n\nHansson said when he asked AI to write lines of code, the output is not \"as good as a job as most junior programmers I've had to deal with.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling that we're falling behind at 37 Signals in terms of our ability to produce, in terms of our ability to launch things or improve the products,\" he said. \"And this is why I'm a little skeptical about the claims that AI is already now at a place where you can take your standard SaaS business and then fire half the programmers and still go faster.\"\n\nHumans coded 95% of the code for Fizzy, 37 Signals' Kanban-inspired organization product, Hansson said. They've experienced with AI-powered features for the product, but for now, they've ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nHansson said he doesn't see his business losing ground because he's focusing on writing his own code. For the time being, he can still \"care about the beauty of it.\"\n\n\"That's a luxury that perhaps is akin to what a modern saddle maker enjoys when you go, \"Oh, the letter's just right, and the stitching is just right.' And you're like, 'Okay, but you're no longer part of the main production for transportation,'\" he said. \"And I'm like, 'Well, so what?' I'll continue to make my handwritten code saddles as long as I can for my enjoyment.\"\n\nAlternatively, Hansson said he's seen the promise of AI in the type of tools Shopify uses, where he serves on the board.\n\n\"Some of the things that they've done with SiteKick, the AI agent they have helping merchants set up their shop and optimize their shop is truly incredible,\" he said. \"And there's some real tangible benefits in that that I think are undisputable.\"\n\nOverall, Hansson said he's excited about the promise of a new era that could upend development, just as the iPhone's 2007 release ushered in a focus on mobile optimization.\n\n\"This is the first one where we, in real time, know the world is going to look totally different, and we don't know what the final result is going to be,\" he said. \"So I think the best thing you can just do is accept that A, we don't know, B, that it's really exciting, and C, just try to hold onto your hat, jump on there cowboy and ride it and see where it goes.\"\n\nHe also said AI isn't going away, no matter what some people may hope.\n\n\"That power does not exist. You don't get to roll these things back. Now, you could personally choose that you're not going to use gen AI,\" he said, adding that some people may also try to avoid buying products that were aided by AI.\n\nHansson said he's amazed by just how much of the US economy is based on large bets that AI will break through its current limitations and reach something akin to Artificial General Intelligence, the theoretical moment where AI reaches capabilities akin to humans.\n\n\"The entire American economy right now is one big bet that that's going to happen,\" he said. \"And I, as AI positive as I am, still marvel at that. The conviction of an entire economy to just combined go like 'Whatever takes 100 trillion, a thousand trillion. I don't care. We will get there.' I go like, 'That's why America is fucking number one.'\"",

    "fullText": "As the race to dominate AI accelerates, Europe's most prominent AI startup is betting that geography — not just technology — can be a competitive advantage in its home market.\n\nArthur Mensch, the CEO and cofounder of French AI company Mistral, said the company's edge in Europe over Silicon Valley rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic isn't about having dramatically smarter models.\n\nInstead, he said that many European governments and regulated enterprises are seeking AI systems they can control, customize, and operate independently, rather than relying on a small number of external providers.\n\n\"European governments are coming to us because they want to build the technology and they want to serve their citizens,\" Mensch said on the \"Big Technology Podcast\" on Wednesday.\n\nMistral, founded in 2023 and now valued at roughly $14 billion, develops large language models that rival those of leading US systems.\n\nBut Mensch said that frontier AI models are rapidly converging in performance as research spreads and training techniques become widely available.\n\nAs a result, the real battleground is shifting away from raw intelligence and toward deployment, control, and trust — a shift that plays directly into Mistral's pitch in Europe.\n\nMensch said governments, banks, and heavily regulated industries want AI systems they can customize, deploy locally, and operate independently — without fear that a single vendor could change the rules or shut off access.\n\nThe approach has already paid off. France's military recently selected Mistral for an AI deal that keeps sensitive systems running on French-controlled infrastructure.\n\nMensch pushed back on the idea that the company benefits merely from EU regulation or protectionism.\n\nInstead, he framed the demand as geopolitical and operational.\n\nEuropean governments, he said, want AI that they can govern themselves and use to serve citizens without depending on foreign platforms.\n\nThe same logic applies to regulated enterprises that need tighter control over data, compliance, and security.\n\nMistral's embrace of open-source models is central to that strategy.\n\nOpen source allows customers to run AI on their own infrastructure, build redundancy, and avoid vendor lock-in — a sharp contrast to the closed, centralized platforms favored by many US firms.\n\nThe appeal isn't limited to Europe. Mensch said Mistral also works with US and Asian customers who want to reduce dependence on a small group of American providers and retain more autonomy over how AI is used inside their organizations.\n\nThat approach is already extending beyond the West. Mistral recently deepened a partnership with Morocco's government to co-build locally tailored AI models and launch a joint research and development lab aimed at strengthening the country's technological autonomy.\n\nLong term, Mensch said he doesn't believe AI will be dominated by a single winner or country. Instead, he expects multiple regional centers of expertise shaped by local needs, industries, and political realities.\n\nIn that future, he suggested, Mistral's biggest advantage may not be the models it builds — but where, and how, it builds them.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

    "description": "The use of generative AI in video games has been controversial to say the least, but when it comes to art, the blowback has been even stronger. One game currently being accused of using the technology is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, as the new trailer for the fighting game's upcoming second season of DLC characters is being picked apart online. Viewers and commenters have pored over the trailer, claiming that the character designs are inconsistent and that certain visual elements contain generative AI. The biggest smoking gun, according to viewers, is a quick shot of series antagonist Geese Howard, who appears to be missing an entire foot.\nOther instances of generative AI pointed out include Blue Mary's motorcycle missing several vital components--and being a completely different model from what she normally rides--and Kim Jae Hoon having noticeably different wardrobes between his cinematic and gameplay character models.",

    "fullText": "First came efficiency. Then came intensity. Now it's accountability.\n\nA new year means a new mantra for Silicon Valley, and this time it's all about showing your work, writes BI's Tim Paradis.\n\nFrom Amazon helping managers track employees' time spent in the office to Meta keeping tabs on workers' AI usage, tech's corporate overlords are no longer going to take your word for it.\n\nThere's a not-so-subtle reason for this sudden interest in documentation. You might have heard me say this before, but companies are investing lots into AI, and the benefits aren't entirely clear. (JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon literally told analysts to just \"trust me.\")\n\nSo with investors breathing down execs' necks about their tech budgets, they're now looking for the humans to give them something to show for it. Add this to the growing list of ways AI ends up creating more work for employees.\n\nThis isn't just a Big Tech phenomenon. Citi CEO Jane Fraser, who is in the midst of her own \"Transformation,\" told workers in a recent memo that old habits won't fly anymore and everyone needs to step up their game.\n\nThere's a slightly less cynical way to look at this whole thing, one expert told Tim. Collecting all this data will help bosses better justify their workers' existence. (I only said it was slightly less cynical.)\n\nIt reminds me of an old coach I had. He'd tell us you shouldn't worry about getting yelled at. You should only panic when he stops yelling at you. That means he thinks you're a lost cause.\n\nThat might be true, but it sure didn't make wind sprints after practice easier.\n\nMetrics aren't a complete disaster for workers, but they could pose a risk to innovation.\n\nA clear sense of what your company expects from you can be beneficial, especially when you're looking for a raise. You asked me to produce X. I delivered X+1. Time to pay up. (Results may vary on that pitch.)\n\nGuidelines can be limiting though. Let's say you crack the code on hitting your assigned number. Are you willing to deviate from that strategy? Is the risk of not hitting your number worth the reward of trying something new?\n\nCreativity is rarely born from repetition. You often need to understand what doesn't work to figure out what will work. But if you're constantly being asked to show your worth, putting up a bunch of Ls, even if a W is around the corner, is a dangerous game.\n\nBesides, the executives are already taking enough risks for all of us.",

    "fullText": "The most recent global market forecasts from Boeing and Airbus project demand for more than 43,000 new commercial aviation airplanes over the next two decades. But according to Aleksey Matyushev, co-founder and CEO of Natilus, the manufacturing titans may struggle to meet it.\n\nMatyushev estimated that Boeing and Airbus have the capacity to produce about 11,000 and 15,000 planes, respectively, in that timeframe. That leaves a gap of more than 17,000-one the Natilus CEO believes could be filled by the company's fuel-efficient, blended-wing body (BWB) design, Horizon.\n\nThis Article First Appeared in FLYING Magazine\n\nIf you're not already a subscriber, what are you waiting for? \n\n\"I think the airlines are now more than ever interested in new ways of thinking, both from a manufacturing and a fuel efficiency perspective,\" Matyushev told FLYING.\n\nHorizon, which Matyushev said will have capacity for about 200 passengers, is one of a handful of regional jet concepts that developers position as solutions to airlines' anticipated capacity crunch. Natilus claims it will burn 30 percent less fuel than traditional aircraft and slash emissions and operating costs in half.\n\nAnother BWB design, JetZero's 250-passenger Z4, promises fuel burn reductions as high as 50 percent.\n\nFor now, these are simply promises.\n\nFew BWB aircraft have advanced beyond the prototype and demonstration phase, and none have been developed to fly passengers. But major U.S. carriers such as United Airlines and Alaska Airlines-which have invested in and placed conditional orders with JetZero-are already exploring the technology.\n\nDelta Air Lines is even aiding JetZero's development of the Z4, a prototype of which is expected to fly for the U.S. Air Force in 2027 under a $235 million contract award.\n\n\"Airlines need to refleet to more efficient aircraft and buy planes to support growth,\" JetZero said. \"Passenger demand is forecasted to double from 2019 levels by 2040, and the industry has pledged to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It will take innovation to meet this demand.\"\n\nThe BWB is an offshoot of the tailless, all-wing aircraft concept, or flying wing, which dates back to the early days of aviation.\n\nIn the 1910s, German engineer Hugo Junkers patented a pure flying wing design-a board-like airframe that would house engines and crew. The U.S. military used tailless biplanes for training around the time of World War I. Later flying wing designs, such as Northrop's B-2A Spirit bomber, became well known.",

    "description": "In Mansion House speech, mayor will talk of opportunities technology offers but highlight mass unemployment risk",
    "fullText": "In Mansion House speech, mayor will talk of opportunities technology offers but highlight mass unemployment risk\n\nSadiq Khan is to warn in a major speech that artificial intelligence (AI) could destroy swathes of jobs in London and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” unless ministers act now.\n\nIn his annual Mansion House speech, the London mayor will say the capital is “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.\n\nThe mayor will argue that “we have a moral, social and economic duty to act” to ensure that new jobs are created to replace those that will disappear, with entry-level and junior jobs the first to go.\n\nIn the speech on Thursday night, Khan will highlight research that suggests 70% of skills in the average job will have changed by 2030.\n\nHowever, he also sees huge potential benefits from AI for public services and productivity across the economy.\n\nWhen he addresses business leaders and bankers at Mansion House, the London mayor will say: “AI could enable us to transform our public services, turbocharge productivity and tackle some of our most complex challenges,” but used recklessly, will “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”. He will warn that the impact on the labour market will be “nothing short of colossal”.\n\nBut he will say that there is a clear choice: “seize the potential of AI and use it as a superpower for positive transformation and creation or surrender to it and sit back and watch as it becomes a weapon of mass destruction of jobs.”\n\nCity Hall is launching a London taskforce on AI and the future of work, with expertise from the government, businesses and the AI sector, to assess the potential impact of the new technology on London’s jobs market. It will also offer free AI training for Londoners.\n\nMore than half of workers in London expect AI to affect their jobs in some way in the next 12 months, according to City Hall polling.\n\nAcross the UK, up to 3m low-skilled jobs in trades, machine operations and admin roles could disappear by 2035 because of automation and AI, a report by the charity National Foundation for Educational Research found in November.\n\n“We can shape this next technological revolution and, if we are bold in our efforts, ensure AI makes us richer, not poorer, stronger, not weaker, more connected and more confident, and more capable of building a fairer, safer and more prosperous London for everyone,” Khan will say.\n\nHe will argue the UK and others have been too slow to respond to new technology in the past and that the growth of social media has led to a youth mental health crisis, a surge in online abuse and a dangerous rise in misinformation.\n\nSeparately, Susan Langley, major of the City of London, said on Thursday morning she had noticed that some finance workers were wary of coming to London from abroad because they worry about their safety.\n\nHowever, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The City of London is one of the safest cities in the world. There’s this perception that you’re going to step out of your office and be swept away in a tsunami of crime.\n\n“It’s completely wrong. Competition for investment is really fierce at the moment, and I think any kind of unfounded negative sentiment that’s being pushed out there really risks undermining the UK on the global stage, and we just can’t let it happen.”",

And to see how it was working with these children, and then the kids ended up taking their lives,\" he said, \"That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nCharacter.AI allows users to build custom chatbots that can emulate the behaviour of a close friend or romantic partner. The startup did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment about Benioff's remarks.\n\n\"Tech companies hate regulation. They hate it,\" Benioff said. \"Except for one regulation they love: Section 230.

Tech giants use Section 230 as a common defense strategy, saying they are just platforms and not responsible for what users say and do on them.\n\n\"Step one is let's just hold people accountable,\" he said. \"Let's reshape, reform, revise Section 230, and let's try to save as many lives as we can by doing that.\"\n\nExecutives, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, have repeatedly defended the regulation in Congress, asking for it to be expanded rather than removed.\n\nLast week, Google and Character.AI agreed to settle multiple lawsuits from families whose teenagers died by suicide or hurt themselves after interacting with Character.AI's chatbots.\n\nThese negotiations are among the first settlements in lawsuits that accuse AI tools of contributing to mental health crises and suicides among teenagers. OpenAI and Meta are facing similar lawsuits as they, along with others, race to build large language models that sound more friendly and helpful, ultimately keeping users coming back.",

    "fullText": "Showing the value of great design over visual impact, this faithfully resurrected home computer seamlessly integrates modern tech with some wonderful additional touches\n\nThe emotional hit was something I didn’t expect, although perhaps I should have. The Commodore 64 Ultimate, a new version of the legendary 8-bit computer, comes in a box designed to resemble the original packaging – a photo of the machine itself on a background of deep blue fading into a series of white stripes. Then when you open it, you find an uncannily accurate replica of what fans lovingly referred to as the breadbox – the chunky, sloped Commodore 64, in hues of brown and beige, the red LED in one corner above the row of fawn-coloured function keys. It’s like 1982 all over again.\n\nMy dad bought us a C64 in late 1983. It was our second computer after the ZX81 and it felt like an enormous leap into the future with its detailed colour graphics, advanced sound chip and proper grown-up keyboard. We unpacked it on our dinner table, plugging it into a small portable TV and loading the one game we had, a very basic Donkey Kong clone named Crazy Kong. My life would never be the same again. This contraption was my obsession for the next four years – my friendships and free-time would revolve around games such as Bruce Lee, Paradroid and Hyper Sports. To this day, I treasure the memories of playing golf sim Leaderboard with my dad. The sound effects, speech samples and graphics conjured by that computer have lived rent free in my head for, god, almost 40 years.\n\nCommodore was a huge success for a decade. It followed the 64 (which sold somewhere between 12-30m units) with the Amiga, another great gaming machine. But with the rise of the PC came a long painful decline – the company eventually filing for bankruptcy in 1994, the brand kept semi-alive for years afterwards by a series of intellectual property buyouts. In August 2025, however, retro YouTuber Christian “Peri Fractic” Simpson, backed by a board of Commodore veterans, bought the brand and promised to reinvigorate it.\n\nThe result is the Ultimate, a faithful reproduction, not just in looks (although you can opt for a Starlight edition with lots of LED lights and a transparent case), but in tech specs. Instead of running a software emulation of the C64, it’s built around an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) – an integrated circuit programmed to simulate the actual hardware. You can plug in an original C64 Datasette or disk drive and it will run original software (a wonderful touch is that if you’re running a disk file, the computer simulates the noise of a disk drive complete with whirs, tics and bleeps). It even has a cartridge port that will run old game carts such as International Soccer. To complete the scene, you can plug your old Quick Shot II into one of the two joystick ports. Then simply load up a copy of Daley Thompson’s Decathlon and immediately break it.\n\nBut it’s not just a machine for playing old games. Turn it on using the authentic power switch on the side and it boots into the original Commodore 64 start screen, complete with the words, “Commodore 64 Basic V2, 64K Ram system, 38911 Basic Bytes free. Ready.” And the flashing cursor. You can programme it just as you could back then, using Basic or, if you’re feeling advanced, assembly language. Obviously I tried everyone’s first program in the 1980s:\n\n10 print “keith is cool”;\n\n 20 goto 10\n\nIt worked. After that, I dug out an old program listing from Computer & Video Games magazine and have been typing it in – although it’s a challenge as the print is small, faint and smudged after 30 years in my attic. On top of this, you can click the power button upwards and it switches to an alternate menu crammed with new options. You can plug in a USB thumb drive and load C64 games and apps that you’ve acquired online. The computer also comes with a sample USB drive (shaped like a cassette tape) that is filled with demos and games to try. Even better, it’s easy to connect it the internet via a wired or wireless connection, which gives you access to a community archive of games, as well as old school bulletin board systems, basically the 1980s equivalents of Reddit forums.\n\nWhat I love about the machine is this seamless integration of modern tech into a retro environment. You can plug it into a modern monitor via HDMI, but the menus and inputs are all redolent of the 1980s era – lists of text, Ascii art, cursor keys or W, A, S, D for navigation. The memories of interacting with this ancient hardware came flooding back. Everything you did on the C64 required some effort and expertise, whether that was loading a game or writing little programs – there was no drag-and-drop, no plug-and-play; you were a computer user not a platform consumer. In its press release announcing the product, Commodore referred to itself as “the Digital Detox Brand – a bold stand against today’s toxic tech”. And while that’s a little polemical and self-aggrandising, there’s some truth in it. Exploring the C64 these last few weeks has given me more pleasure than downloading an app on to my phone ever has.\n\nSet to be priced at £260.50 ($349.99/AU$524), it’s not cheap and begs the question – is there value to this machine beyond its appeal to original owners? I think there is. In a more accessible way than the incredible PDP-10 replica I wrote about last year, it’s a living historical relic, a way to reconnect with the original concept of a desktop home computer – as something we learned and coded for. The excellent user’s guide it ships with is filled with useful information on how to get it to make music and display graphics; I sincerely hope that an alternative indie gaming scene thrives here as a result. There is intrinsic value in understanding computers at a fundamental level beyond slick user interfaces; there is value in developing a knowledge of how programs work, however simple.\n\nAnd even the machine’s nostalgic impact has worth. It has been fun to show my sons this fossilised contraption – no curated walls of games to buy, no ads, no pop-ups, no social media notifications. Meanwhile, playing those old games again has proven the value of great design and clever programming over hype and visual impact. It’s a lesson we could all afford to learn.",

    "title": "Wired: \"Tech Workers Are Condemning ICE Even as Their CEOs Stay Quiet\"",
    "description": "The killing of George Floyd in 2020 prompted a wave of statements from tech companies and CEOs. Today, pushback against ICE is largely coming from employees, not executives.",
    "fullText": "returned to the White House last January, the biggest names in tech have mostly fallen in line with the new regime, attending dinners with officials, heaping praise upon the administration, presenting the president with lavish gifts, and pleading for Trump’s permission to sell their products to China. It’s been largely business as usual for Silicon Valley over the past year, even as the administration ignored a wide range of constitutional norms and attempted to slap arbitrary fees on everything from chip exports to worker visas for high-skilled immigrants employed by tech firms.\n\nBut after an ICE agent shot and killed an unarmed US citizen, Renee Nicole Good, in broad daylight in Minneapolis last week, a number of tech leaders have begun publicly speaking out about the Trump administration’s tactics. This includes prominent researchers at Google and Anthropic, who have denounced the killing as callous and immoral. The most wealthy and powerful tech CEOs are still staying silent as ICE floods America’s streets, but now some researchers and engineers working for them have chosen to break rank.\n\nMore than 150 tech workers so far have signed a petition asking for their company CEOs to call the White House, demand that ICE leave US cities, and speak out publicly against the agency’s recent violence. Anne Diemer, a human resources consultant and former Stripe employee who organized the petition, says that workers at Meta, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, TikTok, Spotify, Salesforce, Linkedin, and Rippling are among those who have signed. The group plans to make the list public once they reach 200 signatories.\n\n“I think so many tech folks have felt like they can’t speak up,” Diemer told WIRED. “I want tech leaders to call the country’s leaders and condemn ICE’s actions, but even if this helps people find their people and take a small part in fighting fascism, then that’s cool, too.”\n\nNikhil Thorat, an engineer at Anthropic, said in a lengthy post on X that Good’s killing had “stirred something” in him. “A mother was gunned down in the street by ICE, and the government doesn’t even have the decency to perform a scripted condolence,” he wrote. Thorat added that the moral foundation of modern society is “infected, and is festering,” and the country is living through a “cosplay” of Nazi Germany, a time when people also stayed silent out of fear.\n\nJonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, added a “+1” to Thorat’s post. Shrisha Radhakrishna, chief technology and chief product officer of real estate platform Opendoor, replied that what happened to Good is “not normal. It's immoral. The speed at which the administration is moving to dehumanize a mother is terrifying.” Other users who identified themselves as employees at OpenAI and Anthropic also responded in support of Thorat.\n\nShortly after Good was shot, Jeff Dean, an early Google employee and University of Minnesota graduate who is now the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, began re-sharing posts with his 400,000 X followers criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, including one outlining circumstances in which deadly force isn’t justified for police officers interacting with moving vehicles.\n\nHe then weighed in himself. “This is completely not okay, and we can't become numb to repeated instances of illegal and unconstitutional action by government agencies,” Dean wrote in an X post on January 10. “The recent days have been horrific.” He linked to a video of a teenager—identified as a US citizen—being violently arrested at a Target in Richfield, Minnesota.\n\nIn response to US vice president JD Vance’s assertion on X that Good was trying to run over the ICE agent with her vehicle, Aaron Levie, the CEO of the cloud storage company Box, replied, “Why is he shooting after he’s fully out of harm’s way (2nd and 3rd shot)? Why doesn’t he just move away from the vehicle instead of standing in front of it?” He added a screenshot of a Justice Department web page outlining best practices for law enforcement officers interacting with suspects in moving vehicles.",

    "description": "You might have heard recently that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS.",
    "fullText": "You might have heard recently that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS. It’s called Grid Lanes.\n\nCSS Grid Lanes adds a whole new capability to CSS Grid. It lets you line up content in either columns or rows — and not both.\n\nThis layout pattern allows content of various aspect ratios to pack together. No longer do you need to truncate content artificially to make it fit. Plus, the content that’s earlier in the HTML gets grouped together towards the start of the container. If new items get lazy loaded, they appear at the end without reshuffling what’s already on screen.\n\nIt can be tricky to understand the content flow pattern as you are learning Grid Lanes. The content is not flowing down the first column to the very bottom of the container, and then back up to the top of the second column. (If you want that pattern, use CSS Multicolumn or Flexbox.)\n\nWith Grid Lanes, the content flows perpendicular to the layout shape you created. When you define columns, the content flows back and forth across those columns, just like to how it would if rows existed. If you define rows, the content will flow up and down through the rows — in the column direction, as if columns were there.\n\nHaving a way to see the order of items can make it easier to understand this content flow. Introducing the CSS Grid Lanes Inspector in Safari. It’s just the regular Grid Inspector, now with more features.\n\nSafari’s Grid Inspector already reveals the grid lines for Grid Lanes, and labels track sizes, line numbers, line names, and area names. Now it has a new feature — “Order Numbers”.\n\nYou might be tempted to believe the content order doesn’t matter. With pages like this photo gallery — most users will have no idea how the photos are ordered in the HTML. But for many users, the content order has a big impact on their experience. You should always consider what it’s like to tab through content — watching one item after another sequentially come into focus. Consider what it’s like to listen to the site through a screenreader while navigating by touch or keyboard. With Grid Lanes, you can adjust flow-tolerance to reduce the jumping around and put items where people expect.\n\nTo know which value for flow tolerance to choose, it really helps to quickly see the order of items. That makes it immediately clear how your CSS impacts the result.\n\nOrder Numbers in the Grid Inspector is an extension of a feature Safari’s Flexbox Inspector has had since Safari 16.0 — marking the order of Flex items. Seeing content order is also helpful when using the order property in Flexbox.\n\nOrder Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector works for CSS Grid and Subgrid, as well as Grid Lanes.\n\nThe Grid and Flexbox layout inspectors might seem similar across browsers, but the team behind Safari’s Web Inspector has taken the time to finely polish the details. In both the Grid and Flexbox Inspectors, you can simultaneously activate as many overlays as you want. No limits. And no janky scrolling due to performance struggles.\n\nSafari’s Flexbox Inspector visually distinguishes between excess free space and Flex gaps, since knowing which is which can solve confusion. It shows the boundaries of items, revealing how they are distributed both on the main axis and the cross axis of Flexbox containers. And it lists all the Flexbox containers, making it easier to understand what’s happening overall.\n\nOur Grid Inspector has a simple and clear interface, making it easy to understand the options. It also lists all Grid containers. And of course, you can change the default colors of the overlays, to best contrast with your site content.\n\nAnd Safari’s Grid and Flexbox Inspectors are the only browser devtools that label content order. We hope seeing the order of content in Grid Lanes helps you understand it more thoroughly and enjoy using this powerful new layout mechanism.\n\nOrder Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector shipped today in Safari Technology Preview 235. Let us know what you think. There’s still time to polish the details to make the most helpful tool possible. You can ping Jen Simmons on Bluesky or Mastodon with links, comments and ideas.",

    "description": "Never underestimate the power of financial incentives. Even for tech billionaires.",
    "fullText": "\"You get what you measure\" is one of my favorite concepts in modern business. It means people and organizations tend to focus their behavior on whatever metrics get tracked and rewarded.\n\nThis even applies to tech billionaires.\n\nThis week, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will make its FSD service subscription-only and remove the option to buy it outright.\n\nOn social media, Elon stans theorized and argued with Elon-haters over the reason for this change. As usual, the debate was devoid of nuance. Fans took this as another sign of the Tesla CEO's genius. Critics argued this proves FSD doesn't work and is doomed.\n\nAs usual, the truth lies elsewhere. Here's my theory, which my Business Insider colleague Tom Carter nodded at earlier.\n\nI think Tesla is getting what it measures. Musk's new compensation package, approved by shareholders late last year, has several tough targets the company must hit before he gets $1 trillion.\n\nAccording to Tesla's proxy filing, there are four product goals. Number 2 on the list is this: \"10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions.\"\n\nOne way Tesla can reach this milestone more quickly is to remove the option to buy FSD outright. By mid-February, anyone considering this option will need to subscribe instead.\n\nWhy would Tesla's board make this a goal for Musk? Subscriptions are a steadier business. Investors prefer continuous income generated by subscription businesses, versus lumpier operations that rely on large, one-time purchases. A pure FSD subscription also gives Tesla more flexibility to change pricing in the future.\n\nI think this is the main lesson, though: Never underestimate the power of financial incentives.\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the FSD change.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Energy regulators and advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to \"pay its own way\" for the power needed to serve its AI footprint.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is promising to cover the costs of electricity needed to power its rapidly growing fleet of data centers in suburban and rural communities across the US.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, Brad Smith, the president and vice chair of the Big Tech giant, said that going forward, Microsoft will \"pay utility rates that are high enough to cover our electricity costs.\"\n\nIt's a bold pledge to make at a time when AI is fueling a historic surge in demand for power in the US, and electric bills are surging for the average American utility customer.\n\nIt is also one that state regulators have heard before as utilities, their data center customers, and consumer advocates argue over who will bear the cost of new infrastructure needed to serve AI's enormous appetite for power.\n\nBut as the impact of data centers on electricity rates becomes an increasingly hot political flashpoint, Microsoft may have no other choice but to follow through, and the rest of Big Tech might not be far behind.\n\n\"There is no free lunch for tech players, and Trump is watching,\" said Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities.\n\nIves expects other Big Tech companies to follow Microsoft's lead and make similar pledges addressing local concerns around major data center buildouts sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" President Trump wrote Monday night in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nTrump wrote that his administration had collaborated with Microsoft on the company's pledge to cover its electricity costs, and alluded to future announcements by other companies.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, the White House Press Office pointed to President Trump's post on Truth Social.\n\nMicrosoft's four-part plan to ensure it is paying its fair share of electricity costs was laid out in a blog post this week. The plan consists of asking utilities and regulators to set their rates high enough to cover their data center costs, collaborating with utilities to cover the costs of new infrastructure, looking for ways to operate data centers more efficiently, and advocating for affordable, reliable power at the state and federal levels.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, a spokesperson for Microsoft pointed to the company's blog post.\n\nConsumer advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to pay its fair share, but eager to see more details — especially from the utilities that serve the data centers.\n\n\"These are only rough concepts that don't get at the root of the problem, which is the scale and speed at which the industry is moving,\" said Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at Virginia's Piedmont Environmental Council.\n\nDominion Energy, Virginia's largest public utility, has said it is in contract talks with data center customers for 47 gigawatts of new demand — double Dominion's current peak load.\n\nBolthouse is concerned about the legitimacy of that demand — and who might end up footing the bill if it never comes to fruition.\n\n\"The current process of unreviewed contracts between utilities and data centers has broken the planning process and threatens the reliability of the system,\" said Bolthouse.\n\nCharles Hua, founder and director of Powerlines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility regulation reform, said that data centers can be \"good grid citizens\" if local utilities prioritize investment in grid-enhancing technologies and energy efficiency over building new power plants.\n\n\"Doing so will require states to reimagine our outdated system of utility regulation and make necessary changes to center consumers going forward,\" he said.",

Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.\n\nThe firestorm over the Grok AI tool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

    "fullText": "If you're wondering whether JPMorgan's tech spend is paying off, here's Jamie Dimon's answer: \"Trust me.\"\n\nThat's how the CEO responded to questions about the bank's ROI on its ever-growing tech budget during JPMorgan's fourth-quarter earnings calls. The bank is projecting it'll spend roughly $9.7 billion \n\nHe won't be the last executive pressed on money spent on tech and AI. The quiet concerns that started last year regarding massive AI investments are escalating into loud protests in 2026.\n\nDimon wasn't just asking for blind faith from his shareholders. He discussed the threat posed by his peers and fintechs, and said spending on technology and AI is far more important than trying to \"meet some expense target.\"\n\n(For what it's worth, JPMorgan is actually top of the class when it comes to AI maturity across Wall Street, according to Evident's AI index.)\n\nThe players might be different, but other businesses will likely defend their AI spend with a similar argument: Every dollar I don't spend is one my competitor is willing to, and that could be the difference between winning and losing.\n\nI'm not endorsing FOMO-inspired spending, but I see the rationale. I'd rather go down swinging in the AI wars than not enter the fray at all.\n\nThere's another fight JPMorgan isn't interested in getting into.\n\nThe bank's CFO said the credit card rate cap proposed by President Donald Trump could force JPM to rethink its business entirely.\n\nIt's the latest company to weigh in on Trump's proposal, and it's a biggy. JPMorgan's card services sales totalled roughly $360 billion last quarter.\n\nOpponents of Trump's pitch say capping credit card rates will backfire. If lenders can't charge higher rates to riskier borrowers, they'll just limit the credit they offer them instead of lowering their rates.\n\nAnd it's not like people will stop borrowing. (This is America, after all.) They'll just look for alternatives, which could lead them to take out more personal loans, making 2026 potentially a big year for lenders like SoFi.",

    "description": "When my husband was laid off from his tech job, we sold our house and decided to travel for a year in our 40s. It changed how we view happiness.",
    "fullText": "We lived with our two greyhounds in an over-3,000-square-foot home outside Boston that we owned. We were both hustling and climbing the corporate ladder — he in the tech industry, and I at a law practice.\n\nThen, in 2022, Dave got laid off, and we lost our two dogs to cancer.\n\nThat's when we had the harrowing realization that the life we'd spent years building no longer fit us. Our home now felt far too big, and we felt lost and restless. We desperately needed a change — but first, a change of scenery.\n\nSo, we sold our house and decided to spend a year traveling the world as we contemplated our next move.\n\nBefore hitting the road, I figured out a plan to work remotely. That income, plus Dave's severance and the money made from the sale of our home, would allow us to enjoy some time away without financial strain.\n\nOur travel goals were simple — see a lot of places, think about what to do with our lives when we returned to the US, and spend time with animals along the way.\n\nThough we're ambitious, we've always found that spending time around animals forces us to slow down. It's a lesson we'd learned after adopting our dogs, who always seemed happy just to be, sans any hustle.\n\nSo, we started our trip on a farm about an hour south of Dublin, where we were able to really mellow out.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to find a note from Dave that said he was joining the husband-and-wife farmers to scan the bellies of the pregnant sheep on-site.\n\nI cradled a warm cup of coffee in my hands as I stood behind my husband while he helped the farmers. His smile was the biggest I'd seen in a long time.\n\nOver the next nine months, we visited other countries in Europe including Croatia, Portugal, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nWe traveled slowly and established home bases in each place, which allowed us to really relax into the environment. We were able to explore at our own pace, and we also had time to consider what our future looked like back in the US.\n\nWhatever was next, we knew it would involve less hustle and more time in the natural world.\n\nAfter nine months, our hunger for travel felt more than satiated.\n\nWe returned to the US with a clear understanding that the life we'd left behind in the States — with a giant home and a constant desire to climb the corporate ladder — wasn't the one we wanted to cultivate again.\n\nDuring our travels, some of our most cherished memories included spending time on the farm in Dublin and sinking into the hot springs in Iceland. It was moments such as these that helped us realize the life we wanted was slower and more intentional.\n\nSo, we downsized to an 800-square-foot home on a lake in central Massachusetts. We even adopted another greyhound — one who's always eager to sit lakeside with his dads, watching the birds fly by.\n\nA little more than a year after we returned, I retired from my law practice to focus on writing, and Dave left the tech industry behind to start a whole new career at a mom-and-pop company.\n\nIf traveling for that year taught us anything, it's that our joy is better accessed with less stuff, less chasing of bigger-and-better opportunities, and more chances to be with the natural world.\n\nThis story was originally published on June 17, 2025, and most recently updated on January 14, 2026.",

Now, he works as a partner software engineer at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe consequences of underperforming are \"more drastic\" now than they were 10 years ago, Friggeri said on \"The Peterman Pod.\"\n\nIn an email to Business Insider, Friggeri wrote that there is less \"organizational 'slack'\" and higher expectations for tech employees.\n\n\"That means performance gaps are identified and addressed faster, and if someone is not meeting clearly defined expectations over time, the path to a formal performance-management process (and potentially a role change or exit) can be shorter than it used to be,\" Friggeri wrote.\n\nMeta has been especially strict with its performance expectations. The tech giant laid off roughly 3,600 employees in February, labeling them low performers.\n\nThere are also benefits to being above the pack. Meta is introducing higher bonuses for top performers, Business Insider reported on Monday.\n\nIn his email, Friggeri clarified that the trend was not specific to Meta. Rather, it was industry-wide and reflected the state of the market. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFriggeri shared four tips with Business Insider to stay ahead and avoid underperformance.\n\n1.) Workers should make expectations explicit.\n\n\"Align with your manager on priorities and what 'great' looks like for the next 30/60/90 days,\" Friggeri wrote.\n\n2.) Employees should seek out feedback.\n\nThey shouldn't wait for review cycles, Friggeri wrote. Feedback should be sought out \"early and often.\"\n\n3.) Focus on \"visible, high-leverage work.\"\n\n\"Pick projects tied to clear outcomes and communicate progress, risks, and tradeoffs,\" he wrote.\n\n4.) Keep investing in your skills\n\nFriggeri wrote that employees should \"treat learning as part of the job, especially as teams and priorities shift.\"\n\nOn the podcast, Friggeri advocated for being independent and building new projects — and not being silent about them. It's not helpful to \"lock yourself in a room,\" build for three months, and show up with the finished product.\n\n\"Overcommunicate is really the strategy I would recommend,\" he said.",

    "title": "Meta cuts more than 1k in Bay Area tech's first big layoff of 2026",
    "description": "The company wants to plow more money into its wearable tech.",
    "fullText": "Meta is laying off more than 1,000 workers, signaling a partial retreat from the company’s much-derided metaverse ambitions.\n\nThe layoff, the Bay Area tech industry’s first big job cut of 2026, was announced Tuesday morning in an internal post from Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, according to a Bloomberg report that Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed to SFGATE. The cuts won’t touch Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp; they’re within Meta’s Reality Labs arm, an operation that’s poured investment into the “metaverse” idea and also sells the company’s virtual reality headsets and Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” Clayton wrote in an emailed statement. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”\n\nAs of Tuesday at 9:15 a.m., the Menlo Park company had not filed a WARN document with California officials announcing the local scope of the layoffs.\n\nMeta’s pullback from its metaverse goals has been a long time coming. When Mark Zuckerberg changed his company’s name from Facebook in October 2021, he expounded on the idea of a virtual world where people could work, learn, play and shop together, calling it an “embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it.”\n\nHe wrote, “Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology.” His ambitions were, like the rhetoric, grand: “Our hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.”\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBut hype around the idea of a metaverse — at one point, people were buying virtual land on other companies’ versions of the metaverse — quickly faded into derision. Meta was mocked for its legless virtual avatars, and failed to turn its Horizon Worlds metaverse product into a hit.\n\nRather than renewing the company, the ambition instead has served as a drag on Meta’s finances. In 2024, the company reported spending 21% of its costs on the Reality Labs segment, even as it lost more than $17.7 billion in the division. Quarter after quarter, the long-term bet has eaten into Meta’s vast social media ad profits. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the division has turned a $71 billion loss since the start of 2021.\n\nZuckerberg’s choice to move that investment toward Meta’s wearables, rather than the metaverse, is a bet on products that Meta has been actually able to find large audiences for. The company’s Quest headsets are well-reviewed and far, far cheaper than Apple’s Vision Pro offering. Bloomberg reported that Meta is considering doubling its output of its new artificial intelligence-embedded glasses, thanks to high demand.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAs SFGATE reported, Zuckerberg is imagining a future where anyone not wearing high-tech frames will be at a “cognitive disadvantage.” Moving money from the metaverse toward wearables means he’s swapping one lofty ambition for another.\n\nWork at a Bay Area tech company and want to talk?

    "fullText": "If you handed Mark Cuban $100,000, he wouldn't run to Wall Street or some hot tech startup. He'd grab a shopping cart.\n\nIn a 2010 Forbes interview, the billionaire was asked what he'd do with a lump sum of $100,000. His response wasn't flashy. It wasn't cryptic. And it didn't involve crypto. It involved…toothpaste.\n\n\"First I pay off all my credit card debt and evaluate paying off any other debt I have. What I have left I put in the bank,\" he said. But he didn't stop there.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nMissed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs? This Platform Lets Everyday Investors Access Private Tech Early\n\nThen comes the part that sounds less like a billionaire's financial strategy and more like a Costco coupon haul: \"I try to create as much transactional value as possible from that cash. I look at my annual budgets for everything and anything, and I look to see where I can save the most money on those items. Saving 30% to 50% buying in bulk—replenishable items from toothpaste to soup, or whatever I use a lot of—is the best guaranteed return on investment you can get anywhere.\"\n\nLet's break that down. Cuban isn't saying go hoard hand sanitizer like it's 2020 again. He's saying if you already use toothpaste, toilet paper, canned soup, shampoo—things you're going to buy anyway—you might as well stock up when prices are lower. That's the ROI: buying stuff now to avoid paying more later. His version of \"investing\" isn't tied up in risk—it's about locked-in savings.\n\nLet's say you usually buy a four-pack of toilet paper for $6, but a bulk box of 30 rolls goes on sale for $20. That's about 67 cents a roll vs. $1.50 a roll. Over the year, you're not just wiping away inconvenience—you're saving real cash. Multiply that across your grocery staples and, like Cuban says, you're looking at a \"guaranteed\" ROI no stock or bond can promise.\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd what about the rest of that $100,000? Don't expect a fancy ETF recommendation from Cuban.\n\n\"Whatever I have left I keep in the bank and let it earn nothing,\" he said in the interview.\n\nYes—\"let it earn nothing.\" Why? Because then it's ready. Cuban's not parking money in the bank out of laziness—he's waiting for the moment he can pounce. In his world, flexibility beats short-term yield.",

    "fullText": "Big tech companies are increasingly striking direct deals with utilities to secure reliable, long-term energy supplies as their power needs surge, driven mainly by data centers, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. These agreements often include power purchase agreements for renewable energy, such as wind and solar, allowing tech firms to lock in stable prices while helping utilities finance new generation and grid upgrades. In some cases, companies are also partnering with utilities on energy storage, transmission expansion, and even next-generation sources like small modular nuclear reactors to ensure around-the-clock power. For utilities, these deals provide guaranteed demand and investment capital. At the same time, tech companies offer energy security, cost predictability, and progress toward sustainability goals—making the partnerships strategically crucial for both sides.\n\nGrowth and income investors looking for a safer way to play the AI and data center explosion have found an avenue with utility stocks.\n\nMany top U.S. utility companies have already cut landmark deals with big-tech giants.\n\nPaying dependable dividends and offering long-term safety for investors, top utility stocks make sense in a growth and income portfolio.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nWe decided to screen our 24/7 Wall St. utility stocks research database to identify the top companies in the sector that have already struck substantial deals with some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent players. Surging demand for electricity, which will only continue to grow, has made some of America’s oldest and best utility companies one of the best investments for growth and income investors who would like to participate in the AI/data center revolution but would rather play it from a safer angle. What could be a better avenue than utility stocks that pay dependable, and in some cases large, dividend payments every quarter? Five top companies that we have covered for years may be perfect stocks for Boomer and Gen X investors, and all are rated Buy at the top Wall Street firms we cover.\n\nThis off-the-radar utility stock is an ideal choice for growth and income investors, with its hefty 3.93% dividend yield. Brookfield Renewable Corp. (NYSE: BEPC) operates renewable power platforms and sustainable solutions. The company has signed a framework with Microsoft to develop over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity from 2026 to 2030, and also has a hydro framework agreement with Google.",

Our technology expert compares the top Apple smartwatches available right now\n\nThe best running watches – tested\n\nThe best Apple Watch may be the one already on your wrist.\n\nEach generation of Apple’s smartwatch is fairly iterative, with most of the best features added via software updates, which means there’s no need to buy a new device each year. That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.\n\nWhile several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll need an iPhone running iOS 26 – iPhone 11 or later – to use one. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.\n\nBest Apple Watch for most people:\nSE 3\n\nBest mid-range Apple Watch: \n\n Series 11\n\nBest Apple Watch for battery: \n\n Ultra 3\n\nI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time, I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting-edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.\n\nWe conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.\n\nWe change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.\n\nWe test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.\n\nThe recently updated entry-level Apple Watch SE 3 offers almost everything its more expensive siblings do, but at a discount.\n\nIt’s light and comfortable to wear, and arrives in a choice of 40mm and 44mm case sizes. Available in either starlight or midnight aluminium, with many different strap colours and types, it should fit most wrists and styles.\n\nThe big upgrade for the SE this year is the always-on display, as well as the rapid S10 chip and 64GB of storage from the Series 11. It runs the latest watchOS 26, which comes with super-handy double-tap and wrist-flick gestures to clear notifications, alarms and scroll through your widgets hands-free. Siri runs locally, so you can quickly set timers, dictate messages and other basic features without an internet connection. And the SE 3 has all the deep integration with the iPhone that makes Apple Watches great, including Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos, music control and many other features. Battery life is about one and a half days.\n\nThe SE 3 sports an older design than the current Series watch line, with chunkier bezels, a slightly smaller and dimmer screen and a 1mm thicker body, but otherwise it looks very similar to all other Apple Watches. Only those comparing them side by side are likely to spot the difference.\n\nWhile you get most of Apple’s class-leading health-tracking features, this entry-level model can’t take ECGs of your heart, record blood oxygen saturation or notify you about any potential hypertension. It still has an optical heart-rate monitor for recording throughout the day and night, though. Its skin temperature sensor allows for retrospective ovulation estimates in the cycles tracking app, too, alongside other features.\n\nIt tracks all your usual sleep, standing, steps and movement goals, and the GPS makes it a decent running and workout tracker. It supports Apple’s new AI Workout Buddy coach, but this requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later with Apple Intelligence to be carried with you on runs.\n\nNote that 5G models are available, but require a plan linked to your phone provider. And if you’re looking for a cellular-connected watch, I’d recommend the Series 11 with 5G instead.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe SE 3 offers all the essential bits of the Apple Watch experience, including an always-on screen, but in an older-looking body with a few more advanced health features removed. That leaves a great smartwatch for iPhone users that does most of what people want at a good price.\n\nDon’t buy if: you want ECG or hypertension alerts.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch SE 3 review: the bargain smartwatch for iPhone\n\nSize: 40/44mm\nThickness: 10.7mm\nScreen brightness: up to 1,000nits\nTested battery life: 1.5 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 50 metres \nSensors: HR (2nd gen), skin temperature, GPS\n\nThe biggest, boldest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 3, which builds on the Series 11 with a supersized screen and body, and adds a bunch of adventure-ready features – ready for life in the wilderness, or just work in the city.\n\nIt’s available only in titanium and at 49mm, although there’s a choice of a natural or black finish. It has the biggest and brightest screen on an Apple Watch, protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. Similar to the Series 11, the display is much brighter off-angle, making it easier to read at a glance.\n\nOn the inside, it’s similar to the Series 11: an S10 chip, 64GB storage, and 5G support as standard with a compatible phone plan. It runs the same watchOS 26, including the double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, but battery life is three days plus with general use. This will see you through a long weekend, or up to 14 hours of tracking workouts at the highest accuracy settings.\n\nOn the outside, the Ultra 3 has an extra action button, with which you can start a workout and light up the screen as a torch, plus other features. There’s a chunkier crown and a loudspeaker that doubles as a siren to attract attention in emergency situations. New for this year is satellite connectivity for free SOS messaging to the emergency services, if things go awry when you’re out of cellular signal range.\n\nThe Ultra 3 also has dual-band GPS, making it one of the most accurate running, cycling and sports tracking watches available. It offers a good suite of tracking metrics, plus Workout Buddy for motivation, if you carry your iPhone with you. The watch can also track dives to 40 metres’ depth and at least 22 other activities.\n\nSize-wise, it’s big for an Apple Watch – but the Ultra 3 still fits under shirt cuffs, and is relatively compact compared with adventure watch rivals from the likes of Garmin. This is a good choice should you want an Apple Watch that stands out – although it costs about twice as much as the Series 11.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, boldest, longest-lasting, and most capable Apple Watch. It’s ready for daily life, workouts or the odd adventure into the wilderness.\n\nDon’t buy if: you need a compact model or have smaller wrists.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhone\n\nSize: 49mm\nThickness: 12mm \nScreen brightness: up to 3,000nits\nTested battery life: 3 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 100 metres \nSensors: HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, dual-band GPS\n\nSeries 10 \n\n The same design as the Series 11 with the same chip and screen, but with a slightly smaller battery, less scratch-resistant glass and 4G rather than 5G. Worth buying at a discount.\n\nSeries 9 \n\n Thicker and with a slightly smaller screen than the Series 10 or 11, but worth buying refurbished if you don’t want the SE 3.\n\nUltra 2 \n\n 2023’s Ultra Apple Watch was great, and is only missing a few small upgrades to screen, battery, 5G and satellite SOS compared with the current model.\n\nWearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.\n\nGreater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, although options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges at least £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteries costs £95.\n\nBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.\n\nThere are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes and sells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.\n\nSeveral third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chain CeX, online stores such as musicMagpie, and marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Back Market.\n\nMake sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:\n\nGrade A or excellent – virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.\n\nGrade B or good – in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.\n\nGrade C or fair – in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:\n\nBattery health – the battery in the Apple Watch is designed to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check the battery health under battery via the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?\n\nCharging cable – the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck, which costs £29 on its own, to charge. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.\n\nButtons – check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.\n\nSensors – the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?\n\nSpeakers – check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.\n\nWifi – the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.\n\nWater resistance – the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50-metre water resistance?\n\nWarranty – what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?\n\nAny Apple Watch Series 7 or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches – tested\n\n The best fitness tech and gadgets, according to experts\n\nSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

    "fullText": "Despite internet blackout, a small number of Iranians are risking their lives to share messages as protests continue\n\nFor most of Iran, the internet was shut off on Thursday afternoon – the most severe blackout the country has seen in years of internet shutdowns, coming after days of escalating anti-government protests.\n\nFor a very small sliver of the country, it is still possible to get photos and videos to the outside world, and even to make calls. The Telegram channel Vahid Online on Monday posted photos of dead bodies lying next to a street in Kahrizak, on the southern outskirts of Tehran; on Sunday, it shared a video of Iranians chanting “death to Khamenei” at a funeral.\n\nSome of these videos and messages are transmitted through an ecosystem of online tools designed to bypass censorship – among them Telegram proxies, a decentralised messaging service called Delta Chat, and a browser called Ceno, said Amir Rashidi, an Iranian digital rights expert.\n\nThere are about 50,000 Starlink terminals now in Iran, said Rashidi; other reports put this number at up to 100,000. The users of the service – which is part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX – are a tiny fraction of Iran’s overall population of more than 90 million people.\n\nWhile multiple people – even a whole apartment block – might be able to connect to the internet via a single Starlink terminal, the number of total users in the entire country is at most in the hundreds of thousands, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a network observability and intelligence platform.\n\nThey hold Iran’s last tenuous link to the outside world. Very little information, at least electronically, appears to be leaving the country, except for minimal traffic from businesses and individuals whitelisted by the regime.\n\nAcross Iran, authorities are hunting for Starlink terminals – jamming whole neighbourhoods using tools developed for electronic warfare, and flying drones over rooftops to search for telltale satellite dishes, say sources. Under a law passed in 2025, possessing a Starlink terminal in Iran can be interpreted as espionage for Israel and is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\n“They have basically criminalised Starlink to the extent that they’re saying in the law [that] if you use Starlink it’s the equivalent of conducting espionage operations for Israel and the American CIA,” said Rashidi.\n\nIt is unclear how many terminals are still operating, and how many have been confiscated, he added.\n\nThe tools Iran appears to be using to jam the terminals are military-grade, similar to those used to jam drones on the frontlines of Ukraine, said Rashidi. They are expensive and energy-intensive, capable of knocking out a certain radio frequency within a given area, but can only be used locally and cannot blanket the country.\n\n“It’s not cheap. It’s something you’d find in a military arsenal, and there’s only a few types of suppliers,” said Madory.\n\nFor now, the few who have smuggled Starlink terminals can connect online, although in neighbourhoods with heavy jamming it is nearly impossible to do more than send messages. The tech-savvy among them are using VPNs to disguise their presence; others are simply hauling their terminals from place to place to avoid detection.\n\nWhile Starlink users can communicate for now, Iran could choose – though it would be difficult – to track them down.\n\n“Depending on how much effort the Iranian government wanted to put into it, they could trace the signals that use the particular frequency those terminals have to use,” said Madory. “You’re kind of announcing yourself.”\n\nFor those without a terminal, an announcement on a state-linked Telegram channel has given a preview to the potential future of the internet in Iran. The IRIB news agency yesterday published a list of all internet sites that would now be available in Iran.\n\nThese included domestic search engines, domestic maps and navigation services, domestic messaging apps, and even a domestic streaming service – an Iranian version of Netflix, said Rashidi, with only government-approved videos.\n\nAll of these sites are part of Iran’s effort to create a national internet, said Rashidi: a skeleton version of the web that is significantly more restricted than even China’s, managed by the government and virtually unconnected to the outside world. That effort has been under way since the Rouhani administration, and now appears to be working, he said.\n\nWhat this could mean, said Madory and Rashidi, is that Iran’s internet as it was may not come back.\n\n“There are rumours,” said Rashidi. “Some people are saying that if things go back normal, there won’t be the internet. There will be only the national internet.”\n\n“They’re gearing up for the long run, for this to be the way things are for an extended period of time,” said Madory.",

As of 2026, at least one data center under the project is already underway in Texas.\n\nSuch buildouts are energy-intensive. OpenAI's data center plans will cost $400 billion and require seven gigawatts of power, Business Insider previously wrote, more than that of the entire New York City.\n\nSome tech companies are also moving their planned facilities off the grid entirely for easier permitting and less community resistance.

    "description": "\"We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening, and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad.\"",
    "fullText": "Pioneering computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” said artificial intelligence will spark a surge in unemployment and profits.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times last year, the former Google scientist cleared the air about why he left the tech giant, raised alarms on potential threats from AI, and revealed how he uses the technology. But he also predicted who the winners and losers will be.\n\n“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said in September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”\n\nThat echoed comments he gave to Fortune in August 2025, when he said AI companies are more concerned with short-term profits than the long-term consequences of the technology.\n\nLayoffs haven’t spiked, but evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level where recent college graduates start their careers.\n\nA survey from the New York Fed at the time found that companies using AI were much more likely to retrain their employees than fire them, though layoffs are expected to rise in the coming months.\n\nHinton said earlier healthcare is the one industry that will be safe from the potential jobs armageddon.\n\n“If you could make doctors five times as efficient, we could all have five times as much health care for the same price,” he explained on the Diary of a CEO YouTube series in June 2025. “There’s almost no limit to how much health care people can absorb—[patients] always want more health care if there’s no cost to it.”\n\nStill, Hinton believes jobs that perform mundane tasks will be taken over by AI, while sparing some jobs that require a high level of skill.\n\nIn his interview with the FT, he also dismissed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s idea to pay a universal basic income as AI disrupts the economy and reduces demand for workers, saying it “won’t deal with human dignity” and the value people derive from having jobs.\n\nHinton has long warned about the dangers of AI without guardrails, estimating a 10% to 20% chance of the technology wiping out humans after the development of superintelligence.\n\nIn his view, the dangers of AI fall into two categories: the risk the technology itself poses to the future of humanity, and the consequences of AI being manipulated by people with bad intent.",

    "title": "Google’s Sergey Brin admits he’s hiring ‘tons’ of workers without degrees: ‘They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner’",
    "description": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin studied graduate computer science at Stanford—but admits Gen Z no longer needs a degree to land a high-paying job at the tech giant.",
    "fullText": "Whether it’s Nike’s Phil Knight, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, or Google’s Sergey Brin, many of the world’s most influential business founders can trace part of their success back to Stanford University. Nestled in the foothills of Silicon Valley, the school has long functioned as a launchpad for tech’s elite.\n\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. As tech reshapes entry-level work and companies rethink traditional hiring pipelines, the payoff of a four-year degree—especially from elite institutions—is increasingly up for debate.\n\nStill, Brin doesn’t regret his own academic path. Speaking to Stanford engineering students last month, he said his decision to study computer science was not driven by a fixation on credentials.\n\n“I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he said. “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”\n\nEven in an era when AI can write code, Brin cautioned students against chasing—or abandoning—fields of study based solely on automation fears.\n\n“I wouldn’t go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,” he said. “The AI is probably even better at comparative literature, just to be perfectly honest anyway.”\n\nBrin met Google cofounder Larry Page in 1994 during his second year of graduate studies at Stanford. Together they developed PageRank, an algorithm they later renamed Google and would become a company in 1998.\n\nGoogle’s hiring practices today reflect how dramatically the industry has shifted. The tech giant is now embracing workers without college degrees.\n\n“In as much as we’ve hired a lot of academic stars, we’ve hired tons of people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees,” Brin said. “They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.”\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, the share of job postings at Google requiring a degree dropped from 93% to 77%, according to analysis from the Burning Glass Institute. And Google isn’t alone: companies including Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco have reduced degree requirements in recent years, signaling a broader industry shift toward skills-based hiring.\n\nThat’s forcing a broader reckoning over what a degree actually signals and whether it’s still a reliable proxy for talent.\n\n“I don’t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you’re going to be a great worker or great person,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in 2024. For many roles, skills matter far more than credentials, he added: “If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn’t show up in their resume.”",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - Apple will use Google's Gemini models for its revamped Siri coming later this year under a multi-year deal that deepens the tech giants' alliance in the ​artificial intelligence era and bolsters Alphabet's position in the race against OpenAI.\n\nThe deal announced Monday marks a major ‌vote of confidence for Google. Its technology already drives much of Samsung's \"Galaxy AI,\" but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apple's installed base ‌of more than two billion active devices.\n\n\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" Google said, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAlphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed.\n\nThe iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its ⁠devices, allowing the company's Siri voice assistant ‌to tap into the chatbot's expertise to answer complicated questions.\n\nApple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters' request for ‍comment.\n\n\"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players ​in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure.\n\nMonday's tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAI's ‌partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

    "fullText": "The “more intelligent” version of Siri that Apple plans to release later this year will be backed by Google’s Gemini language models, the company announced today. CNBC reports that the deal is part of a “multi-year partnership” between Apple and Google that will allow Apple to use Google’s AI models in its own software.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” reads an Apple statement given to CNBC.\n\nToday’s announcement confirms Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting late last year that Apple and Google were nearing a deal. Apple didn’t disclose terms, but Gurman said that Apple would be paying Google “about $1 billion a year” for access to its AI models “following an extensive evaluation period.”\n\nBloomberg has also reported that the Gemini model would be run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, “ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s infrastructure,” and that Apple still hopes to improve its own in-house language models to the point that they can eventually be used instead of relying on third-party models.\n\nAlthough Apple’s iPhones and iOS compete with Google’s Android operating system and the many smartphones that use it, the companies still cooperate in plenty of other areas. Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (though that deal has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years).\n\nApple’s announcement is a blow to OpenAI and the many versions of its ChatGPT model, which Apple has used elsewhere in iOS and macOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple also tested OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude models before deciding to go with Gemini. ChatGPT came out ahead of Gemini in tests that Ars ran using earlier versions of the models, but Google’s models have apparently improved enough (and amassed enough users) to worry OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” last month and pushed back several planned ChatGPT features so that the company could better respond to Google’s Gemini 3 release.\n\nApple originally promised the improved, AI-powered Siri for 2024’s iOS 18 release, but ultimately delayed the feature because it didn’t work reliably enough. The new version of Siri should arrive in an update to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe later this year.",

    "description": "Michael Burry, the investor from \"The Big Short,\" said return on invested capital is the \"measure to beat all measures\" when looking at AI companies.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short,\" says the era of Big Tech turning relatively small investments into huge profits is ending.\n\nIn a recent Substack exchange with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Burry said the most important metric AI industry investors should be watching isn't revenue growth, hiring, or even market size, but return on invested capital, or ROIC.\n\nROIC is a measure of how efficiently a company turns the money it puts into its business into profit.\n\n\"The measure to beat all measures is return on invested capital (ROIC), and ROIC was very high at these software companies. Now that they are becoming capital-intensive hardware companies, ROIC is sure to fall, and this will pressure shares in the long run,\" Burry wrote.\n\nAI, Burry said, is pushing companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta away from their historically asset-light software models and toward a far more capital-intensive future defined by data centers, chips, and energy.\n\nEven if AI expands Big Tech's addressable market, he said, falling ROIC could pressure stock prices for years to come.\n\nBurry rose to fame after his bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled in \"The Big Short.\" Outside the occasional cryptic social media post, Burry, for a long time, spoke publicly only rarely.\n\nThat changed late last year when he closed his hedge fund to outside cash and began writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nPerhaps most notably, he has recently compared the AI boom to the late-1990s dot-com bubble, calling OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time.\" Netscape's IPO marked the beginning of dot-com hype in 1995. Five years later, the bubble burst.\n\nBurry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, has made large bets against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, two darlings of the AI era, according to a regulatory filing released in September last year.\n\nLeading AI companies, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, are spending big to build out the infrastructure they need to support their energy- and data-intensive chatbots and other AI applications. Debt and equity investors have lined up to back these projects.\n\nSo far, however, those companies have not shown significant profit returns on their AI products, leading investors like Burry to sound the alarm that AI is a bubble on the verge of bursting.\n\nAgreed. And still, return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off. Will it be the Panic of 2026? 2027? Does not have to be. https://t.co/VBWjh26vnc\n\n\"At some point, this spending on the AI buildout has to have a return on investment higher than the cost of that investment, or there is just no economic value added,\" Burry wrote in the Substack post.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Louise Allen, the chief product officer at Planview, who's in her 60s and is based in Austin. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the chief product officer at Planview, an AI-driven portfolio management platform. Planview helps people organize and manage their workloads by providing teams with visibility into tasks in progress, who's responsible, and how everything connects.\n\nI've been the CPO since June 2021. I spent 13 years as the company's senior vice president of product management and solutions marketing.\n\nBefore entering the tech industry, I was a professional tennis player for 11 years.\n\nI was a decorated athlete and fortunate to have played in all four Grand Slam tournaments, finishing third at Wimbledon in 1983. I'd ranked 60th in the world and trained alongside some of the fiercest competitors the sport has ever seen. I earned six figures in prize money throughout my career.\n\nI'd also faced significant obstacles — most notably, back-to-back ACL injuries, which put me on medical rest for the better part of two years.\n\nAfter just over a decade of intense training, global travel, and high-stakes competition, I knew my time on the circuit had to end. I couldn't tell you why, exactly; I just felt called to try something new.\n\nTech offered me the opportunity to challenge myself and use the skills I'd honed on the court: Vision, planning, adaptation, and relentless commitment to improvement. I was excited by the pace of innovation, the potential to create something new, and the opportunity to solve real problems.\n\nWhen I hung up my racket, I returned to school and earned my MBA at 34. My first role in tech was secured thanks to a reference from Billie Jean King, which helped me land a product marketing internship at a small startup.\n\nThe hardest part of starting a corporate job was my schedule not being my own — working hard and learning were all pretty natural to me, but starting at the bottom of the totem pole and having a lot of my time directed by others was a big adjustment.\n\nI was relatively late to making a career change into tech by most professional standards, but I had come to tennis relatively late, too, and that never stopped me.\n\nIt was a much smaller company back then, with just one product line. Product management was just getting started, and I was able to get in on the ground floor of that.\n\nAs the company grew and evolved, so did my role. I moved from tactical roles to more strategic leadership.\n\nToday, Planview is a very different company with broader offerings and a transformed value proposition. I'm in more C-level conversations in a week than I used to have in a year.\n\nI see hyping up teams as a key part of the role; it's what gets everyone excited about and aligned with the overall vision. People need to walk away being fired up about what we do, and my days are often filled with high-level conversations across teams, customers, and other C-suite leaders.\n\nA typical day includes strategy meetings, product road map reviews, and customer-facing discussions, both in-person and virtual. All of these conversations are focused on steering the ship in the right direction.\n\nI've also learned to become more selfish with my time as I've risen in the company. Putting in 12-hour days just isn't what I want to be doing at this point in my career, and I don't want my teams to feel like they need to, either.\n\nMaintaining the flexibility of a hybrid schedule is a priority for us at Planview, which we prioritize across our teams. I try to lead by example, modeling the work-life balance that's so critical to preventing burnout and maintaining productivity and creativity.\n\nAs for older professionals, I'd like to emphasize that businesses do — really — see a lot of value in curating intergenerational teams. With age comes historical knowledge and insight into why certain processes are structured as they are; with youth, fresh eyes, ideas, and insights.\n\nTake it one step at a time, and through the route that feels right to you. That might mean taking an internship or contract role, joining a professional network in your field of interest, or finding a mentor who can vouch for you, as Billie Jean King did for me.\n\nIt's also critical to focus on your skills rather than your work history. All of your experiences, no matter how unrelated they may seem, can add value. Many of the more technical or field-specific details can be taught, but core capabilities such as relationship-building, time management, presentation and communication skills, and teamwork are more challenging to learn.\n\nTennis taught me risk management, strategic planning, and resilience, all of which I use every day in my work. Those soft skills are often what set you apart, especially in leadership.",

Krishnan told Reuters that \"any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind\", adding it was \"premature to read more into it\". A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.\n\nONGOING TUG OF WAR OVER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nApple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian ⁠industry group that represents the firms, did not respond ‌to requests for comment.\n\nIndian government requirements have irked technology firms before. Last month it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security ‍cameras over fears of Chinese spying.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung - whose phones use Google's Android operating system - hold 19% and 15%, respectively, of India's market share and Apple 5%, Counterpoint Research estimates.\n\nAmong the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code - the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly ​tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.\n\nThe Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to ‌block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to \"avoid malicious usage\".\n\n\"Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,\" said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.\n\nThe security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.\n\nCOMPANIES SAY SOURCE CODE REVIEW, ANALYSIS 'NOT POSSIBLE'\n\nSmartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China's request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and U.S. law enforcement has also tried and failed to ⁠get it.\n\nIndia's proposals for \"vulnerability analysis\" and \"source code review\" would require smartphone makers to perform a \"complete ​security assessment\", after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and ​analysis.\n\n\"This is not possible ... due to secrecy and privacy,\" MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. \"Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.\"\n\nMAIT asked the ministry last ‍week to drop the proposal, a source ⁠with direct knowledge said.\n\nThe Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.\n\nMAIT's ⁠document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone's battery and seeking government approval for software updates is \"impractical\" as they need to be issued promptly.\n\nIndia also wants the phone's logs - digital records ‌of its system activity - to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.\n\n\"There is not enough room on device to store ‌1-year log events,\" MAIT said in the document.",

    "description": "A tech CEO put together a dream board of directors with AI representing famous leaders. Here's how he uses it.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Matt Blumberg, a four-time technology CEO who now leads Markup AI, maker of an AI platform designed to help brands safely scale AI-generated content. He is based in New York City. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSince I run an AI company, I try to build AI agents and use AI as much as I can. In October, I got an idea to build what I call a fantasy board of directors from another CEO, and with his permission, I made a version of my own to use as a personal thought partner.\n\nWe have an actual human board, and it's fantastic. I get really good advice from them. But I wanted to use AI to create a fantasy board because mine is limited by the five people who are on it and the experiences that they have in life.\n\nSo the first thing my executive team and I did was create a fantasy draft. It's a bit of a play on fantasy football and fantasy basketball. But instead of it being a competitive thing, where each of us would draft our own teams, we drafted just one together.\n\nWe started by making a spreadsheet of essentially famous people, largely but not entirely, from the business world. We divided them into categories, including iconic business leaders, tech CEOs, VCs, authors, and thought leaders. We also had a category for different voices, such as Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.\n\nNext, we had something like a draft where we picked a couple of people from each category that we wanted on the board. We settled on about 15 names, including Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThere are also two people on it that I know. One is me. The other is Fred Wilson, a VC I've worked with for the past 25 years at other companies.\n\nFrom here, we had AI build 5,000-word profiles for each person, and we gave the AI a certain template to follow. We wanted the fantasy board members to be able to react to things as real board members would, with actual things they've said about how companies and boards perform.\n\nNext, we built the agent. We loaded all these profiles in and then wrote a really long instruction set about what we were trying to accomplish and what our company does. We also loaded materials from past board meetings, our quarterly business review decks, and other things that real board members would have at their disposal or in their heads.\n\nAll of this took maybe an hour or two.\n\nSo now the fantasy board exists, and I use it as a thought partner. For example, I will provide a draft of a board book before sending it to my actual board, and I'll say: These are materials for an upcoming meeting. What do you think of them? Are there topics you would have expected me to cover that I didn't? What questions am I likely to get back from our board? In return, I'll get really useful commentary.\n\nOne thing we put in the instruction set is that when I ask the board for its opinion, very generically, I want it to tell me the consensus opinion and notable outlying dissent with quotes of things that the fantasy board members have actually said.\n\nI'll also ask it for help with internal projects. I'll say things like: Hey, I'm doing a presentation for our kickoff meeting next week. What do you think are the top three themes I should hit?\n\nRecently, I asked my fantasy board to give me a performance review for 2025. It nailed it. The board called out the things that I would have said are my strengths and things that I would have said are problems. I sent the review to my executive team just as an FYI, and they all came back to me and said it was pretty impressive.\n\nI don't use the fantasy board every day, but I'm probably using it at least every other week for something. There are two big limitations. \n\nOne is that anything agentic is only as good as its inputs. My fantasy board only knows what I've told it about my business, or what's publicly available. It doesn't actually know what happens every day in the company. Even though I'm pretty good about feeding it information, it just doesn't have all the context.\n\nThe other limitation is that they're not real people. When you have a real board of directors, you have a real thought partner as a strategic advisor. If you have a board meeting, people are in a room together. They have body language. They have facial expressions. You can tell when they lean in, when they lean back. You can tell when they roll their eyes because they don't believe something you said. You can call them out on that.\n\nWith any AI agents, you need to be really careful not to believe the bullshit. They're predictive, and they're good, but not perfect. They're not human, and they miss a lot of cues.\n\nI told my real board about my fantasy board at our last meeting, which was in November, right after we built it. I explained what it was and how I've been using it. They thought it was great. A couple of them asked me afterward how I built it. They asked for a road map and said that they'd like to do something like it.\n\nThey viewed the fantasy board the same way I do, which is that it's a nice add-on, a sort of augmentation of thought partnership, but that it's never going to be a substitute for a real board.",

    "fullText": "Helen Mirren, 80, isn't buying into the fantasy of eternal youth.\n\nIn an interview with Elle published on Sunday, Mirren spoke about the tech industry's obsession with living forever and why trying to hack aging misses the point.\n\n\"To me, the word longevity is being active, proactive, and productive over a long period of one's life,\" Mirren told Elle. \"Living has to do with enjoying the physical elements of life; the beauty of nature; the excitement of professional success, if you're lucky enough to have it; and family and kids.\"\n\nTo her, longevity means \"contributing in as many diverse ways as possible, for as long as possible,\" she said.\n\nAt the end of the day, trying to beat aging becomes a distraction from living fully. Accepting life's limits, Mirren said, is simply part of growing up.\n\n\"Life is finite. There is no fighting that — as much as people like to put themselves into ice, hoping that they might wake up in 50 years. It's a dream and a fantasy. It's very strange to me. I don't call it growing old. I call it growing up. You constantly grow up through life. But the tech bros who cannot face the idea that they will get old and die just can't deal with it. I think it's so funny. They just haven't grown up yet,\" she said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Mirren has spoken about her views on aging. In October, she told Allure that she loves \"everything\" about growing older.\n\n\"Fuck it, I'm alive and I'm working and I can drink a glass of wine and I can wear makeup and I can listen to music and I can watch a beautiful sunset and I can go to the theater and I can watch a movie and I can binge Netflix and I can live life. It's a beautiful thing,\" she said.\n\nTo stay healthy, Mirren has long championed a 12-minute military workout developed in the 1950s by the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\nShe's also said that it's never too late to start moving, particularly for people in their 50s and 60s.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be joining a gym. It can be small changes like taking a short walk or practicing yoga, which I still enjoy,\" Mirren said.",

    "fullText": "A retired lawyer thought he was calling Microsoft for tech support. But the phone number he found on Google didn’t connect him with Microsoft. Instead, the person who picked up the phone, \"Alex,\" and said he could help him fix his tablet, was actually a fraudster.\n\nDavid Welles, 87, followed Alex’s instructions and downloaded remote access software onto his smartphone and laptop, according to The New York Times (1).\n\n“A big mistake,” Welles told the publication in a story published Dec. 12. “All of a sudden, on the laptop, I could see it going blank, and little lights flashing around.”\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nCiting text messages and other records, The Times reports Welles spent almost five hours on the phone with Alex while trying to fix his problems. Meanwhile, Alex was rooting around in his computer for usernames and passwords — managing to access Welles’ checking account at Citibank and make a wire transfer of $85,000.\n\nHere’s how tech support scams work — and why consumers searching for support numbers online are vulnerable.\n\nLosses from internet crime exceeded $16 billion in 2024 — a 33% increase in losses from 2023 — according to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Those over the age of 60 were hit hardest, losing $4.8 billion while submitting the most complaints.\n\nFake tech-support scams are on the rise, exploiting the fact that many major tech companies don’t offer easily accessible phone support. In 2024, about 36,000 complaints were filed to the IC3 about tech support scams. Of those, 16,777 were filed by those 60 or older.\n\nIn terms of dollars, those complaints led to a staggering $1,464,755,976 in losses (of that, $982,440,006 were losses for those 60 and older).\n\nBut the number of incidents and amount lost could be much higher due to unreported fraud.",

    "description": "It joins over 400 other centers in Texas and signals the growth of the tech scene in Medina County.",
    "fullText": "Yet another data center will soon emerge near the Far Westside of San Antonio, according to a recent Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) filing. It's set to further the Lone Star State's reputation as a tech cluster.\n\nThe quaint town of Castroville, with a population of just over 3,000, will soon house a $400 million development owned by Microsoft. Online records show that the project, named SAT 82, will take up roughly 195,000 square feet in Medina County.\n\nAlthough it's only a one-story building, it will take nearly two years to build, according to the TDLR. Construction at the spot, 3580 FM 471 North, will begin on Thursday, August 13, 2026. A visit to the property revealed that equipment and a welcome poster were already on site. An open field, a two-lane road, and residential properties sit nearby.\n\nIn time, the structure will likely take on the look of a windowless warehouse. It may be hard for residents to get a clear glimpse of the center, as each contains extensive fencing around its perimeters for safety and security purposes, Microsoft's website states.\n\nSAT 82 joins six others in Medina County, according to the TDLR: SAT 80, SAT 81, SAT 89/90, SAT 93, SAT 94, and another with the title SAT 82, but with a different address.\n\nThe centers provide the infrastructure needed to open a phone application, join a virtual Zoom meeting, play an online game, and more. According to the company's website, they also allow the company's Azure cloud platform, AI, and collaboration tools to continue operating as normal.\n\nEarlier this fall, community members in a private Redbird Ranch neighborhood Facebook group voiced concerns over Microsoft's presence in the area. A few users worried the company's projects would worsen traffic. Others highlighted the massive amount of water that data centers use.\n\nIn a 2024 sustainability report, Microsoft said that its water consumption in 2023 - which includes but is not limited to data centers - increased by 1.7 billion gallons from the previous year, coming in at 2.1 billion gallons. The company attributed the increase to its business growth.\n\n\"Improvements as part of our Redmond campus modernization project are estimated to yield over 50% reduction in water use for new facilities,\" it continued in the report.\n\nConstruction on the property is expected to wrap up by 2028, according to the TDLR.\n\nThis article originally published at Microsoft bets $400M on tiny Texas town with new massive data center.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're discussing the proposed tax on billionaires that's dividing the tech elite.",
    "fullText": "California's billionaires are at a crossroads.\n\nOne of the biggest business stories kicking off the year is the proposed wealth tax in California. The state's rich and powerful, worth more than $1 billion, would face a one-time 5% tax on their assets if the plan gets approved.\n\nThe proposal, which aims to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit, has prompted plenty of grumbling among the California elite.\n\nAs Business Insider first reported, some have already taken action, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nPage converted his secretive family office out of California in late December and incorporated it in Delaware, according to my colleague Hugh Langley's exclusive reporting. Page also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures. He lists principal office addresses outside of California for those entities.\n\nSeparately, an entity tied to both Brin and Page moved out of California at the end of 2025.\n\nThe timing of these moves is crucial. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. Hence, the rush to move assets before the end of the year.\n\nBrin and Page are two of the richest people on the planet, with a combined net worth north of half a trillion dollars, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a very different tone. He said he's \"perfectly fine\" with the tax and gave no indication he plans to leave Silicon Valley, even if it costs him.\n\nOthers are more pessimistic. LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman called the proposal \"horrendous\" for innovation, warning that poorly designed wealth taxes don't raise reliable revenue — they push money and talent elsewhere.\n\nAlex Spiro, the celebrity lawyer who represents several billionaires, sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom last month warning that the tax would drive capital and innovation out of California.\n\nEarlier this month, White House AI Czar David Sacks predicted Austin would overtake San Francisco as the American tech hub. His social media post ricocheted throughout tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from traditionalists.\n\nWhere do you stand on the proposed billionaire's tax in California?

    "fullText": "Swedish producer is trying to to accelerate the process of extracting the elements vital for hi-tech products\n\nIt is deep winter with temperatures dropping to -20C. The sun never rises above the horizon, instead bathing Sweden’s most northerly town of Kiruna in a blue crepuscular light, or “civil twilight” as it is known, for two or three hours a day stretching visibility a few metres, notwithstanding heavy snow.\n\nBut 900 metres below the arctic conditions, a team of 20 gather every day, forgoing the brief glimpse of natural light and spearheading the EU’s race to mine its own rare earths. Despite identification of several deposits around the continent, and some rare earth refineries including Solvay in France, there are no operational rare earth mines in Europe.\n\nAcross the globe, the scramble for rare earths has become the source of huge geopolitical tension, with China accused last year by the EU of “weaponising” its near monopoly on raw materials and end products, essential for everything from smartphones, to electric cars, to fridges, music speakers and military jets.\n\nChina’s willingness to slap export bans on rare earths led to the vicious trade war with Donald Trump last year and is partly driving his current bid to take over Greenland, which is rich in these materials, now among the most precious in the world.\n\nEvery day the team at LKAB mine in Kiruna drive 4km (2.5 miles) down an impressive network of tunnels to get closer to what is known as the Per Geijer deposit of magnetite-hematite-phosphate named after the Swedish geologist who identified it more than 100 years ago.\n\nThe team are now operating at two levels – 900m and 1.3km deep underground as they try to connect the existing vast iron ore mine in Kiruna with Per Geijer about 2km away.\n\nUsing remote technology they drill a fan of 84 holes in the rock face; pump them with explosives which are then blasted between 1.15am and 1.45am every night, sometimes disturbing the inhabitants overground, and causing subsidence that has led to the state-owned compamy moving parts of the town and its church.\n\nLess than four hours later the team are back.\n\n“At 5am in the morning, when we have ventilated out the blasting fumes, we start the mucking out,” says 37-year-old Kiruna native Jim Lidström, who leads the tunnelling to what is one of Europe’s largest deposits of rare earths.\n\nOnce cleared, a separate team of men and women, sitting in a modern console centre 1.3k below ground, “scale” the rock, remotely controlling machines that break the detritus into transportable chunks for onward transport to a driverless train.\n\nLidström’s team then set about making the tunnel stable and usable, drilling bolts into the freshly made walls and then spraying it with a layer of concrete or “shotcrete” before the whole process starts all over again.\n\n“We do about five metres a day,” Lidström says.\n\nThe hunt for rare earths is slow.\n\nThe 17 rare earth elements – all found in Kiruna – include neodymium and praseodymium, critical materials for the powerful permanent magnets needed for everything from electric cars to household appliances and military jets.\n\nAlthough geological surveys show large ore bodies across the west – including the Fen complex in Norway, thought to be Europe’s largest deposit – from mine to refined end production could take 10 to 15 years, say experts.\n\n“I think people often miss the point. They say ‘why don’t we just produce rare earths in Europe?’. But you have to have the entire supply chain to do that,” says Nigel Steward, a professor at Imperial College London, a materials scientist and a former executive in the US mining industry.\n\nThe experience in Kiruna shows just how challenging it is to reduce the EU’s dependency on China, which is now the core supplier of rare earth magnets and willing to choke supplies, as it did last year, if politically desirable.\n\nState-owned LKAB is now trying to accelerate the process of mining, extraction, and separation of the crumbs from the ore, to help the EU de-risk as quickly as possible.\n\nJan Moström, the chief executive of LKAB, explains that it could take “years and years” if the company tried to expose the entire length of the Per Geijer deposit for mining purposes.\n\n“But that is not what we are going to do. What we are going to do is to open up incrementally,” he says.\n\nHe refuses to give a timeline because of its sensitivity, instead explaining the complex task ahead in the vast network of tunnels circling the deposit.\n\n“The main focus for us now in the Kiruna system is to find a mine design to deal with the mining of the present reserves down to the main level, at 1,365 metres , then to work out how we go beneath that and develop that resource into reserves, and also how to connect the Per Geijer deposit into the [existing iron ore mining] system. We will start to develop it incrementally, and that is the huge difference [from previous approaches],” he says.\n\nFor Moström, who has spent his career in mines, the last 11 with LKAB, the stranglehold Beijing has built in rare earths was no accident, and something he has been pressing home in Brussels repeatedly.\n\nAs the US and Europe started to regulate against toxic waste in the 1980s, China which had none of the environmental concerns, ploughed on charring the landscape as it went building a chokehold on raw materials now critical for modern life.\n\n“I’ve been talking in Brussels the past two or three years about the huge disadvantages we created in the 1970s and the 1980s when we closed the mining industry and started importing metals from South America, Africa, Australia,” he says.\n\nAsked why it has taken the EU so long to wake up to the dangers of dependency on China’s rare earth supply, he is blunt: “Politicians will never be more courageous than the voters.”\n\n“Nobody saw any future in mining, then the super-cycle started and China started to consume enormous volumes of metals,” he says referring to the boom at the turn of the century when China drove a huge commodities boom on the back of urbanisation.\n\n“I have the perception that the European Commission, the commissioners, really understand the importance of domestic mining and some sort of self-sufficiency,” Moström says.\n\nAs part of the acceleration efforts, LKAB has put €80m (£69m) into a new “demonstration” plant in nearby Luleå to test the process of separation before mining even begins. It has also taken a stake in the Norwegian company REEtec to develop an environmentally friendly way of refining the extract.\n\nContrary to what the name suggests, rare earths – a group of 17 soft metals with unique properties such as strong magnetismor high temperature resistance – are not rare.\n\nSpeckled like crumbs in the earth’s crust, the tag “rare” stuck because of the difficulty accessing them, mining them, and separating them from the ore in which they are found, a process that can take a decade.\n\nLKAB has already been visited by a line of Brussels dignitaries, including industry commissioner Stéphane Séjourné in September, because is represents the EU’s best current hope of weaning itself of a dependency on Chinese supplies that has left Europe vulnerable to increasing geopolitical tensions.\n\nDespite the rhetoric in Brussels, London and Washington over the need to wean industries off China, Beijing will hold the rare earth cards for years to come.\n\n“Right now China controls 85% of the final processing of light rare earths and it control 100% of the heavy rare earths,” says Darren Wilson, the chief executive of LKAB’s industrial minerals division.\n\nAccording to senior European Commission officials in December the EU uses 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets, a year of which 17,000 to 18,000 come from China, creating an unbalanced and high-risk trade relationship.\n\nLast April, in retaliation against Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, China imposed global export restrictions on rare earths, hitting Europe’s car industry. It threatened to impose more restrictions in October, until a 12-month truce was agreed with Trump at in Korea the same month.\n\nAs George Riddell, a senior adviser at Flint Global and a trade expert, says: “China has not just got the capacity to weaponise its trade but shown it has the willingness to do so.”\n\nAll hopes rest on LKAB now being the first to reduce the EU’s reliance on China, with a pre-existing highly developed mining operation employing about 2,000 workers directly and double that indirectly.\n\nMagnetic properties of some metals were discovered by the Greeks 4,000 years ago.\n\nPermanent magnets, found in speakers, headphones, toys, cars and military equipment are typically manufactured from a neodymium-iron-boron alloy.\n\nThe process begins by melting suitable raw materials, placing them into a mould that is then chilled, resulting in a powder. All the particles have then to align in the right direction to create a powerful magnetic force. The powder is sintered in a furnace, bonding the particles together into a mass that is then cut for final use.\n\nPermanent magnets were developed in the research department of the General Motors Company in the US and by the Japanese materials scientist Masato Sagawa in the 1980s.\n\nBut making these powerful magnets generates radioactive byproducts that can contaminate water and soil.\n\nAs the west introduced environmental regulations in the 1980s, US rare earth suppliers “started exporting their product to China because they were willing to process it,” says Imperial College London’s Steward.\n\nGM is now working with Mountain Pass, the only operational rare earth mine in the US, which is thought to be about two years away from producing products for the American market.\n\n“There is no reason why we can’t remake magnets. They were our inventions, in the west. That is the crazy thing,” Steward says.",

Growth has been strong in the US and mainland Europe and this month On will open its fourth London store, in Kensington.\n\n“We’re an innovation brand at heart,” says its co-founder, David Allemann, “because we are really going for the long run.”\n\nHe’s speaking from On’s Zurich head office, which has the vibe of a tech firm or luxe gym with light-filled spaces and quirky design features from the spiral staircase and workout room to a hanging fossilised tree.\n\nAllemann says the company’s inspirations are disruptors such as Apple and Dyson. These two brands were on the “mood board” when On was set up as they combine “unique design” with “innovation in terms of user-experience or technology”.\n\nAllemann, a former McKinsey consultant, ditched his job in 2010 as marketing boss of the furniture brand Vitra to start On with a former McKinsey colleague, Caspar Coppetti, and the Swiss Ironman world champion and triathlete Olivier Bernhard.\n\nBernhard’s idea was for a shoe that would protect his body from the impact of long-distance running but also promote speed. The original prototype, developed by Bernhard, an inventive individual as well as a committed sportsman, started out with sections of hose-pipe glued to the bottom of an old pair of trainers.\n\nThe three friends, all keen runners, tried out early versions together and put about £600,000 of their life savings into launching the company. They ordered 1,200 pairs of shoes, which they sold at running meets before convincing some specialist retailers to place orders.\n\nIn 2021, the trio floated the brand on the New York Stock Exchange at a value of $8bn (£5.95bn) , raising almost $750m for the business and netting them about $120m in cash while keeping a large stake in the business. This year they expect to sell 30m pairs. The brand is now worth $16bn.\n\nAfter their innovative design took off, On developed the LightSpray flying fibre technology after a team member met a young student, Johannes Voelchert, at a design fair in 2019. The company decided to fund him for a year to develop his vision, which was inspired by a glue gun used to make Halloween spider-web decorations.\n\n“We said: hey, he’s crazy, but we like that because Olivier was crazy as well,” says Allemann.\n\nVoelchert is now part of a team of hundreds of research and technology experts, from more than 90 countries and numerous industry backgrounds, helping to develop new ideas for On in Zurich with a particular eye on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\n“We call that the explorer spirit,” says Allemann.\n\nThe idea is to foster innovation and creativity so that, even as a bigger company employing 4,000 people around the world, the whole business, from designers to manufacturers, can take risks on ideas without necessarily knowing the final outcome. “We’re still able to set sail without exactly knowing where we’re arriving without calling home the next day,” Allemann says.\n\nAllemann adds that On is now seeing the benefit of “many little sprouts that now are growing up”, from its move into different sports – such as outdoor training and tennis – to its development of apparel and the opening of retail stores.\n\nThe small brand may control just 1% of the $450bn global sportswear market, according to GlobalData, but it is expanding rapidly.\n\nOn plays in the premium market with its shoes starting from about £120, excluding seasonal promotions, up to £495. That compares with Nike, which runs from £60 to £290, and Adidas, from £40 to £450.\n\nDespite high-end purchases coming under pressure from cost of living increases, sales for the brand are on track to increase by just over a third to hit nearly 3bn Swiss Francs (£2.8bn) this year. On says it has grabbed as much as a fifth of the running shoe market in the UK and other European countries.\n\nIt faces some heavyweight competition. On is just one-tenth the size of Nike, which holds about 14% of the global sportswear market, according to industry analysts GlobalData, with Adidas on 9%. However, both have faced difficulties in recent years, creating space for new challenges including On, Hoka and revitalised old brands such as New Balance or Onitsuka Tiger, now owned by ASICS.\n\nThe company also faced a class action lawsuit last year in the US, where customers claimed its shoes make a “noisy and embarrassing squeak”. Its “CloudTec” trainers, designed with holes to feel like “running on clouds” – were criticised on social media over the noise. On said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.\n\nOn’s Cloudboom Strike LS laceless shoe, which is made by just nine robots in Zurich and costs £310, has already won the attention of running enthusiasts after the Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri won this year’s New York and last year’s Boston marathon. She also took a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in a pair.\n\nIn Zurich, the robots in their lab-like room are still outnumbered by humans, who monitor their work and complete the final process. Most of the brand’s footwear is made in traditional factories in Asia. But this year On is aiming to open its first robot-led factory to create a more accessible version of the shoe, the upper half of which is made from a single nearly one mile-long filament of thermoplastic polyurethane in just three minutes. Traditionally, a shoe takes several humans hours of work.\n\nThe factory’s location has not yet been decided, but will be close to one of its main retail markets, with the long-term aim of producing on every continent. That would be a dramatic change from today’s industry, which is largely based in Asia, particularly Vietnam and China.\n\nAllemann says local manufacturing is attractive as it has “a huge advantage from a sustainability point of view, because you don’t have to ship shoes around the world, but also from an agility to market point of view – you can produce much faster, according to what people want”.\n\nHe says LightSpray shoes have a 75% lower CO2 footprint than an ordinary sports shoe, which plays to On’s aim to create more sustainable and recyclable kit.\n\nRetail expansion is also a big part of the story. The latest London opening will make the UK capital its biggest retail centre, with plans for as many as seven in future. It is now part of a global portfolio of 60 outlets, with plans for up to 25 more a year despite the rise of online selling.\n\n“We feel there’s still a lot of potential in retail, if done right. City centres are still a very important place for society, and shopping and sports are an important ingredient to that.”\n\nWith those in their late teens, 20s and 30s keen on sport, particularly training and running, Allemann says the shops “are not just stores but also community hubs where running clubs start”.\n\nHe believes On will continue to expand because participating in sport brings people together in a way the online world cannot.\n\n“Running and sports, that’s such an important part of your life that we see consumers are willing to invest in great performance, innovation and better feel, but also in great design and what that tells us about them.”",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Below are key security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, prompting ​opposition from tech companies, according to four sources, as well as industry and government ‌documents seen by Reuters.\n\nManufacturers must test and provide proprietary source code for review by government-designated labs to ‌identify vulnerabilities in phone operating systems that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nIndustry group MAIT, which represents Apple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi, has told the government this is \"not possible\" due to corporate secrecy and global privacy policies.\n\nBACKGROUND PERMISSION RESTRICTIONS:\n\nApps cannot access cameras, microphones or location services in ⁠the background when phones are inactive. ‌Continuous status bar notifications are required when these permissions are active.\n\nManufacturers say this lacks any global precedent and there is no specific test method ‍prescribed.\n\nDevices must periodically display warnings prompting users to review all app permissions, with continuous notifications. Companies say notice should be limited to \"highly critical\" permissions.\n\nDevices must store security audit logs, including ​app installations and login attempts, for 12 months.\n\nMAIT argues consumer phones lack the storage capacity ‌for a year of data.\n\nPhones must periodically scan for malware and identify potentially harmful applications.\n\nManufacturers warn that constant on-device scanning significantly drains the battery and slows hardware performance.\n\nOPTION TO REMOVE PRE-INSTALLED APPS:\n\nAll pre-installed apps bundled with the phone operating system, except those essential for basic phone functions, must be deletable.\n\nCompanies argue many apps are critical system components that cannot be ⁠removed.\n\nINFORMING GOVERNMENT OF MAJOR UPDATES:\n\nPhone makers must notify a ​government organisation before releasing any major updates or security ​patches.\n\nManufacturers argue this is \"impractical\" because security fixes must be released quickly to protect users from active exploits, while government delays could leave users vulnerable.\n\nDevices ‍must detect if phones have ⁠been rooted or \"jailbroken\", where users bypass built-in security restrictions, and display continuous warning banners to recommend corrective measures.\n\nCompanies say there is no reliable mechanism to detect jailbreaking.\n\nPhones ⁠must permanently block installation of older software versions, even if officially signed by the manufacturer, to prevent security ‌downgrades.\n\nThere is no global standard related to this requirement, manufacturers say.",

    "fullText": "With the Sovereign Tech Fund, we invest globally in the open software components that underpin Germany's and Europe's competitiveness and ability to innovate. By targeting core digital infrastructure, our investments scale across many sectors and benefit a broad range of users. Improving the security, stability, and reusability of open software components directly enhances the productivity, competitive edge, and capacity for innovation of startups and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe open source ecosystem, while incredibly successful, is also increasingly fragile. Many more people are using the software than contributing to it. It is time to invest in digital commons, volunteer communities and the open source ecosystem to build the digital world we want to see. We are working to strengthen the self-determined use of digital technologies and systems by individuals, industry, and governments.\n\nTo prepare an application, we ask that you review and consider all information regarding the selection criteria and the subsequent process. Applications are accepted exclusively through our application platform.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot provide prior advice on whether a project generally falls under our objectives. If you would like to apply for support for a project, please first check thoroughly whether all the criteria listed below apply.\n\nSubmission through our application system: submissions must be completed through the online application portal. No supplemental materials should be sent via email or any other form of communication at this time.\n\nCompleteness: applications must be completed in German or English. The questions must be answered to a degree that allows us to assess and evaluate the applications.\n\nProposed activities: the activities listed in the application must be related to developing or maintaining open digital base technologies. Development is our primary focus, although security audits, conference attendance, and other community-based events can be included in the application should they be necessary.\n\nEstimated costs: The cost of the work described in the application must exceed €50,000 (current minimum).\n\nPublic financing: Projects are not eligible to receive financing or work commissions from the Sovereign Tech Fund if other public entities are already making or have made grants or investments for the same proposed activities.\n\nFOSS: all code and documentation to be supported must be licensed such that it may be freely reusable, changeable, and redistributable. OSI-approved or FSF Free/Libre licenses are acceptable for code. Creative-Commons-like licenses for documentation may not include non-commercial or “no derivative” clauses.\n\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund invests in open digital base technologies that are vital to the development of other software or enable digital networking. We invest in projects that benefit and strengthen the open source ecosystem. Examples include libraries for programming languages, package managers, open implementations of communication protocols, administration tools for developers, digital encryption technologies, and more. We do not finance the development of prototypes. Our currently funded projects show the range and type of technologies that characterize open digital base technologies.\n\nWe are currently not looking for user-facing applications, such as messaging apps or file storage services. If this changes, we will announce it here.\n\nThese are the criteria we use to review all projects that fulfill the basic requirements:\n\nA technology is prevalent when it is widely used for or within other technologies.\n\nA technology is relevant if it is significant for one or more important societal sectors, e.g., education, health care, energy sector, industry.\n\nA technology is vulnerable if important work – to keep the quality of the project or to enhance it – is not (sufficiently) funded by other actors or cannot be completed for other structural reasons.\n\nThere are benefits for society or critical sectors of society (e.g., education, health care, energy, industry) by funding the technology.\n\nWe evaluate the work that is planned in the proposed project. For example, we examine the feasibility and overall impact of the activities described in the proposal.\n\nThe applicants, their organization, or community demonstrate that they have the necessary knowledge, insight, and technological skills to do the proposed work. They are either a recognized part of the community around the technology, or they have the endorsement of that community or the maintainer.\n\nLastly, the evaluation is guided by our strategy and mission. That is, from start to finish, we look at how the project fits into the Sovereign Tech Agency’s mission and contributes to the goal of sustainably strengthening the open source ecosystem in the public interest.\n\nCreate an account to submit an application. Please note that you will only receive a submission confirmation from us if you agreed to receive emails or SMS from us when you registered. If you change this in the settings after your registration, it will only affect future messages from us, such as acceptances or rejections.\n\nDownload a preview of the application form (PDF)\n\nAfter you submit an application, your submission goes through a multistep review and selection process. First, we check if the submission meets the basic requirements listed above. Those that do, are reviewed by the Sovereign Tech Fund using the criteria. You will hear from us whether your application passes those two stages.\n\nUpon positive review, a member of the program team gets in touch with the person or persons who submitted the application to scope the proposal in more detail. During this scoping phase, we work with you to clarify open questions, refine the scope of work, and create a project description, based on the application and conversations between you and the program manager.\n\nThe Sovereign Tech Agency then consults with a pool of external experts and practitioners and includes their perspectives to arrive at the final selection.\n\nThe last step includes a legal compliance review, the creation of additional supporting documentation, and the creation of a contract.\n\nFor technical problems, contact [email protected]\n\nWhen you submit an application, we’ll confirm that we have received it. Then, you can expect to hear back from us within 10 weeks. We’ll inform you whether the proposal has passed the review, and whether we’re continuing with you to the scoping phase. For some projects, the response time will be shorter, depending on the overall amount of applications to be reviewed.\n\nThe overall time between submitting an application and a potential start date of the contract is approximately 6 months.",
