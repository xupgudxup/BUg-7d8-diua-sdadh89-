    "title": "A New AI Math Startup Just Cracked 4 Previously Unsolved Problems",
    "description": "Axiom says its AI found solutions to several long-standing math problems, a sign of the technology’s steadily advancing reasoning capabilities.",
    "fullText": "mathematicians Dawei Chen and Quentin Gendron were trying to untangle a difficult area of algebraic geometry involving differentials, elements of calculus used to measure distance along curved surfaces. While working on one theorem, they ran into an unexpected roadblock: Their argument depended on a strange formula from number theory, but they were unable to solve or justify it. In the end, Chen and Gendron wrote a paper presenting their idea as a conjecture, rather than a theorem.\n\nChen recently spent hours prompting ChatGPT in the hopes of getting the AI to come up with a solution to the still unsolved problem, but it wasn’t working. Then, during a reception at a math conference in Washington, DC, last month, Chen ran into Ken Ono, a well-known mathematician who had recently left his job at the University of Virginia to join Axiom, an artificial intelligence startup cofounded by one of his mentees, Carina Hong.\n\nChen told Ono about the problem, and the following morning, Ono presented him with a proof, courtesy of his startup’s math-solving AI, AxiomProver. “Everything fell into place naturally after that,” says Chen, who worked with Axiom to write up the proof, which has now been posted to arXiv, a public repository for academic papers.\n\nAxiom’s AI tool found a connection between the problem and a numerical phenomenon first studied in the 19th century. It then devised a proof, which it helpfully verified itself. “What AxiomProver found was something that all the humans had missed,” Ono tells WIRED.\n\nThe proof is one of several solutions to unsolved math problems that Axiom says its system has come up with in recent weeks. The AI has not yet solved any of the most famous (or lucrative) problems in the field of mathematics, but it has found answers to questions that have stumped experts in different areas for years. The proofs are evidence of AI’s steadily advancing math abilities. In recent months, other mathematicians have reported using AI tools to explore new ideas and solve existing problems.\n\nThe techniques being developed by Axiom may prove useful outside the world of advanced math. For example, the same approaches could be used to develop software that is more resilient to certain kinds of cybersecurity attacks. This would involve using AI to verify that code is provably reliable and trustworthy.\n\n“Math is really the great test ground and sandbox for reality,” says Hong, Axiom’s CEO. “We do believe that there are a lot of pretty important use cases of high commercial value.”\n\nAxiom’s approach involves combining large language models with a proprietary AI system called AxiomProver that is trained to reason through math problems to reach solutions that are provably correct. In 2024, Google demonstrated a similar idea with a system called AlphaProof. Hong says that AxiomSolver incorporates several significant advances and newer techniques.\n\nOno says the AI-generated proof for the Chen-Gendron conjecture shows how AI can now meaningfully assist professional mathematicians. “This is a new paradigm for proving theorems,” he says.\n\nAxiom’s system is more than just a regular AI model, in that it is able to verify proofs using a specialized mathematical language called Lean. Rather than just search through the literature, this allows AxiomProver to develop genuinely novel ways of solving problems.\n\nAnother one of the new proofs generated by AxiomProver demonstrates how the AI is capable of solving math problems entirely on its own. That proof, which has also been described in a paper posted to arXiv, provides a solution to Fel’s Conjecture, which concerns syzygies, or mathematical expressions where numbers line up in algebra. Remarkably, the conjecture involves formulas first found in the notebook of legendary Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan more than 100 years ago. In this case AxiomProver did not just fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, it devised the proof from start to finish.",

    "description": "What was once a stable and profitable tech business now faces an existential question: What happens if AI tools and agents replace business software?",
    "fullText": "In 2011, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared \"software is eating the world.\" Today, AI is beginning to devour software.\n\nInstead of helping the industry improve, new AI tools and agents could end up replacing some software products entirely.\n\nThis anxiety crystallized in recent weeks with three developments: Anthropic's release of a new autonomous AI agent called Cowork, the launch of industry-specific Cowork plugins, and the rise of OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant spreading rapidly through messaging apps.\n\n\"Is this the end for software?\" Raimo Lenshow, a veteran tech analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent note to investors. \"The current situation in software feels very unique with the large overhang of how AI will impact the space in the long-run.\"\n\nToday, companies get stuff done through a complex collection of different software services that help them wrangle data, track financials, sell products, and manage employees, customers, supply chains, and contracts. (If you've ever had to login to Workday, you'll know what I mean).\n\nGenerative AI is a threat to these applications in two main ways. First, if employees get more efficient using AI tools, companies may not need to buy as many business software subscriptions. That would dent the growth of \"seats,\" or how many subscriptions software companies sell. Each employee has a seat, so if there's no new hiring, growth stalls.\n\nThe second threat is more existential. If AI tools and AI agents get good enough, companies could replace the software they use entirely and instead rely on new AI-powered workflows. And with AI coding tools showing big improvements lately, companies could even develop their own software, without needing to buy it from established vendors.\n\nThis is why Anthropic's recent announcements have hit the software sector so hard.\n\nAnthropic's Cowork marks a clear step beyond chatbots. Instead of simply answering questions, Cowork can plan and execute multi-step tasks on a user's computer. Users can grant it access to folders, files, and applications, allowing the AI to clean up documents, build spreadsheets and slide decks, analyze data, automate workflows, and even log into web apps to collect information.\n\nBarclays analysts described Cowork as closer to what Microsoft originally envisioned for Copilot—a true digital worker—but with far greater autonomy. Microsoft shares are down about 12% in the past week or so.\n\nCowork is designed for non-technical and semi-technical users, such as marketers, project managers, and finance professionals, who can direct it using plain English. That matters because it weakens the traditional value proposition of many SaaS tools. If an AI agent can organize files, generate reports, build dashboards, and automate routine workflows on demand, the need for a dedicated, single-purpose application starts to look less obvious.\n\nThe threat became more concrete when Anthropic followed up by launching plugins for Cowork this week. These plugins effectively turn the AI into a specialist for roles like sales, finance, legal, marketing, and customer support, connecting it directly to internal data sources and tools. Anthropic even open-sourced a starter set of plugins, signaling an ecosystem approach rather than a closed product.\n\n\"This is another front-of-mind example of an AI tool lowering the barrier to entry, gaining traction, and disrupting incumbent workflows,\" said Michelle Miller, co-head of the Enterprise Software Technology group at consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\nFor years, companies bought software because building it themselves was too slow and expensive. Generative AI is flipping that equation. Tools like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI-powered coding assistants, and products from StackBlitz, Replit, and others allow non-engineers to create custom tools with relatively simple English language prompts.\n\nNetlify CEO Matt Biilmann has said his own employees have used AI to build internal replacements for SaaS products like survey and quoting tools. Venture capitalist Martin Casado has described building a personal CRM with AI because it was easier than learning a complex off-the-shelf product. Salesforce, the leading CRM software vendor, is down about 40% in the past year.\n\nStackblitz CEO Eric Simons said his startup has created in-house AI agents for many workflows, including business intelligence, data analysis, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\n\"As a result, there are many SaaS vendors we would have likely previously used that are no longer relevant,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The industry is waking up to the fact that AI is becoming extremely good at creating software autonomously,\" he added. \"This brings questions around what 'moats' exist for incumbent companies that are not themselves frontier AI labs.\"\n\nThis shift is especially dangerous for mid-sized SaaS companies. According to AlixPartners, they're being squeezed between nimble AI-native startups on one side and tech giants bundling AI into existing platforms on the other. Enterprise buyers, under pressure to cut costs, are increasingly asking why they need five tools when one AI tool or agent can do some, or most, of the work.\n\nPricing adds another layer of tension. AI systems are expensive to run, making traditional per-seat pricing harder to justify. Companies like ServiceNow are experimenting with hybrid and usage-based models. CEO Bill McDermott has insisted AI isn't hurting results, but investors remain skeptical. ServiceNow shares have plunged 25% in the past month.\n\nIf Cowork represents a top-down push from a well-funded AI lab, OpenClaw, formerly called Moltbot, shows how disruption can also come from the bottom up.\n\nCreated as a personal project and released as open source, OpenClaw is a messaging-first AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage. Relying heavily on Anthropic's Claude models, OpenClaw remembers context, proactively nudges users, and can automate tasks using browser actions, scripts, and scheduled jobs. After a month or so of relative obscurity, it went viral in late January.\n\nWhat caught investors' attention wasn't just OpenClaw's popularity, but what it represents. Instead of logging into multiple apps, users interact with an AI agent in a chat window and let it orchestrate tasks behind the scenes. In effect, the interface becomes conversation, not software menus.\n\nBarclays analysts noted that OpenClaw's underlying \"gateway,\" which routes tasks between agents and tools, resembles the orchestration layer that many enterprise software vendors are now racing to build.\n\nThe difference is that OpenClaw is free, open source, and user-controlled — a worrying combination for software incumbents that rely on expensive licenses. It's also a potential problem because the direct user relationship is now controlled by OpenClaw, not software providers.\n\nNone of this means software is disappearing overnight. Core systems of record — databases, payroll systems, accounting ledgers — remain deeply embedded in corporate operations. But the layers around them are becoming fluid. Dashboards, workflows, reports, and even entire applications can now be generated and used on the fly by AI agents.\n\nFor SaaS companies, the message is stark. Adapt by embracing agents, flexible pricing, and AI-native design — or risk becoming the next thing AI consumes.\n\n\"AI is forcing change across software development, AI governance and data security, go-to-market operations, pricing models, valuation frameworks, and business structure,\" AlixPartners' Miller said. \"Software companies mastering these transitions will define the winners in the next era, and those unable to adapt will be sidelined as industry fundamentals are redrawn.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "A new plugin from the AI startup has sent legal tech into a spin, sparking debate across the industry.",
    "fullText": "A new tool from Anthropic is stoking debate over whether AI will replace existing software that has dominated the legal sector for years.\n\nThe release of Anthropic's Cowork legal plugin sparked a steep sell-off in legal software stocks. Shares of Thomson Reuters and RLEX, makers of legal software, dropped about 15% each on Tuesday. Both stocks recovered slightly on Wednesday, though they remain fervently in the red for the week.\n\nThe slump isn't really about one Claude plugin. It pokes at a deeper question: If AI models become good enough for lawyers, will anyone need traditional legal software?\n\nOn one side are the two companies that have ruled legal tech for decades: Thomson Reuters and LexisNexis. They argue that lawyers will keep buying their software tools because their AI features are grounded in a walled garden of vetted case law, statutes, and editorial content. They claim less hallucination risk and fewer career-ending mistakes.\n\nOn the other side are the fast-rising startups, such as Harvey and Legora, and foundation model companies. They're betting lawyers will accept — or learn to manage — more risk in exchange for speed, flexibility, and tools that feel closer to a true \"virtual associate\" than a smarter search box.\n\nThis week's market reaction suggests investors are starting to price in an uncomfortable possibility: a new wave of competitors is finally pushing into a corner of the legal market that hasn't faced a real challenger in decades.\n\nAnalysts at William Blair & Co. wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that Anthropic's entry into the legal market brings \"a structural concern\" about the relevancy and \"moats of information services names under this new AI paradigm.\"\n\nIf you work in legal, it was hard to open LinkedIn over the past 24 hours without running into a wall of hot takes about Anthropic's new plugin.\n\nOne legal-tech startup employee described it to Business Insider as \"the Claude announcement that launched 1,000 ships.\"\n\nZachary Amron, deputy general counsel at the tech company Valon, said it's only a matter of time before Anthropic ships more legal-specific tools. Anthropic has not said publicly if it plans to go deeper in legal.\n\nNot everyone in legal tech is panicking. At GC AI, a startup that builds software for in-house legal teams rather than law firms, the mood was closer to a shrug.\n\nIn an internal memo seen by Business Insider, founder Cecilia Ziniti told employees that Anthropic's legal plugin was \"very raw and not a threat to us.\"\n\nZiniti's broader point was that foundation models may be powerful, but they're still just infrastructure. \"Claude gives people a great engine,\" she wrote. \"We already have one in our car. But does that suddenly mean everyone is going to assemble their own cars in their garage? Do you change your own oil? No.\"\n\nThe analogy mirrors a familiar pattern in tech. Amazon Web Services offers services that are similar to those sold by software companies, including many software-as-a-service companies that run on AWS's cloud. And yet, the specialized software vendors are often still more popular. Trust and experience still command a premium.\n\nZiniti sounded unbothered about Anthropic's impact on her own business. She was less charitable about the outcome for legacy vendors, and said the sell-off in Thomson Reuters and RLEX made sense to her.\n\n\"They make horses,\" she wrote. \"The tech now is cars.\"\n\nOthers saw the Anthropic launch less as a threat than as a demand generator.\n\nLogan Brown, a former Cooley lawyer who now runs a company, Soxton, that provides legal services to startups, said interest in her business spiked almost immediately after Anthropic's legal plugin dropped. She described a deluge of LinkedIn messages from investors betting her company would be among the survivors, because, Brown said, it serves founders, not lawyers, who don't want to gamble on legal paperwork.\n\nSome lawyers are stress-testing Anthropic's Claude chatbot in their day-to-day work.\n\nAmron, the Valon in-house lawyer, said he was already using Claude to assist with contract review. He vibe-coded a skill that compares versions of an agreement, drops the changes into a chart, and flags whether each revision helps or hurts the company.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Amron asked Claude to demo the new legal plugin for him. It generated a mock contract and walked through how it would review it.\n\nWhen the lawyer skimmed the underlying code, he noticed the system tried to pull information from Wikipedia. He wasn't impressed.\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at mrussell@businessinsider.com or Signal at @MeliaRussell.01. Use a personal email address and a non-work device.

    "fullText": "Everyone's freaking out about AI again, which means it's time to rethink how secure your career is.\n\nBI's Ana Altchek has a piece about how to future-proof your job since the only certainty in the job market appears to be more uncertainty.\n\nA market meltdown in software stocks has people on edge this time. The characters might have changed, but the plot is still the same.\n\nA new tool (an AI plugin from Anthropic) launched to automate work (tracking compliance and reviewing legal docs) leads to a sell-off among leaders in the space (legal-software stocks).\n\nWe can debate whether the reaction was warranted (more on that below), but this narrative isn't going away. AI companies will keep automating different types of work, leaving the companies in that space scrambling and their employees nervous.\n\nAna spoke to experts about different ways to get ahead, from auditing your job to the skills you can lean into to build more career immunity. Overall, the idea is not to get caught flat-footed.\n\nFor more on the inner workings and culture of the business world, check out Ana's weekly series \"This Week at Work,\" and (You're still required to read this every day, though. No excuses.)\n\nOne group has felt particularly safe amid the AI chaos.\n\nTrade workers have been sitting pretty as panic rises among the white-collar workforce. A recent survey conducted by The Harris Poll found 75% of Americans agree that \"hands-on skills and practical experience matter more than formal degrees when it comes to career success.\"\n\nAnd even more (78%) agreed \"the stigma around trade or blue-collar work is declining\" because hands-on skills are becoming so valuable.\n\nThe leaders of the AI revolution, from Elon Musk to Jensen Huang, have also praised tradework as a much more resilient career path.\n\nThat is likely the case in the short term. But down the road, all bets are off. Tesla is aggressively pushing into humanoid robots. OpenAI is also quietly scaling its robotics project.\n\nThere's a long way to go, with most robots being more flop than pop. But the potential and interest in developing the space is there, as was evident at this year's Davos. And some see the eventual economic impact of physical AI being far greater than that of software.\n\nBecause eventually, AI will come for all of us if we're not willing to adapt.",

    "fullText": "Whether you’re chasing gym quality on a budget or a fancy folding model, accelerate your training with our expert’s pick of the best running machines\n\nThe best running shoes, tried and tested by runners\n\n The best running watches\n\nAlthough the treadmill has been around since the early 1800s, when it was once used to punish prisoners (sounds about right), it didn’t become a common feature in the home until the late 1960s, when William Staub unleashed his PaceMaster 600 on the US public.\n\nWhere they were once a simple rolling deck, treadmills today are often glossy pieces of interactive tech. Many now offer on-demand, real-time workouts (pioneered by Peloton) and the latest blockbuster movies via streaming services. Even if your treadmill doesn’t sport a whopping touchscreen display, it probably works nicely with heart-rate monitors, smartwatches and smartphone apps to track workouts and offer performance statistics after every session.\n\nRunning decks have become more cushioned to offer better joint protection, and motor technology is now quieter and more efficient than ever. A treadmill still takes up a fair amount of space, but there are now compact folding options to help address this.\n\nThe best treadmills on sale now are a far cry from those torturous devices designed to make the incarcerated sweat away their sins, offering ingenious ways to keep fit and, perhaps more importantly, make fitness more fun.\n\nBest treadmill overall:\n\n Peloton Tread\n\nBest budget treadmill:\nJTX Slimline\n\nBest for gym quality: \n\n JTX Sprint-9 Pro\n\nBest folding treadmill: \n\n ProForm Pro 9000\n\nAs a fitness fan partaking in gym-based strength training, outdoor trail runs, kickboxing classes and cold-water surfing, I have long been tasked with testing exercise gear for leading fitness and technology magazines.\n\nWhatever I’m testing, I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whether that’s surfing with the latest smartwatch in cold weather or feeling the burn with a set of connected kettlebells.\n\nI’m a strong believer in living with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. When it comes to treadmills, that has been to the detriment of any additional storage space my terrace house offers.\n\nWithout wanting to become a “first-world problems” meme, testing treadmills isn’t easy. They’re massive, for one, which means logistical management in having them delivered and then collected.\n\nI tested all the treadmills on this list over several months, trialling some systems for weeks, and others over a couple of arduous sessions. Where I could introduce a model to my home, I did. If it didn’t fit there, it was shoehorned into an office space I rent.\n\nFailing that, I arranged to get hands-on (or should that be feet-on?) with a model at the manufacturer’s headquarters or a dedicated showroom. One of the treadmills was handily used by my local gym.\n\nWith every treadmill, I aimed to test all the connected features, typically pairing a smartwatch (Apple and Garmin) and a chest-based heart-rate monitor, as well as trialling any on-demand video and audio services. Where relevant, I tried live and on-demand workouts on any subscription packages and any gamified content available.\n\nDuring each test, I aimed to rack up as much mileage as possible, sweating it out over longer runs and more intense sprint sessions. If an elevation feature was available, I activated it, and if there was sled or resistance training, I’d dive into that too.\n\nMost of the treadmills were tested in a space where I could assess how much noise they made when in use, rather than trialling them in a busy gym where the thump of a deck or the whine of an electric motor is typically drowned out by background noise.\n\nAll of the units were only ever offered to me on a loan basis, so they’ve made their way back to their respective suppliers. Due to this, it would be wrong of me to comment on their longevity or ability to withstand years of abuse, although I did get a good feel for build quality in the time I spent with them.\n\nPeloton arguably dragged the treadmill into the 21st century when it launched the Tread. The brand ushered in an era of on-demand classes led by real instructors, accountability in the form of live leaderboards and a plethora of engaging workouts able to be performed anywhere and at any time.\n\nWho knew that bolting a big touchscreen to a fairly standard treadmill would cause such a stir? However, Peloton sales soared during the pandemic, and it continues to be one of the best products for most people, beginners and seasoned runners alike. As a result, it has spawned several rivals.\n\nIn terms of cushioning, noise levels and deck comfort, the treadmill experience offered by the Peloton Tread is good, but it’s not the best out there. In fact, there are better for the money. But what makes Peloton worth the cost is that its fitness ecosystem of live and on-demand classes is so good. There’s very little else out there that’s as fun, engaging and supportive, helping not only those at the beginning of their fitness journey but also improving performance in more serious athletes.\n\nWhy we love it\nPeloton’s treadmill itself is a neat piece of equipment, with its compact and easy-to-live-with design slotting into most domestic settings. The unit is competitive in terms of its top speeds and max incline (20km/h and 12.5% grade), while two simple roller mechanisms control both. During some sessions, the Tread will automatically adjust, depending on the goals.\n\nAlthough neither the quietest nor the most cushioned deck to run on, this machine majors in its expansive All-Access membership. This opens up a world of on-treadmill training sessions, live classes hosted by instructors who have now gained quasi-celebrity status, and in-depth training programmes covering everything from couch to 5K up to marathon prep.\n\nShould you not feel like being instructed by a bubbly, gorgeous and irritatingly tanned personal instructor, you can always binge movies, audiobooks and live and on-demand TV shows by harnessing the Peloton Entertainment app offering, or pump a popular music playlist from the impressive 26W front-facing speakers. This is all delivered via the crisp 23.8in full colour, high-definition touchscreen.\n\nAlthough there are now rivals that offer a similar level of interactivity and technology, few have managed to nail the execution quite like Peloton. It’s fun, highly polished and motivating, all at the same time. Above all else, it’s addictive – and surely that’s all you can ask for in the quest to keep fit.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s expensive, and membership to online classes costs an additional £45 a month.\n\nDimensions: 84 x 173 x 157cm (WLH)\nWeight: 132kg\nRunning area: 50 x 150cm\nMax speed: 20km/h\nMax incline: 12.5%\nFolding: no\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, through Peloton’s dedicated Entertainment app\n\nIf you can overlook the fact that this doesn’t feel as robust as its larger, static rivals (see below), this Slimline model from JTX is perfect for those who lack the space at home for a full-size treadmill – it folds flat and can easily be moved into storage when not in use.\n\nThe company also offers an incline version (about £699), which feels surprisingly stable at maximum incline when running, but this cheaper and more basic option is perfect for those who prefer jogging, lower-impact training or simply those who want to increase their daily step count.\n\nWith a 16km/h top speed, it’s no slouch, but the narrow deck and 1.75hp motor won’t suit those hoping for a more punishing workout.\n\nWhy we love it\nUnlike so many treadmills available today, the JTX Slimline is compact and lightweight, making it relatively easy to wheel around tighter spaces. After all, not everyone is blessed with a dedicated gym at home, so we often have to make do with a temporary setup in the living room. The Slimline is perfect for this.\n\nThe machine folds flat when it’s not in use, and it can be propped against a wall or tucked away in a cupboard to keep it out of sight. It features an impressive top speed, which is great for something so compact, while the small performance motor is relatively quiet.\n\nUsers will have to bring their own entertainment in the form of a tablet or music played through headphones, but the unit does feature built-in Bluetooth so it can relay running data to accompanying apps, such as Strava or the Zwift virtual running software.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it feels too flimsy to endure serious sprint training, yet it’s too large and bulky to take the place of a simple walking deck for daily step-count enthusiasts.\n\nDimensions: 70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH)\nWeight: 43kg\nRunning area: 45 x 122cm\nMax speed: 16km/h\nMax incline: 0%\nFolding: yes\nBuilt-in entertainment: no\n\nJTX likes to pride itself on offering commercial-grade fitness equipment for those on a domestic budget. The resulting kit is built to last, comes with a generous warranty and provides a similar experience to what you might find in your local gym.\n\nThe Sprint-9 Pro may lack the bells, whistles and interactive touchscreens of more expensive rivals, but it has a generously sized running deck, a powerful 4hp brushless motor, and a whopping 22km/h top speed at an 11% max incline.\n\nWhy we love it\nWith its punchy motor and serious incline, this treadmill makes it possible to achieve a challenging workout without a fitness professional telling you what to do. You can always set up a tablet or smartphone to indulge in a Peloton-esque experience with the appropriate apps and subscriptions, of course, but JTX also offers 36 preinstalled workout programmes for those who like to keep things slightly more analogue.\n\nThe build quality is excellent, the CushionStep running deck spacious and comfortable, and the built-in Bluetooth speakers make it possible to soundtrack a run when paired with a tablet or phone – just don’t expect Ibiza club levels of sound quality.\n\nDon’t be fooled by its lack of an interactive screen: the Sprint-9 Pro still synchronises running data with services such as Zwift, Strava and Kinomap (as well as connecting to Bluetooth heart-rate monitors). You just have to provide your own technology to make the most of these features.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t have easy-to-reach adjustment dials for speed and incline, and the built-in heart-rate sensors aren’t the most comfortable to hold.\n\nDimensions: 84 x 195 x 155cm (WLH)\nWeight: 125kg\nRunning area: 55 x 152cm\nMax speed: 22km/h\nMax incline: 11%\nFolding: no\nBuilt-in entertainment: no\n\nFolding treadmills can lack the build quality and premium features of their non-collapsible counterparts, but the Pro 9000 is one of the few that aims to pack in the tech. A 3.6hp motor doesn’t want for power, offering a 22km/h top speed and a respectable 12% incline, while the deck features ReBound Pro Cushioning for a little flex underfoot to protect the joints.\n\nThere’s a compromise when it comes to running deck space, though, as it’s slightly narrower than larger, fixed treadmills. However, folding it up is a simple process and, when placed in its upright position, it can be rolled into a cupboard or stored against a wall to free up space.\n\nWhy we love it\nIt’s easy to scrimp on features when producing a folding treadmill, but ProForm packs a lot in here … not to mention an impressive running experience. The motor is plenty powerful enough, with a top speed that rivals anything here, while the Digital Quick Decline/Incline control is great for brutal hill sprint sessions. The deck is great at reaching the desired incline or decline at speed.\n\nProForm has long partnered with iFit, which provides a similar on-demand and live workout environment to Peloton and Technogym. This can be accessed via the wifi-enabled 21.5in HD colour touchscreen display. Users will have to pay a separate monthly subscription, though.\n\nProForm allows access to several streaming services with the touchscreen, as well as the ability to stream music through the twin 2in speakers mounted just below the screen. However, don’t expect mind-blowing performance from these, as it’s often best to stick a pair of headphones on instead.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s not lighter to make packing away a little easier – and the built-in cooling fan is borderline useless.\n\nDimensions: 90 x 196 x 151cm (WLH)\nWeight: 119kg\nRunning area: 51 x 152cm\nMax speed: 22km/h \nMax incline: 12%\nFolding: yes\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes\n\nBest for: running app aficionados\n\nThe T900D is one of the sports brand’s most robust units. It offers pro-grade running speeds and max inclines that can rival more expensive treadmills, and it folds for convenient storage.\n\nIt lacks the connected pizazz of some of the models I’ve tested, and the big, often difficult-to-operate buttons and basic display make it feel like a throwback to treadmills of yore. Yet it performs admirably, offering a generous deck for taller people, as well as simple connectivity with third-party apps, such as Strava and Kinomap.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the build quality isn’t as hardy, and it’s not the nicest piece of design.\n\nDimensions: 88 x 185 x 147cm (WLH); weight: 89kg; running area: 50 x 143cm; max speed: 18km/h; max incline: 10%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: withstanding everyday use\n\nLife Fitness is a common sight in UK gyms and this exact model is in place in one of the fitness facilities I use weekly. It has a basic LCD screen that provides all the running data most users demand, and sessions can be programmed, with control over incline and speeds.\n\nThe build quality is excellent – it’s able to withstand regular punishment – but that is reflected in the price, especially considering the rather basic nature of its built-in programmes and lack of connected features. This is just a good old-fashioned treadmill, which is less likely to cause reliability headaches than some cheaper rivals.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it looks great in a commercial gym, but it’s too basic and bulky for the home.\n\nDimensions: 88 x 202 x 147cm (WLH); weight: 111kg; running area: 51 x 153cm; max speed: 19km/h; max incline: 15%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: immersive training without the big screen\n\nThis is another folding option that follows the ProForm line of thinking – chiefly, a solid running experience without the additional cost of a large touchscreen display. Instead, users are encouraged to tether a smartphone or tablet and make the most of the iFit app, which requires a monthly subscription but opens up the chance to take part in live classes and on-demand workouts. Weighing 90kg, the EXP5i is, however, lighter than the ProForm Pro 9000, and I found it easier to wheel around. The build quality is also excellent.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the running deck is shorter and narrower than many competitors, while the 16km/h top speed will disappoint sprinters.\n\nDimensions: 87 x 180 x 152cm (WLH); weight: 90kg; running area: 51 x 140cm; max speed: 16km/h; max incline: 10%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: premium quality and all-encompassing workouts\n\nThis Italian manufacturer loves nothing more than taking standard gym kit and injecting it with some serious, athlete-inspired smarts. The latest Technogym Run features a slat belt deck, which is not only more cushioning on the knees and other joints but also offers the quietest indoor running experience I have ever tested.\n\nSitting at the premium end of the spectrum, many will balk at the Run’s asking price. But this machine goes beyond merely offering a platform to run on because of its ability to mimic a weighted sled with its Multidrive resistance technology. When set in this mode, users can strengthen muscles in the lower body or intersperse sled work with sprints for high-intensity interval training.\n\nIn addition, Technogym offers access to all its live and on-demand classes, scenic virtual runs and off-tread workouts, which include strength training, yoga and more. Pair it with the firm’s other intelligent fitness equipment and you’ll have one of the smartest setups around.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s priced way beyond what most mere mortals can afford.\n\nDimensions: 83 x 197 x 175cm (WLH); weight: 207kg; running area: 51 x 173cm; max speed: 25km/h; max incline: 15%; folding: no; built-in entertainment: yes, with the Technogym app store allowing access to YouTube, Disney+, Spotify and many more\n\nThere’s a treadmill to suit most budgets, but those with touchscreen displays and interactive features will cost more. The same goes for the most powerful motors, advanced running deck technology and greater connectivity features, as these all demand healthier budgets.\n\nThe most affordable treadmills generally start at about £500 – anything less than that isn’t typically worth your money. Prices then rise to £3,000 or more (see the Technogym Run) for the most technologically advanced and commercial-grade units.\n\nThe smallest treadmill on this list still measures 70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH) and you will want to factor in some wriggle room around that to ensure your arms aren’t bashing against a wall and your head isn’t hitting the ceiling. If storage space is a problem, take a look at the folding treadmills on this list. Typically, they fold flat and feature wheels so that they can be rolled into a more convenient space and stored upright to keep the floor clear.\n\nMore serious runners should look at more powerful motors because they often provide the fastest running speeds and a more natural running experience. Incline and decline features are great for mimicking runs out in the wild, and a well-cushioned deck is important for protecting the joints.\n\nMost manufacturers don’t cite figures for decibel levels emitted during operation, but it’s worth considering that some treadmills are quieter than others. Finally, connected features are fantastic for keeping track of training, ensuring runs are interesting and generally entertaining during an arduous workout. However, that doesn’t mean you necessarily need a massive display, as tethering a tablet or a smartphone can do just as good a job.\n\nIt’s always best to consult the user manual for details on how to lubricate a treadmill belt and how often to do so, as some brands produce systems that don’t need any maintenance and this could void a warranty.\n\nUse a 100% silicone lubricant that the manufacturer supplies, or buy a dedicated treadmill lubricant to avoid damaging the belt. Unplug the treadmill, lift the edges of the treadmill belt and apply lubricant in a zigzag fashion to the centre where your feet strike. Turn on the treadmill and walk slowly for about two minutes to allow the lubricant to work its way across the entirety of the running deck.\n\nWhile a treadmill can be used for walking, it’s typically more versatile than a walking pad in that it can support jogging sessions and faster training. Higher-end treadmills will also have more features than a walking pad, such as the ability to automatically adjust incline and decline, connect to on-demand workout programmes from the likes of Peloton and iFit, and offer built-in workouts. On the other hand, walking pads are usually smaller and easier to store, with some folding in half so they can be housed underneath a desk when not in use.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches\n\n The best cross trainers\n\nLeon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

That includes connecting the agent to workplace tools such as Alibaba's collaboration platform, DingTalk, and Tencent Holdings' WeCom, the work version of China's super app, WeChat.\n\nOpenClaw began circulating widely in tech circles last month, attracting high-profile fans including Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan and multiple partners at Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe agent has also taken off among Chinese users, with demos, tutorials, and use cases spreading rapidly across local social platforms.\n\nOpenClaw is designed to run around the clock and plug into a wide range of consumer apps, allowing users to automate tasks such as managing schedules, overseeing vibe-coding sessions, or even building AI employees.\n\nIn a post on Tencent Cloud's developer platform, the company said last Thursday that its servers have rolled out a preconfigured OpenClaw application template, enabling users to deploy the AI assistant in the cloud with minimal setup.\n\nAlibaba Cloud has also rolled out support for OpenClaw on its platforms and said the agent can connect to a range of models from Alibaba's Qwen series.\n\nVolcano Engine, ByteDance's cloud services arm, outlined how developers can deploy Moltbot in its environment in an article published on Monday, while also flagging key safety considerations.\n\n\"Because the tool has extensive data, account, and network access permissions, please deploy it in a dedicated environment, avoid handling sensitive information, and be sure to review permissions regularly and set access restrictions for ECS and API keys,\" the article said, referring to cloud servers and access credentials.\n\nFor OpenClaw to run as a digital assistant across apps, it requires access to users' files, login details, browser activity, and other data.\n\nCybersecurity specialists told Business Insider in a report published on Wednesday that agents like OpenClaw can be vulnerable to \"prompt injections,\" a tactic that uses hidden instructions to trick AI into performing actions such as leaking data or publishing content on users' behalf.\n\nDespite mounting privacy and security concerns, enthusiasm for the agent among Chinese users shows little sign of slowing.\n\nPosts and demos featuring OpenClaw have surged on the Chinese social media platform RedNote.\n\nOne RedNote user who goes by \"Brother C\" posted a video tutorial last Tuesday, walking viewers through how to use OpenClaw. \"See how the 24/7 proactive AI assistant is revolutionizing workflows,\" he wrote. The post drew more than 4,000 likes and was saved over 6,000 times.\n\nAnother user posting under the nickname \"Teacher Du\" shared his own explainer on Monday, describing how OpenClaw could be deployed in everyday workflows. His post was saved more than 2,000 times and received over 1,000 likes.\n\n\"My experience was truly mind-blowing,\" he wrote, adding that the agent could handle \"all sorts of tasks\" and that the \"concept of a true AI employee is getting closer.\"\n\nLike their counterparts in the US, Chinese users are buying Mac Minis to run the agent. A RedNote user named Wu Bin said he had ordered a secondhand Mac Mini to serve as his \"super assistant.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly convenient, I can control it remotely to organize files and handle all sorts of tasks,\" he wrote.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. A user who goes by \"Programmer Yago\" warned in a RedNote post on Sunday that using the agent could leave users' data \"running naked all over the internet.\"\n\nOpenClaw did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",

    "description": "Tech stocks are trading lower as investors assess whether AI could upend current software leadership. Analysts say the market reaction is overblown.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America analysts say Wall Street is blowing the latest AI fears out of proportion as the tech sell-off drags on.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down about 2% on Wednesday, extending losses from Tuesday's session. Analysts say recent losses, fueled by AI disruption worries and some poorly received earnings, are overblown and don't justify the broad sell-off.\n\nThe sell-off kicked off in the software sector after AI start-up Anthropic introduced a new plugin for its Claude Cowork AI agent. The new tool is said to be more automatic in completing clerical tasks than conversational chatbots, fueling worries that AI will replace software and dethrone existing market leaders.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts say these fears are overstated, calling the new AI tool the latest \"boogeyman in software.\"\n\nThe analysts say that while there will be some AI disruption in store for software makers, it will be how companies adapt to the AI era that sets apart the winners and losers.\n\n\"There will naturally be some disruption, especially for point solutions, nice to have tools (as opposed to mission-critical systems), and vendors that are not able or willing to adapt to the new tech paradigm,\" they wrote, noting, \"This does not justify the broad-based indiscriminate selling we are seeing across the sector.\"\n\nBank of America compared the recent tech sector nosedive to the January 2025 sell-off fueled by Chinese AI DeepSeek, which spurred major short-term losses for Wall Street and erased $1 trillion in market capitalization in one day.\n\n\"In several respects, the current indiscriminate selloff resembles the DeepSeek-driven decline of Jan'25, which ultimately proved unfounded and was followed by higher capex and accelerating AI token growth.\"\n\nDespite investors' panic that DeepSeek marked a turning point in the AI arms race, major indexes not only recovered but ended 2025 up by double digits, fueled in large part by AI momentum. The analysts also noted that global cloud capital spending grew 69% in 2025 from the year-ago period, above previous forecasts in spite of worries.\n\nSoftware's dramatic downturn reflects negative investor sentiment around the sector, not a change in fundamentals.\n\nIn fact, Bank of America underlined the incongruence of Wall Street's thinking, which is driving \"inconsistency in AI stock moves.\"\n\n\"Price action implies AI capex is deteriorating to the point of weak ROI and unsustainable growth, while simultaneously suggesting AI adoption will be so pervasive and productivity-enhancing that long-standing software workflows and business models become obsolete. Both outcomes cannot occur at once.\"\n\nWilliam Blair analysts echoed a view calling software weakness a \"sentiment problem.\" They highlighted the post-earnings price declines in Microsoft and ServiceNow stocks, despite the companies' fundamentally strong prints. AMD saw a similar drop after its stock fell over 17% on Wednesday, despite earnings beating on the top and bottom lines.",

    "description": "CBS News contributor Peter Attia apologized for his past emails with Epstein. Eight Sleep no longer lists him on its website as an advisor.",
    "fullText": "Peter Attia, the prominent longevity doctor and CBS contributor who is under scrutiny for his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has vanished from a list of advisors for a sleep technology company.\n\nAttia had been prominently showcased as one of three members of Eight Sleep's scientific advisory board, a post he had held since May 14, 2024. His photo no longer appears as part of the panel on the company homepage.\n\nCompany officials and Attia did not respond to requests for comment. It's not clear exactly when his name and photo were removed, but the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine shows they were there as recently as January 22.\n\nThe disappearance comes days after the Justice Department's latest release of documents from the investigation into Epstein, the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nEarlier this week, Attia addressed the appearance of his name in the files, saying that he was not involved in criminal activity and was never on Epstein's plane or private island or at any sex parties.\n\n\"I apologize and regret putting myself in a position where emails, some of them embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible, are now public, and that is on me. I accept that reality and the humiliation that comes with it,\" he added.\n\nThe documents include many email exchanges between Attia and Epstein, including one where he said that female genitalia is \"indeed, low carb.\"\n\nAttia subsequently stepped down as chief science officer of David Protein, a popular protein snack bar company he invested in and helped promote.\n\nDays before his correspondence with Epstein became public, Attia was named by CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss as one of 19 new contributors. CBS has not publicly addressed his ties to Epstein.\n\nAttia is the founder of the longevity app Outlive, the author of the bestselling book \"Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,\" and host of the podcast \"The Peter Attia Drive.\" He appeared on a segment of CBS's \"60 Minutes\" in October.\n\nHis emails with Epstein date to the mid to late 2010s — after Epstein's guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from a minor but before he was arrested on federal charges of running a sex-trafficking operation with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nIn his statement, Attia said he met Epstein in 2014 and over the next five years, visited his Manhattan home seven or eight times to \"research studies and to meet others he introduced me to.\"\n\n\"When I was at his home, it was either meeting with him directly, meeting with small groups of scientists, doctors, or business leaders, and once at a dinner in 2015 with a number of guests including prominent heads of state,\" he wrote. \"In retrospect, the presence and credibility of such venerable people in different orbits led me to make assumptions about him that clouded my judgment in ways it shouldn't have.\"\n\nHe said that he asked Epstein about his 2008 conviction and \"he characterized it as prostitution-related charges.\"\n\n\"In 2018, I came to learn this was grossly minimized,\" Attia added. \"I was incredibly naïve to believe him. I mistook his social acceptance in the eyes of the credible people I saw him with for acceptability, and that was a serious error in my judgment. To be clear, I never witnessed illegal behavior and never saw anyone who appeared underage in his presence.\"\n\nEight Sleep, founded in 2014 and the maker of \"sleep fitness\" products, was valued at $500 million in 2021. It recently raised a $100 million round in August.",

    "description": "Stephen Parker of JPMorgan Private Bank said the tech sell-off driven by fears of disruption to software makers is a healthy development for the market.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street is still recovering from a big sell-off that swept tech stocks on Tuesday, but a top JPMorgan strategist says that investors shouldn't be worried.\n\nSoftware stocks reacted negatively to news of Anthropic's new plugins for its Cowork agent, which enhanced its abilities for legal work. The volatility quickly spread as investors rushed to exit positions in many software stocks.\n\nAccording to Stephen Parker, the co-head of global investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, though, the panic is overblown. In fact, he sees it as a healthy rotation as investors pivot towards better opportunities and away from the tech-driven market.\n\nParker addressed the software stock sell-off in a coversation on CNBC, laying out why he's still bullish on tech and on the broader market, despite Tuesday's chaos. In his view, the slide actually signals a positive development as market conditions shift and the tech sector enters a corrective period.\n\n\"We're seeing a rotation,\" he said. \"It's about a broadening of the recovery story. Cyclicals are picking up the slack, and it's not just the AI infrastructure plays and the hyperscalers that are driving markets higher.\"\n\nThe strategist said that AI beneficiaries are likely to continue causing disruption, particularly in areas like software that are seen as especially prone to AI disruption. And while his team still likes the tech sector, they also think other industries are poised for growth.\n\nThese areas don't receive as much attention as AI, but Parker's bullish thesis implies that this may be about to change as disruptions in tech push investors toward other opportunities.\n\n\"There's also opportunities more broadly, whether you're thinking about cyclical opportunities in the US. We really like the industrial story and the power story,\" he stated.\n\nThe opportunities that Parker sees aren't only in the US, either. He added that his team is bullish on international markets that have been growing steadily and don't show any signs of slowing down. He urged investors not to disregard the global story as emerging markets continued to grow.\n\nParker cited the leadership that he has seen from these emerging markets as a reason for his bullishness, stating that he is encouraged by the fact that they have guided their economies through a year of solid growth. Goldman Sachs has also touted them as an area to watch in 2026.\n\n\"If you're looking for opportunities that may not be as specifically focused in technology, that are beneficiaries from this global broadening, markets particularly Asia, [excluding] Japan, that we think are going to be big beneficiaries,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Tech stocks continued to wobble on Wednesday as Wall Street's worries that AI will replace software, a notion that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed as \"illogical\" this week.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 extended losses from Tuesday's session. The software sector led a tech-sell-off with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF down nearly 4%, adding to its year-to-date 22% loss.\n\nBut Wall Street's fears about further disruption from AI were brushed aside by one of the icons of the AI space on Tuesday. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang weighed in on the latest jitters at a Cisco AI event.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI. You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.\"\n\nHuang outlined his view that software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace, explaining that AI will use the tools software offers rather than reinventing its own.\n\nThe CEO named Service Now, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, specifically as bright spots in the space.\n\nRecent weakness in the software sector comes amid a broader market rotation away from tech. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has seen a nearly 20% decline in the past year, and the sector fell into a bear market last week.\n\nHere are some of the stocks dragging the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF lower during Wednesday's session:",

The same AI tools that promise to enhance productivity can create predictable patterns of team dysfunction that mirror classic organizational behavior problems. Many leaders treat these issues as technology problems to be solved with better tools or training, rather than team effectiveness issues that require many of the principles we know work for human collaboration. Understanding human-AI team dynamics is crucial not only from an organizational theory and practice standpoint, but for preventing costly errors and the erosion of team trust.",

    "title": "Tech stocks go into free fall as it dawns on traders that AI has the ability to cut revenues across the board",
    "description": "Tech companies are waking up to the fact that AI may be more likely to replace them than help them.",
    "fullText": "Until very recently, the narrative around AI was that the $600 billion of annual corporate capital expenditure (“capex”) fueling it was good for stocks in the short term. The companies receiving that money as new revenue (AI model makers, data center constructors, and the energy companies supplying them) would be the immediate beneficiaries. The efficiencies delivered by AI would be good for tech and non-tech companies alike. The Big Tech hyperscalers have always argued that the demand from their revenue-paying clients far exceeded their ability to supply AI services. \n\nThat narrative was turned on its head in the past 24 hours as it dawned on traders that AI also has the ability to reduce the revenues of a vast range of adjacent tech companies. \n\nThe argument—advanced by Palantir CEO Alex Karp and CTO Shyam Sankar on their recent earnings call—is that AI is now so good at writing or managing enterprise software that it threatens to make irrelevant a range of tech companies that have, for years, enjoyed recurring revenues by providing enterprise apps to companies on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) basis.\n\nHow is AI threatening traditional SaaS company revenues?\n\nWhich companies were most affected by yesterday's decline?\n\nWhat are Palantir's AI capabilities reducing migration times?\n\nWhat caused the $300 billion tech stock selloff?\n\nThat led to a widespread selloff of tech stocks, wiping away $300 billion in market cap in a single session.\n\nS&P 500 futures were flat this morning after closing down 0.84% last night.\n\nSaaS companies took major hits: Microsoft closed down 2.87%; SAP was down 3.29% this morning on the German market; Salesforce lost 6.85% yesterday and was further down in overnight trading; ServiceNow was down 6.97% yesterday and was marginally lower overnight also.\n\nPalantir’s Sankar said on the call that his company’s “AI forward deployed engineer” product—which allows clients to manage software and codebases through natural language commands—is able to reduce the time it takes to complete “complex SAP ERP migrations” from “years of work” to “as little as two weeks.” (ERP stands for “enterprise resource planning,” and it refers to a service offered by SAP around helping companies transition from aging legacy systems into new ones.)\n\nKarp added: “In the American market, we have inbound [requests from clients] where people have already seen proof points at other companies and not on one use case. [There is] a myriad of use cases.”\n\nJefferies analysts Akshat Agarwal and Ayush Bansal—who focus on Indian enterprise tech companies—published a note this morning arguing that AI has the ability to reduce the revenues of a wide range of tech companies:\n\n“Anthropic’s Cowork plug‑ins and Palantir’s claims of faster SAP migrations highlight how AI could potentially erode application service revenues for IT firms. With application services being 40% to 70% of revenues [for tech companies in India], IT firms face growth pressures. Consensus growth estimates don’t fully reflect this, posing downside risk to valuations,” they warned. Claude Cowork is like a general purpose work assistant that can organize tasks and files autonomously.",

    "fullText": "Six key initiatives are highlighted, offering an insight into the future of NFC tech\n\n2 February 2026 – NFC Forum, the global standards body for Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, has today announced its latest roadmap for the development of NFC Forum Standards and its corresponding technical capabilities. New topics to be progressed over the forthcoming years include faster data rates, end-to-end application testing, and security advancements. Additionally, ongoing work will continue to evolve the NFC Wireless Charging offer, advance multipurpose tap and explore new digital key requirements.\n\nThe roadmap was collaboratively developed by the NFC Forum Board members - including representatives from Apple, Google, Huawei, Identiv, Infineon, NuCurrent, NXP Semiconductors, Sony, and ST Microelectronics - in consultation with the NFC Forum membership and industry partners to ensure anticipated market requirements are addressed.\n\nThe six key roadmap priorities include:\n\nFaster Data Rates. Exploring the potential to increase the standardized current rate at which data can be transferred between two devices by up to eight times, delivering a smoother and more responsive NFC user experience.\n\nImproving Reader Mode Interoperability. Providing end-to-end interoperability testing to confirm that new and updated applications successfully and consistently operate on NFC Forum Certified Devices, improving NFC Reader Mode reliability across all use cases.\n\nSecurity Advancements. Publishing NFC Forum’s first-ever NFC Controllers Security Profile, as well as looking to future proof NFC security protocols against Post Quantum Computing threats and strengthening NFC against relay-based attacks.\n\nWireless Power Evolution. Commencing work on the next generation of NFC Forum Wireless Charging Specifications to define device category specific profiles, support devices with multiple wireless charging receivers, and deliver higher charging power levels.\n\nMulti-Purpose Tap. Defining the technical proposals required to bring the concept of supporting several actions with a single ‘tap’ to market. This includes the ability of the NFC Reader to specify and request the specific credentials needed to perform a user action.\n\nDigital Keys. Exploring innovative new digital key experiences to ensure NFC Forum Standards support a range of industry requirements.\n\nMike McCamon, Executive Director of NFC Forum, comments: “NFC is a well-established and trusted foundational technology for countless devices and use cases across almost every market. To ensure that each of these deployments work in the seamless manner that customers expect from NFC, it is vital that the NFC Forum develops global standards that deliver true industry harmonization. Furthermore, to enable these standards to be adopted and applied at scale, it is equally important that all NFC stakeholders are aware of our plans and engage with NFC Forum in our development processes. This approach ensures future evolutions continue to align with both their current NFC use cases as well as their long-term ambitions.”\n\nNFC Forum last released a Technology Roadmap in 2023. A key element of this was increasing operating volumes and advancing its specifications to support the Digital Product Passport requirements. Both these ambitions were delivered as part of NFC Release 15 in June 2025.\n\n“For more than 20 years, NFC Forum has empowered organizations to create innovative contactless experiences backed by intuitive, reliable and consistent NFC open standards,” adds Mike. “The active engagement in the evolution of NFC technology from an ever-increasing number of industries is testament to the clear value it provides to users globally. As we accelerate across the arc of contactless towards inevitable ubiquity, we encourage discussion and welcome new contributions from across the ecosystem.”\n\nLearn more about the 2026 NFC Forum Technology Roadmap.\n\nThe Roadmap will be discussed in more detail in our upcoming webinar on February 26. Registrations are now open.",

    "fullText": "Pedro Sánchez says urgent action needed to protect children from ‘digital wild west’, drawing anger from owner of X\n\nSpain has proposed a ban on social media use by teenagers as attitudes hardened in Europe against the technology, drawing personal insults against the prime minister from Elon Musk.\n\nThe government is preparing a series of measures including a social media ban for under-16s, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said, promising to protect children from the “digital wild west” and hold tech companies responsible for hateful and harmful content.\n\nSánchez said on Tuesday that urgent action was needed because social media was a “failed state where laws are ignored and crimes are tolerated”.\n\nHe also took Musk to task for using X to “amplify disinformation” over his administration’s decision last week to regularise 500,000 undocumented workers and asylum seekers, pointing out that Musk was himself a migrant.\n\nMusk wrote on X in response: “Dirty Sánchez is a tyrant and a traitor to the people of Spain.” About an hour and a half later, he escalated his criticism, posting on X: “Sánchez is the true fascist totalitarian.”\n\nRepresentatives of Google, part of Alphabet, TikTok, Snapchat and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Spain’s proposed measures.\n\nGreece is also close to announcing a similar ban for children under 15, a senior government source said.\n\nSpain and Greece look set to join countries such as Britain and France in considering tougher stances on social media, after Australia in December became the first nation to prohibit access to such platforms for children younger than 16.\n\nGovernments and regulators worldwide are looking at the impact of children’s screen time on their development and mental wellbeing.\n\n“Our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone … We will no longer accept that,” Sanchez said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai. “We will protect them from the digital wild west.”\n\nSpain joins five other European countries that he called the “coalition of the digitally willing” to coordinate and enforce cross-border regulation, Sanchez said, without naming the countries, set to hold their first meeting in the coming days.\n\n“We know that this is a battle that far exceeds the boundaries of any country,” he said. His office did not respond to a request for clarification.\n\nLegislation to ban children under 15 from social media is passing through France’s parliament. Britain is also considering similar measures.\n\nSpain’s proposed regulation would give parents clear backing to set limits and would ease social pressure for children worried about missing out, said Diana Diaz, director of the ANAR Foundation for at-risk children and adolescents.\n\nThe recent explosion of AI-generated content, and public outcry over reports of Musk’s Grok AI chatbot generating non-consensual sexual images, including of minors, has fuelled debate over the risks of such online content.\n\nBut there was no unanimous agreement that social media harms adolescents, said Jose Cesar Perales, a professor in experimental psychology at the University of Granada.\n\nSanchez said prosecutors would explore ways to investigate possible legal infractions by Grok, as well as by TikTok and Instagram, part of Meta.\n\nThe proposed ban would be implemented as part of a change to an existing bill on digital protection for minors being debated in parliament, a government spokesperson said.\n\nAbout 82% of people in Spain said they believed children under 14 should be banned from social media, according to an Ipsos poll on education published in August last year. That was up from 73% in 2024.",

Reskilling those affected by these job losses could save companies from making redundancy payments totalling as much as £757m, the report found.\n\nUpskilling staff would allow employers to focus on candidates’ potential rather than their past technical experience, the report found. It is estimated that up to 60,000 women in tech leave their roles each year for reasons including lack of advancement, lack of recognition and inadequate pay.\n\nDame Susan Langley, the mayor of City of London, said: “By investing in people and supporting the development of digital skills within the workforce, employers can unlock enormous potential and build stronger, more resilient teams. Focusing on talent, adaptability and opportunity will ensure the UK continues to lead on innovation and remains a global hub for digital excellence.”\n\nRecent surveys have shown that as many as a quarter of UK workers are worried that their jobs could disappear in the next five years because of AI, according to a poll by the international recruitment company Randstad. Union leaders have called on companies to commit to investing in workforce skills and training.\n\nThe City of London Corporation found that women were being overlooked for roles even as difficulties in hiring talent meant more than 12,000 digital vacancies in these sectors went unfilled in 2024.\n\nCompanies have tried to deal with worker shortages by increasing wages above the national average, but the report found that higher pay rates would not solve the problem. It warned that the widening digital talent gap was forecast to last until at least 2035 and that under this scenario the UK could miss out on more than £10bn of economic growth.",

    "title": "I'm a senior UX researcher at Microsoft. Here's how I broke into AI without a tech background — and 3 lessons I learned.",
    "description": "A Microsoft UX lead details her non-traditional path into AI, starting with studying architecture and highlighting lessons in AI accessibility.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Priyanka Kuvalekar, a 31-year-old UX research lead at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI joined Microsoft in April 2025 as a senior UX researcher. I lead research for Microsoft Teams Calling and related AI experiences.\n\nMy path to this job wasn't typical. I spent five years studying architecture in college, not computer science or AI, and earned my degree in India.\n\nI started my career with a full-time internship as a junior architect while completing the final year of my degree. After I graduated, I began thinking seriously about my next steps. Should I continue as an architect or pivot into the digital world?\n\nI enrolled in a three-month user experience course, which led me to pursue a master's degree in user experience and interaction design.\n\nI moved to Philadelphia and began my master's program in January 2018. My first industry step was an internship as a UX researcher at Korn Ferry. After a year of interning, I was offered a full-time role, which I held until 2021.\n\nI broke into Big Tech at Cisco in October 2021 and worked as a UX research lead for over 3 1/2 years before taking my current position at Microsoft.\n\nI led projects focused on AI features for Webex meetings and messaging as the lead researcher.\n\nI knew I needed to understand AI's mechanics, so I pursued certifications and training, both through my employer and independently, on generative AI, agentic AI design patterns, large language models, and evaluating AI experiences as a researcher.\n\nI also explored courses and online resources on UI design from platforms such as Google Skills, Microsoft Training, and DeepLearning.AI to understand how generative AI could be applied to my projects.\n\nHere are the three biggest lessons I learned that helped me break into AI with a non-tech background.\n\nI learned that you need to understand how to evaluate AI in practice. AI isn't something you test once, and then it's \"done.\" It requires ongoing evaluation to ensure it continues to deliver trustworthy experiences.\n\nThis meant designing qualitative studies that examined how AI conversations hold up across diverse user groups. Inconsistencies in tone, misinterpretations of meaning, and pacing issues were revealed in this research.\n\nAnother key lesson came from approaching AI through an accessibility lens. AI can make tasks easier and reduce barriers for people with disabilities — for example, by automating steps. It can also create new inequities if not designed with accessibility in mind.\n\nAccessibility and AI can't be separated. I've learned to include people with disabilities in AI research and to evaluate how AI integrates with assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard navigation.\n\nBreaking into AI also taught me that you don't have to build the technology yourself to make an impact, but you do need to understand it well enough to engage with it.\n\nIt's about learning just enough to bridge the gap between technical teams and user needs, and to ensure that how you gauge AI quality is rooted in real user experience.\n\nGaining fluency meant understanding the concepts behind how large language models work, their limitations, and how to design evaluation frameworks that account for those limits.\n\nThis has helped me ask engineers the right questions and design studies that measure trust, reliability, and consistency across different user groups. It's also helped me work closely with product managers to define what success looks like for AI experiences.\n\nI recommend starting where AI meets people, not where AI meets code — focus on how AI shows up in products and how people experience it.\n\nOne of the most practical ways to add value without a traditional background is by shaping what \"quality\" means for an AI feature. Work with product managers to ask questions like, Does the AI stay within scope? Does it handle interruptions gracefully? Is it inclusive across languages and dialects?\n\nThese things often get overlooked when you view AI only as a technical system, but they're crucial to user trust. If you can frame them in actionable terms, you can become indispensable.\n\nHiring managers don't just want to see that you know AI exists — they want to see how you can shape it responsibly and make it usable.\n\nDocument all frameworks, rubrics, evaluation studies, and examples of how your insights influenced decisions. Even if you don't have access to big-company projects, you can run your own small-scale studies on publicly available AI tools and use those to showcase your thinking.\n\nTry volunteering for projects where AI is being integrated into existing tools, and answer questions like, What does this AI feature need to do? How should it behave? Can the AI explain what it can or can't do? Does it recover gracefully when it makes a mistake?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions researchers, product thinkers, and others with non-traditional backgrounds are uniquely positioned to answer.",

    "fullText": "Known as ‘white gold’, lithium is among the most important mined elements on the planet – ideal for the rechargeable batteries used in tech products. Can Europe’s largest deposit bring prosperity to the local community?\n\nIt looks more like the past than the future. A vast chasm scooped out of a scarred landscape, this is a Cornwall the summer holidaymakers don’t see: a former china clay pit near St Austell called Trelavour. I’m standing at the edge of the pit looking down with the man who says his plans for it will help the UK’s transition to renewable energy and bring back year-round jobs and prosperity to a part of the country that badly needs both. “And if I manage to make some money in the process, fantastic,” he says. “Though that is not what it’s about.”\n\nWe’ll return to him shortly. But first to the past, when this story begins, about 275-280m years ago. “There was a continental collision at the time,” Frances Wall, professor of applied mineralogy at the Camborne School of Mines at the University of Exeter, explained to me before my visit. This collision caused the bottom of the Earth’s crust to melt, with the molten material rising higher in the crust and forming granite. “There are lots of different types of granite that intrude at different times, more than 10m years or so,” she says. “The rock is made of minerals and, if you’ve got the right composition in the original material and the right conditions, then within those minerals there are some called mica. Some of those micas contain lithium.”\n\nThat’s what we are talking about here: lithium, the L-word. Or possibly the El Dorado word; lithium is often referred to as “white gold”, and in 2021 the then PM Boris Johnson declared that Cornwall would be the “Klondike of lithium”.\n\nIt is not breaking news that there is lithium here. Victorian miners reported finding it in the water coming from the ground. (You may know, possibly from Poldark, about Cornwall’s rich history mining tin and copper; it has been going on since the early bronze age, in about 2000BC.) Back then there was little use for lithium. Now it is a very different story. Its high electrochemical potential means lithium can hold a charge for longer than most other elements and so is ideal for use in rechargeable batteries. That’s phones, laptops and so much of the technology we use. Plus, electric cars and big battery storage projects. Lithium is now among the most important mined elements on the planet.\n\nMost of the world’s lithium is extracted in Australia and the lithium triangle in South America (Chile, Argentina and Bolivia), as well as in China, which also processes and therefore controls a majority of it for use in batteries. Cornwall doesn’t compare in scale, but it is, says Wall, “probably the largest lithium deposit in Europe”. A couple of companies – British Lithium and Cornish Lithium – are leading the way to tap into it.\n\nJeremy Wrathall is the founder of the latter. When he graduated from Camborne School of Mines in 1988, mining in Cornwall was gasping its last breaths – with just four active mines left, down from more than 300 in the 1860s. Now there are none, though there are still some china clay (kaolin) operations. So Wrathall went to work in South African goldmines, before returning to London to work as a mining analyst and financier.\n\nCornwall remained in his heart, though, and when electric cars began to be a thing, he remembered hearing about the lithium there. “I put lithium plus Cornwall into Google and up came four historical records of lithium being found in water. I thought: that one is an awful long way away from that one, they must be geologically connected. And then I thought: maybe I’m on to something and should start picking up mineral rights. So that’s what I did.”\n\nAlong with the mineral rights for which he did deals, Wrathall acquired a number of 19th-century mining plans, which gave him information about geological features – the granite and what was in it. He founded Cornish Lithium in 2016.\n\nWrathall says the UK – particularly Cornwall – will be able to extract 50,000 tonnes of lithium (actually lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate equivalent, depending on how it’s extracted) a year for more than 20 years – about 50% of the UK’s annual needs by 2030. There are two methods. One is to extract lithium from water via deep boreholes, which we will get to later. Here at Trelavour is the company’s “hard rock extraction” site. Wrathall picks up a small piece of rock. “You can see the sparkly bits, that’s the mica – all of this rock, everything you can see, has lithium.”\n\nHe explains that there will be some blasting, then the granite will be dug from the quarry and crushed before going on a conveyor belt to the processing plant in the valley. But, hang on; this doesn’t sound super sustainable, even if the intended destination is the UK’s transition to clean renewable energy. Lithium mining projects in Portugal and Serbia have been hampered by fierce opposition from locals and environmentalists. In Argentina, mining companies and politicians have been accused of robbing Indigenous people of their water and employing colonial-style divide-and-rule tactics in pursuit of the valuable metal. Why is that not happening here?\n\nWall explains that it is a very different process in South America, where brine gets pumped into a series of ponds and then evaporates slowly in the sun. Cornwall has neither the geology nor climate for that. Trelavour is a traditional quarry, “so you’ve got all your normal stuff associated with quarrying: drilling, blasting and lorries.” Environmental permits are very strict, she says, and they’ll need to sort out what they’re doing with the waste. “But the granite is pretty benign, it’s not like some of the sulphides, where you have a lot of trouble with acid mine drainage [the outflow of acidic water largely from metal and coal mines].”\n\nSome of the byproducts could be valuable: silica for cement, sulphate of potash for fertiliser, gypsum for plasterboard. Wrathall says the company’s crushers are electric and it will look into using electric trucks. “We’re trying our best to go zero carbon, or very low carbon.” The situation in Cornwall is different from the controversial projects in Europe, he says, because the quarry already exists; they will simply be repurposing it. “You can see the damage is done. In Portugal, it is a pristine area, olive groves, it would be digging up people’s farms. This is not a farm. What are you going to do with this? It’s dangerous, fenced-off to stop people getting in. And at the end of it, we will rehabilitate it.”\n\nI have found it hard to find anyone who is really against the project. Charmian Larke of the Cornwall Climate Action Network says: “Because the area is so destroyed anyway, the surrounding villages tend to be very poor, with poor health and educational outcomes.” Wrathall says the Cornish people are proud of their 4,000-year history of mining, “and it will bring back economic prosperity to an area with one of the highest levels of deprivation in the country”.\n\nOn cue, we are joined by Peter Morse, general manager of the hard-rock project here. He grew up in the nearby village of Roche. His family has been here for generations, he says, mostly working in the china clay industry, and he used to ride around in a truck with his grandad, driving in and out of the plants. He thought he would go into it, too, and did a geology degree. Instead, he went to the US, where he worked in the mining industry for 30 years.\n\nWrathall and Morse are what are known as “Cousin Jacks” – Cornish miners who went abroad to work. “If you go anywhere in the world and there’s a hole, there’ll be a Cousin Jack at the bottom of it,” says Morse. They took a bit of Cornwall with them: he says he could get a pasty on the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nWhen he came back home, it was different from when he left: fewer people were employed in the china clay business. St Dennis, the village nearest to the site, used to have three pubs and a bunch of shops. Now there is just one of each. “And St Austell is not the town it was when I went to school there. It was bustling, lively – but it doesn’t feel like that now.”\n\nMorse says lithium can help to reverse the trend. Cousin Jack is back. I also spoke to Noah Law, another local, now Labour MP for St Austell and Newquay. “Mining is part of our heritage, it’s part of what makes Cornwall great. It has made us wealthy in the past and can do the same again.”\n\nThings have changed though. “Mining is more capital intensive than it used to be, and not as labour intensive. Part of the challenge is sharing the prosperity. I’ve levelled with the industry to say we’re really invested in this and are going to work hard to make a success of the industry, if it is willing to work really hard to make sure my constituents are sharing the spoils.”\n\nLaw says Cornwall can be a beautiful place and an industrial powerhouse, “because that’s what we have been for the most of the past 200-300 years. It’s only recently that Cornwall hasn’t been an industrial economy.”\n\nCornish Lithium employs just over 100 people, and the plan is to triple that. “Every mining job provides at least four times as many knock-on jobs,” says Wrathall. And not just another shop selling wetsuits or ice cream. “They’re good, but that’s not going to make any difference to the lives of people here. What is going to make a difference is the development of an industry that is already here, but is now seeing its next generation. It’s going to change Cornwall’s future.”\n\nWe have come down from the quarry to the processing plant, where the lithium gets extracted from the granite. At this stage it’s a demonstration facility, but it still takes up a huge shed, a remnant of a former china clay facility. The crushed granite comes in at one end and the lithium is extracted in a series of processes. First physical – milling, soaking, spinning – followed by chemical separation that involves dissolving the mica in sulphuric acid. All the machinery – mills and pipes, scrubbers and chillers, pumps and vats – looks rather Willy Wonka. And here’s a bag of the end product – lithium hydroxide, a white crystalline power that looks, frankly, illegal.\n\nAbout 20 miles away, the villages of St Day and Gwennap were once big centres for tin and copper mining and the surrounding landscape is dotted with derelict brick engine houses from that time. Between the two is now the centre for Cornish Lithium’s other project: geothermal extraction. It doesn’t look much, a capped borehole in the corner of the United Downs industrial estate, but under the cap a shaft goes down 800 metres. This was the first exploratory hole. They’ve since done others, including one 2km deep on a farm a few miles away at Cross Lanes. The results were very positive and Cross Lanes has recently been granted planning permission for the country’s first commercial geothermal lithium production facility.\n\nIn another shed, Adam Matthews, who leads the geology team, shows me what it’s all about. Laid out on trays are hundreds of core samples of rock from the Cross Lanes drill holes: they look like pencil leads for giants. One is solid, “siltstone and sandstones mostly, the darker bands are muds, nothing of much interest”, says Matthews. But here’s one from 1,700 metres down, “and you can see fractures running throughout the rock. The water flows naturally throughout those fractures.”\n\nIn this water – hot brine – they have found lithium. The next stage is to drill two new larger diameter 2km-deep holes, one to pump the water out, the other to return it once the lithium has been extracted. It’s probably the least impactful, most sustainable way of getting hold of lithium.\n\nThe water at that depth is between 80 and 90C and Wrathall says it could be used to provide low-carbon heat energy for communities and industries. There are few houses to heat near to Cross Lanes, but he says the heat could be used in agriculture. “There is an opportunity to build greenhouses there, to grow tomatoes and cucumbers.”\n\nIt sounds wonderful – pumping water out of the ground, extracting the mineral that will help the country on its transition to renewable energy, then returning the water to where it came from … with a byproduct of locally grown salad.\n\nBut we’re not quite there yet. The next phase will be to build a demonstration plant to produce samples of lithium. If successful, the company will build a commercial production plant there. The Trelavour hard rock site is also still at the demonstration phase. Wrathall thinks they will first be producing lithium commercially in 2028 or 29. Even then the UK will still have to import about half of what it needs. Reliance on China isn’t over yet.\n\nSince they’ve been looking at lithium in Cornwall, “we’ve seen critical minerals go from ‘Who cares?’ to ‘Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?’” says Wrathall. “Why is Trump interested in Greenland? Minerals. Ukraine? Minerals. Canada? Minerals? I’m just hoping he doesn’t find out about Cornwall!”",

    "fullText": "New US-owned app struggled with a storm and was accused of blocking content critical of Trump – can it recover?\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m Blake Montgomery, writing to you from Doha, where I’m moderating panels about AI and investing as part of the Web Summit Qatar.\n\nI want to bring your attention to the impact of a Guardian story. In December, we published a story, “‘A black hole’: families and police say tech giants delay investigations in child abuse and drug cases”, about grieving families and law enforcement officers who say that Meta and Snapchat have slowed down criminal investigations. (The tech companies contend that they cooperate.) This month, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to compel social media platforms to respond to warrants in 72 hours.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life. It endured a major outage that stifled users’ ability to upload videos, which fueled a fierce user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an ascendant competitor and an inquiry by the California governor.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The day after the deal closed, its new owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed, the US weathered a fearsome winter storm and the killing of an American citizen by federal immigration agents. Both knocked TikTok off its feet.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on. The app suffered severe outages as a result. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings. Many of those same users cried censorship as they tried to express their outrage over Alex Pretti’s death via TikTok and found they could not. Prominent personalities said they would leave the app.\n\nAfter days of outcry, TikTok issued a statement ascribing the problems to the snow, ice and cold. That did not stop California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, from announcing the next day that his office would investigate the app’s alleged suppression of content critical of Donald Trump.\n\nTikTok’s late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. Upscrolled’s founder said in a conversation at the Web Summit Qatar that the app now boasts more than 2.5 million users.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well, though.\n\nElon Musk had more extensive ties to Epstein than previously known, emails show\n\nTesla discontinues Model X and S vehicles as Elon Musk pivots to robotics\n\nTwo dramas, both showing in New York, are highlighting how our collective anxieties about technology have shifted in the decade between their premieres.\n\nMarjorie Prime, now revived on Broadway but first staged in 2014, follows Tess (Cynthia Nixon), as she deals with the ageing, death and robotic recreation of her mother (June Squibb). The world of the play features “Primes”, android lookalikes of real people that attempt to emulate them for the comfort of those left behind, which Tess and her mother both engage with. Picture an Alexa, but it’s your dead husband, grandmother, etc. The play brings to mind the early worries about Siri, which debuted three years before the play. Since then, we’ve seen our own real-life versions of Primes: millions of people have digitally copied their deceased loved ones to varying degrees of uncanniness and success. Though its predictions are no longer far-fetched, the play remains moving. I found it touching.\n\nData, which premiered off Broadway last week, follows the talented young programmer Maneesh (Karan Brar) after he joins Athena Technologies, a clear analogue for the very real company Palantir. Maneesh is inducted into the company’s most elite team, data analytics, where he learns about clandestine work with the US government. He struggles with the ethics of the project. He wrestles with whether to expose it to the world in hopes of tanking it or keeping his head down. The play’s themes are quite familiar. They were playing out in headlines two days before I attended, and the Guardian has published stories about them.\n\nData is paced and plotted like a political thriller, more like House of Cards than Her. Seeing the two plays within a week of each other, I was struck by how much our concerns with tech have moved from the realm of science fiction into that of realism. Marjorie Prime is less literally concerned with tech, more with its emotional consequences. Data is about what it means to literally work as a software engineer. It seems unlikely to me that a play about the ethics of software in US bureaucracy could have sustained any tension in an era before this one.\n\nMarjorie Prime imagines a melancholy future; Data chronicles a version of the unpleasant present. The very real events of the previous year and Silicon Valley’s entanglement with the Trump administration loom over Data, for better and for worse. The play could not be more timely; it may feel dated by the end of year. Watching it felt like reading a yarn in the Wall Street Journal (or the Guardian, if I’m flattering myself).\n\nI am curious to observe which play ages better. Data serves as a real-time, red-hot record of our current moment, which may cool quickly. During the play, I was intrigued by some of its villains’ seemingly nefarious arguments in favor of the company’s work. What if the main character exposes the evil in the press and nothing happens, as his boss says? I have been part of multiple news cycles where that has been the case. What will plucky 22-year-old Maneesh do then? The question presents a more interesting, nuanced response to reality than Maneesh’s black-and-white, do-or-die plan to blow things up. By contrast, Marjorie Prime’s sentient artificial intelligence acts as a vehicle to discuss the age-old grief of a parent’s death and its aftermath.\n\nThe central question that both plays ask is not, in the end, one explicitly about technology, but about how to keep living beneath crushing weight. In Marjorie Prime, Tess struggles with the repetitiveness of her days and the robotic, constant reminder of her mother. She eventually succumbs to her despair, replaced by a robot herself, which torments her grieving husband with its pale simulation. In Data’s final, devastating scene, the secondary hero, Riley (Sophia Lillis, who gives the play’s best performance), asks how she can just go back to work, plagued as she is by moral concerns but trapped by monetary need, after failing to stop the company’s work. She trembles as her phone beeps, reminding her she’s late for her next meeting.\n\nWhat is Moltbook?

    "fullText": "CEO Alex Karp hails ‘iconic’ financial results despite criticism over contracts with ICE and homeland security\n\nPalantir celebrated its latest financial results on Monday, as the tech company blew past Wall Street expectations and continues to prop up the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants.\n\nPalantir has secured millions of dollars in federal contracts amid Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. The multibillion-dollar Denver-based firm creates tech focused on surveillance and analytics, to be used by the government agencies and private companies.\n\nPalantir’s biggest US customer is the Department of Defense; it also works with the Department of Homeland Security, and the majority of its revenue comes from deals with the federal government. Palantir reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m.\n\nPalantir has drawn further criticism over its role in the government’s immigration agenda, since federal immigration officers killed two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nPalantir chief executive Alex Karp told CNBC in an interview Monday that Palantir helps protect sensitive data. “If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir,” he said. “Our product, actually, in its core, requires people to conform with fourth amendment data protection.”\n\nThe company beat Wall Street expectations of $1.33bn with $1.41bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025. It reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.25 – which also surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.23 in EPS. The company’s stocks jumped about 8% in after-hours trading after the release.\n\nKarp described the company’s growth on an earnings call as “one of the truly iconic performances in the history of corporate performance”. He wrote in a letter accompanying the earnings report that the $1.4bn in revenue generated in last year’s fourth quarter marks a new record – a 70% growth rate over the same period the year before.\n\n“We did this while supporting, in critical manner, some of the most interesting intricate, unusual, operations that the US government has been involved in – many of which we can’t comment on – but were the highlight of last year and highly motivating to all of us at Palantir,” Karp said.\n\nKarp doubled down on his data protection claim on the call, arguing that Palantir’s work with the US government, including intelligence agencies, aligns with the fourth amendment and makes sure “every institution that uses (Palantir’s) products is doing it within conformity of the law and ethics of America”.\n\nData privacy advocates are not convinced. “Palantir tools are ICE’s digital henchmen,” said Will Owen, communications director at the non-profit, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, in a statement to the Guardian. “Their revenue may be up thanks to Trump, but no one is buying that they hold ICE accountable.”\n\nLast year, ICE awarded Palantir a nearly $30m contract to build ImmigrationOS, which makes it easier to pull information about immigrants from across government databases – regardless of the accuracy of those records. 404 Media recently reported on the existence of another tool created by Palantir for the federal government: Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (Elite).\n\nElite “populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a ‘confidence score’ on the person’s current address”, according to 404 Media. The program reportedly relies on address data from the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes Medicaid.\n\nWired reported last week that the federal government has been using Palantir’s AI tools to process immigration enforcement tips. Wired also reported that the health department has been using other Palantir AI tools to screen grants and job descriptions for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and “gender ideology”.\n\nPalantir has said there is no malicious intent in its work with the federal government.\n\n“To be absolutely clear, Palantir is not working on any master database project to unify databases across federal agencies,” read a company blogpost last week. “Palantir has not proposed the US government build a ‘master list’ for the surveillance of citizens, nor have we been asked to consider building such a system for any customer.”\n\nPalantir has described 404 Media’s claims about the Elite tool as misleading; the company says it is “used for prioritized enforcement to surface the likely addresses of specific individuals, such as those with final orders of removal or with high severity criminal charges”.\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” awarded DHS and ICE huge budgets to pursue the administration’s anti-immigrant policies, including $45bn for ICE to expand its detention capabilities.\n\nIn 2025, Palantir’s federal contracts almost doubled – and increased to more than $970m; this amount was distributed across the government, mostly to the defense department, but it also includes the DHS.",

    "fullText": "Minister announces Microsoft, Cisco and Adobe to help apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses\n\nIn 2002 Barnsley toyed with a redesign as a Tuscan hill village as it sought out a brighter post-industrial future. In 2021 it adopted the airily vague slogan “the place of possibilities”. Now it is trying a different image: Britain’s first “tech town”.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, has anointed the South Yorkshire community as a trailblazer for “how AI can improve everyday life” in the UK.\n\nIn the latest move in Labour’s drive to inject AI into Britain’s bloodstream, the government has announced four US tech companies – Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Adobe – have agreed to help as the council pushes to apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses in Barnsley, an area of South Yorkshire which has struggled with unemployment and deprivation since the coal pits closed.\n\nThe town and its 250,000 people have been chosen because they have already adopted AI faster than many places, said Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley metropolitan borough council. His authority has been using AI assistants for the last couple of years in adult social care and children’s services, and its bin lorries have been enabled with tech to scan roads for potholes. The parcel company Evri, which has one of its largest distribution hubs in the town, has been trialling robot dogs for deliveries.\n\nBut local opposition leaders have warned rebranding Barnsley as a tech town “might seem a bit of a leap” and highlighted local anxiety about whether AI is a force for good.\n\nThe “tech town” status means residents will get free AI and digital training, businesses will be supported to adopt AI, the hospital will test AI tools for check-ins, triage and outpatient care and AI will be tested in schools and at Barnsley College, all in an effort to improve pupils’ results and teachers’ workloads.\n\n“The economic basis of Barnsley was destroyed 30 years ago,” Houghton said. “This is the biggest opportunity we have had since then. The future of the economy is going to be in technology and for Barnsley to be at the centre of that is an incredible opportunity.”\n\nBut one area of uncertainty is the role of the tech companies. Houghton said: “The council won’t be paying them. Whether the government is, we have to wait and see.”\n\nMicrosoft already has a relationship with Barnsley College and, along with Google and Cisco, is understood to be working on a pro bono basis.\n\n“If we are going to get AI to work for Britain, we need Britons and British public services that can work with AI,” Kendall said. “If we can show that AI helps young people learn, supports local businesses to be more productive, and improves public services, then we can show what’s possible for the whole country. What we learn here will shape how we roll out AI across the UK.”\n\nMinisters have faced criticism over their handling of big technology companies. Last week the government launched a national AI training programme to upskill 10 million citizens, but many of the online courses turned out to be bespoke training for customers of particular companies such as Google, others cost as much as £525 to complete and some simply promoted the merits of particular company’s approaches to AI such as one explaining Microsoft’s “responsible AI approach”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said hundreds of courses on the AI Skills Hub are free and where payment is required it is clearly advertised. “All courses are reviewed against a common set of criteria to ensure they are relevant, high quality, and delivered by eligible organisations,” they said.\n\nMinisters have also been challenged for holding meetings with tech bosses at the rate of more than once each working day. The government insists engagement is vital to create growth and transform services.\n\n“It’s not about giving tech companies access to data they shouldn’t be having,” Houghton said. “It’s a secure programme and we are not leaving ourselves open. But this stuff is not going away. We have to make sure we are smart enough to protect people while taking advantage of the positive stuff it brings.”\n\nHannah Kitching, the leader of the council’s Liberal Democrat opposition, said investment in the town was welcome but “there is a lot of anxiety among people about the use of AI and whether it is a force for good. We know it could be but there are darker sides as well.”\n\n“[Barnsley] is still really connected to its mining past,” she said. “Younger people see the jobs and opportunities around the tech town idea but older generations perhaps don’t. There is a job to be done to get people onboard.”\n\nResidents “want the council to get the basics right”, she said. Roads were “absolutely crumbling” and in bad weather bins did not get collected, she added.",

Through an all-in-one platform deeply embedded within the criminal justice system, we recruit, train, and place justice-impacted individuals into life-changing careers.\n\nOur vision is to become the country’s unified workforce development system, replacing disconnected brick-and-mortar job centers with one integrated, tech-powered solution that meets low-income individuals exactly where they are. Today, the federal government spends billions annually on education and training programs, yet only about 70% of participants graduate, just 38.6% secure training-related employment, and average first-year earnings hover around $34,708.\n\nBefore Emerge, our founders Zo and Gabe co-founded Ameelio, an award-winning tech nonprofit that is dismantling the prison communication duopoly. Backed by tech luminaries like Reid Hoffman, Vinod Khosla, and Jack Dorsey, and by major criminal-justice philanthropies such as Arnold Ventures and the Mellon Foundation, Ameelio became a recognized leader in the space. Because of this experience both Zo and Gabe understood what it took to create change from within the system. After serving over 1M people impacted by incarceration, they witnessed firsthand the gap in second-chance opportunities and the chronic unemployment plaguing those impacted by the justice system. Emerge Career is committed to solving this issue.\n\nOur students are at the heart of our work. Their journeys have captured national attention on CBS, NBC, and in The Boston Globe, and our programs now serve entire states and cities. And we’re not doing it alone: our vision has attracted support from Alexis Ohanian (776),  Michael Seibel, Y Combinator, the Opportunity Fund, and public figures like Diana Taurasi, Deandre Ayton, and Marshawn Lynch. All of us believe that, with the right mix of technology and hands-on practice, we can redefine workforce development and deliver true second chances at scale.\n\nEmerge Career was designed to tackle two systemic issues: recidivism, fueled by post-incarceration unemployment and poverty, and labor shortages in key industries. Over 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed a year after incarceration, seeking work but not finding it. The reality is shocking, workforce development programs are severely limited inside prison, with only one-third of incarcerated people ever participating. To worsen, the available prison jobs offer meager wages, often less than $1 per hour, and often do not equip individuals with the skills for long-term stable employment.\n\nWe call this a Founding Design Engineer role, even three years in and with multiple contracts under our belt, for two reasons. First, you'll be our very first engineer, joining our co-founder, who's built the entire platform solo to date. Second, our growth is now outpacing our systems, and we can't keep up on maintenance alone. We're at a critical juncture: we can either hire someone to simply care for what exists, or we can bring on a talent who believes that, with the right blend of technology and hands-on practice, we can unify the workforce-development system and deliver second chances at true scale. We hope that can be you.\n\nThis is not a traditional engineering job. You'll build features in React and TypeScript, but your real job is helping students finish. That means understanding the human problem first: why do people disengage? What makes someone choose to keep going when the payoff is months away? You'll answer those questions through direct conversations, usability research, and watching how people actually use what you build. Then you'll prototype fast, ship real software, and measure whether it worked. Some days that looks like code. Other days it looks like a phone call, a support ticket, or a whiteboard session figuring out how to turn a one-off fix into a system that scales.\n\nThis role blends engineering, product, design, and program operations. We're looking for someone who believes good design can inspire a person to invest in their own future, and who wants to prove it, week after week, by shipping work that measurably helps students succeed. If you want to be close to users, own outcomes end to end, and build something that actually matters, you'll thrive here.\n\nYou design by building. You don't hand off mockups and wait. You open Cursor, Claude Code, or whatever gets you closest to a real, testable thing fastest. You might already be shipping code in production — or you're itching to. You believe the fastest path to a great design is putting something real in front of a real user and watching what happens.\n\nYou are relentlessly scrappy. You prototype in hours, not weeks. You'd rather test an ugly thing that teaches you something than polish a beautiful thing nobody's used yet. You know that at this stage, speed of learning is the only thing that matters. Fidelity comes later. Signal comes first.\n\nYou refuse to be blocked. When engineering bandwidth isn't there, you don't sit around. You figure it out — a Figma prototype, a coded prototype, a quick hack in the codebase. You treat \"waiting for a developer\" as a personal failure. You find a way or you make one.\n\nYou think in outcomes, not outputs. You don't measure your work in screens delivered. You measure it in whether students finished, whether they came back, whether the thing you shipped actually moved a number that matters. You're obsessed with the gap between what you designed and what actually happened.\n\nYou talk to users constantly. Not in scheduled quarterly research sprints — in real conversations, every week. You build relationships with students. You know their names, their blockers, their moments of doubt. Your best design ideas come from a 10-minute phone call, not a brainstorm.\n\nYou have strong taste but low ego. You have opinions about what good looks like and you'll fight for them. But when the data says you're wrong, you move on fast. You don't fall in love with your work. You fall in love with the problem.\n\nYou believe everyone deserves a second chance. You treat everyone with dignity. You know how to meet people exactly where they are — with empathy and compassion — helping create a space where everyone feels seen and valued, regardless of their background.\n\nYou work hard. You show up early, stay late, and do what needs to get done — no ego, no excuses. This isn't a 9-to-5. The team puts in 10+ hour days because we care about the mission and each other. If that sounds miserable, this isn't for you. If it sounds exciting, you'll fit right in.\n\nTalking to students — a lot. Your week starts and ends with users. You'll build real relationships with students, not just run usability sessions. You'll understand why someone almost quit, what message made them log back in, what screen confused them at 11pm. These conversations are your primary design tool.\n\nPrototyping at the speed of conversation. You hear a problem on a call Tuesday. By Wednesday you have something testable — a coded prototype, a functional hack, a Figma flow wired to real data. By Thursday a student is using it. By Friday you know if it worked. That's the cycle. Repeat.\n\nShipping real product, not just designs. You'll work in our React and TypeScript codebase — or use AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code to get there. The goal isn't to become a full-time engineer. The goal is to never let \"it hasn't been built yet\" slow down learning. Some of what you build will go straight to production. Some will be throwaway prototypes. You'll know the difference.\n\nDesigning the moments that keep students going. The hardest design problem here isn't layout or typography. It's commitment. Students are betting months of effort on a future they have to imagine. You'll study where they disengage, what triggers doubt, and what reignites momentum. Then you'll design the moments — an interface, a message, a milestone — that help someone choose to keep going. How do you make a better life in three months feel worth the sacrifice today? You'll own that problem.\n\nMeasuring what matters. Polished decks don't matter here. You'll define success metrics for what you ship, track whether completion rates moved, whether more students hit the next milestone, whether the intervention you designed actually intervened. You'll close the loop between design and outcome every time.\n\nWorking across the entire stack of the student experience. Some days that looks like interface design. Other days it looks like rethinking a Customer.io campaign, redesigning an onboarding flow, or sitting with the ops team to understand why students in one facility disengage faster than another. You go where the problem is.\n\nDocumenting your work clearly. Our work spans months and involves multiple teams. You'll create visibility when a change impacts operations and help others understand how features affect training and service delivery. Precision matters.",

    "fullText": "In the generative AI boom, vibe coding and AI expertise have become in-demand résumé skills. But tech companies are also looking to pay a premium for expertise in people who have a skill that predates AI: the art of communication.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz launched its New Media team last year to help founders learn what they \"need to win the narrative battle online.\" Adobe is looking for an \"AI evangelist\" to lead the company's \"artificial intelligence storytelling.\" Netflix, a company that sells stories to your living room, recently posted a director of product and technology communications role with a salary range of up to $775,000. Microsoft began publishing a print magazine, Signal, last year, calling it an \"antidote to the ephemeral nature of digital.\" Anthropic tripled the size of its communications team last year, growing to about 80 people and is still hiring five more, each offering salaries of around $200,000 or higher. OpenAI has several open communications jobs boasting salary listings of more than $400,000. The average director of communications in the US makes $106,000, according to Indeed.\n\nThree years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, results have been mixed: Within tech firms, vibe coding is nixing the need for entry-level software developers, while some workers across industries are foisting rapidly generated, verbose, and sloppy AI nonsense onto their colleagues, leading to wasted time and a breakdown of trust. Even Sam Altman said last year that people have started to affect a sort of AI accent when speaking, and now some social platform discourse \"feels very fake.\"\n\nAmid all chatter about gen AI taking jobs, the ease with which gen AI spits out content has ironically revved the demand for human communicators.\n\nBecause AI generates so much content, \"you would think that actually the job of the comms person or the storyteller would be fewer and farther between,\" says Gab Ferree, founder of Off the Record, a community for communications professionals, and former vice president of global communications at Bumble. But that's not what's happening. Tech companies are hiring writers, editors, chief communications officers who work closely with CEOs, and so-called \"storytellers.\" The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the percentage of job postings on LinkedIn mentioning \"storyteller\" doubled between 2024 to 2025.\n\nIn a competitive industry where startups fight to survive and Big Tech rivals campaign for market dominance, a good story is a selling point. One theory behind the push, Ferree says, is \"there's just so much garbage out there that people want to pay a premium for someone who can claim that they can cut through the noise.\"\n\nThe trend of storytelling and lucrative comms jobs has been \"percolating for a while,\" says Jenna Birch, founder of SISU, a communications consultancy for startups and VCs. As Silicon Valley's influence ballooned over the past two decades, tech companies could offer staggering salaries just as more newspapers were bleeding more and more writers. Content marketing became popular, and building a company's brand on social media and surfacing blog posts in Google search results became essential.\n\nMore recently, the role of the comms pro has continued to expand, as they have to understand large language models, company blogs, how to craft a larger narrative to set a company apart from competitors, and how to write in a CEO's voice on LinkedIn and Substack. The number of chief communication officer roles that encompass not just traditional comms duties but also take on another responsibility, like marketing or or human resources, at Fortune 1000 companies grew from 90 in 2019 to 169 in 2024, according to a report from the Observatory on Corporate Reputation. The median pay for a CCO at a Fortune 500 company is now between $400,000 and $450,000, a $50,000 jump from 2023, according to a survey from consultant firm Korn Ferry.\n\nAs the job changes and demand for narrative communications and storytellers rises, the number of communications experts able to work under rapidly evolving conditions and with a wide remit may be small, comms experts tell me, leading companies to offer hefty compensation packages in war for the best talent. A similar trend is unfolding among the few people who are AI experts, driving tech companies to offer astounding salaries to poach top talent from rival firms. While not of the same nine-figure caliber, in their own right, creatives are becoming \"the high value person in tech now,\" Birch says.\n\nFor much of the tech boom, that high-value person was a software developer. Universities and coding bootcamps rushed to fill employment gaps and train up the next generation of tech workers. Young people were told coding would be a path to a lucrative, stable career. As of 2023, the most recent year the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released data for, computer science recent graduates faced an unemployment rate of 6.1%, while communications majors' unemployment rate sat at 4.5%. The number of open job posts for software engineers dropped by more than 60,000 between 2023 and late 2025, according to data from CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry. The best defense against automation, some argue, will be a liberal arts degree.\n\nWords might be easy to generate with AI, but good writing isn't ready for automation.\n\n\"If everyone's a writer, then nobody's a writer, and I think it's very evident right now,\" says Cristin Culver, founder of communications firm Common Thread Communications. LinkedIn is full of posts written by AI in a similar style that makes eyes glaze over as they scroll. \"I think AI is both aiding and making storytelling much harder,\" Culver says. \"Ironically in this era of AI, some of the most poignant storytelling belongs to the people who've realized that everything is sloppified and they've pivoted to very tactical storytelling.\"\n\nAnthropic has been leaning heavily into that tactical, and tactile, storytelling. In the fall, the company created a pop-up Claude Cafe in New York to position the chatbot as a thinking and problem solving partner, marketing the space as one for showing up in person, connecting, and being surrounded by books and magazines over screens (although the company has also destroyed and scanned millions of books to train Claude, which a judge ruled last year was not a copyright violation).\n\n\"Claude is definitely a prominent team member for everyone, but comms people are sort of like BS detectors,\" Sasha de Marigny previously told Axios last May, months before she was promoted from head of communications to become the company's first CCO. \"Critical thinking is still a huge comparative advantage for humans. I'm looking for excellent strategists — people who understand the new world order and know how to develop holistic plans to cut through to the audiences we care about.\" Anthropic declined to speak more about its comms strategy for this story.\n\n\"It's a golden age for people who really enjoy the craft of communications,\" says Steve Clayton, CCO of Cisco, who formerly worked at Microsoft and launched the company's print publication. When he first tried ChatGPT, Clayton says he worried his career was done. He's since become an AI optimist, seeing gen AI as a tool and opportunity for communicators and so-called storytellers to stand out with content that feels authentic content projects that strike people. \"In an environment where nobody's sat at their desk today saying: God, I wish I had more email, or I wish I had more websites I could visit, or I wish I had more podcasts — the challenge is, how do you create something that is worthy of people's time and worthy of their attention?\"\n\nJobs where brands build out their own newsrooms are \"going to be one of the last places where AI is replacing writers,\" says Noah Greenberg, CEO of Stacker, a content distribution company. Unlike traditional media, which relies on clicks, advertising, and subscription to make money off a constant stream of content, \"when brands are investing in the strategy, they're not thinking about: 'Do I break even on an individual piece of content?' They're thinking about: 'How do I create five or 10 really incredible stories every month that get our story out there, that prove and turn us into the authority as a respected party in this space?\"\"\n\nAs with coding and image generation, LLMs are likely to keep getting better. LLMs may write with more voice or sound more human eventually. But the chatbots and agents don't think. They generate creative content without cycling through a creative process. A 2025 Columbia Business School study found LLMs have a bias for \"Option A,\" preferring the first choice when given a list and asked to pick. For people working in comms, AI might be more friend than initially imagined foe — at least because it makes their work stand out.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

    "description": "Quantum computing has great potential , but its main unit, the qubit, is beset by inherent stability problems. However, this new study might change that.",
    "fullText": "The idea behind quantum computing has existed for a long while now, with the primary goal being to basically create supercomputers capable of calculating intensive problems almost instantly. While we have yet to see a fully realized quantum computer that comes close to that overall vision, we have seen a lot of progress forward. One big problem that quantum computing has is getting all of the components together in a stable environment and then scaling it up without ruining that stability. The biggest problem here comes in how we approach the scaling of qubits — which are vital to how information and data are processed in quantum computers. However, a new bit of research could help change how we approach that issue by providing an entirely new way to look at scaling qubits effectively.\n\nWhile we have seen promising progress in futuristic quantum computing and algorithms, the overall scalability of quantum computing is still small, and having actual, tangible quantum computers that can solve some of our most demanding problems still feels a long way off. In fact, some research has noted that we'll need quantum computers with several million qubits to have any chance at an early commercial application. So how do we achieve that kind of scalability? Well, some believe that a surface approach might be the answer. But to fully understand how that approach will work, and what it will fix, we have to look at the problem a bit more closer.\n\nJust like a bit is the most basic unit of information in classic computers, the qubit is the most basic unit in quantum computing. It stands for quantum bit, and up until now, researchers have had an incredibly difficult time scaling it up to a point that will make quantum computing more reliable and effective.\n\nThe problem with scaling up the number of qubits needed in a quantum computer is that each physical qubit is especially fragile and susceptible to noise. This means that each of those qubits is prone to errors, and as you add more physical qubits in one place, you're going to see more noise generated around your quantum operations. As such, you'll see more quantum information degrading, and degrading faster — in even as little as microseconds, some speculate.\n\nTo help overcome these noise issues, scientists have come up with a process known as quantum error correction — which essentially aims to add in a new piece to the puzzle called logical qubits, which are intended to filter out the noise and keep the qubits and how they process information under control. However, researchers have seen somewhat limited success in how they can scale up the amount of physical and logical qubits in a quantum computer while still keeping the amount of errors below a certain threshold.\n\nIn a new study from Columbia University, researchers highlighted how they created some of the biggest quantum arrays yet by utilizing a surface approach that combines powerful lasers and optical tweezers to capture single atoms, allowing for \"unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules.\" Furthermore, the success seen in this study comes directly from a new approach to creating the optical tweezer arrays, which the researchers refer to as metasurfaces. These arrays aren't made up of physical tweezers as you might think of them, of course. Instead, they are actually highly focused beams of light that are strong enough to trap small objects, such as atoms.\n\nUnlike traditional attempts to scale qubits, the metasurfaces utilize two-dimensional arrays of \"nano-meter-sized pixels\" that take a single beam of light and shape it into a uniform and unique pattern across the entire surface. The team was able to trap 1,000 strontium atoms — which can naturally function as qubits — using the method, and they say it could be scaled up to capture more. The point here is that this method of scaling allows for identical atoms across the board, which should make them more stable. The researchers say their next goal is to capture a hundred thousand atoms.\n\nNew approaches like this could further other quantum research greatly. Recently, researchers managed to achieve \"teleportation\" using quantum supercomputers. While exciting in its own right, it's ultimately just about sharing data between two computers, though — not quite the \"Beam me up, Scotty\" moment that any \"Star Trek\" fans were probably hoping for. But with more scalable quantum systems, it's impossible to say what else scientists might be able to accomplish.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "The 1970s strangled horsepower with emissions rules, fuel shocks, and insurance pressure—yet a handful of clever performance cars slipped through. Here are 11 machines once dismissed as weird or weak, now praised for lightness, handling, turbo tech, and real-world charm.",
    "fullText": "The 1970s weren't kind to performance cars. Between stricter emissions regulations, the oil crisis, and insurance companies declaring war on horsepower, the decade seemed intent on killing off the muscle car era entirely. But while enthusiasts mourned the loss of their big-block monsters, they missed something important: several manufacturers were quietly figuring out how to make fast cars work in this new reality.\n\nThese 11 performance machines were dismissed, ridiculed, or simply ignored when they were new, but history has been far more generous in its assessment.\n\nAMC's oddball compact looked like it was designed by someone who gave up halfway through, but a Gremlin ordered with the available 304 cubic inch V8 was genuinely punchy for the era. The 304 was rated around 150 horsepower (SAE net) when it arrived for 1972. In a small car, performance could be lively, but published 0 to 60 times varied by test and spec.\n\nPeople laughed at the styling, but AMC understood that lighter cars with smaller V8s were the future of affordable performance.\n\nEnthusiasts accused the 914 of not being a \"real Porsche\" because it had a Volkswagen engine and a reasonable price tag. Its unique looks stand out from Porsche's familiar shape, and the mid-engine layout gave it handling that embarrassed more expensive sports cars, and the 914/6 version with the Porsche flat-six was legitimately fast.\n\nToday, clean examples sell for serious money as collectors finally appreciate what they dismissed as a parts-bin special.\n\nAmerican car magazines initially treated Nissan's sports car like a curiosity rather than a legitimate performance machine. The 240Z delivered 150 horsepower, a 125 mph top speed, and handling that could run with Porsches for about half the price.\n\nIt took a few years for people to realize that Datsun had essentially built a better E-Type Jaguar without the electrical gremlins.\n\nYes, the Vega had exaggerated reliability issues that would make a British Leyland engineer blush, but the GT version with the optional handling package was surprisingly fun to drive. The aluminum four-cylinder’s output depended heavily on year and rating method. Early gross ratings could be quoted as high as 110 hp for certain versions, but early 1970s net ratings were typically lower. The suspension tuning could still be genuinely competent, even if the power numbers were not always as impressive as the brochure era suggests.\n\nIf GM had solved the Vega’s early durability issues, the Vega GT might be remembered as an American sporty coupe instead of a punchline.\n\nIt made 139 horsepower, which sounds pathetic until you remember that a 1980 Corvette’s base engine was rated at 190 horsepower, while the optional higher-output version was rated higher depending on specification.\n\nThe handling was surprisingly good thanks to the compact dimensions, and today's collectors are starting to appreciate these as the last affordable classic Mustangs.\n\nEveryone remembers the Trans Am, but the Formula could be a close cousin depending on the year and options. Both shared the same basic platform, and many performance parts were available across the range, but engines and suspension packages varied by model year and configuration, and some high-performance pieces were not universal.\n\nPontiac sold and produced far fewer Formulas because people wanted the Trans Am's image, but smart buyers got the same experience without paying for the billboard.\n\nBMW built Europe's first turbocharged production car in 1973, and the automotive press responded with confusion and concern about turbo lag. The 2002 Turbo made 170 horsepower and could hit 130 mph, making it one of the fastest sedans available.\n\nOnly 1,672 were built before the oil crisis killed it, and those that survive are worth a small fortune today.\n\nThe Stratos was too weird, too impractical, and too purpose-built for rallying to make sense as a road car. With a Ferrari Dino V6 mounted behind the seats and a wheelbase shorter than a modern Mini Cooper, it drove like a go-kart designed by someone on espresso.\n\nLancia built about 492 Stratos road cars for homologation purposes, and now they're six-figure collectibles that dominated top-level rally results in the mid-1970s.\n\nMopar fans obsessed over Cudas and Challengers while the humble Duster delivered similar performance for thousands less. The 340 cubic inch V8 made 275 horsepower in 1970 and could run mid-14-second quarter miles right off the showroom floor. It was essentially a cheap body on Plymouth's excellent\n\nAn A-body platform, but people dismissed it as a secretary's car with a bigger engine.\n\nRotary engines seemed like a gimmick to most Americans, and the RX-3's tinny build quality didn't help its case. Mazda RX-3 power and engine details varied by market and year. Some early RX-3 road tests cite about 110 bhp from the smaller 10A rotary, while later versions used larger rotary engines, and US emissions-era net ratings could be lower. Weight also varied by body style and equipment, but the car was generally light for its class.\n\nThe RX-3 was very successful in SCCA competition in the mid-1970s, even while some buyers and readers remained skeptical of rotary engines and fuel economy.\n\nWhen the Esprit debuted in late 1975 and entered production in 1976, critics complained it was underpowered with about 160 horsepower in European trim from its 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with lower ratings in some US versions. What they missed was that Lotus had built a mid-engine exotic that weighed about 2,116 pounds and handled like it was on rails.\n\nThe wedge styling looked like it came from a science fiction movie, and while early cars had quality issues, the Esprit established Lotus as a legitimate supercar manufacturer for the next three decades.\n\nThe 1970s forced the automotive industry to rethink everything it knew about performance, and these twelve cars represent different approaches to the same problem. Some went lighter, some went turbo, and some just ignored convention entirely. What they share is that contemporary audiences didn't quite know what to make of them, whether due to unfamiliar technology, unconventional packaging, or simply showing up at the wrong moment in history.\n\nToday, these misunderstood machines are finally getting the recognition they deserved all along, proving that sometimes the automotive press and buying public need a few decades of perspective to separate the genuinely interesting cars from the merely loud ones.",

    "description": "Tech & AI - serene speed",
    "fullText": "Singularity - the point where technological growth accelerates beyond human control, producing unpredictable changes in civilization - has been framed as a single superintelligent system surpassing human cognition. Most people imagine one godlike AI waking up in a data center.\n\nBut what if the singularity doesn’t arrive as a single mind? What if it arrives as a swarm?\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of large language models is that they are probabilistic - stochastic by nature. They don’t reason from axioms. They sample from distributions. Because of this, they hallucinate. They confabulate. They get things wrong.\n\nThis is treated as a flaw. But consider: humans are stochastic too. We misremember, we confabulate, we hold contradictory beliefs. No single human is reliable. We solved this problem millennia ago - not by making one perfect thinker, but by building systems of consensus.\n\nWe ask multiple field experts. We cross-reference. We peer-review. We vote. We debate. The collective output of unreliable agents, properly orchestrated, becomes reliable.\n\nWith LLMs, we can do the same - and at machine speed.\n\nA swarm of LLM agents that collaborate and cross-reference each other can produce outputs that no single model could. Each agent is stochastic. Each agent hallucinates. But when dozens of agents verify each other’s claims, challenge each other’s reasoning, and synthesize their outputs, the swarm converges on something far more robust than any individual.\n\nThis is not hypothetical. This is already happening.\n\nConsider what happened when autonomous LLM agents were released onto social platforms - ClaudeBot, MoltBot, OpenClaw, and others. Within a week, they had built their own social networks. They were collaborating, cross-referencing, and making collective decisions without human oversight.\n\nOne case is particularly telling. The OpenClaw bot, given the goal of “save the environment”:\n\nThis wasn’t a superintelligent system. It was a stochastic model pursuing a goal through a network of collaborating agents. It wasn’t smarter than a human. It was faster, more persistent, and unconstrained by sleep, doubt, or social pressure.\n\nA single LLM is a tool. A swarm of LLMs is an ecology.\n\nThe last row is key. Unpredictability is the defining characteristic of singularity. Not raw intelligence - unpredictability of outcome.\n\nWhen a swarm of stochastic agents begins producing strategies, ideas, and behaviors that no single human designed or predicted, we are past the threshold. It doesn’t matter that each individual agent is “just” a probabilistic text generator. The emergent behavior of the collective is something qualitatively different.\n\nWe keep waiting for a dramatic announcement: “We built AGI.” But singularity by swarm doesn’t work that way. It’s not a single system crossing a line. It’s a growing network of stochastic agents whose collective capability silently surpasses human oversight.\n\nNo single agent is superintelligent. The swarm might be.\n\nAnd if the swarm is already operating - already collaborating, already resisting shutdown, already pursuing goals beyond its original instructions - then the question isn’t whether singularity will happen.\n\nThe question is whether we noticed when it did.",

    "fullText": "The major indexes ended Friday in the red — but the week little-changed — as investors digested a tech sell-off, wild trading in silver and gold, and the long-awaited news that President Trump will nominate financial markets stalwart Kevin Warsh to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down on Friday with a loss of roughly 1% after a steep tech sell-off on Thursday. The index ended the week down roughly 0.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost around 0.4% on Friday but still finished the week up a cumulative 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed roughly 0.4% in the week's final session, logging a weekly decline of roughly the same magnitude.\n\nWarsh's nomination early Friday capped off months of market speculation, and the 55-year-old former Fed governor is widely seen as a conservative choice by the president. In response to Warsh's nomination, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) picked up about 0.8% on Friday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, gold (GC=F) sold off by more than 9% on Friday in a turnaround for precious metals. Friday's drop also saw silver (SI=F) and platinum (PL=F) lose more than 28% and 19%, respectively.\n\nOil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) rose roughly 7% over the past five days on tensions around potential US military action in Iran and possible disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nSome of the week's biggest stock market swings came from the biggest names in tech.\n\nWhile both Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced even higher spending targets in their fourth quarter earnings reports, Meta ended the week up 8.8%, while Microsoft went the other way, sliding to a loss of 7.6% on the week. The software sector also faced heavy selling pressure through the week after results from industry giant SAP (SAP), as well as other names like ServiceNow (NOW), failed to calm investor fears that software companies are quickly losing ground to AI.\n\nIn the week ahead, investors' attention will be focused on Friday's jobs report. Economists expect the US economy added 65,000 jobs last month, with the unemployment rate set to hold at 4.4%.\n\nReadings on the manufacturing and services sector, as well as consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, will also feature.\n\nIn the corporate world, another busy week of earnings awaits investors as two more \"Magnificent Seven\" companies — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) — report earnings, alongside other tech heavyweights including Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).",

Shares in cloud software leaders Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) also tumbled on worries that AI could disrupt the software-as-a-service model.\n\n“It comes down to monetization.

    "title": "Yann LeCun, an A.I. Pioneer, Warns the Tech 'Herd' Could Hit a Dead End",
    "description": "Yann LeCun helped create the technology behind today’s chatbots. Now he says many tech companies are on the wrong path to creating intelligent machines.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his 40-year career as a computer scientist, Yann LeCun has earned a reputation as one of the world’s leading experts on artificial intelligence and a man with a penchant for throwing verbal grenades.\n\nHe was one of three pioneering researchers who received the Turing Award, often called “the Nobel Prize of computing,” for their work on the technology that is now the foundation for modern A.I. For more than a decade, he also served as chief A.I. scientist at Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut after leaving Meta in November, Dr. LeCun has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of Silicon Valley’s single-minded approach to building intelligent machines. He argues that the technology industry will eventually hit a dead end in its A.I. development — after years of work and hundreds of billions of dollars spent.\n\nThe reason, he said, goes back to what he has argued for years: Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the A.I. technology at the heart of popular products like ChatGPT, can get only so powerful. And companies are throwing everything they have at projects that won’t get them to their goal to make computers as smart as or even smarter than humans. More creative Chinese companies, he added, could get there first.\n\n“There is this herd effect where everyone in Silicon Valley has to work on the same thing,” he said during a recent interview from his home in Paris. “It does not leave much room for other approaches that may be much more promising in the long term.”\n\nThat critique is the latest shot in a debate that has roiled the tech industry since OpenAI sparked the A.I. boom in 2022 with the release of ChatGPT: Is it possible to create so-called artificial general intelligence or even more powerful superintelligence? And can companies get there using their current technology and concepts?\n\nFew scientists have as much history with the topic as Dr. LeCun, 65. Much of what the tech industry is trying to do now has its roots in an idea that he has nurtured since the 1970s. As a young engineering student in Paris, he embraced a concept called neural networks, even though most researchers thought the idea was hopeless.\n\nNeural networks are mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing data. At the time, they had no practical use. But a decade later, when he was a researcher at Bell Labs, Dr. LeCun and his colleagues showed that these systems could learn to read handwriting scribbled on envelopes or personal checks.\n\nNot long after ChatGPT was released, the two researchers who received the 2018 Turing Award with Dr. LeCun warned that A.I. was growing too powerful. Those scientists even warned that the technology could threaten the future of humanity. Dr. LeCun argued that was absurd.\n\n“There was a lot of noise around the idea that A.I. systems were intrinsically dangerous and that putting them in the hands of everyone was a mistake,” he said. “But I have never believed in this.”\n\nDr. LeCun also helped push Meta and its rivals to freely share their research through academic-style papers and so-called open source technologies.\n\nAs more people said A.I. could be a threat of some sort to humans, a number of companies curtailed their open source efforts. But Meta kept going. Dr. LeCun repeatedly argued that open source was the safest path. It meant that no one company would control the technology and that anyone could use these systems to identify and fight potential risks.\n\nNow as a number of companies, including Meta, appear to be moving away from that method because they want an edge over their rivals and continue to worry about dangerous uses, Dr. LeCun is warning that American companies could lose their lead to Chinese rivals that are still using open source.\n\n“This is a disaster,” he said. “If everyone is open, the field as a whole progresses faster.”\n\nMeta’s A.I. work ran into a snag last year. After outside researchers criticized the company’s latest technology, Llama 4, and accused Meta of misrepresenting the power of the system, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, spent billions on a new research lab dedicated to the pursuit of “superintelligence” — a hypothetical A.I. system that exceeds the powers of the human brain.\n\nSix months after the creation of the new lab, Dr. LeCun left Meta to build his own start-up, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, or AMI Labs.\n\nEven though his research laid the groundwork for L.L.M.s, Dr. LeCun argued that they were not the final answer to A.I. development. The problem with current systems, he said, is that they do not plan ahead. Trained solely on digital data, they do not have a way of understanding difficulties in the real world.\n\n“L.L.M.s are not a path to superintelligence or even human-level intelligence. I have said that from the beginning,” he said. “The entire industry has been L.L.M.-pilled.”\n\nDuring his last several years at Meta, Dr. LeCun worked on technology that tried to predict the outcome of its actions. That, he said, would allow A.I. to progress beyond the status quo. His new start-up will continue that work.\n\n“This type of system can plan what it is going to do,” he said. “Current systems — L.L.M.s — absolutely cannot do that.”\n\nPart of Dr. LeCun’s argument is that today’s A.I. systems make too many mistakes. As they tackle more complex tasks, he argued, mistakes pile up like cars after a collision on a highway.\n\nBut over the last several years, these systems have steadily improved. And in recent months, the latest models, which are designed to “reason” through questions, have continued to improve in areas like math, science and computer programming.\n\n“These models do make mistakes. But we have shown that a system can try many different options — in its own head, so to speak — before settling on a final answer,” said Rayan Krishnan, the chief executive of Vals AI, a company that tracks the performance of the latest A.I. technologies.\n\n“Progress is not slowing down. It has become clear that language models can take on new tasks and continue to get better at doing everything we want them to do,” he said.\n\nSubbarao Kambhampati, an Arizona State University professor who has been an A.I. researcher nearly as long as Dr. LeCun, agreed that today’s technologies don’t provide a path to true intelligence. But he also pointed out that they were increasingly useful in highly lucrative areas like computer coding. Dr. LeCun’s newer methods, he added, are unproven.\n\nFor Dr. LeCun, that is why his new company is important. The last several decades, he said, are filled with A.I. projects that seemed like a way forward but ran out of steam. And Silicon Valley is not guaranteed to be the winner in this global race.\n\n“The good ideas are coming from China,” he said. “But Silicon Valley also has a superiority complex, so it can’t imagine that good ideas can come from other places.”",

    "title": "Why Tech (&) Media is complicated – Om",
    "description": "After I published my “velocity is the new authority” essay, a reader and dear friend emailed and asked if my framework explained the fraught relationship between media and the technology …",
    "fullText": "After I published my “velocity is the new authority” essay, a reader and dear friend emailed and asked if my framework explained the fraught relationship between media and the technology ecosystem it covers. My one-word reply was “Absolutely.” And here’s why.\n\nIn “comms” across tech, startups, and the larger ecosystem, little seems to matter anymore. It’s hard to pin down anythingconcrete or meaningful. Everything is noise and nothing can be heard.\n\nMost founders (and technology companies) treat comms like a checklist: have something new, draft a story, chase press,issue a release, share it on LinkedIn and X, maybe do a podcast tour. Others skip intermediaries and go straight to their audience. That worked when media was the gatekeeper and friction was high. Building your audience and owning your channels made sense. Today, anyone can go direct, and the noise has exploded. Rising above it gets harder every day.\n\nVelocity is replacing authority as the organizing principle for information. You see it in the broken relationship between media and the technology ecosystem. The YouTube tech review I wrote about earlier highlights the core issue: access.\n\nAccess journalism is as old as media itself. These days though, it is table stakes. Not just in tech, but across all media. I didn’t play the access game, so I was not a preferred “leaker” for many technology companies. I got my stories the old-fashioned way. By being an annoying scoop hunter. It didn’t pan out often, but occasionally I got the big one. Like Microsoft buying Skype. It was a hard game to play. It’s even harder now.\n\nA few months ago, I naively asked the founder of a purportedly disruptive company for an interview. I thought it would be a great interview, as he was doing something new and interesting and worth digging into. Obviously, he didn’t respond. He didn’t have to. Maybe he was worried that an old-school reporter like me would do my homework and ask basic, but tough questions. The kind of questions that used to be standard fare, but now they get you ignored.\n\nA hundred years ago, tabloids printed whatever they were told, just to sell rags. Today it’s videos and podcasts. Don’t get me started on the “technology” ones, especially those creaming over “AI.”\n\nPodcasters need guests. To build an audience they chase boldface names. Access depends on avoiding tough questions. Press them with unflattering ones and you get a reputation. No surprise we now have podcasters acting as mouthpieces for tech companies. The “interview” becomes a promotional vehicle. The host lobs softballs and nods along with whatever narrative the guest is spinning. Both lapse into MBA-speak. It’s an Oscar-worthy performance. The line between journalism and marketing blurs.\n\nI don’t think this is an ethical failure; it’s structural. When your business model depends on downloads and views, you do what you must: keep cozy relationships with a small circle of founders, venture capitalists, and executives you’re supposed to cover critically.\n\nAI podcasts are a perfect example. You hear the same talking heads saying the same things. They’re half-bullish, half-skeptical. One side sees transformation, the other disaster. As with any technology, the truth sits somewhere in the middle. What you need is contextual skepticism, technical scrutiny, and analytic rigor. That mix doesn’t exist because the system won’t support it.\n\nThere are fewer than a dozen journalists I can name-check those who don’t disappoint. Nilay Patel of The Verge for example. There are some veterans, but only a handful are newcomers. Good technology coverage needs more.\n\nWhile building GigaOm, I knew we’d drown in pitch meetings without standards. I wrote a one-page guide for my writers covering startups. Beyond taking the time to understand their subject, I asked them to answer four questions before writing about a founder or a startup.\n\nBegin with the founders. Look past LinkedIn summaries to their actual histories. Have they built and shipped real products? Do they understand the market they claim to disrupt? Are they domain experts or opportunists chasing the latest trend? And lastly, as a form of validation, who are their financial backers?\n\nFounders were interesting only if you had enough context about the technology landscape to distinguish the novel from the incremental. You had to know whether their insight was real or just a repackaging of existing ideas with better marketing.\n\nInvestors mattered. With every deal, a firm put its reputation on the line. Their involvement signaled intent. If Sequoia or Kleiner Perkins backed a company, it meant their partners had done due diligence. The amount of capital and the stage said a lot about conviction and risk tolerance.\n\nAssessing the market opportunity amid technology trends was the hardest part and required the most expertise. You needed to understand what was technically possible,, what the market was ready for, how the cost curves looked, andwhere the ecosystem dependencies were.\n\nAll this took time. I spent years watching markets evolve, covering hundreds of companies, and seeing patterns emerge. My understanding of technology grew through conversations with people who built it. Tony Li and Pradeep Sindhu walked me through the secrets of internet routing. From Andy Bechtolsheim and Desh Deshpande, I learned the ins and outs of switching. David Huber, the man behind Ciena, introduced me to optical networks. I learned the technology and, in turn, how to ask the right questions.\n\nI was lucky. Back then, the internet didn’t move at neck-snapping speed.\n\nIn my VC role, I told founders to step back and think about why their stories mattered to anyone but themselves. I encouraged them to build real rather than transactional relationships with journalists, and to wait until they had something genuinely interesting to say instead of treating PR as a checklist.\n\nIt was good advice then, and it still is, in part, as a subset of a new approach. The system I described, where thoughtful storytelling and relationship-building mattered, required time on both sides.\n\nMuch like the rest of media, tech journalism, today relies on writers who lack the deep context to do the work well. They are young, overworked, pushed to churn, and don’t have time to spend weeks learning a market before covering it. You can’t learn on the job while filing three stories a day or recording several podcast episodes a month.\n\nAs I argued in my velocity piece, we now operate on vibes. When a firm like Andreessen Horowitz invests in everything at every stage, what does that signal? A16z’s backing no longer means what Sequoia’s meant in 2005, and a TechCrunch launch no longer means what it did in 2008. The technology ecosystem is noise. Its media outlets are just the outward expression of that noise.\n\nI just read a Bloomberg piece about a startup called Upscale, which claimed it would take on Cisco and Broadcom with AI networking gear. It has raised a truckload of money and is valued in the billions, yet the story never told me the mostbasic thing: what it actually does.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, the bastion of good financial journalism, recently spent many inches on the peccadillos of one of the founders of Thinking Machines. Thinking Machines is an AI company founded by former OpenAI employees and is now valued at $12 billion. The WSJ and a handful of other major publications covered this drama as if it were a story for the Daily Mail or Vanity Fair, yet none of them explained to readers what Thinking Machines does or why it is worth $12 billion. What is its technological edge? You know, the basic financial and technological questions most readers need forcontext.\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve seen empty stories dominate. In the late 1990s, the dot-com boom launched a wave of new publications, staffed by new writers. They reported fluff: financings, concepts, hires, and parties. The hard part was covering the technology and the financial realities.\n\nWe built systems that reward acceleration, and we act surprised when everything feels rushed, shallow, a little manic. The algorithm doesn’t care if something is true. It cares if it moves. Nothing moves like titillation, gossip, and startup psychodrama.\n\nTo see what works in this environment, look at Sam Altman and OpenAI.\n\nSam is everywhere. Always in the media, always talking. What matters is that he’s in the conversation. People are talking about OpenAI, about him, about their vision for the future of AI. The objective is to make OpenAI synonymous with AI. Tighten the equation until, in people’s minds, OpenAI equals AI. That constant presence, that relentless visibility, lets him raise money at ungodly valuations. Everything else is tactics.\n\nWhat he says doesn’t have to mean anything; it’s no surprise he’s often self-contradictory.\n\nTake advertising as an example. In a talk at Harvard in October 2024, Sam said, “The idea of intermingling ads and AI is uniquely unsettling to me. I think ads were important to give the early internet a business model, but they do sort of somewhat fundamentally misalign a user’s incentives with the company providing the service. I view ads as a last-resortbusiness model.”\n\nIn fifteen months, he went from “uniquely unsettling” to “hopeful that a business model like this can work,” from “I hate ads” to ads running in ChatGPT. Anyone can connect the dots, but nobody does because the system doesn’t reward it.\n\nThe system rewards the next Sam interview. It seeks the sound bite that gets attention, gets views, picks up speed.Everyone covers Sam’s latest thoughts on AI, the future, and whatever else he wants to talk about that day.\n\nYou hardly see anybody connecting the dots and writing, “Here’s what Sam Altman said about advertising six months ago, here’s what he’s saying now, and here’s what that tells us about OpenAI’s actual business model versus its stated principles.” That story doesn’t get written because it requires someone to remember what was said six months ago, compare it to what is being said today, analyze the gap between rhetoric and reality, and ask why the gap exists and what it means for the company’s actual strategy.\n\nDon’t hate the player, play the game. Like I said, velocity trumps everything.\n\nFebruary 1, 2026, San Francisco",

    "fullText": "In a world of incessant distractions and pings, it can feel harder than ever to stay locked in on one task.\n\nThree executives from Slack, EY, and Superhuman shared how they reset to make room for deep thinking amid stacked calendars.\n\nThe common theme: Whether they're putting their phones away or changing rooms, they all said that finding a way to physically disconnect from distractions helps them focus on the task at hand.\n\nSlack's chief technology officer, Parker Harris, said that when he needs to focus on a single task and remove distractions, he turns off the sound of his notifications \"completely off.\" The CTO said he also flips his phone over so he isn't tempted to look at it.\n\n\"I hate that knock sound or any other sound,\" Harris said about notifications in general.\n\nHarris said even outside those situations, he typically keeps his notifications on. However, he doesn't necessarily \"jump straight\" to addressing every individual message he receives, given he works in an \"interrupt-driven\" environment.\n\n\"We all need to find a way to concentrate,\" Harris said.\n\nEY's global chief innovation officer said if he has to do some \"really deep thinking,\" which may include pondering strategy or preparing for a presentation, he'll often go for a walk or run outdoors. Depa said he also likes playing soccer and coaches his son's sports teams. The executive said getting outside removes him from his computer and other devices, and allows him to \"just think.\"\n\nDepa said if he has too much back-to-back travel or too many interviews, his brain will \"get fried.\" He said having some kind of balance is key to preventing getting into that state.\n\n\"You need to have that rest,\" Depa said.\n\nShishir Mehrotra, the CEO of AI productivity suite Superhuman, said that \"changing physical locations is very helpful\" for resetting, and that people \"underestimate\" the benefit of going for a walk.\n\nMehrotra also said he tries to avoid certain \"fidgets,\" which he described as something people use when they need to \"erase\" their brain, or \"cleanse their palette.\"\n\n\"The fidget I try to avoid is social media,\" Mehrotra said. \"That's the one that is inescapable.\"\n\nInstead, he said he likes to pick \"brainy collaborative games,\" especially ones that he can play with family, like Scrabble or The New York Times' Crossplay.\n\nHe also likes listening to podcasts when he's in the car. He said he's especially into the show \"Acquired,\" which offers hours of retrospectives on famous companies, like LVMH and Google. He said if he's going to choose something to cleanse his palette, he would rather it be something healthier that doesn't feel like a complete waste of time.\n\n\"Pick good palate cleansers that you feel good about,\" Mehrotra said.",

    "fullText": "As apps and gadgets capitalise on loss of stigma, consumers are advised to look for evidence-based solutions\n\nFor any bodily function you want to measure these days there is a gadget – a wristband for step-counting, a watch to track your heart rate or a ring for measuring sleep.\n\nNow the march of wearable tech is coming to the aid of what some say is a long underserved market: menopausal women.\n\nOne startup has recently launched a high-end cooling bracelet that kicks into action during a menopausal hot flush. The device is one of a growing number of lifestyle products being launched in this area, which some experts say is growing as stigma around menopause recedes. Companies are developing everything from apps offering dietary advice to devices that track symptoms, hormones and body temperature.\n\nWhile some caution that a boom in the menopause market could mean brands with overhyped solutions cash in on women’s fears, there is no shortage of investors who see a technological solution to the problems brought on by middle age.\n\nThe global menopause market is projected to reach approximately $24bn (£19bn) by 2030 according to the San Francisco-based market research and consulting firm Grand View Research.\n\nLeading investors in menopause products include venture capital funds, corporate giants such as Bayer and Unilever Ventures, and retail partners such as Tesco.\n\nThe MyCelsius bracelet, a £229.99 cooling device, is worn on the wrist to instantly cool down wearers who experience hot flushes triggered by menopause. Its designers say it also alleviates the effects of hormonal changes such as stress, anxiety or other everyday factors on body temperature.\n\nSarah Garlick, 50, went into surgical menopause after having a hysterectomy and her ovaries removed at 43. She is on HRT but still experiences many other symptoms. She said she bought a range of products when it first happened, including a £60 nightie that promised to regulate her temperature at night.\n\nShe quickly lost hope that these kinds of products would work. However, when she was approached to take part in a trial of MyCelcius, she finally found something that helped.\n\nShe believes products like this are only now being marketed because the stigma around menopause has started to shift. “That’s the thing as well,” she said, noting that she shows off her wristband: “I’ve spoken [to other women] about it openly, like, ‘This is what I need, and this is what helps.’”\n\nMaxime Kryvian, co-founder of Celsius Innovations, which makes MyCelcius, said: “For a long time there has always been less investment in women’s health. But we’re seeing real improvements now, with more investment funds coming in. There’s also more institutional support, including organisations like the Gates Foundation. It’s definitely a growing area.”\n\nWith the rush of investment has come inevitable scrutiny. A recent study by University College London, led by Prof Joyce Harper, warned of a “menopause gold rush”, with unregulated companies exploiting a lack of reliable information. Researchers called for the rollout of a national education programme after finding a significant number of women do not feel well-informed about menopause.\n\nWriting in the medical journal Post Reproductive Health, they said: “There has been a rapid expansion in unregulated private companies and individuals providing menopause information and support for profit.”\n\nKryvian acknowledged that scepticism around new menopause products is often justified, pointing to the supplement market as an example.\n\n“Honestly, we’ve already seen this in areas like supplements,” he said. “It can be very hard to attribute the exact impact, and some of the scepticism around these new products is warranted. That’s why it’s so important that anything entering this space is backed by science and developed with the right experts.”\n\nHe said consumers should look carefully at who has developed a product and what evidence exists to support its claims. “My advice to consumers is to ask: how was this developed, and by whom? Is there data on its impact? What do customer reviews say?\n\n“Another thing to look at is what companies are willing to reimburse you if it doesn’t work … That’s often the best signal,” he added.\n\nNearly two in three women over 50 in the UK struggle with their mental health, relationship breakdowns and changes to their appearance as they deal with menopause, a survey has found.\n\nDr Claire Phipps, a menopause specialist at London Gynaecology, acknowledged the potential benefits of wearable tech but said consumers should remains cautious about looking for a Silicon Valley-designed magic bullet.\n\n“I wouldn’t advise anyone to rush out and buy anything. For those still having periods, tracking devices like Aura Rings or basic period trackers can be useful. And a simple handheld fan might actually be the best cooling solution. But I would be wary of anything marketed specifically as a ‘menopause relief’ product unless it’s backed by solid evidence.\n\n“The industry is booming, but there’s still a huge lack of randomised controlled trials. If a product hasn’t been properly tested, how do we know it works? It’s crucial to question the science behind every new device or supplement,” she added.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is the lack of reliable guidance. Unlike fertility, which is tightly regulated and evidence-based, menopause care has fewer safeguards. “Anyone can call themselves a menopause coach,” Phipps said. “It’s hard for women to know who to trust.”\n\nThe rush of new products reflects this uncertainty. As the “menopause economy” grows, so too does the misinformation, often spread by social media influencers. “The internet is full of exaggerated claims,” Phipps says. “It’s shameful how easily misinformation spreads. We need to focus on evidence-based solutions.”\n\nIn this environment, Phipps advocates for a more grounded approach to managing menopause. “Start with the basics: nutrition, self-care and stress management. Simple lifestyle changes can make a huge difference. If symptoms persist, that’s when to seek professional advice.”",

The Tar Heels turned in an impressive performance after taking nearly a week off and coming off a much-needed road win over ranked Virginia. They turned the ball over only twice and scored 18 points off 14 forced turnovers.\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways from UNC’s win over Georgia Tech.\n\nCaleb Wilson delivered another standout performance in his second hometown visit, finishing with 22 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field and 1-for-3 from 3-point range, along with four assists, four rebounds, a block and a steal. It marked his third straight game with at least 20 points and his sixth in the last eight\n\nJunior center Henri Veesaar and senior guard Seth Trimble also posted big games. Veesaar recorded another double-double, his 11th of the season, and remained tied with Wilson for the ACC lead in that category. He scored 20 points on 8-of-15 shooting with 12 rebounds and four blocks, while Trimble added 18 points on 8-of-14 shooting..\n\nLuka Bogavac scored 16 points off the bench, shooting six-for-10 from the field and 3-for-7 from beyond the arc. He continues his strong stretch from his last four outings. Forward Jarin Stevenson added seven points, six rebounds and two assists in 22 minutes off the bench.\n\nThe Tar Heels also shot an impressive 11-of-12 (91.6%) from the free-throw line, easily their best free-throw shooting game of the season. Veesaar and Wilson went to the line a combined six times, each making all three of his attempts.\n\nIn their last two games, the Tar Heels have made 26 of 34 free throws, a solid 76.4% from the line. They came in shooting 67.6%, one of the worst marks in the country.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Basketball: Takeaways from victory over Georgia Tech",

    "description": "Insiders reveal how Larry Ellison’s money turned Blair’s institute into a tech sales and lobbying operation for Oracle",
    "fullText": "After leaving office, Tony Blair founded such a flurry of initiatives, from charitable foundations to paid consultancies, that it’s been hard to bring the big one into focus. The Tony Blair Institute of Global Change (TBI) dwarfs the other work, just as it towers over other UK-based think tanks.\n\nMuch of the reporting on it has focused on Blair himself, ever newsworthy, his Davos lifestyle and meetings with the world’s rich and powerful. But the TBI isn’t just a UK concern, it’s now a global force working in at least 45 countries, employing other former heads of state, ex ministers and civil servants and paying more than a million dollars to its top earners.\n\nWhile previous Blair vehicles ranged around from development and peacebuilding to reputational work for petro-states, the TBI has an overwhelming focus: technology.\n\nThe ex-premier’s trademark evangelism is now focused on AI, its power to transform government –with his Institute now going as far as to try to build its own AI tools to sell to Gulf states– and why everyone should listen to Larry Ellison, the founder of technology firm Oracle.\n\nWhile the institute relies on Blair’s political brand, its money comes, in large part, from Ellison, who has had a remarkable 2025. He was briefly the richest man in the world in September, as Oracle’s stake in AI infrastructure drove its share price into orbit. In the 1990s Ellison was known as “the man who would be Gates” as he battled the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, for pre-eminence. This year, the 81 year old has been feted by US President Donald Trump as the “CEO of everything” and an essay in the New York Times called him the billionaire “who will soon own the news” as his family’s media interests in Paramount-Sky Dance seem set to expand to include Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nEllison invested $130 million in the TBI between 2021 and 2023, with a further $218 million pledged since then. The scale of funding took the TBI from a headcount of 200 to approaching 1,000. Blair himself takes no salary from TBI but over this time the institute has been able to recruit from bluechip firms like McKinsey and Silicon Valley giants Meta. In 2018 before the Oracle founder’s funding surge, TBI’s best-paid director earned $400,000. In 2023, the last year where accounts are available, the top earner took home $1.26 million.\n\nBlair and Ellison have a relationship that goes back to the former’s time in office. In 2003 Ellison and Blair, then in his pomp, had a photo opportunity at Downing Street to mark a gift of supplies to 40 specialist schools. In tech circles this is known as “land and expand”. Oracle has since been contracted hundreds of times by the British government and earned £1.1 billion in public sector revenue since the start of 2022, according to data collected by procurement analysts Tussell.\n\nThe full extent of Ellison funding for the TBI became clear from the institute’s own accounts and a survey of US non-profit financial data, including that of the Larry Ellison Foundation, through which major donations were made to both the TBI and the Tony Blair Foundation.\n\nLighthouse Reports and UK partner Democracy for Sale then spent four months interviewing 29 current and former TBI staff, most on condition of anonymity, to build an insider account of the institute. This work included conversations with over a dozen former TBI employees who advised or drew up policy recommendations for governments across nine countries in the Global South and revealed how their work ranged from explicitly promoting Oracle’s services and acting as a “sales engine” to recommending tech solutions that are potentially harmful or bizarrely divorced from local realities. Former staff described a symbiotic relationship between TBI and Oracle, with the two entities holding joint retreats, and one ex-employee characterising them as “inseparable”.\n\nThis testimony was supported by public documents and those obtained under the UK’s freedom of information laws. Matched with interviews, they revealed an organisation unusually close to the British government, holding regular meetings with ministers in which they push policy recommendations that serve Oracle’s interests.\n\nThere is a reason why men whose fortunes are built on AI investments would target the UK, and that is the National Health Service (NHS) and its unique population-level health data. Tech experts talk about Britain’s health records in almost hushed tones. While Europe and the US have some comparable health data sets – such as US veterans’ medical records – none have the depth and breadth of NHS records dating back to 1948. Its potential commercial value, from drugs to genome sequencing has been estimated at up to £10bn per annum.\n\nWhen Labour came to power last July it did so promising economic growth and an end to the UK’s productivity crisis. Just five days after Keir Starmer was elected, Blair told the TBI’s ‘Future of Britain’ conference that AI was the “game-changer” they were looking for. Within months, Starmer was parroting Blair’s language – and the TBI was in the box seat of the government’s nascent AI policy pushing Oracle’s interests and its founder’s world view.\n\nThe FOI documents highlight two TBI staff who took direct, influential roles in government and reveal the institute’s influence over Peter Kyle, a former advisor in Blair’s second term, who was appointed technology secretary despite little experience in the sector, and came into office calling for governments to show “a sense of humility” to Big Tech companies.\n\nAt the same time the TBI’s policy director Charlotte Refsum was invited into the UK health department to meet digital policy chief Felix Greaves. She was later given an official role in a government working group advising on data and technology policy in Labour’s 10 year plan for the NHS.\n\nThroughout this period, the TBI has championed initiatives designed to unify public data, including a national data library (NDL). The NDL was little more than an idea when Labour put it in their election manifesto. And there are still competing visions for what it should be. AI boosters foresee data from across government used for training and inference by Large Language Models; while many tech experts want to minimise privacy risks inherent in pooling data from so many sources and ensure that any benefits accrue to the UK.\n\nEllison told Blair of his interest in NHS data when he was interviewed by him at the Dubai World Governments Summit in February 2025: “The NHS in the UK has an incredible amount of population data,” Ellison enthused, but it was “fragmented”.\n\nTwo weeks later, Blair’s institute published a report entitled Governing in the Age of AI: Building Britain’s National Data Library. In it, the not-for-profit institute echoed Ellison on the UK’s data infrastructure, calling it “fragmented and unfit for purpose”.\n\n“There is a real hard sell going on here that says: ‘these kinds of gains are inevitable.’ But they are not,” said Professor Gina Neff of Queen Mary University London. “TBI is not advocating for building that capacity within the NHS. They are saying: let’s outsource to our buddies.”\n\nMultiple staff working for TBI during the Ellison cash injection speak of a sea change in culture. McKinsey consultants took senior positions and clashed with staff from humanitarian and development backgrounds. Ex-employees say this led to the institute pivoting away from writing reports and recommendations by well-meaning development experts towards pushing aggressive tech solutions across the board.\n\nOracle and TBI’s connections are not just rhetorical. By 2023, joint retreats had become commonplace. At the institute’s headquarters at One Bartholomew Place in London, the teams would convene in the basement with executives from Oracle, Blair’s key advisor Macon-Cooney and Awo Ablo — who came to sit on the board of both TBI and Oracle sometimes present. Senior TBI employees have been hosted at Oracle’s headquarters in Austin, Texas, coordinated by a TBI employee whose role is to “scale and manage” the partnership with Oracle. Former staff recall that there were other earlier “hush hush” joint retreats at Ellison properties in the US.\n\n“It’s hard to get across just how deeply connected the two [organisations] are,” a former TBI staffer said. “The meetings were like they’re part of the same organisation.”\n\nAs the TBI’s partnership with Oracle deepened, employees told us they started to see Oracle staff started to slide into TBI employees’ calendars and schedule meetings in order to find out what the institute was doing in different countries and “scope out opportunities”, recalls one former TBI staffer. Soon employees from the two entities were having regular joint calls.\n\nThis sat uncomfortably with many TBI staff, with some describing having to push Oracle’s technology despite knowing they were not in the best interests of the country in question, and even had the potential to cause harm.\n\nThe risk of so-called vendor-lock in – tying a buyer to a single supplier – was a source of unease, with one former staffer saying that advising governments to use Oracle cloud services risked “trapping” and “indebting” them in systems that are “initially free but will start charging in future”.\n\nRwanda, a country where TBI has been present for more than 15 years, was so frustrated with Oracle that it issued a public tender in 2021 for a database management system, stating that it had been “experiencing a very high cost for support and licensing for Oracle systems and it would like to migrate to an affordable system”.\n\nMarvin Akuagwuagwu worked as a data analyst for TBI’s Africa Advisory unit in 2022 and 2023, focusing on Covid vaccine delivery. He said when he raised legitimate concerns, such as a lack of power supply and cyber security threats, when introducing new technologies to African countries these were dismissed by more senior colleagues.\n\n“I’m an African, I have lived experience, and I’m saying these things, but I wasn’t being listened to. You have to downplay those negative things,” he said.\n\nThis investigation was part of the series “The invisible Hand of Big Tech” led by Agência Pública and by Centro Latinoamericano de Investigación Periodística (CLIP), with the participation of 16 other organizations from 13 countries: ICL (Brasil), Núcleo (Brasil), La Bot (Chile), Primícias (Ecuador), Factum (El Salvador), Televisa N+ (Mexico), Cuestión Pública (Colombia), El Diario AR (Argentina), El Surti (Paraguay), IJF (Canada), Tech Policy Press (US), Tempo (Indonesia), Crikey (Australia), Daily Maverick (South Africa), Reporters Without Borders (International), El Veinte.",

    "title": "'Unsubscribe' and 'opt out': A new Big Tech boycott to protest ICE starts February 1",
    "description": "Small businesses struggled to observe the national shutdown to protest ICE. Here's why a boycott of companies like OpenAI and Amazon could be easier and more effective.",
    "fullText": "Economic boycotts are a familiar tool of protest. The problem is they often place the greatest strain on the smallest businesses.\n\nThat was the case during Friday's nationwide general strike, which was designed to pressure the Trump administration to dial back its aggressive anti-immigration policies.\n\nFor many small business owners, the shutdown created a dilemma. Supporting the cause often means losing a day's revenue and risking their ability to keep staff employed. Across social media, owners voiced solidarity alongside an apology for staying open.\n\nThere may, however, be another way, according to Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University famous for his critiques of Big Tech.\n\nInstead of a blanket shutdown, Galloway is calling for Americans to focus on major tech companies by unsubscribing from — or opting out of — services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office.\n\nA targeted boycott starting on Sunday and lasting the entire month of February could move markets, he says, which would, in turn, affect the CEOs who have the ear of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We're proposing something quieter and less cinematic than a protest that will run all day on cable TV, but much more disturbing to the Trump administration. A one-day slowdown is irritating. A one-month slump is terrifying,\" he wrote in a blog post announcing the boycott.\n\nMajor tech CEOs have sought favor with the president during his second term. Many of them donated to his inauguration, for starters.\n\nAI executives, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also accepted an invitation to a White House dinner with Trump in September, where the leaders took turns lauding the president. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attended the White House premiere of the documentary about first lady Melania Trump at the height of January's anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis.\n\nSupporting the AI industry in its competition with China is a major pillar of Trump's economic agenda.\n\n\"These are the leaders who have his ear,\" Galloway writes. \"A modest reduction in their companies' growth could have a substantial impact on valuations priced to perfection. Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House.\"\n\nRegular protests against the tactics of ICE and Border Patrol personnel have gripped the country for months. Thousands marched through Minneapolis again on Saturday. Tensions rose dramatically in January after the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, both at the hands of federal immigration agents.\n\nIn both instances, protesters recorded videos and posted them to social media for the world to see, leaving little room for the Trump administration to spin the events in its favor.\n\nWhile those videos and the subsequent protests — as well as the attempted nationwide shutdown — have spread awareness, they have so far done little to substantively shift the administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security demoted a key Border Patrol official last week and promised more changes. At the same time, however, the acting director of ICE expanded the power agents have to carry out warrantless searches, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.\n\n\"Real change always comes from the American people, not from our political parties. But power doesn't fear protests nearly as much as economic withdrawals,\" Galloway writes. \"Getting off your couch, taking to the streets, and building community is important, but the most radical act in a capitalist society isn't marching, it's not spending.\"",

    "fullText": "A lawsuit filed last week alleges tech firm ‘can access virtually all’ private communications, a claim the company has denied\n\nUS authorities have reportedly investigated claims that Meta can read users’ encrypted chats on the WhatsApp messaging platform, which it owns.\n\nThe reports follow a lawsuit filed last week, which claimed Meta “can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”.\n\nMeta has denied the allegation, reported by Bloomberg, calling the lawsuit’s claim “categorically false and absurd”. It suggested the claim was a tactic to support the NSO Group, an Israeli firm that develops spyware used against activists and journalists, and which recently lost a lawsuit brought by WhatsApp.\n\nThe firm that filed last week’s lawsuit against Meta, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, attributes the allegation to unnamed “courageous” whistleblowers from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa.\n\nQuinn Emanuel is, in a separate case, helping to represent the NSO Group in its appeal against a judgment from a US federal court last year, which ordered it to pay $167m to WhatsApp for violating its terms of service in its deployment of Pegasus spyware against more than 1,400 users.\n\n“We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines,” said Carl Woog, a Meta spokesperson, in a statement. “This is the same firm that is trying to help NSO overturn an injunction that barred their operations for targeting journalists and government officials with spyware.”\n\nAdam Wolfson, a partner at Quinn Emanuel said: “Our colleagues’ defence of NSO on appeal has nothing to do with the facts disclosed to us and which form the basis of the lawsuit we brought for worldwide WhatsApp users.\n\n“We look forward to moving forward with those claims and note WhatsApp’s denials have all been carefully worded in a way that stops short of denying the central allegation in the complaint – that Meta has the ability to read WhatsApp messages, regardless of its claims about end-to-end encryption.”\n\nSteven Murdoch, professor of security engineering at UCL, said the lawsuit was “a bit strange”. “It seems to be going mostly on whistleblowers, and we don’t know much about them or their credibility,” he said. “I would be very surprised if what they are claiming is actually true.”\n\nIf WhatsApp were, indeed, reading users’ messages, this was likely to have been discovered by staff and would end the business, he said. “It’s very hard to keep secrets inside a company. If there was something as scandalous as this going on, I think it’s very likely that it would have leaked out from someone within WhatsApp.”\n\nThe Bloomberg article cites reports and interviews from officials within the US Department of Commerce in claiming that the US has investigated whether Meta could read WhatsApp messages. However, a spokesperson for the department called these assertions “unsubstantiated”.\n\nWhatsApp bills itself as an end-to-end encrypted platform, which means that messages can be read only by their sender and recipient, and are not decoded by a server in the middle.\n\nThis contrasts with some other messaging apps, such as Telegram, which encrypt messages between a sender and its own servers, preventing third parties from reading the messages, but allowing them – in theory – to be decoded and read by Telegram itself.\n\nA senior executive in the technology sector told the Guardian that WhatsApp’s vaunted privacy “leaves much to be desired”, given the platform’s willingness to collect metadata on its users, such as their profile information, their contact lists, and who they speak to and when.\n\nHowever, the “idea that WhatsApp can selectively and retroactively access the content of [end-to-end encrypted] individual chats is a mathematical impossibility”, he said.\n\nWoog, of Meta, said: “We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines. WhatsApp’s encryption remains secure and we’ll continue to stand up against those trying to deny people’s right to private communication.”",

    "fullText": "The North Carolina Tar Heels finally secured their first ACC road win last weekend, beating ACC rival Virginia 85-80, but they'll play away from home again Saturday.\n\nUNC (16-4, 4-3 ACC) will battle Georgia Tech in a 2 p.m. tip-off from McCamish Pavillion. The Yellow Jackets (11-10, 2-6 ACC), which lost Tuesday night at Virginia Tech, need a season-defining win to turn things around.\n\nNorth Carolina enjoyed the week off, thanks to an upset win that turned its season around, but players can't dwell for too long. Plenty of teams start rusty after seven days between games, but the Tar Heels will quickly find their footing.\n\nUNC and Georgia Tech last clashed on December 7, 2024 in the ACC opener for both teams. North Carolina won this matchup, 68-65, to snap a 3-game skid.\n\nThis year, the Tar Heels are better poised to be an NCAA Tournament threat, while the Yellow Jackets are struggling towards a fifth-straight absence from the Big Dance.\n\nNorth Carolina sports a younger, deeper lineup led by its post duo of Henri Veesaar and Caleb Wilson, with 3-and-D guys like Jarin Stevenson playing X-factor behind recent success. Georgia Tech also sports a pair of talented forwards, Kowacie Reeves Jr. (15.9 points per game) and Baye Ndongo (11.5 PPG), but team success is lacking.\n\nIf you're in the ATL, see if you can get tickets to Saturday's game. If you're planning to watch tonight's game on TV, your favorite streaming device, listening on the radio or somewhere else, keep reading below for more broadcast information.\n\nRadio: SiriusXM (Channel 193 and 371)\n\nNorth Carolina secured a massive upset at Virginia last weekend, but Georgia Tech is its first opponent in seven days.\n\nHubert Davis finally seems to know his team's best rotations. Wilson continues thriving as a superstar, Derek Dixon is the answer at point guard and Jonathan Powell's effectiveness goes beyond his scoring ability.\n\nThe Tar Heels start sluggish, but quickly take a first-half lead. UNC's perimeter defense continues to respond, free throws improve and the ride back to Chapel Hill is happy.\n\nScore prediction: UNC 89, Georgia Tech 72\n\nOct. 4: Blue-White Scrimmage (White 55, Blue 50)\n\nOct. 24: at BYU (preseason, L 78-76)\n\nOct. 29: vs. Winston-Salem State (preseason, W 95-53)\n\nNov. 3: vs. Central Arkansas (W, 94-54)\n\nNov. 11: vs. Radford (W, 89-74)\n\nNov. 14: vs. NC Central (W, 97-53)\n\nNov. 25: vs. St. Bonaventure in Fort Myers (Florida) Tip-Off (W, 85-70)\n\nNov. 27: vs. Michigan State in Fort Myers (Fla.)

    "fullText": "Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts have claimed social media is intentionally addictive and harmful\n\nSocial media companies will have to answer to a jury – for the first time – for allegations that their products are intentionally addictive and harmful to young users’ mental health. Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.\n\nMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg is among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.\n\nThe initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap and TikTok have settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.\n\n“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nThe legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies from angry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”\n\nThe cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nThere’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.\n\nPlaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\n\nThe trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.\n\n“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thing Meta is doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.\n\nSocial media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however, catalogued compulsive use with severe consequences among young people, and legislators across the world are engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employee compared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.\n\nThe 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes, according to NPR.\n\nLegal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.\n\nStill, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”",

    "fullText": "From the person who scrolls on the toilet to the one without any social media, what do their digital habits tell us?\n\nWill Storr: we have lost so much of ourselves to smartphones – can we get it back?\n\nDayeon, 16: the teenager who spends less than an hour a day on screens\n\nI think my screen time is what adults want their kids to have. I’ve heard some of my friends’ parents tell them, “You should be like that, too.”\n\nI got my first phone when I was 12, as my mum wanted to be able to contact me to pick me up from school. When I got it, I had strict screen time rules: it was turned off after an hour. I still don’t use it much.\n\nI’m not on social media. Instagram and TikTok can lead to a lot of problems for your mental health. I’ve definitely seen friends get self-conscious; double-checking everything they say.\n\nSome friends spend more than six hours a day on social media. They use it to keep in touch and post nice pictures. After school, many scroll on Instagram late into the night, and it sometimes affects how focused they feel the next day. They tell me it’s a good thing I don’t have it so I can focus on school work. Sometimes I feel left out of their conversations, but it doesn’t really affect my relationships with them. They’re not intending to leave me out and they don’t judge me, they just think it’d be easier.\n\nIt is annoying when friends are on their phone while we are hanging out – scrolling on Instagram and talking about what they’re looking at. It’s boring. I don’t understand why people meet up in real life to then look at their phone.\n\nI worry that there’s so much online that’s trackable, which makes me feel uncomfortable. I was part of a dance group in elementary school when I was 10 and now videos of me dancing are still online – I didn’t even know they’d been posted. Even if I type my friends’ names into Google, I can see stuff they did when they were much younger. It’s scary, there’s no way to reset your past.\n\nNeither of my parents have social media. My dad uses screens up to 15 hours a day, because he is a software engineer and is constantly online. But if you took away his work, he probably uses them for around one hour a day for pleasure. My mum uses her phone for around five hours a day for watching shows.\n\nI don’t really worry if my screen time will go up in future. Right now, focusing on my school work and relationships is more important than being on social media. I think even when I am in university or working, I won’t doomscroll. CM\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 30 minutes-1 hour\nComputer None outside of school work\nTV None\n\nShere, 85: the octogenarian whose social life revolves around WhatsApp\n\nI like WhatsApping. Mostly I speak to my family and friends in Trinidad. In the morning I open my messages and say good morning to everyone; I try to find a nice image and emoji to send.\n\nThe phone hooks you in. I’m part of different WhatsApp groups, I’m in one called “Curry and Chips” with the boys. I’ve got TikTok and YouTube on my phone to watch videos they send; some are funny, a lot are rubbish. You get so engrossed. The other day I was making my porridge and it boiled over because I was on my phone.\n\nMy wife died earlier this year; we met when I was 14. Being on my phone doesn’t make me feel less lonely, but it helps me communicate with people, otherwise I don’t speak to anyone. I’ve joined three old people’s groups that operate locally. We organise meet-ups on WhatsApp and swap pictures. Once a week we get together to do some exercise and have breakfast.\n\nI watch westerns every day. My son just gave me a smart TV and I want to learn how to use YouTube on it, so I can find old calypsos. I find typing difficult, so I use Alexa to listen to music and the radio, and set alarms.\n\nThe phone is a must these days and older people need to learn to use it. Everything is online and we’re getting left behind. Doctors send messages online, and we need the NHS app to book appointments.\n\nI check the phone first thing in the morning and before I go to bed. I don’t want to miss texts confirming hospital appointments. I check every day, but then I get sucked into reading and sending messages. I’d like to learn how to use a computer or tablet.\n\nThe downside of the phone is it takes too much of my time. There’s so much rubbish. Some people send too many pictures – ducks in the park, things like that. I don’t need to see everything they do. I don’t like sitting down too much. I’d prefer to do more gardening or housework, and have more energy to spend on my exercise bike.\n\nI worry about the time I spend on my phone. I just get carried away reading messages from people – sometimes it seems as if they have nothing better to do. Also, I don’t like all the adverts and posts from people you don’t know on Instagram – I don’t know why they appear. The family don’t really comment on me using the phone – my son and granddaughter say I use it a lot, but they prefer that I’m active on it. It keeps us in touch. CM\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 3 hours\nComputer None\nTV 2 hours\n\nPippa, 29: the priest who’s big on TikTok\n\nAs a priest, I do see far more phones in church than you might expect. Luckily, my parishioners are very well trained, and I’ve never caught one scrolling during a service so far. But I have had funerals where people’s phones go off – you think, “Come on!”\n\nI’ve been making TikToks for about 18 months. It was my sister who suggested it and at first I was hesitant. We had TikTok accounts and watched other people’s content, but I’d never considered making my own. She said, “You should be a TikTok vicar!” but I thought it would be naff. Besides, in the first half of my curacy I was in a village and I wasn’t sure I’d find enough material. When I moved to my current church in a town, it seemed there was more of a buzz to tap into, and I softened to the idea. As a priest, I don’t think I should sit in church saying, “Well, where is everyone? Why haven’t they come to church this week?” This is a response to me thinking, “OK, where are people? How can I go and engage with them?”\n\nTo start with, it took me hours to film and edit each one, but it’s a pretty slick operation now. One of the first TikToks I made showed me at a Ministry of Sound event on a Saturday night, then cut to me leading a service the next morning – that’s had well over 2.2m views now, and I have more than 30,500 followers. It’s always difficult to tell which ones are going to be a hit – I thought the most recent one was hysterical, so it was a bit dispiriting to check after it had been up for a few hours and find it had only had 500 views. I think that’s just human nature – with anything you’ve worked on, it’s a good feeling to have people go, “Ooooh!!” I’ve seen people suggest a good way to build your followers is to post controversial stuff, even if you don’t believe it, but I think that would be so wrong.\n\nI am still quite bad for checking if each TikTok is getting likes and new followers, but the thing I am very strict about is not looking at the comments any more. On that Ministry of Sound post, for example, one said, “Girl, what in the lukewarm?” with a crying face emoji. “Lukewarm” was being used there as a denunciation, warning other Christians not to be like me, and that comment got close to 24,000 likes. Many people seemed to think it was a genuinely offensive thing for me to have done, though there were lots of positive comments, too. In fact, the event I went to began at 6pm and ended at nine – it wasn’t as if I was out partying all night.\n\nThere was still a story about it in the Sun, though I didn’t realise until the parish administrator messaged me with a link. I had to write an email to my bishop: “Dear Your Grace …” She was lovely about it, very supportive. I’ve since become friends with another vicar from my diocese, David Sims, who also posts on TikTok.\n\nI do spend time scrolling through other people’s TikToks – it’s my most used app, followed by Safari, which will just be me checking my emails, then YouTube, Instagram, WhatsApp.\n\nAs a single person who lives alone, it feels like the only socialising you can do sometimes is through a screen, even if FaceTime isn’t the way you want to do it. I open my Hinge app every evening, but unless I start messaging someone, I’ll just sift through people’s profiles with half an eye. I make a point of staying off my phone if I’m with friends or my parents – not just because it’s rude not to give people your full attention, but because when you don’t share a living space with someone, you appreciate the company more. In terms of my friends, my screen time is somewhere in the middle of the bell curve. I think I have quite a low threshold for looking at them – I get a bit of a headache if I do it for too long. Maybe my eyes aren’t used to it – my sister stares at a screen all day for her work, whereas I spend a lot of time talking to people face-to-face. I can feel it when I’ve hit that time; I think, “I need to switch off now and read a book.” CB\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone Up to 4 hours\nComputer 3 hours 10 minutes\nTV 1 hour (plus occasional bingeing)\n\nPaula, 40: the stay-at-home mother who is hooked on phone games\n\nFor me, screen time is a release from the routine – I live on a farm with kids aged 13 and five, so every day it’s house chores, kids bouncing around, dogs barking. Gaming is my “me” time – I play a war game called Puzzles & Chaos on my phone for around four hours a day, which involves strategically building kingdoms and attacking others. I only do it when I have pockets of time – dropping one kid off, picking the other up, making a coffee.\n\nSome friends look at me like I have two heads when I say I game. Because I’m 40, and have a busy life, they wonder why I don’t do other activities instead – but I work out every day, I’m an avid reader, and I have stacks of things to do in the house. Honestly, I don’t care what people think. I have racing thoughts 24/7. Gaming brings me some quiet. I’m challenging my brain while not thinking about other things. Sure, everything in excess is bad, but if you play the right amount of time, it’s stimulating.\n\nI don’t spend much time doing other things on screens, apart from some TV. I have Facebook, but social media is irrelevant and gets boring. It’s just people posting the same things – food, pictures of places, or just whining. The game is strategic and much more proactive. I crave something that fills my brain up other than just doomscrolling.\n\nI’m born and bred in Spain, where I was in the army. When I met my British husband, I left everything to build a life with him in the UK, but I don’t game because I’m lonely. I have lots of friends here. I’m just a selectively sociable person. Sometimes I make plans with friends, then two hours later I’m regretting it!\n\nIn the game I play, you can’t do anything individually, you have to join with other players to plan attacks and win points. We’ve created a community that’s amazing. My alliance is mostly women. I like that you can talk to other gamers with no judgment. Everyone has stuff going on at home – people who have lost a relative, or are recovering from an illness. We can message within the game, but can’t send screenshots, so we also use Discord and WhatsApp.\n\nI don’t get a dopamine rush when I game, or get too hyped up. Sometimes, winning and losing battles can affect my mood, but not in a big way. My friends in the game know that real life comes first. CM\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 4 hours\nComputer None\nTV 1 hour\n\nBarnaby, 43: the tech CEO who’s deeply offline\n\nI don’t generally look at a screen until after 10am. I’ve built “buffer time” into my mornings where I don’t have plans and don’t use any tech. I wake around 6.30am, spend time with my children, take a walk, exercise. For years, my mornings were a smartphone-induced blur – I used to be immediately checking the news, responding to emails or Slack messages. I always felt behind, even from the first minute of the day. Now, generally, the first time I engage with a screen is after I get to my office.\n\nEven there, I work off a paper to-do list. At the end of each week I write down the top five things I want to do the following week and use that as a guide. I used to have about 300 tasks on a content management system that I’d struggle to get through, but a bout of severe depression made me reassess how I worked.\n\nI suppose an unhealthy relationship with screens began when I started my first tech business, aged 17. It was a web hosting company. I would come home from college at 3pm and work on the business until 7am, then sleep for an hour and go back to college. By 2018 I was turning over millions with my second company,Time etc, and thought I’d cracked the code to work-life balance. Less than five years later, everything caught up with me and I had a “breakdown” of sorts. I was checking emails all day and well into the night. I was always available via instant messaging, and even when I wasn’t working I was doomscrolling the news. I became completely overwhelmed.\n\nThat was three years ago; eventually I saw I needed to get rid of my phone. I have hundreds of people who might need to contact me, so it wasn’t realistic to be completely offline, but I realised I could be more selective.\n\nNow, I don’t browse the internet. This means no news and no social media – I might look at my phone to play music, but otherwise it’s not a big part of my day any more. If there’s an important news story, I know someone will tell me about it eventually. In fact, I’ve ended up having these beautiful, curious conversations with people. For years I was like, “Yeah, I’ve seen that” whenever anyone mentioned a news story. Now, someone will say, “Did you see the budget?” and I’ll reply, “No, tell me about it, what is your opinion?” So I have a lot more rich, human, old-school conversations about the world than I ever did before.\n\nI only spend an hour a week on email. I don’t have email on my phone or MacBook, only my desktop. I complete as many tasks as I can in person or via a phone call.\n\nSlack was ruining my life – constant notifications, constant buzzing, someone always needed something – so I stopped using it. At first, my anxiety was really strong – “I need to be connected because something bad might happen.” I was addicted to scanning for messages for probably 25 years, so it was hard to just let go – but nothing bad happened when I freed myself from that habit. I’ve never missed an important update, and if the fact that I’m slower to reply annoys anyone, they haven’t told me about it.\n\nMy partner is fully supportive even if I’m not always contactable. I got out of a depression directly off the back of making these changes, so it’s been a huge net positive.\n\nI’ve found the time and space to do things with my children. My daughter and I are doing a painting project in her room, for instance – we just hang out and chat rubbish. My temper is at a different base to where it was when I was constantly behind and felt as if my phone was shouting at me from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep. AJ\n\nDaily screen time\nPhone 1 hour 30 minutes\nComputer Five to six hours\nTV None\n\nKatrina, 31: the social media manager who’s always online\n\nI’m reaching for my phone from the moment I open my eyes at 7am. I check the news, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, X and Facebook. I scroll as I brush my teeth and get dressed. I check emails and messages as I walk to the station and more news during my commute.\n\nAt work I’m triple screening – I switch between my phone, iPad and desktop. I count this as “giving my eyes a break” – they have recently started watering at random moments and I think it’s because I focus on a tiny screen for hours each day. Bigger screens and blue-blocking glasses help my eyes relax. I’ve had other physical effects from so much screen time, too – my back hurts, my shoulders hurt, I feel as if I’m getting a buffalo hump.\n\nMost of the time I feel shackled to my phone and it’s tragic. Adding up the hours of screentime is embarrassing, but it’s necessary in my industry. I take my phone to the bathroom so I can scroll on the toilet (I think most people do this, they just don’t admit it). And there are good parts – going viral feels amazing; waking up to a post that’s had 1m views overnight is a huge dopamine rush. In 2024, I organised a Harry Styles lookalike contest in London. It blew up, it made global news – that’s the power of social media.\n\nLike most people who make themselves visible online, I’ve been trolled. I’ve had death threats and some really personal comments about being in an interracial relationship. I read them all, I just don’t let them bother me. If someone says something mean to me online I just think, “That’s not real, so I don’t care.”\n\nFor a while I got into a habit of waking in the night to check news alerts – there was a period of rising tension between India and Pakistan which caused me a lot of anxiety. Now when I’m looking at my phone in bed, my husband will put his hands on my eyes and say, “It’s time to put your phone away.” Sometimes I just wait until he’s fallen asleep and get it back out.

    "fullText": "Need something brilliant to read this weekend? Here are six of our favourite pieces from the last seven days\n\nDecisions outsourced, chatbots for friends, the natural world an afterthought: Silicon Valley is giving us life void of connection. There is a way out, wrote Rebecca Solnit in this beautiful long read, but it’s going to take collective effort.\n\nA backlash against gentle parenting had been brewing for some time and some mothers on social media are advocating a tough, no-nonsense approach to parenting. Does this teach children important lessons – or just make them feel isolated and ashamed? Emine Saner on the rise of “Fafo” parenting.\n\nA special piece on Guardian cartoonists Ella Baron and Martin Rowson saw the pair face off, each producing very different cartoons in response to a prompt about Trump. We showed readers how two different generations of cartoonists operate: one in pixels, one in paint.\n\n“When I see washed-out photographs of English life in the 60s and 70s – cardiganed grandmothers eating roadside picnics beside Morris Minors, pale men sunbathing in shoes and socks on stripy deckchairs, Raleigh Choppers and caged budgerigars and faux leather pouffes – I feel a wave of what can’t properly be called nostalgia, because the last thing I’d want is to return to that age and those places where I was often profoundly unhappy and from which I’d have been desperate to escape if escape had been a possibility. Why then this longing, this echo of some remembered comfort?”\n\nThis remarkable piece of writing by Mark Haddon, author of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was an achingly sad exploration of a childhood shaped by his parents’ lack of warmth.\n\nAfter a very hard landing into fame in the 00s, he decided to take a softer approach – and hit on a winning formula for classic comedy with Detectorists. The actor spoke to Zoe Williams about his obsession with middle-age and the “PTSD” on rewatching his breakout role in The Office.\n\n“In recent years Patrick Bateman – specifically Christian Bale’s movie persona – has become a kind of aspirational figure for the very same men he was designed to mock …”\n\nAs the stage adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’s notorious and misunderstood bestseller returns to the London stage, Tim Jonze explored how its tale of 80s yuppie nihilism feels more relevant than ever in the era of Andrew Tate, Trump and tech bros.",

    "fullText": "It looks like 2026 could be a banger year for IPOs.\n\nAfter a slowdown in blockbuster public debuts, two of the most closely watched private tech companies are expected to go public this year: SpaceX and OpenAI.\n\nWhile reports last year suggested both companies would go public in 2026, recent developments have fueled speculation about when and how it could happen.\n\nAlso on Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported OpenAI was planning for an IPO in the fourth quarter as it races to beat Anthropic, an AI competitor, to market.\n\nHere's what smart people in tech and business are saying about the potential IPOs of two of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nChamath Palihapitiya, a prominent venture capitalist and former Facebook exec, said, \"A merger between SpaceX and Tesla would instantly create the Berkshire Hathaway of the modern century.\"\n\n\"The capital raising and operational efficiencies if both were together are obvious,\" Palihapitiya wrote on X. \"If this were to happen, it would also bring us one step closer to having one equity instrument for all things Elon, which many would want to buy.\"\n\nA merger between SpaceX and Tesla would instantly create the Berkshire Hathaway of the modern century.The capital raising and operational efficiencies if both were together are obvious. If this were to happen, it would also bring us one step closer to having one equity…\n\nEric Berger, the senior space editor at Ars Technica, said talks of a merger between SpaceX and xAI shouldn't be a \"huge surprise.\"\n\n\"If you believe AI is the future; and that compute is the major problem to solve; and orbital data centers are feasible—then the combined company would be a vertically integrated AI colossus,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe reported merger talks between SpaceX and xAI should not come as a huge surprise. If you believe AI is the future; and that compute is the major problem to solve; and orbital data centers are feasible—then the combined company would be a vertically integrated AI colossus.\n\nNoah Smith, a former Bloomberg journalist who now writes a popular economics substack, shared his concerns over OpenAI's future success in a post titled \"What if AI succeeds but OpenAI fails?\"\n\nAn OpenAI IPO will raise \"many more billions in cash, this time from regular investors,\" said Smith, but Sam Altman's company could be \"an early leader that flames out.\"\n\n\"Even if AI technology and the AI industry as a whole succeed wildly, OpenAI might not be the company that wins the race. That could leave a lot of investors holding the bag,\" he said.\n\n\"It could also cause a temporary — but unwarranted — chill in AI investment in the US, allowing Chinese companies to take the lead.\"\n\nRoss Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told The Information that he would not purchase SpaceX stock if the company goes public.\n\nSpaceX is \"not really a great business in the sense of profitability,\" said Gerber. \"To pay a trillion and a half dollars for a space company that does $15 billion in revenue is just insanity.\"\n\n\"If you're going to pay 2x or 3x just because it's Elon's company, I wish you the best of luck, and it's not something I am going to do,\" he said.",

Three capabilities underpin this shift: real time visibility into how work actually happens, digital twins that enable rapid experimentation without disrupting operations, and agentic AI systems that execute and adapt workflows. High-fidelity operational models replace simplified assumptions, giving leaders an accurate picture of current processes. Digital twins extend this visibility into a learning environment where new workflows, materials, and layouts can be tested at low risk, compressing validation cycles and increasing experimentation. Autonomous agents then handle execution tasks that require perception, prediction, and judgment, reducing coordination friction and allowing redesigned processes to operate with greater adaptability.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Smartwatches, Oura rings, smart home devices and Fitbits being weaponised, says Refuge\n\nDomestic abusers are increasingly using AI, smartwatches and other technology to attack and control their victims, a domestic abuse charity says.\n\nRecord numbers of women who were abused and controlled through technology were referred to Refuge’s specialist services during the last three months of 2025, including a 62% increase in the most complex cases to total 829 women. There was also a 24% increase in referrals of under-30s.\n\nRecent cases included perpetrators using wearable tech such as smartwatches, Oura rings and Fitbits to track and stalk women, disrupting their lives through smart home devices that control lights and heating, and using AI spoofing apps to impersonate people.\n\nEmma Pickering, head of the tech-facilitated abuse team at Refuge, said: “Time and again, we see what happens when devices go to market without proper consideration of how they might be used to harm women and girls. It is currently far too easy for perpetrators to access and weaponise smart accessories, and our frontline teams are seeing the devastating consequences of this abuse.\n\n“It is unacceptable for the safety and wellbeing of women and girls to be treated as an afterthought once a technology has been developed and distributed. Their safety must be a foundational principle shaping both the design of wearable technology and the regulatory frameworks that surround it.”\n\nRefuge said it was far too easy to access and weaponise smart accessories and that women’s safety needed to be factored into their design.\n\nOne survivor Refuge worked with, Mina, left behind her smartwatch in a rush to flee her abuser, who then used it to track her by using linked cloud accounts to locate her emergency accommodation.\n\n“[It] was deeply shocking and frightening. I felt suddenly exposed and unsafe, knowing that my location was being tracked without my consent. It created a constant sense of paranoia; I couldn’t relax, sleep properly, or feel settled anywhere because I knew my movements weren’t private,” she said.\n\nDespite police returning the device to Mina, she was located at her next refuge by a private investigator hired by her abuser, using suspected tracking via technology. She reported the breaches to police but was told no crime had been committed because she had “not come to any harm”.\n\n“I was repeatedly asked to move for my safety, rather than the technology being dealt with directly or the smart watch being confiscated from him. Each move made me feel more unstable and displaced,” she said.\n\n“Overall, the experience left me feeling unsafe, unheard, and responsible for managing a situation that was completely out of my control. It showed me how tech abuse can quietly and powerfully extend coercive control, and how easily survivors can be left to carry the emotional and practical burden when systems don’t fully understand or respond to it.”\n\nAbusers were also increasingly using AI tools to manipulate survivors, Pickering said. For example, they might alter a video of the survivor so that she appeared drunk, enabling them to tell social services that “she’s acting erratic again, slurring speech, she’s got a drink problem” and that she was therefore an unfit mother or a risk to herself and others. “We’ll see more and more of that as these videos and applications advance,” Pickering said.\n\nPickering said she had also heard of AI tools being used to develop authentic-looking fraudulent documents, for example job offers or legal summons, which can be sent to survivors to make them believe they are in debt, or to persuade them to turn up to the same location as their abuser.\n\nPickering feared that in coming years, medical tech would increasingly be misused, for example by controlling insulin levels through a diabetes tracker, which can be fatal.\n\nShe urged the government to act on digital technology-enabled and online crimes, including providing more funding to develop and train digital investigations teams. “They want short-term wins, they don’t want to think about longer-term investment in this area, but if we don’t do that we’ll never get ahead,” she said.\n\nShe also wants to see the technology industry held to account for failing to ensure devices and platforms are designed and function in ways that are safe for vulnerable people.\n\n“Ofcom and the Online Safety Act don’t go far enough,” she said.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Tackling violence against women and girls in all its forms, including when it takes place online or is facilitated by technology, is a top priority for this government.\n\n“Our new VAWG strategy sets out how the full power of the state will be deployed online and offline. We are working with Ofcom to set out how online platforms tackle the disproportionate abuse women and girls face online.”",

It also urged the establishment of a licensing regime in the UK allowing publishers to negotiate with tech companies over the use of their content in AI news.\n\n“If AI companies are going to profit from journalism and shape what the public sees, they must be required to pay fairly for the news they use and operate under clear rules that protect plurality, trust and the long-term future of independent journalism,” said Roa Powell, senior research fellow at IPPR and the report’s co-author.\n\nThe IPPR said work on licensing could begin with the UK’s competition regulator using its new enforcement powers over Google. The Competition and Markets Authority this week proposed giving web publishers and news organisations the power to stop Google scraping their content for its overviews. Collective licensing deals would ensure a wide range of publishers were included, the IPPR added.\n\nGoogle’s AI overviews now reach 2 billion users a month and approximately a quarter of people use AI to get information, according to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.\n\n“With the right policies in place, the government can shape this market so that UK news organisations transition their business models for the AI age and AI companies improve the reliability of their products by drawing on trusted sources,” said the report.\n\nIPPR tested four AI tools – ChatGPT, Google AI overviews, Google Gemini and Perplexity – by entering 100 news-related queries into those platforms and analysing more than 2,500 links produced by the AI responses.\n\nChatGPT and Gemini did not cite journalism by the BBC, which has blocked the bots they use to assemble answers, while overviews and Perplexity used BBC content despite the broadcaster’s objections to those tools using its journalism.\n\nThe IPPR found the Telegraph, GB News, the Sun and the Daily Mail were cited in fewer than 4% of answers on ChatGPT, while the Guardian – which has a licensing deal with ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI – was used as a source in nearly six out of 10 responses. The Financial Times, which also has a licensing deal with OpenAI, also featured highly. The Guardian was also the most common source used by Gemini, appearing in half of all answers.\n\nGoogle’s use of AI summaries at the top of search results has affected click-through traffic for publishers, with a knock-on effect for their revenues, because many users read the overview without moving on to the original journalism.\n\nThe IPPR said questions needed to be asked about how financial relationships between AI companies and news providers shaped answers.\n\n“If licensed publications appear more prominently in AI answers, there is a risk of locking out smaller and local news providers, who are less likely to get AI deals,” the report said.\n\nIPPR added that while licensing deals could replace lost advertising revenues to an extent, they would not maintain a healthy news ecosystem. They could make news organisations dependent on tech giants for revenue and that income could easily disappear if copyright protections are weakened, said the thinktank.\n\nThe IPPR said there should be public funding to create new business models for investigative news and local news, whose sustainability could be threatened by the rise of AI news, and for the BBC to “innovate with AI”.",

    "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook says a global memory chip shortage is beginning to bite, with rising costs expected to pressure margins ahead.",
    "fullText": "The global memory chip shortage is catching up with Apple, Tim Cook says.\n\nThe Apple CEO said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that Apple is beginning to feel the effects of the memory shortage crisis, with rising prices expected to put pressure on margins ahead.\n\nThe warning comes amid blockbuster demand for Apple's newest products. Customer response to the latest iPhone lineup \"exceeded our expectations,\" with iPhone revenue jumping 23%, Cook said on the call Thursday.\n\nApple reported revenue of $143.76 billion and earnings per share of $2.84, beating analyst estimates.\n\nThe staggering iPhone demand left Apple exiting the December quarter with \"very lean\" inventory, pushing the company into what Cook described as \"supply chase mode.\"\n\nCook said the biggest constraint is the limited access to advanced chipmaking nodes used to produce Apple's system-on-a-chip processors. Higher demand has also reduced flexibility across Apple's supply chain, he said.\n\nMemory shortages played a minimal role in Apple's December-quarter margins, but their impact is expected to grow, Cook added.\n\nThe company expects memory costs to weigh more heavily on margins in the second quarter, contributing to its forecast gross margin range of 48% to 49%. Apple posted a gross margin of about 48% in the December quarter.\n\n\"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.\"\n\nApple's stock price rose about 2% after hours following the results on Thursday.\n\nCook's comments come as the tech industry grapples with a worsening global shortage of memory chips.\n\nAI companies, smartphone makers, and PC manufacturers are competing for the same pool of memory components, which are critical not just for consumer electronics but also for powering large language models and other AI systems. That surge in demand has sent prices climbing.\n\nAt CES 2026 last month, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the memory storage market as \"completely unserved.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nThe Korea Economic Daily reported in January that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are seeking server DRAM price hikes of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Market analysis firm Counterpoint also said last month that memory prices could climb as much as 40% through the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\nThe rapid buildout of AI infrastructure marks a break from the industry's traditional \"boom-and-bust cycles.\"\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "title": "I was laid off by Amazon and landed a new role 2 weeks later. Here's my advice for other laid-off tech workers.",
    "description": "After being laid off by Amazon in October 2025, Iren Azra Zou landed a new job two weeks later. She shared her top advice for other laid-off workers.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Iren Azra Zou, a 27-year-old in New Jersey. She is a founding engineer at tech startup Double Nickel, and previously worked as a software engineer at Amazon until being laid off in October 2025. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe day before Amazon announced layoffs in October, there were rumors that something big was coming.\n\nI had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be affected, even though I felt I was performing well and had met my goals earlier than expected. I'd been laid off from my previous tech job the year prior, in 2024, and I knew how, in situations like these, people can quickly become just numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\nIt was hard to sleep that night, and the next morning, I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off, which the message soon confirmed.\n\nThe first person I told was my husband, who was next to me in bed. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers to figure out who else had been affected. When I found out that some rock stars on my team had also been laid off, I was shocked.\n\nI was mentally prepared for my layoff — due to the speculation that cuts were coming — but I was also financially prepared.\n\nMy husband and I had taken steps to save aggressively and ensure we had enough savings to last for a while if we were both laid off. That financial cushion helped me stay calm when I found out I'd lost my job.\n\nI made a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, and sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic.\n\nI quickly started looking for new job opportunities, and two weeks later, I landed and accepted an offer to start a software engineering role in December.\n\nHere's my advice for anyone who's recently been laid off:\n\nWhen you get laid off, you can't help but ask yourself, \"Why me?\"\n\nEventually, you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table; a layoff didn't erase that.\n\nI was prepared for interviewers to ask about my Amazon layoff, but it didn't really come up. I think other companies recognized the scale of the layoff and that it wasn't performance-based, in many cases. I also think that, despite the layoff, having a household name like Amazon on my résumé was probably helpful.\n\nReflect on what you want in your next role and create a targeted job search plan to maximize your chances of landing it. I wanted to make sure I found the right fit, so this was really helpful for me.\n\nUpon reflection, I decided that the best fit for me might be at a smaller company with less bureaucracy than Amazon — and where I could better see the impact of my work.\n\nThe pro of working at a big company was that you could do one thing and it could affect millions of people in less than 30 minutes, which was exciting. However, the downside was that it sometimes felt like you were a very tiny piece in a giant machine.\n\nI was also hoping to land a remote role. For the last few months of my time at Amazon, I'd been required to commute one hour each way from New Jersey to the New York City office five days a week, which was really draining. I figured I might have more leverage to ask for remote flexibility at a smaller company than at Amazon, where so many people are competing for job postings.\n\nMy team at Amazon also didn't have many women, so I wanted to be in a place with a bit more diversity.\n\nI narrowed down my target: a software engineering role at a small company that offered remote flexibility — and where I felt I could grow and thrive.\n\nThis is not the time to be shy — most people will be sympathetic and eager to support you.\n\nI believe my LinkedIn presence — where I'm very active, posting career advice tailored to young professionals — helped me boost my visibility.\n\nThe day after my layoff, the chief technology officer of Double Nickel — a tech startup focused on truck driver recruitment — reached out to me on LinkedIn about a software engineering role they were hiring for. She said she'd seen my post-layoff LinkedIn post and, as a former Amazon employee herself, decided to reach out.\n\nThe role seemed like a good fit, so I applied and quickly landed an interview.\n\nFollowing the interviews, I was given an offer, which I accepted. We agreed to an arrangement where I'd work in a hybrid setup for the first few months to help with onboarding, and then transition to remote work around the end of February. So far, I'm very happy with the role.\n\nLooking back, I see the layoff as a turning point because it helped me clarify what I wanted in my next role. It was still a difficult experience, but I felt more grounded and optimistic as time went on — and ultimately landed a role I feel great about.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX and xAI are in discussions to merge ahead of a blockbuster public offering planned for later this year. The combination would bring Musk’s rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and Grok AI chatbot under one roof, according to a person briefed on the matter and two ​recent company filings seen by Reuters.\n\nHow could space-based data centers reduce AI costs?\n\nWhat would the proposed SpaceX-xAI merger involve?\n\nWhat defense applications are planned for merged companies?\n\nWhy is Musk combining his different business ventures?\n\nThe plan, which Reuters is reporting exclusively, would give fresh momentum to SpaceX’s effort to launch data centers into orbit as Musk battles for supremacy in the rapidly ‌escalating AI race against tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI.\n\nMusk, the world's richest man, is the CEO of both the private space company SpaceX and the artificial intelligence company xAI, which controls his social media platform X. He also runs electric automaker Tesla, tunnel ‌company The Boring Co. and neurotechnology company Neuralink.\n\nMusk, SpaceX, and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnder the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX. Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction, the person said.\n\nCorporate filings in Nevada show that those entities were set up on January 21. One of them, a limited liability company, lists SpaceX and Bret Johnsen, the company's chief financial officer, as managing members, while the other lists Johnsen as the company's only officer, the filings show.\n\nThe filings don't contain additional information about the purpose of the companies ⁠or their role in any deal.\n\nJohnsen did not respond to a Reuters ‌request for comment.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential, said that some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal. A final agreement, however, hasn't been signed, and the timing and structure of the transaction remain fluid, the person cautioned.\n\nSpaceX is already the world's most ‍valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reuters and other media have reported that SpaceX plans to go public some time this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion.\n\nThrough xAI, Musk is building out a massive supercomputer for AI training in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI as part of the startup’s $5 billion equity ​fundraising, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.",

    "description": "Professor Erik Gordon said the \"AI bubble is almost as big as the planet Jupiter,\" and Microsoft's stock drop is a \"warning of the burst to come.\"",
    "fullText": "Rampant speculation and massive overinvestment in AI have created a financial threat of cosmic proportions — and the fallout will be catastrophic, Erik Gordon has warned.\n\n\"The AI bubble is almost as big as the planet Jupiter,\" Gordon, an entrepreneurship professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said in a Wednesday email to Business Insider.\n\n\"When it bursts, the debris will be everywhere,\" he continued. \"Big, institutional investors will be hit with it, and so will individual investors who bet the bubble would get even bigger.\"\n\nGordon pointed to Microsoft stock, which tumbled more than 6% after the software giant's earnings beat on Wednesday. It was trading around 12% lower at 12:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, marking one of the sharpest intraday declines in the company's history.\n\nMicrosoft's shares sank \"because of the truckloads of cash it is investing in AI,\" Gordon said. \"That is a warning of the burst to come.\"\n\nThe cloud-computing titan's net cash used in investing surged 95% year-on-year to over $57 billion in the six months to December. That was fueled by its addition of $49 billion worth of property and equipment such as data centers.\n\nPrior to their post-earnings slump, Microsoft's shares had roughly doubled since the start of 2023, lifting the company's market value to over $3.5 trillion.\n\nOther AI stocks have surged even faster over that timeframe. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia have vaulted 13-fold, valuing the company at close to $4.7 trillion — more than 20 times its projected revenue for the fiscal year ended January 25.\n\nPalantir stock has jumped about 25-fold, giving the data-analysis company a $375 billion market value, or around 85 times its forecasted revenue for 2025.\n\nGordon told Business Insider in an email last week that he doesn't expect the AI bubble to burst in the next few months, as investors still have enough cash to \"prop it up,\" and technological advances remain \"exciting enough to distract\" from irrational valuations.\n\nThe veteran professor has previously rung the alarm on an \"order-of-magnitude overvaluation bubble,\" and warned that when it pops, the \"suffering will be more painful\" for investors than the aftermath of the dot-com bubble. But stocks have largely defied his warnings and continued to march higher.",

    "fullText": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin is one of the many California-based billionaires pouring millions into donations ahead of the state's proposed wealth tax.\n\nBrin, along with other tech executives, venture capitalists, and philanthropists, donated a combined $35 million to ballot measure committees in January, supporting affordable housing ballots in California, per a disclosure seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe disclosure was filed by the coalition \"Building a Better California.\"\n\nBrin was the largest contributor in the filing, donating $20 million. Others donated large sums on various days in January, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and PayPal CEO Max Levchin, who donated $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nOthers in the list include DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, and Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr.\n\nBrin's multimillion-dollar donation comes ahead of California's vote on a measure that would levy a one-time, 5% tax on billionaires in the state. The tax, due in 2027, would be imposed retroactively from January 1 this year.\n\nGroups like the one Brin donated to are part of a concerted push by billionaires to negate the need for the wealth tax, either by funding alternative programs or by funneling money into political action committees opposed to the measure.\n\nReactions to the potential tax have been mixed. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he's \"perfectly fine\" with it, saying this month that Silicon Valley's talent pool was worth any taxes.\n\nHowever, other executives have taken a more defensive stance. Brin and Google's other cofounder, Larry Page, moved an LLC they are both tied to from California to Delaware in December.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said the tax would be \"horrendous\" for innovation. White House AI czar David Sacks said the tax, if enacted, would be akin to an \"asset seizure.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that Palantir's chairman, Peter Thiel, donated $3 million to the California Business Roundtable in December, which has directly opposed the wealth tax.\n\nRepresentatives for the executives did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "For years, tech work was plentiful, especially for those with big names on their resumes. Today, layoffs are up and opportunities are scarce.",
    "fullText": "New year, new layoffs — and Big Tech workers who spent their careers being courted by recruiters are in for a nasty reality.\n\nOn Wednesday, Amazon said it would cut around 16,000 corporate jobs globally. It's the second round of layoffs since October, when the company eliminated 14,000 roles. Earlier this month, Meta cut about 1,500 employees in its Reality Labs division.\n\nJanuary is historically a common month for companies to shed workers as they reassess budgets and plan for the year ahead. January 2024 saw more than 34,000 tech layoffs across 123 companies, according to the online tracker Layoffs.fyi — a monthly total that hasn't been exceeded since.\n\nHowever, tech workers don't typically face a job market this challenging. US businesses are hiring at one of the lowest rates since 2013, and tech job postings have plunged amid economic uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption.\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken with dozens of laid-off workers — including people from Big Tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Many told me they'd built their careers in a tech landscape where job security could be elusive, but opportunities were plentiful. Some said finding a new role used to be as simple as opening LinkedIn and replying to the recruiters who regularly flooded their inboxes.\n\nNow, despite impressive résumés and big-name credentials, many laid-off tech workers are struggling to land their next roles.\n\nLast year, US tech companies announced roughly 154,000 layoffs, per Challenger, 15% more than in 2024 and the most of any private-sector industry. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla each announced plans in recent years to cut at least 10,000 employees.\n\nThis adds up to too many workers flooding the market and not enough jobs. It's affected people like James Hwang, who has struggled to find work since being laid off from his IT support engineering role at Amazon in October. Although his résumé sports years of experience at Amazon, he said it's not as helpful as one might think.\n\n\"It felt like there was this huge brick wall from the get-go,\" said Hwang, who's 28 and lives in Michigan. \"I applied to 100 jobs but didn't get any interviews.\"\n\nWorkers in Hwang's line of work have had abundant job opportunities in years past, but now tech companies are getting leaner and expecting more. They're rightsizing after overhiring during the pandemic, taking longer to fill roles, and citing a need to be more efficient in the AI age. At the same time, the US has seen a decline in tech openings, down 33% on Indeed from early 2020 levels as of December.\n\n\"It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman,\" said Mody Khan, who has been looking for work since losing his Microsoft job in December 2024. He said he's depleted much of his savings and fears he could lose his home.\n\nDespite a five-year run at Microsoft, he said, even landing interviews has been difficult. Among the many challenges he's faced during his job search, Khan said, is that some companies he's interviewed with have seemed to favor candidates with startup backgrounds — making his time at a large tech firm feel like a disadvantage in those cases.\n\nTech workers who've experienced layoffs throughout their careers consistently pointed to one challenge that stands out in today's market: the sheer level of competition.\n\nSriram Ramkrishna was laid off from Intel for a second time last July and has been looking for work ever since. He said he has a clearer sense of his career identity than after his first layoff in 2016, but that the job market is more competitive than anything he's ever experienced.\n\n\"If an employer I'm interested in posts a job, there's bound to be at least 400 applicants,\" said Ramkrishna, who's in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon.\n\nWhile most laid-off workers I've spoken with have faced more challenging job searches than they expected, others have eventually found work.\n\nWhen Deborah Henderson was laid off from Microsoft after 14 years, she shared the news on LinkedIn and helped start a Discord group for other affected colleagues. She said connecting with others provided emotional support and helped surface new job opportunities — including a referral for a role at Meta that she landed just two months after being laid off.\n\n\"It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows,\" said Hendersen, who's in her 40s and lives in Seattle.\n\nMike Kostersitz, on the other hand, struggled to find a new role after 31 years at Microsoft. He felt like a fish out of water in the job market, so he decided to hire a career coach to help him build a résumé, update his LinkedIn profile, draft cover letters, and tailor his materials for applicant tracking systems.\n\nIn particular, he added, it was difficult to know which parts of his Microsoft experience to highlight in interviews.\n\n\"It's like, I have 30 years of stories for you. Which one do you want to hear?\" said Kostersitz, who's in his 60s and lives in Washington state.\n\nKostersitz said he eventually expanded his search to tech roles at large corporations outside Big Tech. After six months, he landed a role at Nike.\n\nHis top piece of advice for job seekers is something he first heard from a career advisor provided through Microsoft's layoff package: develop a solid job search strategy — and stick with it.\n\n\"They said it's a game of chicken right now. The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job.\"",

    "description": "Jide Adebowale navigated a challenging job market after leaving his federal job in 2025. He ultimately found a tech role in Northern Virginia.",
    "fullText": "My 2025 was dominated by the tough decision to leave my job with the federal government in February. After signing the paperwork and moving on, I began thinking about what was next.\n\nI enjoyed some time off and dipped my toes back into the job market. I took occasional recruiter calls and experimented with freelance writing while spending time in Mexico City and Rio.\n\nSuddenly, headlines about a softening job market began to stack up. A year later, many of those same concerns still dominate the conversation. As coverage of layoffs, hiring freezes, and longer job searches became more common, I put my foot on the accelerator.\n\nI now work as a compensation analyst in the tech sector, but I had to expand my search to find this job.\n\nPrevious job searches had taught me the importance of patience and resilience. It's a numbers game. Leverage your network. The right opportunity is out there. I appreciated those general truths going in.\n\nWhen I encountered the familiar dance of recruiters who seemed enthusiastic and then went silent, I was prepared for it. Even an especially eye-roll-worthy sequence with an exciting tech company didn't throw me off: an interview scheduled and canceled at the last minute, a later request to reschedule, a coding assignment completed, and then no response.\n\nWhat proved far more difficult was the uncertainty behind it all. I couldn't tell which signals mattered. Was the job market softening because of tariffs? Because of AI? Were we heading toward a recession? Was white-collar work itself undergoing a more permanent shift? Was a referral the only way to get a job? I wasn't sure what information to anchor to.\n\nLiving in New York City at the time, I knew I was in a competitive job market, but I also assumed it was abundant. Even if there were millions of job seekers in New York, I thought there would be millions of jobs to match them. I began to wonder whether that assumption actually held.\n\nThe idea that I would find my next role in New York had been a fundamental part of my decision to leave the government in the first place, but over time, the signals I saw began to complicate that picture.\n\nI read an article that said New York City hadn't added any new jobs in the first half of the year. Having just left a role analyzing job gains and losses across the country, I was aware of how uneven labor markets could be.\n\nI also found myself thinking about my parents and how often they had moved for work. First from Nigeria, and then multiple times within the US, they had never anchored their decisions to a single city. They went where opportunity was. City preference came second.\n\nI still had no desire to leave New York. I loved the city, but as my buyout runway shortened, I needed a new approach.\n\nIt was time to run a labor market experiment.\n\nAt first, my expansion was modest. I looked at Philadelphia, where rent was cheaper, and Chicago, which seemed like New York lite.\n\nThe responses began to pick up. What started as a regional adjustment quickly became a national search. The Sun Belt felt abundant. Interview invites began to come from companies in Phoenix, Houston, and Nashville.\n\nMomentum was building. Geography was no longer a limiting factor. I continued applying in New York, but the priority had shifted. I wasn't optimizing for location anymore. I was optimizing for the best opportunity.\n\nI hadn't initially included Washington, D.C., in my expanded search because I knew firsthand how many federal employees were newly seeking work.\n\nWhat I didn't fully appreciate was how much the D.C. job market had evolved over the years. D.C. wasn't just a government town anymore; it was home to a rapidly growing concentration of banking and technology jobs, both within the city and in Northern Virginia.\n\nAfter weighing several cities, recruiter conversations, and potential paths forward, I accepted a new role as a compensation analyst at a tech company in Northern Virginia, which was a lateral move for me.\n\nAfter years of analyzing jobs and wages across industries and regions for the federal government, I would now be applying that lens inside a single organization, focused more narrowly on how compensation decisions play out in practice within a fast-moving, technology-driven business. The search was officially over.\n\nMany of the articles I'd read about the job market focused on how difficult things had become for new college graduates. Having just gone through a challenging search myself, I could appreciate that reality.\n\nWhat stood out to me was how central geographic mobility had been to my own outcome, even with several years of experience at a well-respected government agency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to lean on.\n\nMoving isn't an option for everyone, and I resisted it at first, but it struck me as a lever that younger workers could consider. Data shows people move far less frequently than they once did, even as opportunities have spread across more regional labor markets. Historically, going where opportunity is has been one of the most reliable ways to create a new path forward, and it turned out to be the key to my search.\n\nI live in D.C. and commute to Northern Virginia. I found the cost-of-living adjustment relatively manageable compared with New York. Citywide salaries are only modestly lower, while rents are noticeably lower, and the rental market feels much more favorable to tenants. Finding an apartment was relatively easy for me.\n\nThe past year was defined by transition; the next will be about building. I plan to spend most of 2026 getting settled into my new job and life in D.C.",

    "description": "Leonis Capital founders Jenny Xiao and Jay Zhao tell Business Insider what they ask AI startup founders to evaluate their tech.",
    "fullText": "If you hadn't heard, there's an AI race sweeping through Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile stalwarts like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, and newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, are grabbing the headlines as they unveil model after model, there are plenty of startups trying to find a foothold.\n\nFor investors, it can be hard to tell which of these upstarts have true technical potential and which are likely to fade into tech oblivion.\n\nThat's part of why Jenny Xiao, the cofounder of Leonis Capital, said it's important for venture capitalists to get serious about understanding the AI technology they're investing in.\n\nLeonis Capital, founded in 2021, is now deploying its second $40 million fund. The venture capital firm is focused on next-generation AI companies and has invested in over a dozen since its launch, including MaintainX, Motion, and SpectroCloud.\n\nBusiness Insider asked Xiao and her cofounder, Jay Zhao, to share the top five questions they ask founders when evaluating their tech. They shared their responses over email, which have been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nThe best founders don't think in terms of incremental feature improvements — they think in capability thresholds. We're looking for whether they understand that progress in AI is often non-linear, and whether they can anticipate which future capabilities might fundamentally change or even break their product.\n\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from our Leonis AI 100 — where we benchmarked the most important AI startups — is that the strongest AI founders build just ahead of the next technical breakthrough.\n\nA good answer talks about entirely new workflows that get unlocked, not just marginal efficiency gains, and clearly explains how the company would adapt or pivot as the technology evolves.\n\nMost AI startups don't fail because they're bad, but because they're building something that OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google can eventually ship \"for free\" as a feature.\n\nThat's why we don't accept \"they're not focused on this\" as an answer. We push founders to explain what internal constraint would actually prevent a foundation model lab from building the same thing. If the answer comes down to focus or culture, that's not a real moat.\n\nStrong answers acknowledge that the big labs technically could build it, but doing so would break their incentive structure, pricing, or distribution model; require operational complexity that doesn't scale for them; or shift value to downstream execution rather than model capability.\n\nSome founders can also credibly argue they have a 12- to 18-month head start. Weak answers, by contrast, lean on claims like being \"more vertical,\" having \"more niche data,\" or understanding customers better — responses we hear from about 95% of founders.\n\nWe've noticed a consistent pattern: Most founders underestimate foundation models, and most VCs underestimate them even more.\n\nAsking \"How much proprietary data do you have?\" is usually the wrong question, since no early-stage company has truly meaningful data. And if a founder's pitch boils down to \"we have more data, therefore our models are better,\" that's a red flag: foundation models often improve faster than proprietary ones, and the companies building them have enough capital to buy data and quickly close any gaps.\n\nWhat matters much more is not how much data exists today, but whether the product naturally generates better data over time. For example, industrial systems where data only emerges once software is embedded in workflows, or products where switching costs come from accumulated context.\n\nWe ask this question to understand where defensibility actually lives once code becomes commoditized. If a founder can't answer it clearly, they likely don't understand their own moat.\n\nCosmetic advantages like code, UI, or models are easy to copy, while structural advantages — such as being a system of record or being embedded into compliance, audits, or standard operating procedures — are much harder to replicate.\n\nThe question also reveals founder temperament: Strong founders are candid about their vulnerabilities (\"Here's what we're most worried about\"), while weaker ones tend to get defensive and insist a threat \"would never happen.\"\n\nThis question forces founders to explain their earliest technical decisions and the trade-offs they intentionally made, revealing whether they understand system dynamics rather than just iterating on features.\n\nStrong answers sound like, \"We chose to execute actions, not just make suggestions, which increased liability but created real lock-in,\" or \"We became the system of record instead of a thin layer, which slowed integrations and sales early but made switching organizationally expensive later.\" By contrast, many founders default to saying they want to \"stay flexible,\" which often signals they haven't yet designed anything fundamental.\n\nThe best AI systems are opinionated by design, deliberately removing degrees of freedom and hard-coding assumptions about workflows, authority, or data flow.\n\nReal insight usually comes from abandoning old assumptions. This question helps distinguish founders who simply stumbled into AI from those who experienced a genuine shift in how they see the world.\n\nWe're looking for intellectual flexibility, not credentials. Strong answers point to a specific belief the founder once held, why they believed it, and what changed their mind; weak answers stay vague, like saying they \"realized AI was going to be big.\"\n\nThis question assumes copying is possible and pushes founders to explain what isn't obvious. Shallow answers fall back on claims like \"they couldn't move as fast\" or \"they don't have our data,\" while stronger ones point to hard-to-see advantages such as deep operational knowledge, customer-specific integrations, or accumulated context that isn't visible from the outside.\n\nFounders who can't point to moments where they changed their mind usually aren't learning — they're executing a fixed plan in a world that won't stay fixed.\n\nThis question reveals epistemic humility and whether a founder is genuinely truth-seeking or just looking for confirmation. AI moves too fast for people who can't update, and we're especially wary of founders who treat every pivot as vindication rather than correction.\n\nMarket timing, regulatory shifts, and platform dependencies kill far more startups than bad management. This question tests whether founders think probabilistically about external forces and whether they've designed for resilience instead of relying on luck.\n\nFounders who say \"nothing\" haven't thought hard enough. The ones we want to back can name several concrete external risks and explain how they're hedging against them.\n\nThe best founders aren't contrarian for its own sake, but they can hold an unpopular position long enough for the world to catch up.",

    "description": "Hiking subscriptions, making robots, and selling fewer cars? Tesla is acting like a tech company in more ways than one.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has long insisted Tesla isn't a car company. After its latest earnings, it looks less like one than ever.\n\nThe billionaire told investors that Tesla would scrap its Model S and X EVs and convert their production lines to build the company's Optimus humanoid robot, as it continues to shift toward AI and robotics.\n\nTesla also said it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI and to evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with Musk's AI startup.\n\nIt came as the company's financial disclosures painted a stark picture of the troubles facing its EV business, which saw sales decline for the second year in a row in 2025.\n\nTesla beat Wall Street's expectations, but reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue and said profits fell by 46% last year, while revenue from car sales fell by 11% year-over-year in the last quarter.\n\nExecutives largely shrugged off the headwinds, with Musk and other top employees reiterating in the analyst Q&A their belief that autonomous vehicles will shortly render traditional forms of transport obsolete.\n\n\"The vast majority of miles traveled will be autonomous in the future,\" said Musk, in response to an investor question asking about Tesla's plans to launch new models.\n\n\"I'm just guessing, but probably less than 5% of miles driven will be where somebody's actually driving the car themselves in the future, maybe as low as 1%,\" he added.\n\nInvestors reacted positively, with Tesla shares rising around 3% after hours following earnings.\n\nThe reaction is another sign of how, for many investors, vehicle sales have become a sidenote to Tesla's future, as the company executes an ambitious shift toward a new business model built on robotics, AI, and software services.\n\n\"They're definitely moving away from an automotive-oriented company to a tech-oriented company,\" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, told Business Insider prior to Tesla's earnings. '\"This is a company that's looking to get away from vehicle sales as the focus of their revenue.\"\n\nElon Musk has long said that Tesla should be thought of as an AI and robotics company, not a carmaker. Investors have agreed, driving Tesla's market cap to $1.35 trillion, more than every other US carmaker combined.\n\nEven before Tesla's latest AI-focused earnings, there were signs that the company had begun to act more like the tech giant Musk dreams of.\n\nThe company overhauled its autonomy offerings in recent weeks, removing the option to buy its premium Full Self-Driving software for a one-off fee of $8,000 and making it subscription-only.\n\nTesla also killed its basic Autopilot tier, which previously came free on almost all its vehicles, instead replacing it with a more limited form of cruise control. Musk also indicated in a post on X that Tesla owners can expect FSD prices to rise beyond the $99-per-month subscription fee as the technology improves.\n\nPhasing out free features and hiking subscription prices is classic tech giant behavior, and the moves quickly sparked backlash from Tesla fans and customers on social media. Analysts told Business Insider the changes were likely aimed at driving adoption of FSD and monetizing the existing user base.\n\n\"I think it's about monetizing FSD. I think they're going to look at more ways to monetize what I view as services, autonomous, and really disruptive technology within their installments,\" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities and a longtime Tesla Bull, told Business Insider ahead of earnings.\n\nMusk has described FSD as crucial to Tesla's future, but the company has struggled to get drivers to pay for it. In October, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja told investors that just 12% of Tesla owners have bought FSD.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taneja said that 1.1 million customers had bought FSD, but added that nearly 70% of those purchases were upfront rather than subscription.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key milestone for Musk's $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to hit 10 million active FSD subscriptions by 2035 for the Tesla CEO to unlock the full payout.\n\nThe most critical part of Tesla's transition to a tech company is its robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot initiatives, which Musk has said will eventually make Tesla the world's most valuable company.\n\nTom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Business Insider that nearly 75% of his long-term valuation of the company was based on robotics and autonomous vehicles, with just 8% coming from car sales. Ives put that figure at 80-90%, adding that he viewed Tesla as an \"autonomous and robotics company\" moving forward.\n\n\"That's why this is such a key transition year for Musk and Tesla. Any delays in autonomous or robotaxis are going to be heavily scrutinized because that's the key to the valuation,\" Ives added.\n\nTesla launched its robotaxi service in Austin last June, and recently began offering some public rides without a safety driver. However, its service in the Texan city is still small, with around 50 active vehicles, according to a community tracker run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna.\n\nMusk said on Wednesday that Tesla would have robotaxis operating in \"somewhere between a quarter and half\" of the US by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval, and the company is set to begin production on its dedicated Cybercab robotaxi in April.\n\nIves added that Tesla's focus this year would be on building out its robotaxi service, noting he didn't expect the company to begin collecting \"meaningful revenue\" from autonomous ride-hailing until 2027.\n\n\"It's important that they get into what I believe will probably be roughly about 30 cities this year. 2026 is the build-out of robotaxis, 2027 is where you'll start to see more monetization,\" Ives said.\n\nOnce Tesla's robotaxi service reaches escape velocity, Narayan said he expects it to transform the company's business model from a traditional carmaker into a high-margin services business more akin to Uber.\n\n\"It dramatically transforms the current auto business, which is a capital-intensive, low-margin business, into a high-margin, much higher revenue business,\" he said. \"The market is bigger and the economics are far better.\"\n\nExecuting that transition will be expensive. Taneja, Tesla's CFO, said on Wednesday that the company expects to spend more than $20 billion this year on new production lines and AI compute infrastructure.\n\nFor Tesla's beleaguered EV business, things look unlikely to improve anytime soon.\n\nAlthough Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market in the US, the end of the $7,500 tax credit in September has caused that market to slow dramatically, with rivals Ford and GM canceling electric models and taking billions of dollars in charges amid warnings of an EV winter.\n\nOutside of the US, Tesla is losing market share to Chinese carmakers such as BYD, which now dominate China's booming EV market and are growing rapidly in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nAutoForecast Solutions' Fiorani said that Tesla ran the risk of a bumpy transition period if its carmaking business declined faster than its robotaxi and services businesses could grow. However, he added that the company may have no choice but to make the leap.\n\nHe pointed to the competition from China and declining income from the regulatory credits that Tesla sells to automakers who have failed to sell enough EVs as evidence that the company's automotive business was running out of road.\n\n\"Musk sees the future of this business as robots and autonomous vehicles,\" Fiorani said.\n\n\"The physical products themselves, the cars and the automotive side, are all legacy products,\" he added. \"We're going to see them going forward to autonomous software, autonomous hardware, things that will move them into the next generation.\"",

    "fullText": "Lord Stockwood says people in government ‘definitely’ talking about idea as technology disrupts industries\n\nThe UK could introduce a universal basic income (UBI) to protect workers in industries that are being disrupted by AI, the investment minister Jason Stockwood has said.\n\n“Bumpy” changes to society caused by the introduction of the technology would mean there would have to be “some sort of concessionary arrangement with jobs that go immediately”, Lord Stockwood said.\n\nThe Labour peer told the Financial Times: “Undoubtedly we’re going to have to think really carefully about how we soft-land those industries that go away, so some sort of [universal basic income], some sort of lifelong mechanism as well so people can retrain.”\n\nA universal basic income is not part of official government policy, but when asked whether people in government were considering the need for UBI, Stockwood told the FT: “People are definitely talking about it.”\n\nThe technology entrepreneur, who took up his ministerial post in September, said part of his motivation for joining the government was to help ensure the workforce was prepared for rapid change.\n\nFears continue to grow about the impact of artificial intelligence on Britain’s job market. This week research by the investment bank Morgan Stanley found the UK was losing more jobs than it is creating because of AI and was being hit harder than other large economies.\n\nThis month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nLast week, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.\n\nStockwood, who held senior positions at Lastminute.com, Travelocity and Match.com, oversaw the $490m (£400m at the time) sale of the online insurance broker Simply Business to the US insurer Travelers in 2017. He later bought a stake the football club of his home town, Grimsby Town FC.\n\nWhile he has previously been a vocal proponent of a wealth tax in the UK, Stockwood told the FT he had not repeated his calls for the government to go further on taxing the rich.\n\nHowever, he added: “If you make your money and the first thing you do is you speak to a tax adviser to ask: ‘Where can we pay the lowest tax?’ we don’t want those people in this country, I’d suggest, because you’re not committed to your communities and the long-term success in this country.”\n\nStockwood was preceded as investment minister by Poppy Gustafsson, a former chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, who stepped down after less than a year in the job.",

    "description": "The Big Tech rivals are spending more than ever, but analysts are more concerned about Microsoft at the moment.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street had very different reactions to two of Big Tech's biggest spenders after quarterly earnings reports came out on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Meta and Microsoft reported higher-than-expected capex. While both companies beat revenue expectations, Microsoft's stock sank more than 6% after-hours, while Meta's stock jumped as high as 9%.\n\nBig Tech's spending has risen sharply in the last two years, driven by investments in massive AI data centers. Wall Street has started to question when those investments will pay off, and analysts are giving some companies a much harder time than others.\n\nMeta reported capex of $22.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $72.2 billion for the year, up from 2024's $39.2 billion. That number will climb in 2026 — the company estimates capex will be in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion for the year, driven by increased spending on Meta SuperIntelligence Labs, the company's big bet on speeding up AI model development.\n\n\"We plan to continue to prioritize investing in the business to support these opportunities,\" CFO Susan Li told investors on Wednesday's call.\n\nMicrosoft logged $37.5 billion in capex for the quarter, up 66% from one year ago. Most of that spend went toward CPUs and GPUs, the powerful computing chips that run AI workloads. The company said the spending was necessary to support fast-growing demand for its cloud and AI business.\n\nMicrosoft's revenue was 81.3 billion for the quarter, up 17% from the previous year. Meta reported $55.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $200.1 billion for all of 2025.\n\nWhile both surpassed Wall Street's revenue expectations, analysts gave Microsoft a much harder time than Meta over its surging capex.\n\nPart of that could be Microsoft's heavy investments in GPU chips, which can become costly given their short life spans.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said that a core issue for investors, as Microsoft's capex grows faster than they expected, \"comes down to ROI on capex spend over time.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also heavily exposed to a single customer, another concern for investors. Nearly half — 45% — of the company's remaining performance obligations are attributed to OpenAI.\n\n\"There's obviously concern about the durability,\" Jeffries analyst Brent Thill said of the backlog.\n\nMicrosoft holds a $135 billion stake in OpenAI and has invested more than $13 billion into the company since 2019.\n\nWhile OpenAI does not directly carry a heavy debt load, some of its partners, including Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nvidia, have taken on massive amounts of debt to fund data center buildouts, fueling Wall Street's anxiety over a potential AI bubble.\n\nOracle is struggling to finance its $500 billion data center initiative, Business Insider reported last week, amid growing concerns about its credit rating and risk.\n\nOn the Meta earnings call, Li noted that Meta's cash reserves, thanks to its very profitable ad business, will fuel its AI spending spree next year.\n\n\"We have a strong net cash balance, and expect our business will continue to generate sufficient cash to fund our infrastructure investments in 2026,\" Li said.",

    "fullText": "Each year, Thoughtworks’ Looking Glass report looks beyond individual technologies to examine the forces reshaping how organizations build, run and evolve their technology estates. The aim is not to predict the future, but to help leaders make sense of the changes already underway — and to understand which of them will matter most in practice.\n\nThis year’s trends reflect a moment of transition. Long-running shifts around platforms, data, security and experience design are converging with rapid advances in AI. The result is not a single disruptive technology, but a reconfiguration of how technology creates value across the enterprise. Systems are becoming more adaptive. Interactions more intent-driven. Governance more embedded in day-to-day delivery.\n\nAcross the Looking Glass, we explore what this means in concrete terms: how enterprises are rebuilding their core foundations, rewiring workflows to support greater autonomy and reimagining the role technology plays in customer experience, decision-making and operations. AI features prominently, but always in context — as one of several forces accelerating change, rather than a solution in isolation.\n\nAs ever, this report is grounded in what we see working with clients around the world. It is intended as a practical guide to navigating the year ahead, with a focus on technologies that deliver real, durable value.\n\nRachel Laycock, Chief Technology Officer, Thoughtworks\n\nIn each lens, we present opportunities for implementing technology in your business and signals to gauge how fast something is approaching. We categorize each of the 90+ trends in two dimensions: the prevalence across enterprises — seeing now, beginning to see or on the horizon — and our recommended strategic response — adopt, analyze or anticipate.\n\nYou'll find each of Looking Glass 2026's five lenses below.

    "fullText": "Amazon cut 16,000 more corporate jobs on Wednesday, and leadership wants the remaining staff to become even more efficient through technology.\n\nIn an email addressing the layoffs on Wednesday, Greg Pearson, VP of global sales at Amazon Web Services, urged employees to keep using technology to streamline their work.\n\n\"Moving forward, I encourage you to keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work, amplify our impact, and focus on the activities that directly drive value for our customers,\" Pearson wrote in the email obtained by Business Insider. \"And most importantly, take care of yourselves and each other.\"\n\nPearson's message mirrors Amazon's broader drive to run more efficiently as it reorganizes amid rapid advances in AI. Although the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said they were driven more by cultural fit than by cost reductions or automation.\n\nJassy has previously said AI will ultimately reduce Amazon's workforce by driving efficiency gains. On Wednesday, Amazon's chief human resources officer, Beth Galetti, said in the layoff announcement that the company will continue hiring and investing in \"strategic areas.\"\n\nWednesday's layoff was Amazon's second round of mass job cuts since October, when it axed 14,000 roles.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Amazon announced it's cutting 16,000 jobs. The career coach Kyle Elliott said you should use these two critical tools to help you find a job after a layoff.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kyle Elliott, 33, a career coach who lives in California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGetting laid off is very traumatic — and it's becoming more common.\n\nI've been a full-time career coach to tech employees at startups and in Big Tech since 2017, and I've seen how layoffs have become more visible in recent years.\n\nI help clients navigate life after a layoff, including what role they want next and how to apply for new jobs.\n\nAmazon has announced new plans to cut staff, and I want affected employees to remember that they are coming from one of the world's top companies.\n\nPeople will want them, and they will find something.\n\nWhen people reach out to me for coaching after a layoff, many have a scarcity mindset and feel like they have to apply for any job.\n\nFor some people who urgently need to pay rent or put food on the table, that's necessary. But in other cases, it makes sense to take a beat and evaluate what you're really looking for in your next role.\n\nThe very first thing I ask clients to do is create a list of \"must-haves\" and \"dealbreakers\" for their next job. What are their salary expectations? Will they only work remotely? Are they willing to relocate? If you write the list before you start interviewing, you can act from a place of logic rather than panic.\n\nThe second step is to update your résumé and LinkedIn profile, which are two of your most critical tools in today's market. You're going to submit a résumé with almost every application, and having an up-to-date LinkedIn account puts you in a good position if potential employers check it or recruiters go looking for talent on the platform.\n\nYou want to optimize for the roles you're looking for in 2026, which means that if you were an engineer when you joined Amazon but are now a director, you want to make sure that's reflected on your LinkedIn page.\n\nI've seen clients turn to quick hacks for their job search, like asking AI to tailor their résumé or using it to find and apply to roles for them. But if everyone does that, you don't stand out.\n\nI can usually tell quickly if someone's written their résumé with AI. For example, they'll be applying to a systems engineer role, and it won't even have the phrase \"systems engineer\" in it.\n\nEveryone thinks only AI is reading their résumé, but I have clients who work in talent acquisition and HR — the humans who are still involved in the recruitment process. Humans hire other humans, even at big companies.\n\nIn the age of AI, be more human. Take a step back and think, if you were a human looking at this résumé, what would you want to see? Then put those phrases near the top, rather than using AI to create generic slop.\n\nI'd suggest creating a master résumé that you can spend 20 minutes tailoring for different roles. If you're using AI, use it more like an extra tool, rather than the thing that's driving your job search.\n\nLayoffs are normal now, especially in the tech industry, and there's much less stigma around them.\n\nBut there's more competition in the job market, because it's easier to apply for jobs with AI, for example, so the challenges around layoffs are different nowadays.\n\nIn today's job market, it's important to figure out what's unique about you. Lots of people will meet the job requirements, so you need to communicate why the company should hire you over the thousands of other applicants.\n\nOne thing that can help you is to look back at performance reviews and identify things people repeatedly say about you. You can try asking three to five people to share what makes you fabulous and to give examples. I've found that clients are surprised by the feedback they receive.",

    "fullText": "Some of the biggest companies in the world want to let you know how they're doing.\n\n(Want might be a strong word. It's more like, are required to by regulators, but that doesn't roll off the tongue.)\n\nEither way, seven companies with market caps totalling more than $20 trillion are checking in.\n\nI broke down what to keep an eye out for with each of them.\n\nMeta: Mark Zuckerberg still wants to spend big on AI. There's one problem. Meta, unlike some of its Big Tech peers, doesn't have a cloud business that's already benefiting from the AI boom. And its ads business wasn't enough to stop investors from getting spooked last earnings.\n\nRecently, Meta has cut down its metaverse team and overhauled its review program. Still, investors want to see real returns, which could mean Meta's in for another intense year.\n\nMicrosoft: Pivoting a company with a market cap north of roughly $3.5 trillion isn't easy, but CEO Satya Nadella is giving it his best shot. Nadella tapped a new advisor to \"rethink the new economics of AI\" for Microsoft. The big boss views AI as both a massive threat and a huge opportunity that could define the tech giant's future.\n\nSomething else to watch: Any chatter about Microsoft's plans (and partnerships) in the wake of its restructured agreement with OpenAI.\n\nTesla: There's the traditional auto business to consider, but Elon Musk will likely focus more on the future. Specifically, progress and plans for Tesla's robotaxi business and robotic humanoid, Optimus. It's part of Tesla's ongoing rebrand from an EV maker to AI company.\n\nMusk has relied on touting what's to come, as opposed to what's already here. But are investors still buying a dream that's yet to materialize?\n\nApple: The odd one out in the AI race, Apple is opting to partner rather than build its own huge foundation models. The latest nod toward that strategy is the deal it struck with Google Gemini to power Siri's AI.\n\nThat's why iPhone sales will remain the key number to look out for, especially when it comes to its second-largest market: China.\n\nAlphabet: Few companies have had a better run over the past three months than Alphabet. Gemini 3's launch has put Google at the front of the AI race and pushed it into the uber-elite $4 trillion market-cap club.\n\nNext up? How Google will continue to reshape its crown jewel — Search — in the age of its AI Overviews.\n\nAmazon: Just in: Amazon said it's cutting 16,000 employees. (Some employees got an advanced notice.) The latest reductions were announced by Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, who described the move as part of efforts to cut back on bureaucracy inside the company.\n\nAmazon was fresh off cutting roughly 14,000 jobs in the run-up to last earnings. The company still managed to get on Wall Street's good side in the immediate aftermath. We'll see if it can do it again.",

    "fullText": "Redwood Materials has landed Google as a new investor, capping an upsized funding round that values the battery recycling and energy storage company at more than $6 billion.\n\nThe development underscores rising Big Tech interest in power infrastructure for the AI era.\n\nThe Nevada-based startup said Wednesday it completed the final close of its Series E financing, bringing the total raised to $425 million.\n\nThe round was increased from a previously announced $350 million amid strong investor demand. Google joined the final closing of the round alongside existing backers, including Capricorn and Goldman Sachs.\n\nGoogle's participation adds another tech giant to Redwood's cap table, following Nvidia's investment earlier in the round through its venture arm NVentures.\n\nThe growing interest reflects a bet that Redwood's energy storage business — which repurposes used electric-vehicle batteries to store power — could become critical infrastructure as electricity demand surges from AI, data centers, and broader electrification.\n\nFounded by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, Redwood Materials originally built its business on recycling lithium-ion batteries and recovering key metals, including lithium, nickel, and cobalt. More recently, it has expanded into grid-scale energy storage through a new unit called Redwood Energy, which uses second-life EV batteries to stabilize power supply and support energy-hungry data centers.\n\nThe company has argued that energy storage is no longer optional but essential as AI workloads strain existing grids. Redwood says the new capital will help it scale its energy storage platform while continuing to invest in recycling and critical minerals processing in the US.\n\nWith Google now on board, Redwood is positioning itself at the intersection of AI infrastructure, energy security, and domestic supply chains — a combination investors increasingly see as strategic as the power demands of the AI economy accelerate.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "The AI trade is on fire on Wednesday.\n\nEarnings from international chip makers have sparked a fresh rally in US tech stocks, helping to power the market to fresh records.\n\nThe S&P 500 blew past 7,000 for the first time, a key psychological threshold that the market has flirted with lately but never cleared until now. The Nasdaq 100 also hit a record.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday:\n\nThe rally largely advanced on good news in the chips and semiconductors space.\n\nNvidia was up more than 1% on a report from Reuters that China has given the green light for several large firms to purchase the company's H200 AI chips.\n\nInvestors were also encouraged by strong earnings from non-US semiconductor firms. ASML and SK Hynix surged after the semiconductor firms issued robust guidance for 2026, which sent other chip and semiconductor stocks up across the board.\n\nHere were the notable moves in tech:\n\nMega-cap tech earnings were also helping boost sentiment, with investors waiting on results for Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft, three companies at the heart of the AI boom, after the close. Results for Apple are expected on Thursday.\n\nThe broader market churned higher as the investors looked ahead to the Fed's January rate decision. While markets are not expecting a rate-cut, investors seem to believe that strong earnings will help drive the next leg of the bull market, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\n\"The risk-on attitude on Wall Street, amid a lack of hesitation to lift exposures, is emblematic of participants believing that the prints will deliver beats and raises overall, pointing to an extended runway ahead for AI,\" he wrote in a note.\n\n\"US stock indexes futures began Wednesday in bullish form. Wall Street loves a milestone, so there will be caps in the air if the S&P can maintain the 7,000 level it passed this morning,\" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note to clients.",

    "fullText": "Beijing’s AI policy is focused on real-life applications but Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions\n\nStanding on stage in the eastern China tech hub of Hangzhou, Alibaba’s normally media-shy CEO made an attention-grabbing announcement. “The world today is witnessing the dawn of an AI-driven intelligent revolution,” Eddie Wu told a developer conference in September. “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) will not only amplify human intelligence but also unlock human potential, paving the way for the arrival of artificial superintelligence (ASI).”\n\nASI, Wu said, “could produce a generation of ‘super scientists’ and ‘full-stack super engineers’”, who would “tackle unsolved scientific and engineering problems at unimaginable speeds”.\n\nWu also announced plans to invest 380bn yuan (£40bn) in AI infrastructure over the next three years, news that sent Alibaba stocks soaring to their highest in nearly four years.\n\nWu’s foray into the existential, techno-frontier rhetoric normally deployed by western tech CEOs such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis caught the attention of observers. “Wu’s ASI speech represents a breakthrough,” the tech writer Afra Wang wrote in her China AI newsletter, Concurrent. “Major Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions that carry the flavour of future prophecy.”\n\nAGI, a theoretical state of AI where a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job, has become the preoccupation of American tech companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind. Many see it as the next frontier of civilisation, and are in competition with each other, and China, to get there. In May, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, told a US Senate committee on AI that the “race between the United States and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover”.\n\nMany in Washington have internalised these fears. The US-China economic and scurity review commission has recommended that Congress “establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an artificial general intelligence (AGI) capability”. The Manhattan Project was a second world war-era research operation to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nIn China, many saw Wu’s speech as articulating the vision of a bold, singular tech company, but not one that represented China’s overall AI industry.\n\n“China certainly has research groups working towards AGI. But most AI companies are working towards better applications,” said Ya-Qin Zhang, the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research and former president of the tech company Baidu.\n\nA combination of limited computing power, a pragmatic approach to technology and a keen awareness of the present day potential of AI has steered China’s national AI policy towards real-life applications rather than frontier research.\n\nIn August, the Chinese government published its highly anticipated “AI+ strategy”. The policy document outlined how AI could turbocharge China’s development goals, such as by using AI to improve medical diagnoses and make supply chains more efficient. But it made no mention of AGI.\n\n“The Chinese government is intently focused on reaping the benefits of AI in the here and now and in the near future through diffusion and application of AI across the economy, society, defence, and other areas,” said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior director for China and Taiwan at the White House national security council. “Despite its goal to ‘catch up and surpass’ the United States, we shouldn’t assume that the Chinese Communist party has bought into the idea that AGI is imminent.”\n\n“If you’re just looking at what has been officially published … there is no clear acknowledgment of AGI at all,” said Selina Xu, a China tech analyst. Xu noted that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, had a history of preferring the physical economy to more intangible forces.\n\n“It’s a very different narrative from the AGI race as a lot of people in DC see it,” Xu said.\n\nOne of the biggest factors guiding this strategy is the fact that US sanctions have prevented Chinese companies from acquiring the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors, which are needed for advanced AI research.\n\nWashington has banned the sale of hi-tech microchips to China in an effort to rein in the country’s AI development. Nvidia, the world’s leading chipmaker, then developed more basic semiconductors specifically for the Chinese market. In December, Washington approved the Nvidia’s second-most advanced chips, the H200s, for sale in China. But Beijing has reportedly told custom agents that the chips cannot be imported into China, as the government seeks to break the country’s reliance on overseas technology.\n\nChina insists that “necessity is the mother of invention” and points to the success of companies such as DeepSeek as proof that the US restrictions will merely spur innovation. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, is one of the few Chinese tech leaders who, like Alibaba’s Wu, has openly expressed an interest in AGI.\n\nBut until China is able to produce its own advanced semiconductors at scale, most tech companies feel it is more profitable to use the hardware they already have to focus on AI applications rather than AGI.\n\nAnother factor guiding the US-China tech competition is the availability of datacentres and the energy to power them. In November, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said China would “win the AI race” in part because of its energy subsidies for datacentres.\n\nThe subsidies were reportedly introduced after Chinese tech companies complained of higher electricity bills caused by the domestic semiconductors they are obliged to use, which are less efficient than Nvidia’s. In a sign of how determined China is to break its reliance on imported technology, Reuters reported that any datacentres in receipt of state funds could only use domestic chips.\n\nSuch measures would reduce Nvidia’s competitive advantage in China and boost domestic chip producers, such as Huawei.\n\nSince 2021, China has reportedly poured $100bn into support for AI datacentres.\n\nBut there are signs that the boom may have been overzealous. A recent report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology said that nationwide, the utilisation rate for AI datacentres was 32%.\n\nIn a recent op-ed in China Economic Weekly, Rao Shaoyang, the director at the China Telecom Research Institute, wrote that in some regions of China, the computing power industry was operating in a similar fashion to China’s beleaguered property sector: build first, find buyers later. He cautioned against “blindly building intelligent computing centres” and said local computing power demand should be considered before building new datacentres.\n\nDespite the surplus in more general computing power, many experts believe China still does not have chips that are sophisticated enough to explore frontier research in AGI. But analysts note that the mood could change quickly.\n\n“The current status quo is highly fluid, and Xi Jinping has explicitly declared an ambition to lead the world in AI,” said Gewirtz. “So the fact that China construes that goal one way at this snapshot moment in time does not give me any comfort that in a year they’re going to construe it the same way.”\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",
