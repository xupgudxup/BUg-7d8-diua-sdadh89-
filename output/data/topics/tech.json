    "fullText": "Critics brand deal with regulator as ‘lightweight’ with ‘no legal bite’ as tech giants avoid legally binding measures\n\nApple and Google have committed to avoid discriminating against apps that compete with their own products under an agreement with the UK’s competition watchdog, as they avoided legally binding measures for their mobile platforms.\n\nThe US tech companies have vowed to be more transparent about vetting third-party apps before letting them on their app stores and not discriminate against third-party apps in app search rankings.\n\nThey have also agreed not to use data from third-party apps unfairly, such as using information about app updates to tweak their own offerings.\n\nApple has also committed to giving app developers an easier means of requesting use of its features such as the digital wallet, and live translation for AirPod users.\n\nThe commitments have been secured as part of a new regulatory regime overseen by the Competition and Markets Authority, (CMA), which has the power to impose changes on how Apple and Google operate their mobile platforms after deciding last year that they had “substantial, entrenched” market power.\n\nHowever, the CMA has opted to allow voluntary commitments rather than impose formal changes.\n\nTom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and a former CMA director who represents app developers challenging Apple and Google’s dominance of the mobile platform market, said the changes were “lightweight” and had no legal bite.\n\nThe CMA did not name specific Google and Apple apps that compete with third-party rivals but both firms offer their own music services in the form of YouTube Music and Apple Music. Google and Apple’s app stores are vital shopfronts for app developers because the Android and iOS platforms are used by the overwhelming majority of UK mobile phone users.\n\nHowever, the commitments do not cover a significant bugbear for app developers – the fees of up to 30% that Apple and Google charge developers to sell products via their app stores. The CMA is still considering whether to tackle how Apple and Google charge developers.\n\nThe CMA said if the companies fail to implement the commitments effectively they will impose them formally under new enforcement powers against tech companies. The commitments take effect on 1 April.\n\nSarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “The ability to secure immediate commitments from Apple and Google reflects the unique flexibility of the UK digital markets competition regime and offers a practical route to swiftly address the concerns we’ve identified.”\n\nUnder the commitments, Apple and Google must provide data to the regulator showing the number of apps submitted for review and whether they were approved or rejected, plus the time taken to review those apps as well as the number of complaints received about the app stores and the outcomes of those processes.\n\nThe CMA will also monitor the outcome of applications to use the features and functionality within Apple’s mobile operating systems, such as the digital wallet.\n\nSmith said: “This first batch is so lightweight that it barely exists, and the promises made by Google and Apple are not legally binding in any case.\n\n“The main measures that could help with cost of living and economic growth issues may come later this year, such as forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores on its devices and to allow customers to avoid paying Apple’s commission.”\n\nThe News Media Association, whose members include the Guardian, questioned whether the commitments were “really worth the paper they are printed on”.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson said the company faced “fierce competition” in every market it operates in. “The commitments announced today allow Apple to continue advancing important privacy and security innovations for users and great opportunities for developers. We appreciate the positive and ongoing dialogue with UK officials.” they said.\n\nA Google spokesperson said its mobile ecosystem, including its Google Play app store, was a “driver of growth” in the UK economy. “While we believe Play’s existing developer practices are fair, objective, and transparent, we welcome the opportunity to resolve the CMA’s concerns collaboratively,” they said.",

    "title": "How Harvey picked its first chief product officer: 'Her slope of learning is very high'",
    "description": "Harvey is one of best-known players in legal tech. Now, the $8 billion startup has hired its first chief product officer to help defend its lead.",
    "fullText": "Harvey, the $8 billion legal software startup, is becoming a default vendor in Big Law. Now, with rival startups nipping at its heels and AI model providers moving closer to legal workflows, Harvey is bringing in a new executive to help defend its lead.\n\nThe company tells Business Insider it has hired Anique Drumright as its first chief product officer. In this role, she'll shape what Harvey builds next and how quickly it can ship. Drumright has held roles at Uber, TripActions, Loom, and, most recently, HR software startup Rippling, where she led the company's push into IT management software.\n\n\"Her slope of learning is very high,\" said Winston Weinberg, Harvey's chief executive. He described sending Drumright a lengthy Google Doc on the state of law firm technology and the day-to-day mechanics of legal work. She came back quickly with \"really good product ideas,\" he said.\n\nThe C-suite hire comes at a critical moment for Harvey — and for legal tech more broadly. Law firms are pouring money into new software meant to help lawyers work faster and save costs. Clients are driving much of that spend. After seeing chatbots and virtual assistants transform their own operations, they now expect the same efficiency from outside counsel.\n\nThose tools don't come cheap, and recent moves by the model providers themselves have complicated the picture. Anthropic's release last week of a contract-review tool sent ripples through the industry and led to a major sell-off of legal-research stocks. It raised a pointed question: If a foundation model can review contracts, on top of handling tasks across the rest of the organization, how much specialized legal software will firms still pay for?\n\nHarvey sits at the top of the heap for now. The startup has emerged as one of the best-known and best-funded players in legal tech, with licenses at over half of the 100 largest US law firms. The company said it ended last year with more than $190 million in annual recurring revenue. And job postings reviewed by Business Insider suggest it is pushing into mid-market and smaller firms, a long tail of potential growth beyond Big Law.\n\nEarlier this week, Forbes reported that Harvey is raising a new round of funding that would value the company at $11 billion, citing unnamed people familiar with the deal. A Harvey spokesperson declined to comment on the report.\n\nHarvey's dominance comes with pressure. The company still needs to show lawyers its product can boost revenue, not just save hours. At the same time, competition is intensifying, from legal software startups like Legora and from OpenAI and Anthropic, the same companies whose technology powers Harvey's platform.\n\nWeinberg said Anthropic's latest release doesn't change Harvey's product direction, but it does emphasize the need to move faster on shipping what makes the company distinctive. \"Part of hiring Anique is to accelerate that,\" he said.\n\nIf the next fight is adoption, Drumright has put in the reps. She's spent years building products that ask people to change their habits.\n\nAt Uber, she worked in product and marketing as the ride-hailing giant scaled to billions of trips a year. Later, at Loom, she helped grow a product that nudged office workers away from meetings and long email chains, replacing them with screen-recorded video messages.\n\nDrumright faces a similar challenge at Harvey, where the company has to convince reluctant lawyers, a famously luddite profession, to trade the familiar way of doing things for new tools. Those take time to use effectively.\n\n\"When something is new, even if it's powerful, it's still harder to do than the way you've always done it,\" she said. Her job, she said, is to make those new capabilities feel intuitive.\n\nDrumright is the daughter of two lawyers, and she has seen firsthand how low-tech legal work can be. She remembers her mother siting on the couch, preparing for a deposition by speaking into a tape recorder.\n\nDrumright starts on Tuesday. Her first weeks at Harvey will be spent on a listening tour, meeting lawyers using the product and legal teams deciding whether to buy it. \"Legal is a very specific domain,\" she said, but the work starts with understanding how lawyers actually work today, and designing products that don't slow them down.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "The US Army jammed its new command-and-control tech to see if electronic warfare would break it",
    "description": "The jamming cut soldiers off from commanders and limited what they could see. They located the source and took it out with mortars.",
    "fullText": "Much like the war in Ukraine, future battlefields could be drowning in electronic interference, so the US Army stress-tested new command-and-control tech against that threat.\n\nThe need to maintain connections between command and deployed weapons and crews, or reestablish those links when they're lost, is shaping how soldiers train on the service's Next Generation Command and Control, a new software-driven system that's being developed for the Army.\n\nIn its most recent NGC2 exercise at Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army's 4th Infantry Division put it to the test against electronic warfare. Stressing the system proved difficult, the Army said, because it would \"heal itself.\" The service said it had to disable certain features to really test it.\n\nMaj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, the commander of the 4th ID, said during a media roundtable that after they activated the jamming, the system rerouted internally to keep functioning. \"We had to go back and figure out something else to turn off to actually stress the system to feel that for real,\" he said.\n\nThat further testing saw soldiers in the field lose their connection to satellite services, forcing them to resort to backups like radio for communications while they searched for the source of the jamming.\n\nOnce they found it, they eliminated it with a mortar strike and started the reconnection process.\n\n\"It was quite seamless,\" said Lt. Col. Shawn Scott, commander of the 4th Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, speaking during the roundtable. He added that troops still had to learn how to manage retransmission in complex terrain — an important step in restoring communications when troops are spread out across a wide area.\n\nThe recent exercise put soldiers in a \"denied, degraded, intermittent, and limited\" environment, Scott said, cutting them off from the division's cloud but still allowing the squadron to track the fight and carry out its mission on its own. Once the simulated jamming was removed, \"we were able to reestablish connection back with division and brigade,\" he said, watching data flow back up the chain and back down again \"seamlessly.\"\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine has shown the US military that consistent jamming of communications, weaponry, and intelligence and surveillance capabilities is something it'll need to be prepared for in a future conflict.\n\n\"We don't think the modern battlefield's going to be free of electromagnetic interference,\" Ellis said.\n\nIn this round of testing, the Army fired 155mm rounds from an M777 howitzer at a Marine-provided target. The data from those strikes was then sent back to Marine Corps systems. During the exercise, 20 different types of sensors fed information into NGC2, including drones, electronic warfare systems, and Stryker vehicles.\n\nNGC2 is a major modernization initiative for the Army, changing how soldiers communicate with each other and command, receive intelligence, track locations, and plan warfighting actions like firing artillery or scouting with drones.\n\nJoe Welch, who oversees the Army's command-and-control systems and efforts to counter enemy communications, said that most NGC2 parts are built using off-the-shelf technology and standard commercial software practices, rather than bespoke military-only systems.\n\nData and artificial intelligence capabilities are giving soldiers real-time information, like how much ammo they have left or whether there are casualties to care for, and predictive simulations for what they'll need should enemy forces attack them. The testing at Fort Carson, led by Anduril and an industry team, is continually bringing in more vendors, capabilities, and functions to broaden what NGC2 can do.\n\nWith the new system, the Army is also recognizing what different divisions across the service will need out of it. The process has been driven by implementing soldier feedback quickly, sometimes overnight or within a few days.\n\nIn Hawaii, the Army's 25th Infantry Division is working on a data and applications component of NGC2 led by Lockheed Martin and other companies that, once completed, will also be implemented into what the 4th ID is doing.\n\nFuture exercises are expected to expand what NGC2 can do. One event in May, for instance, will test it against a simulated enemy.\n\n\"We're going to really tests the systems,\" Ellis said, including against cyber, electronic, and kinetic areas to see what vulnerabilities exist. \"We're going to go after all that to learn where we need to make some adjustments.\"",

    "description": "Salesforce's senior VP of business technology said he tries to teach his kids resilience, and it's a skill is important for entry-level talent, too.",
    "fullText": "As companies rethink how they train early-career workers in a job market shaped by AI, Salesforce executive Andy White said resilience is top of mind for him — both at work and at home.\n\nWhite oversees Salesforce's implementation of Slackbot, an AI personal agent that generates responses based on conversations, files, and workflows inside Slack.\n\nAs White raises his son and daughter during a period of rapid technological change, he said he preaches to his kids the importance of powering through moments that don't go as planned. He said resilience is pivotal and that it's important for people to focus on doing the hard things and being OK when things don't go as expected.\n\nThe senior vice president of business technology said he recently spoke with his daughter about the importance of dealing with situations rather than merely labeling them as \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n\n\"Hard is hard,\" White told Business Insider. \"Hard isn't necessarily bad.\"\n\nExpectations, he said, are the \"destroyer of hope and joy,\" and that when things don't go as planned, it often turns out to be a good thing down the line, even if it doesn't seem that way in the moment.\n\n\"It's when we look back, and it's like, 'Oh man, I'm glad that didn't go the way I expected,'\" White said. \"But when you're in it, it's really hard.\"\n\nThe resilience lesson is one White also thinks is relevant for entry-level workers. While junior hires often arrive ready to use new tools and deliver a \"pretty high output,\" he said, persistence is an area where some still need to grow.\n\nHe described today's entry-level talent pool as \"incredibly capable, very bright, and very driven,\" with a stronger grasp of how to use AI tools to solve problems.\n\n\"They're much more fluent at being able to leverage AI tooling in the flow of their work,\" White said.\n\nHowever, he said the group sometimes struggles when it comes to working through challenges.\n\n\"There's more willingness to give up sooner,\" he said, adding that this trait doesn't apply across the board.\n\nWhite said he's seen AI tools, such as the company's recently upgraded Slackbot, help boost entry-level workers' confidence. He said they could help reduce feelings of imposter syndrome by helping early-career workers navigate challenging situations that arise at work.\n\nWith that said, White added that workers need to stay balanced and not let tools make them \"overly confident.\" He said workers need to bring skepticism to \"any kind of information\" they get, and be diligent about reviewing sources and citations when using AI.\n\n\"If you don't believe something, read the citation, and if it doesn't have a citation, you have to assume it's a hallucination,\" White said, adding that he tells his kids the same thing.",

And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\n\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\n\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature.\n\nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley.\n\nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\n\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\n\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works.\n\n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\n\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act.\n\nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.\n\n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”",

    "description": "The recent tech sell-off spooked Wall Street, sparking a rerating of AI stocks. One analyst shares his criteria for picking winners in the AI race.",
    "fullText": "The tech stock sell-off that rattled Wall Street last week served as a reminder to investors that AI hype works both ways, and endless enthusiasm is no longer lifting all boats.\n\nThe dramatic downturn hit software stocks hardest, but it also spilled into the broader tech sector. Major indexes have broadly recovered from last week's sell-off, but investors are still on edge about what could be the next shoe to drop.\n\nAccording to Futurum Group CEO and chief analyst Daniel Newman, the sell-off was a \"healthy, overdue rotation and a market demanding receipts.\"\n\n\"Ignore hype and look at growth and constraints,\" he told Business Insider. The analyst also shared some tips for picking AI stocks.\n\nHere is the framework Newman says he's using to spot winners and losers as the AI trade evolves.\n\nNot all companies spending on AI are seeing it pay off. While many on Wall Street chalk this up to the early innings of the emerging tech, companies that are seeing AI drive revenue are ones to look for.\n\n\"Companies need to show that the $470+ billion the hyperscalers are spending this year is generating returns. Those that do will be rewarded,\" Newman said.\n\nHe highlights Amazon and Microsoft as examples of AI spending fueling revenue real growth, through the tech giant'' respective cloud businesses, AWS and Azure.\n\nCompanies creating their own silicon chips are better positioned to compete. Capacity constraints control the AI race, with chip demand outpacing supply.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all working on their own custom AI chips.\n\nNewman highlighted that companies with in-house chips benefit from capacity advantages and vertical integration, which set them up for better margins.\n\nCompanies that have been successful in seeing a return on their AI spending have been largely focused on enterprise offerings. These include the cloud hyper scalers, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as Palantir, a favorite among retail traders.\n\nSome software companies are seeing enterprise monetization, despite the worries that sparked this week's sell-off. Newman highlights ServiceNow and IBM as \"companies driving agentic AI workflows and token consumption.\"\n\nElon Musk told Tesla investors on the company's most recent earnings call that its humanoid robot, Optimus, could generate up to $10 trillion in long-term revenue.\n\nNewman said that physical AI is the next multi-trillion-dollar market outside of data centers. He called out Amazon and Tesla as companies bringing AI to the physical world.\n\nThe market zeroed in on the software space for good reason, Newman said. \"I don't believe the AI will eat all software, but AI will eat some software,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe analyst explained that software companies with data running core business applications can survive in an AI era, but they will have to adapt to meet the needs of enterprise customers who want AI insights to fuel productivity gains.\n\nSome software companies partnering with AI factories include Salesforce and ServiceNow.\n\nAs AI-disruption concerns continue to fuel market skittishness, investors should be wary of companies without a clear narrative for how capex will deliver tangible results.\n\nAnother sign that an AI stock is risky may be that a company is using debt to finance AI infrastructure buildouts. Newman clarified that while debt isn't always a bad thing and can be a way to invest in critical growth, it can make a stock more of a risk-on play.\n\nIn a risk-off environment, Newman told Business Insider that there are a couple of things investors should be watching for.\n\n\"Look at the companies that can really afford to keep investing, for businesses that are going to basically create the cash flow that do it with the least risk.\"",

    "fullText": "California still has it over Texas in at least one key way, Elon Musk says: Hiring.\n\nAfter moving the headquarters of SpaceX and Tesla Inc. to Texas in recent years because of politics, he said it’s still easier to recruit employees to work in California. With one exception.\n\n“Austin, it helps,” Musk said — while noting that Tesla still has most of its engineering capacity in California. “Getting engineers to move … I call it the significant other problem.”\n\nThat’s what makes engineering recruiting toughest at Starbase, the remote South Texas outpost where SpaceX is developing its Starship mega-rocket.\n\n“For Starbase that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low,” Musk said. “It’s quite difficult. It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”\n\nSpouses, he said, are often unwilling to relocate to the isolated area.\n\nMusk companies also have operations in Robstown McGregor, Bastrop and elsewhere across the state.\n\nHe disclosed the issues on the Cheeky Pint podcast during a chat in which he also accused tech giant Apple Inc. of trying to poach Tesla’s talent when that company was working on its own self-driving electric car, a project it later scrapped.\n\n“They were carpet bombing Tesla with recruiting calls,” Musk said. He claimed their opening offer would be roughly double the compensation at Tesla, indicating what he referred to as a “Tesla pixie dust” factor, in which other companies assume if they could hire someone from Tesla, the employee would put them on track to success.\n\n“When we had the pixie dust problem, we would get relentlessly recruited from,” Musk said. “Also, Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it’s easier for people to just… They don’t have to change their life very much. Their commute’s going to be the same.”\n\nREAD NEXT: Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein had closer ties than disclosed, newly released files show\n\nJohn Collison, co-founder of Stripe and podcast host, asked Musk how he guards against poachers. Musk said there’s not much that can stop it.\n\nMusk has long been trying to draw tech talent to Texas, with a renewed push after last week’s announcement that SpaceX acquired xAI. Days after giving notice of the plan, Michael Nicolls, vice president of Starlink engineering, said the SpaceX-owned satellite company is hiring for critical engineering roles to develop technologies for AI satellites in space at the company’s facilities in Austin and Seattle.",

    "fullText": "Billionaire Mark Cuban has heard every version of \"how would you start over?\" But in a Wired \"Tech Support\" Q&A in 2023, someone finally raised the stakes.\n\n\"You have six months to make as much money as possible,\" he said. \"All you have to start with is a phone and $500 in cash. What are you doing?\"\n\n\"That is the best question I have ever been asked in my entire adult life,\" Cuban said. And then he gave a step-by-step answer that didn't include flipping phones, trading crypto, or launching an app.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nBlue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\n\"I'm going to find a sales job,\" he told Wired. \"Because I already know that if I'm down to my last $500, and all I have is a phone, I am going to get that job and I am going to learn more about that industry than anyone on the planet.\"\n\nHe wasn't joking. For the first three months, Cuban said he'd live on commission — focusing on one goal: becoming the top-performing salesperson in the building. After that, he'd cash in.\n\n\"Three months in, when I've demonstrated that I am the best salesperson in the history of that company, I'm going to walk into my boss' office and I'm going to tell him or her: ‘You're either going to pay me this amount of money to keep me, or I'm going to start my own business selling this stuff,'\" he said. \"That is exactly what I would do.\"\n\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nCuban built his career on this mindset. Before becoming a billionaire, he sold garbage bags door-to-door at 12, launched MicroSolutions out of his apartment, and made $5.7 billion selling Broadcast.com to Yahoo. From cold calls to billion-dollar exits, his pitch has always been his power.\n\nAnd on \"Shark Tank,\" it wasn't the backstory or the business plan that sealed the deal — it was the pitch. Cuban told GQ in 2023, \"You're not trying to convince people. You're trying to help them.\"\n\nNot everyone's built for sales. And not everyone wants to talk their way to the top. That doesn't mean they can't still be part of the next big thing.",

And if they wouldn't, you're probably not quite where you ought to be.\"\n\nWhen it comes to those gunning for the C-Suite, or maybe even his job, Robbins said you \"can't underestimate\" the value of EQ.\n\n\"The people who are wildly successful have this really incredible combination — in our industry — understand the technology, have high EQ, and really care about the mission of the team,\" he said.\n\nAs for himself, Robbins said he's always had a way to compartmentalize things he can't control. It's why he said he's nothing that is keeping him awake at night.\n\n\"Look, I've gone home where I've had a really bad day, and I look at my wife, and say, 'You want to hear the good news? I wasn't diagnosed with cancer today,'\" he said. \"And somebody was, and I wasn't. So if my worst day, if I'm not being diagnosed with cancer or some sort of terminal illness, tomorrow I'll get up and fight another fight. You just gotta have perspective.\"",

    "fullText": "That's the question laid-off workers are grappling with in the aftermath of losing their jobs. The No. 1 suspect is often artificial intelligence, but connecting the dots on how that led to their firing isn't always clear.\n\nJacob Zinkula has spoken to dozens of laid-off workers who are trying to piece together why they were let go.\n\nSome might deem those efforts fruitless. (Congrats on figuring it out! You're still unemployed.)\n\nA better understanding helps inform the next career move, and plenty of people could use that. This January saw more layoffs than any January since 2009.\n\nFurther muddying the waters is companies' reluctance to say AI drives layoffs. When Amazon made its first round of deep cuts last fall, many speculated it was due to AI. But CEO Andy Jassy said it was about \"culture,\" not AI or costs.\n\nIt's one thing to lose your job because of tech. It's another to hear you don't have the personality for it.\n\nThe way I see it, AI impacts layoffs in three main ways.\n\nAI took my job: While the most direct, it's also the least common these days. There aren't many examples of AI doing everything a human can at work. In most cases, there's still a need for some human interaction.\n\nAs much as it stinks to lose your job this way, at least it's a clear sign you need to change what you're doing. AI isn't coming for your job. It's already here.\n\nAI makes my job a lot easier: This applies to just about everyone. AI can't automate everything you do, but it can sure carry a lot of the load. At first glance, that seems like a good thing. But if AI enables you to do more with less, your company has the same benefit.\n\nSure, some will position it as an opportunity to supercharge their employees to drive more business. The more likely outcome is that this is an opportunity to reduce headcount.\n\nThe silver lining is that your job is still needed. There are just fewer opportunities out there, and you need to get really good at managing AI to get them.\n\nWe need to pay for this AI somehow: The most frustrating of the three. AI isn't directly impacting your job at all, but those tech bills aren't going to pay themselves. If you fall into this bucket, chances are you weren't driving a ton of revenue for the firm. (After all, why kill a cash cow when money is tight?)\n\nIt's a hard pill to swallow. However, it could serve as a wake-up call for how you approach your next gig. Like it or not, AI is the way forward for most companies. So if you're not helping a business reach that goal, you might need to reconsider what you're doing in the first place.",

    "description": "Surging prices in a corner of the tech market are inflating AI capex. Without that, there could be a \"notable deceleration\" in spending growth: RBC.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech's latest capex projections have shocked investors. Look beneath the headline numbers, though, and spending may actually be growing far more slowly.\n\nThat's according to new research on Monday from analysts at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAmazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are expected to spend almost $600 billion this year on data centers, chips, networking, and other related gear to meet surging AI demand.\n\nOn the surface, this may look like a relentless acceleration, but RBC's analysis suggests these growth numbers are being flattered by an unusual culprit: runaway memory prices.\n\nThe RBC analysts found that soaring prices for data center memory chips — including DRAM, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and NAND flash — could account for about 45% of the dollar growth in cloud capital expenditures for 2026. Crucially, most of that increase isn't coming from companies buying dramatically more hardware, but from paying much more for the same components, the analysts said.\n\nRBC estimates that data center memory spending across the top 10 hyperscalers will jump from about $107 billion in 2025 to roughly $237 billion in 2026. That $130 billion increase would represent about 45% of total capex growth at those companies. Even more striking, around three-quarters of the memory spend increase — roughly $98 billion — is attributable purely to higher prices, not higher unit volumes.\n\nThe price shock is severe. TrendForce projections cited by RBC show DRAM prices more than doubling in 2026, while NAND prices are expected to rise more than 85%. Memory has become one of the most constrained inputs in AI infrastructure, as advanced GPUs require large amounts of high-performance DRAM and HBM, while AI data centers consume massive quantities of flash storage.\n\nWhen RBC strips memory out of the equation, Big Tech's spending surge looks meaningfully different. Excluding memory costs, capex growth is projected to drop to about 40% in 2026, down from roughly 80% growth in 2025. That's still a strong expansion, but far less explosive than the raw capex totals imply.\n\nThe analysts described this as \"a notable deceleration,\" while adding that \"it's not necessarily cause for alarm.\"\n\nRBC argued that underlying AI investment remains robust, but warned that memory pricing is now the biggest wild card for capex trends heading into 2027.\n\nIn effect, Big Tech may be spending vastly more on some equipment — without building proportionally more — as the AI arms race collides with an overheated memory market.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender’s early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase\n\nMillions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDocuments published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.\n\nThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.\n\nEpstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.\n\nDocuments published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.\n\nIn communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.\n\nOn Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.\n\nIn communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.\n\nCharlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.\n\n“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.\n\nAs to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.\n\nCryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.\n\n“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.",

    "description": "OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said specialized AI, not AGI or LLMs, is a better future for the technology.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, many investors, founders, and tech giants often frame AI as an all-powerful force — something approaching omniscience.\n\nThey call it artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical system capable of matching or exceeding human reasoning across virtually all tasks and, beyond that, superintelligence, which would surpass human cognition altogether.\n\nAGI is the thing OpenAI and its competitors are racing to be the first to bring to life.\n\nThe industry isn't a monolith, however, nor are its builders.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, the now-viral personal AI assistant powering the agent-only social network, Moltbook, told the Y Combinator podcast on Saturday that he thinks the best AI is specialized, not generalized.\n\n\"What can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space?\" he said. \"As a group we specialize, as a larger society we specialize even more.\"\n\nHe said the same holds true for AI. Current AI systems are labeled as \"general.\" In practice, however, they are already specialized for particular tasks — like startups building models to solve Erdos math problems or identify gene mutations.\n\nWhile the hype around AI has largely focused on the types of models being built — from large language models to computer vision systems or even world models — some startups and tech giants are also experimenting with more focused, subject-specific forms of intelligence.\n\nAxiom, a startup founded by former Meta researcher Carina Hong and backed by $64 million in seed funding, for instance, is building specialized intelligence to tackle advanced mathematics.\n\nGoogle DeepMind has developed AlphaGenome, a system designed to predict how variants or mutations in human DNA affect a wide range of gene-regulating biological processes.\n\nCompanies are also developing smaller models, which could make it easier to build AI systems tailored to specific subjects or domains. Aidan Gomez, the CEO of Cohere, which builds AI technology for enterprises, told Business Insider in 2024 that there was increasing pressure to build \"smaller, more efficient models\" and to make them smarter with the right data and algorithms, rather than just scaling them.\n\nSteinberger is not the only one to push back against the idea of an all-powerful general intelligence.\n\nTimnit Gebru, a computer scientist who founded and leads the Distributed AI Research Institute, said AGI is a \"fictional thing\" in a November video published by Nature.\n\nShe said the backbone of engineering lies in building well-scoped, testable systems. The pursuit of a \"fictional, undefined 'machine god,'\" she said, is pushing the industry toward deeper labor exploitation and environmental damage.\n\nSteinberger, previously best known for launching the PDF processing company PSPDFKit, came out of retirement to build with AI. He said the technology has come a long way since he started, when his goal was simply to build \"something that could type stuff so my computer could do things.\"",

    "description": "Tech didn't just star in Super Bowl ads this year — it stumbled. While the stakes are high for advertisers, some glitches aren't always a bad thing.",
    "fullText": "A Super Bowl ad is meant to serve as a victory lap for tech companies. But on advertising's biggest night of the year, some brands were undone by the very thing they were supposed to be showcasing: technology.\n\nMr Beast and Salesforce teamed up to offer viewers a $1 million prize if they could be the first to crack clues hidden in a Super Bowl ad, and elsewhere, in an online treasure hunt. However, some hopeful contestants were immediately foiled by delays in receiving their registration emails.\n\nIn a message on the contest website, Salesforce said the glitch was caused by an \"overwhelming response\" to the competition and that it was working with major email providers to resolve the issue.\n\nMarc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, appeared to be pleased with the ad's performance, writing on X that more than 53 million people visited the campaign's landing page. \"Beyond any expectation we could have had,\" he wrote, adding that Mr Beast is \"an absolute genius.\"\n\nElsewhere, an ad that ran in the fourth quarter of the game for AI.com — a new platform launched by Crypto.com cofounder Kris Marszalek — invited viewers to visit the website to create a handle and create their own agents. But social media users said that the site was down for a period after the ad aired.\n\nMarszalek had spent $70 million to acquire the AI.com domain, which the deal's broker confirmed to the Financial Times was the highest-known price paid for a domain.\n\n\"Insane traffic levels. We prepared for scale, but not for THIS,\" Marszalek wrote on X. He later wrote that the site was \"hitting Google rate limits (which are at their absolute global maximum).\" The site was restored shortly afterward.\n\nThe stakes are high for Super Bowl advertisers. This year's broadcaster, NBCUniversal, confirmed that the average price to secure 30 seconds of airtime during the game reached $8 million, with some slots fetching $10 million. Then there's the additional investments in talent fees, production, and supporting ads and social activity beyond the TV ad.\n\nAs one of the few remaining mass-reach advertising vehicles — 127.7 million viewers tuned in last year, per the ratings company Nielsen — Super Bowl advertisers usually want to go out of their way to avoid mistakes. Sometimes brands can frame apparent tech flops as wins.\n\nLoz Horner, strategy partner at the ad agency Lucky Generals, which had previously produced Super Bowl campaigns for Amazon, said that while site crashes could cause some viewers to question the reliability of a company's tech, last night's glitches will likely play out well for Salesforce and AI.com.\n\n\"It builds the sense that this is a good thing that you should \"There probably isn't another advertising moment like the Super Bowl where if you run an ad saying, 'do something now,' you need to be ready for tens of millions of responses.\"\n\nIn 2022, Coinbase captured attention with a 60-second Super Bowl TV spot that simply featured a QR code bouncing around the screen like a DVD screensaver. Shortly after airing, Coinbase's app reportedly crashed for some users, while others showed error screens on the landing page. The company chalked it up as a win, saying the ad delivered 20 million hits to a landing page within a minute of it airing. The spot also won the 2022 Super Clio for best Super Bowl ad, an award judged by a jury of advertising experts.\n\nThis year, Coinbase went minimal again with a 60-second retro karaoke-machine-style ad that encouraged viewers to sing along to the Backstreet Boys' \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back),\" before revealing its logo at the very end.\n\nPrediction market platform Kalshi was another company hit by tech glitches during last night's Super Bowl. While the company couldn't advertise during the Super Bowl itself — prediction markets were placed on the NFL's prohibited advertising list last year — Kalshi had been heavily promoting bets related to the big game. However, the company said Sunday evening that some deposits and transfers on its app were delayed because of the high volume of traffic.",

I have yet to come up with a world-beating name for it, so for now let’s just call it “How bloody stupid is AI?” The playing of the game will change from player to player, depending on their circumstances – but essentially the rules remain the same. Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.\n\nIn my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.\n\nIt’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny. As a satirist, I have always been a fool for anything that points up the even greater folly of our leaders, the tools of their techbro masters or the true capabilities of our new robot overlords. Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”\n\nImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overview was “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically is not my wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:\n\nTextile designer Fiona Scott-Wilson.\n\nActor Fiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.\n\nJulia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this is the fantasy author, the illustrator, the late powerlifter or another Julia Mills altogether).\n\nWriter and journalist Emily Rees.\n\nLawyer and academic Siva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.\n\nWriter and journalist Carrie McLaren.\n\nChannel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman.\n\nCNN correspondent Clarissa Ward.\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Rachel Johnson.\n\nThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.\n\nThen it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does he exist?\n\nThere was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. Playwright Lee Hall got a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.\n\nAs for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).\n\nAnother search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalist Ann Widdecombe (his ex-wife), Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author, Polly Toynbee is a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”\n\nFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”\n\nI suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.\n\nWhile my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imagine that family Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.\n\nWe should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?\n\nI wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”\n\nMartin Rowson is a cartoonist and author",

    "title": "This Sci-Fi US Navy Destroyer Is $8 Billion Of Military Tech Floating At Sea",
    "description": "Right out of a sci-fi movie, this US Navy stealth ship comes with an $8 billion price tag and an incredible level of high-tech weaponry and capability.",
    "fullText": "When the U.S. Navy commissioned its Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG-1000) in 2016, it hailed the warship as the most advanced surface combatant in the world. Equipped with a state-of-the-art stealth design, revolutionary electric propulsion and integrated power mechanisms, and twin Advanced Gun Systems, the 16,000-ton Zumwalt was touted as being larger, more advanced, and more difficult to detect than any destroyer the world had ever seen.\n\nHowever, several shortcomings, including runaway costs and underwhelming performance, caused the Navy to reduce order numbers from the proposed 32 to three, raising doubts in the Navy's ability to deliver advanced warships. Ultimately, the Zumwalt suffered from two major problems. The first was its incredible cost, as the $8 billion per-ship price tag made it impractical for largescale manufacturing and deployment. Second, its advanced designs were poorly suited for the Navy's intended usage as a land support ship, where stealth features are less important. As such, U.S. leadership determined the Zumwalt was an expensive square peg for the Navy's shore-support round hole, rendering it a floating money pit without a definitive mission.\n\nThis disconnect prompted the U.S. Navy to begin the arduous task of updating its most expensive destroyer, replacing the 155mm guns with hypersonic missiles. The first ship of its kind to sport an intercontinental missile system, the Zumwalt is one of a host of global destroyers adding high-tech weapons systems to address a changing threat landscape. The update recasts the Zumwalt as part of the U.S.'s long range strike operations, an increasingly important strategic priority, perhaps best exemplified by the nuclear missile test in November 2025. Having completed a round of post-modernization sea trials in January 2026, this sci-fi stealth ship may finally be ready to take its place at the head of U.S. Naval strategy.\n\nWhen the DDG-1000 was commissioned, it was lauded for its novel stealth designs. Despite constituting an approximate 40% jump in size from its Arleigh Burke-class predecessor, the 610-foot Zumwalt's radar cross section matches that of a 50-foot fishing vessel. Employing many of the same stealth design principles of fighter jets, the Zumwalt eschewed typical design structures, instead using an angular, wave-piercing tumblehome hull and a deckhouse constructed of electromagnetic wave-absorbing composite materials to lower the ship's radar footprint.\n\nAdd acoustics that more closely resemble a submarine, and the Zumwalt is roughly 50 times more clandestine than the Arleigh Burke destroyers. Another major development was the Zumwalt's electric propulsion system. Powered by a revolutionary integrated power network, it's capable of generating 78 megawatts, nearly as much as a nuclear aircraft carrier.\n\nThe massive size allows the Zumwalt to host a diverse array of aircraft, including Joint Strike Fighters, drones, and MV-22 Osprey, initially seen as a boon for its position alongside amphibious and littoral combat ships. To support these near-shore operations, the ship was equipped with two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS). With a range of 62 nautical miles, the Navy intended the AGS' Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles to fill the Naval Surface Fire Support void left by the 1992 retirement of the Iowa-class battleship.\n\nUnfortunately, the technological advancements of the Navy's sci-fi stealth ship came at a price. Over its 11-year development, costs skyrocketed to$23 billion. To put such astronomical numbers in perspective, the US Navy's new nuclear supercarrier, the Gerald R. Ford-class, costs $13 billion. Ammunition alone proved a financial disaster for the Zumwalt, as each round cost over $800,000, forcing a purchase cut from 20,000 to 2,400 units.\n\nFurther complicating things, the Zumwalt's expensive stealth advancements were ill-suited for the Navy's planned near-shore use, where crowded waterways and clear sightlines nullify much of its anti-radar capability. Between rising costs and competing design priorities, Naval planners largely viewed the Zumwalt-class destroyers as an expensive ship without a mission. Since canceling its ammunition order, however, the Navy has begun to reorient the Zumwalt away from close shore combat and towards clandestine operations and long range missile strikes.\n\nThis repurposing began in August 2023, when the DDG-1000 underwent a 3-year modernization effort.  Part of which involved replacing the Advanced Gun Systems with a state-of-the-art Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapons system that carries Common Hypersonic Glide Bodies capable of worldwide range at speeds up to Mach 5. Through these efforts, the Navy hopes that the CPS system will shift the Zumwalt-class destroyer into a key cog of its global force-projection efforts, particularly in the Pacific theatre.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

She was 7-for-11 from 3-point range and had seven assists.\n\nSakima Walker scored 18 points and Mjracle Sheppard had 14 points and eight assists for Cal, which was coming off a win at Georgia Tech.\n\nThe Bears (15-10, 6-6 ACC) jumped to a 54-32 halftime lead and kept a double-digit edge throughout the second half against the Panthers (8-17, 1-11) while winning for the fifth time in six games.\n\n\"I thought we came out with the right mindset, and were really good in the first half,\" Cal coach Charmin Smith said. \"Obviously, we made shots offensively and we were locked in defensively and did a really good job. We struggled to keep that momentum in the second half, but we're on the road in ACC play, so I'm happy that we got a sweep, and this helps us have momentum. … These were games that we had to win, so we took care of business.\"\n\nTheresa Hagans' 19 points led the Pittsburgh.\n\nGeorgia Tech 74, Stanford 52: In Atlanta, freshman Lara Samfai scored a season-high 19 points and Hailee Swain added 10, but the Cardinal (16-9, 5-7 ACC) were held to 33% shooting in a loss to the Yellow Jackets (11-14, 6-7).\n\nStanford trailed by six after the first quarter, then saw its deficit grow to 15 at halftime after being held to seven points in the second quarter. The Cardinal closed to within 45-39 in the third quarter only to see Georgia Tech close the period with a 10-2 run.\n\nStanford was scoreless for a nearly six-minute stretch in the second quarter, had a four-minute drought in the third quarter and was blanked in the final 4:32 as Georgia Tech closed with a 7-0 run.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets also won the rebound battle 42-39 and outscored the Cardinal in the paint 30-20.\n\n\"Stanford's tough, they've got a lot of length, there's a lot of height on that team,\" Georgia Tech coach Karen Blair said. \"So to outrebound that team … our team was disciplined. We were disciplined with the boxouts when we needed to.\"\n\nThis article originally published at Local college basketball: Lulu Twidale scores 32 as Cal women win; Stanford falls to Georgia Tech.",

    "fullText": "A Friday bounce may have left some investors feeling better heading into the weekend, but a violent sell-off in tech names focused on the software industry this past week had Wall Street strategists trying to steady clients' nerves across the investment world.\n\nSoftware names were crushed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday last week as investors priced in even more aggressive disruptions to these businesses amid AI advances, with the uptake of Anthropic’s Claude Code the latest source of angst.\n\nHow much are Big Tech companies spending on AI?\n\nWhich sectors are outperforming tech stocks currently?\n\nWhat caused the massive software stock sell-off this week?\n\nAre software stock declines considered overdone by strategists?\n\nAnd despite a rebound on Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted a weekly decline of more than 2%, with software giants Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) shares falling more than 9%, among a host of other names in the space that also dropped.\n\nStill, the magnitude of the selling had several strategists urging patience and suggesting these moves may have actually overshot the potential risks facing these industries.\n\n\"You're getting to a point where this probably seems overdone,\" Invesco chief global market strategist Brian Levitt told Yahoo Finance last week. \"We've seen some names taken out pretty significantly.\"\n\n\"Clearly, there's concern about what some artificial intelligence programs are going to mean for different software businesses, but we've seen some names taken out pretty significantly,\" he added.\n\nStrategists believe the disruption won't be severe across all companies.\n\n\"Larger software companies that are positioned to adapt, [they're] going to be fine,\" said JonesTrading chief market strategist Mike O'Rourke. \"The problem is there are new risks out there.\"\n\nO’Rourke said productivity commentary during Alphabet’s earnings call only reinforced “the alarm” the market has sounded about AI agents.\n\nEarnings from Big Tech giants over the last week also revealed the sheer amount of capital being poured into AI, as capital expenditures from Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are set to top $650 billion.\n\n\"Investors are now kind of being more discerning,\" Dave Mazza, CEO of Roundhill Investors, told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\n“People are really pulling back before they begin to say, 'How much do I want to value a company even if it's growing,' knowing that they’re moving from a capital-light industry to maybe a more capital-intensive industry?” he added.\n\nMazza mentioned that there are still areas of the market that remain undervalued, such as Consumer Staples (XLP) and Energy (XLE).\n\nNotably, cyclical and defensive sectors have also outperformed tech (XLK), which is negative for the year.",

    "description": "Hassan Ismail cofounded a defense tech startup in Canada. He found the country's regulations difficult to navigate, and the investors too risk-averse.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hassan Ismail, the 24-year-old cofounder of Yellowcake, who lives in Toronto. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2021, there was a government bid in Canada for some military hardware. My cofounder and I officially founded West Tek Defense Corporation in August 2022. We were doing smart rifles for the military.\n\nIt was complicated. (At one point, we were literally balancing redox equations for propellant in the ammo.) The physics background we both had helped a lot; essentially, everything we saw was something we'd encountered in a class or during personal research.\n\nWe spent about three years on the entire process. Ultimately, we found out it wasn't going to work — mostly because of regulation.\n\nWe spoke to the head of the civilian side of procurement for the bid, and we were flat-out told something like: \"There's no reason for us to consider you. We don't even care.\" For us to even find the contact for who was running the bid, it was a bunch of dead links. We had to go pester extremely high officials to get us the appropriate contact.\n\nTo be able to produce firearms in America, you need an FFL. You go through a pretty standard process: apply, background check, reason.\n\nIn Canada, the equivalent of an FFL is a BFL. We weren't able to get a BFL until we had a contract. We had to convince some type of agency, as two kids, to buy an idea. Almost all of them at first would be receptive: \"Sure, can we see this thing?\" We'd have to awkwardly explain to them: \"Well, you have to order them before I can even produce them, because of government regulation.\"\n\nJustifiably, most of them were like, \"Nope.\"\n\nWe took this terrible 3D-printed demo to the law enforcement in Northwest Ontario. It was falling apart. I could tell they pitied us.\n\nIt was regulatory law after regulatory law. After a while, we did finally get our BFL.\n\nIt turns out, if you want to subcontract this — which you will if you're a startup, because the startup doesn't have millions to start some manufacturing project — whoever you subcontract to needs their own BFL.\n\nIt really seemed that it was tailored against any kind of startup or disruptor to come in and break the status quo.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was that a lot of manufacturing businesses are going under here. Every time we'd reach out to a company, they'd either say they don't have the budget to help us, or they would and then would call us back later and say something to the effect of, \"We're going bankrupt.\"\n\nInvestors would say: Until you guys lock in these contracts, this $1 billion government bid, we're not going to touch it. These guys were looking for fourth- or fifth-time founders who already had multi-hundred-million-dollar exits.\n\nOne of our angels, who was the first money in, is on the board of a Big Tech company. He wrote us a $50,000 angel check. We'd pitch investors on that — and Canadian investors wouldn't care.\n\nAmerican investors were interested, but the issue was that they were interested in American defense, not really Canadian defense. They also had a lot of compliance issues with investing in foreign defense.\n\nWe ended up shuttering that. We still have the patents. The tech is still ready to go.\n\nWe got into the University of Waterloo's accelerator and started a new SaaS startup.\n\nThis startup is a Delaware C Corp. American investors — who rightfully want to invest in American companies, because it's what they're familiar with — are far more friendly and open-minded.\n\nMany Canadian investors have very hostile agreement conditions. One investor wanted to do CA$100,00 at a $3-5 million valuation. For reference, we ended up raising our round at $1.6 million at a $10 million post-money capitalization in America. They were offering less than a fraction. It's brutal.\n\nEveryone in our cap table is American, or Canadian expats living in America. None of our investors are actually living in Canada.\n\nWe'd like to move the business to New York. We think it is going to be the next tech hub. Clay CEO Kareem Amin is a McGill grad. He's Canadian. He also lets us co-work in his office in Chelsea.\n\nYC initially deciding not to invest in Canadian corporations is totally justifiable. There are a lot of Canadian founders in YC. What that's telling them is: Canadians aren't even confidant in building Canadian companies. They're all moving to America anyway.\n\nI understand their decision to reverse it. The backlash was coming from a place of political climate and ignorance. A lot of people were seeing it as YC sticking the middle finger to Canada.\n\nEveryone that we know, as well as Canadian YC founders that we know and love, have all said the same thing: This is a stupid debacle.\n\nWe all understand why YC did it.",

    "description": "Two AI researchers said the 996 work culture, which is gaining traction in Silicon Valley, can lead to burnout for tech workers.",
    "fullText": "The AI wars are driving a more demanding work culture in Silicon Valley that some insiders worry is burning workers out.\n\nA \"996\" work schedule, in which employees work six days a week from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., has been well established in China and is taking hold in the San Francisco tech scene. While Silicon Valley has long been known for an intense work culture, some companies have recently adopted the more rigid 996 work schedule.\n\nNathan Lambert, a senior research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, and Sebastian Raschka, an AI research lab founder, joined podcaster Lex Fridman in a recent episode about artificial intelligence. When asked about 996 culture in Silicon Valley, Raschka said what he's seen is not exactly the same as in China, but it's trending that way.\n\nThe current landscape of the tech industry consists of AI models leapfrogging each other to try to stay ahead of their competitors. For startups, the pressure to make it big can lead to grueling work schedules for employees.\n\n\"It's really hard because you have to deliver constantly,\" Raschka said.\n\nRaschka said both passion and competition are driving the grind mindset in Silicon Valley. He got a taste of this work culture while working as an academic in AI. He said he wasn't forced to overwork; he chose to.\n\nLambert said this mindset is showing up in some of the most recognizable companies in San Francisco and the AI industry.\n\n\"That's what OpenAI and Anthropic are like,\" he said, saying that employees commit to the high-pressure culture because they want to do the work, particularly the programmers.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nStill, Lambert said that the environment can come at a \"human expense,\" including lost time with family, closed-mindedness toward the rest of the world, and, sometimes, health issues.\n\n\"You can only do this for so long, and people are definitely burning out,\" he said.\n\nFor Raschka, the toll was back and neck pain from skipping breaks that he said he should've taken.\n\nIt's an environment that young programmers may have to brave if they want to make their mark in AI.\n\n\"If you're really passionate about wanting to have an impact in AI, being physically in SF is the most likely place where you're going to do this,\" Lambert said. \"But it has trade-offs.\"",

    "description": "Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said there are three big traits the people \"who are wildly successful\" in tech all share.",
    "fullText": "Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins says he hates interviewing internal candidates for promotions.\n\n\"I think when we have two or three internal candidates for a promotion, the whole interview process is stupid,\" Robbins said during a recent interview on TBPN. \"What are we going to learn about them when we sit down in a room for 30 minutes and ask them questions when we can watch them work?\"\n\nThis frustration, Robbins said, translates into his belief that \"every day you're working is an interview for your next job.\"\n\nRobbins, who started at Cisco in 1997 as an account manager, said it's also not enough to simply strive to climb higher and higher on the corporate ladder.\n\n\"You also have to have people who care about making sure their peers are successful as well,\" he said. \"The person who is solely focused on getting to the top as an individual, it's probably not going to happen for them.\"\n\nThere's a simple exercise, Robbins said, that people should use when envisioning their promotion.\n\n\"If your peer group would look at your promotion announcement and go, 'that makes perfect sense,' then you've done your job, right?\" he said. \"And if you can't look in the mirror and say, 'OK, those people, would they be happy, would they believe it's the right decision?' And if they wouldn't, you're probably not quite where you ought to be.\"\n\nWhen it comes to those gunning for the C-Suite, or maybe even his job, Robbins said you \"can't underestimate\" the value of EQ.\n\n\"The people who are wildly successful have this really incredible combination — in our industry — understand the technology, have high EQ, and really care about the mission of the team,\" he said.\n\nAs for himself, Robbins said he's always had a way to compartmentalize things he can't control. It's why he said he's nothing that is keeping him awake at night.\n\n\"Look, I've gone home where I've had a really bad day, and I look at my wife, and say, 'You want to hear the good news? I wasn't diagnosed with cancer today,'\" he said. \"And somebody was, and I wasn't. So if my worst day, if I'm not being diagnosed with cancer or some sort of terminal illness, tomorrow I'll get up and fight another fight. You just gotta have perspective.\"",

    "title": "What's the future of the software business look like? Our top tech columnist weighs in.",
    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about what AI means for the future of the software business.",
    "fullText": "Software stocks had a brutal week, aside from a Friday rally, extending what has been a rough year for the industry. I touched base with our tech columnist, Ali Barr, the best I know on AI business models. He also wrote this piece in the midst of the selloff.\n\nAli, you've been covering AI adoption and costs by big business since you started our Tech Memo newsletter. What's your gut on whether the recent selloff was overblown?\n\nSoftware business models have underpinned the tech industry for decades. Companies invest heavily upfront to build software, but each additional copy costs almost nothing to distribute. So revenue scales faster than costs, driving fat profit margins. That dynamic helps explain why Microsoft, the world's largest software company, is so valuable.\n\nAI challenges this model. If this new technology makes employees more productive, companies may need fewer software subscriptions. And as AI tools improve, businesses could replace existing software with AI-driven workflows or even build their own software using AI coding tools. Finally, if software companies embrace AI, that could make their services more expensive to run than traditional software. That would mean rising usage doesn't automatically translate into soaring profitability.\n\nIf software in the AI era becomes less profitable and grows more slowly, then it's logical that the stock prices of software companies might fall. A lot.\n\nBig Tech spending on AI data centers and other infrastructure is set to soar again this year. How will these companies generate a return on these huge investments?\n\nThe numbers are breathtaking. Just two companies, Google and Amazon, are planning capex of almost $400 billion in 2026. A couple more years of the same, and that's more than $1 trillion.\n\nTo get a return on this, they will have to come up with new revenue of well over $1 trillion in future years. AI is amazing and really useful, but it's hard for some investors to see how this happens. Even if new AI products are awesome, do consumers and companies have enough money to buy all this stuff? I don't know. One outcome could be that Big Tech giants make do with slimmer profit margins in an AI future. That's similar to the concerns that have hammered software stocks lately.\n\nWho are the most-interesting people to watch in the sector?\n\nI pay attention to Andrej Karpathy. He was director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI. He's pretty independent nowadays, which means what he says about AI can be trusted more. Bonus: He coined the term \"vibe coding.\"\n\nAditya Agarwal was Facebook's first head of product engineering. He was also CTO and VP of engineering at Dropbox. He's a coding powerhouse. Recently, he used Claude to do some coding and was stunned by the power of this tool. \"I am filled with wonder and also a profound sadness,\" he wrote on X. \"We will never ever write code by hand again. It doesn't make any sense to do so. Something I was very good at is now free and abundant.\"\n\nI'm usually skeptical, but the start of 2026 feels like a moment of highly disruptive — and destructive — change.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Singapore (AP) — This week’s Singapore Air Show brought together trade delegations from around the world to show off the latest in civilian and military aviation technology.\n\nThe event this year marked the 10th edition of the air show, which showcased cutting-edge planes from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force. This included the F-35 Lightning II, the latest U.S.-made fifth-generation fighter jet that has integrated stealth technology and is considered one of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.\n\nMajor commercial plane makers also touted the latest advancements in their fleets, including Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Boeing and China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC.\n\n“We have a very good representation of the latest and the greatest,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, which organizes the event. “The Singapore Air Show, the unique part of it is we cover both the aviation and also the defense industries.”\n\nDuring the Singapore Air Show's aerial displays, COMAC promoted its C919 passenger jet, which China is pushing as an alternative to the European Airbus A320neo and the American Boeing 737 MAX. The daily aerial displays at the event also showcased six military teams and Airbus’ A350-1000.\n\nWithin the exhibition hall, the air show featured experimental air taxis, advanced flight simulators, a wide variety of drones and both manned and unmanned helicopters. The static aircraft display under Singapore’s sizzling sun included roughly 35 planes from more than 10 countries.\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 companies from around 50 countries participated in the air show, hosted on the grounds of Changi International Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest airport. The event, which opened on Feb. 3, is considered Asia’s largest aerospace and defense exhibition and runs through Feb. 8.\n\n“All the exhibitors can use Singapore as a springboard to then tap into the opportunities that are rising in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key driver that is driving the growth of the global aviation industry,\" Lam said.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "fullText": "One of these companies is not like the others.\n\nIf you’ve been following the Big Tech companies’ earnings reports, you know that they’re pouring more than ever into capital expenditure to pursue their AI futures.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft all spent record sums last quarter on purchases of property and equipment — largely tied AI chips and data centers. And for the companies that offered forward-looking guidance, their capex plans for the year blew analysts’ already generous estimates out of the water.\n\nAmazon expects its 2026 capex to surge to $200 billion. Google is aiming for $175 billion to $185 billion. Meta estimates it will spend between $115 billion and $135 billion. All of those figures came in well above expectations and, for the most part, have weighed on their stocks. Microsoft didn’t give a formal 2026 capex outlook, but if its peers are any indication, spending will likely exceed the roughly $114 billion Wall Street expects for the calendar year.\n\nOf the Big Tech companies, just one stands apart this earnings season. Apple’s capital expenditure, already just a fraction of its peers, actually declined in the December quarter from a year earlier.\n\nFor better or worse, Apple has struck its own path with AI. As we’ve argued before, it’s embracing AI but is not an AI company. Instead, it’s chosen a hybrid model, relying on both first- and third-party data centers — a move that keeps a significant amount of infrastructure spending off its balance sheet. And while Apple has said it expects capex to increase as it invests more heavily in AI, particularly to support its Private Cloud Compute, those outlays remain minimal compared with its peers.\n\nYou can see that approach reflected in Apple’s decision to use Google’s Gemini, rather than an in-house model, to power the next generation of Siri and Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe Google deal, reportedly worth about $1 billion a year, gives Apple access to a top-tier AI model for pennies on the dollar compared to what other Big Tech companies are spending to build their own.\n\nOf course, it also means Apple won’t fully own a technology that some see as powering the next industrial revolution. But if that revolution fails to materialize — or takes longer than expected — Apple won’t be left holding the most expensive bag in Silicon Valley history.",

    "fullText": "The race to dominate the burgeoning AI market is pushing tech giants to adopt business models reminiscent of IBM's (IBM) in the 1960s.\n\nBig Tech \"hyperscalers\" Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) are all in various stages of developing their own custom AI chips to put in their data centers and power their cloud and software offerings. Alphabet, the farthest along of the four companies, is even reportedly in talks to sell its physical chips called TPUs to Meta — a move that would see it go head-to-head with leading chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nThose efforts have led Bloomberg Intelligence analysts to predict the custom AI chip market will grow to $122 billion by 2033.\n\nBig Tech's production of their own components goes beyond chips: Microsoft and Amazon are actively investing in dark fiber, or currently unused fiber-optic cables that are already underground, RBC Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Atkin said in a recent note to clients. Google and Meta also own their own cables but still buy from third parties, he wrote. Those cables are necessary to connect companies' data centers and the enterprises that use them.\n\nThe dynamic in which cloud providers are making their own components (hardware) to run their core products (software) shows Silicon Valley swinging back toward vertical integration — an operating model pioneered by oil and steel tycoons in the late 19th century and adopted by IBM during the digital revolution.\n\nIBM was one of the most successful vertically integrated companies in the 1960s, when it made the hardware components for its mainframes, or large computer systems. IBM's strategy emerged from the idea that making its own specialized parts would improve its end product (mainframes) and profit margins — and amid concerns over supply shortages of parts for early computers. It worked: In 1985, the company accounted for more than half the market value of the computer industry, Carliss Y. Baldwin noted in her book \"Design Rules.\"\n\nOf course, that all fell apart later. In the 1990s, the falling costs of producing semiconductors — as well as the rise of software powerhouse Microsoft and chip leader Intel — dug into IBM's once-formidable competitive moat, and the company no longer claimed to be vertically integrated by 2000, Baldwin said.\n\nJust as the emergence of computers pushed IBM toward vertical integration, the popularization of AI since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 has put today's cloud giants on a similar trajectory. In particular, the steep costs of Nvidia's chips and their limited availability have pushed tech giants to advance their AI chip efforts. Those custom chips are cheaper and better optimized for the companies' software.",

    "description": "AI bubble fears have led to billions erased from tech CEOs’ net worth overnight—and Oracle founder Larry Ellison has been hit the hardest this year.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to the world’s richest billionaires, tech founders litter the top of the list. AI has been heralded as a multitrillion-dollar industry, catapulting many founders to extreme wealth; but now AI bubble fears and doubts over valuations have led to billions erased from CEOs’ net worth overnight. For Larry Ellison, whose net worth has been hardest hit, that looks like a $59.2 billion loss since the year started—and we’re only in February.\n\nAfter months of eyebrow-raising over software stocks and AI’s impact on the sector, a selloff on Tuesday triggered the loss of billions among the wealthiest. In the few days since then, Ellison has watched his wealth slide by $19 billion, according to current data from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s fortune has dropped by $14 billion.\n\nThe Tuesday selloff, turbocharged by Anthropic’s new legal AI tool, also sent the already dwindling fortunes of software billionaires to tumble even harder. Following the broad selloff that saw the S&P 500 software and services index fall by nearly 4%, at least $62 billion was wiped from the net worth of the industry’s wealthiest entrepreneurs so far this year, according to a Bloomberg analysis of its Billionaires Index.\n\nBut the three founders of advertising platform AppLovin saw the biggest relative decline in wealth in the aftermath in the selloff; CEO Adam Foroughi lost 31% of his net worth since the start of the year, around $7.8 billion, while former CTO John Krystynak’s fortune was shaved down 30% after a $2.4 billion blow. Fellow AppLovin cofounder Andrew Karam also emerged from the selloff 29% less rich than at the start of 2026.\n\nDespite building the world’s most valuable company thanks to AI advancements, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also faced a decline; he’s lost $7 billion since the selloff earlier this week, and is down nearly $12 billion this year. And the net worth of Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, has gone through the wringer this week. Relative to his peers, he’s only lost a modest $5 billion after Tuesday—but since the start of 2026, almost $29 billion has been wiped from Ballmer’s name.\n\nTechnology has proved a gold rush, with the industry minting new entrepreneurial millionaires and billionaires yearly. Take a look at the top 10 richest U.S. billionaires, who added a whopping $698 billion to their net worth between 2024 and 2025, according to a 2025 Oxfam report, and the sector’s financial power comes to light.",

    "description": "Laid-off workers are wondering whether AI played a role in their job losses, and what it means for their next career moves.",
    "fullText": "When Kent Ha was laid off from his digital marketing role at Intel last July, he'd been mentally preparing for the possibility that his job could be cut — in part due to AI.\n\nPrior layoff rounds had left him concerned about his job security. Plus, earlier that year, Intel announced plans to outsource much of his division's work to Accenture, which it said would use AI to enhance its marketing efforts.\n\n\"That made it seem even more likely that our group would be hit,\" said Ha, who's in his 30s and based in Portland, Oregon.\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken with dozens of white-collar workers who had recently been laid off — and were left wondering why. Those who weren't aware of any personal performance concerns pointed to a variety of possible explanations, including cost-cutting, the Great Flattening, and pandemic-era overhiring. And one question came up over and over: Is AI to blame?\n\nAs companies pour money into AI, it remains unclear if the technology will replace jobs — or create new ones. While some have signaled that replacing human employees is the goal, others haven't been as clear. Instead, they've cut jobs while simultaneously funding significant AI investments, leaving workers to connect the dots.\n\nUS employers cited AI as responsible for nearly 55,000 planned layoffs last year, per Challenger — up from about 17,000 combined in the two years prior. As pressure mounts to show returns on AI investments, companies may respond by tightening performance standards — and ultimately, shedding the workers who can't keep up.\n\nStill, most companies stop short of pointing the finger at AI. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. Amazon also cited efficiency and culture as a reason for cuts.\n\nRegarding the layoffs that affected Ha, an Intel spokesperson said the company is \"taking steps to become a leaner, faster and more efficient company.\"\n\nThe workers puzzling out AI's role in their layoffs aren't just trying to process the news — they want to better assess what they're up against in today's job market. To thrive in an AI-driven future, they know they may need to learn new skills and explore new roles. They just want to know if the future they've been fearing has already arrived.\n\nWhen Joe Friend learned in May that he, along with thousands of others at Microsoft, had lost their jobs, he \"wasn't entirely surprised by the layoffs,\" he said. \"I was surprised to get caught up in them.\"\n\nFriend, who's in his 60s and lives in Washington state, was a director of product management overseeing a team of nine. He said he saw speculation online that the layoffs were tied to productivity gains from Microsoft's AI investments — that AI had effectively \"eaten\" people's jobs. However, he said he hadn't seen much evidence that AI was significantly boosting productivity — and suspects the cuts were more about freeing up money for those investments.\n\n\"I think these are cuts to offset the huge expenditures that are being made into the structure for AI,\" he said. \"So in that way, AI has eaten your job, but not in terms of AI creating productivity gains.\"\n\nIan Carter, another laid-off Microsoft worker, also pointed to the company's large investments in AI, as well as what he saw as overhiring during the pandemic. While pursuing roles similar to his former technical program manager position, he also began developing his AI skills — noting that job postings increasingly signaled demand for that expertise.\n\nWhich jobs will be most vulnerable to AI takeover has been a topic of speculation for years. James Hwang, who lost his Amazon job in October, said he knew that his role — providing IT support for Amazon employees — could be at some risk of automation. Plus, last June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he expected AI-driven efficiency gains would eventually lead to a smaller workforce.\n\nStill, while Hwang's team had started using AI to help troubleshoot issues, he didn't think the tech was there yet. He's currently applying to similar IT support roles and hasn't shifted his job search strategy in response to AI concerns.\n\n\"Amazon is not at that stage yet where AI can do our job,\" said Hwang, who's in his 20s and lives in Michigan. \"For us, AI is a tool, because there needs to be a human touch for support.\"\n\nFriend and Hwang are among several laid-off workers who told Business Insider they believe AI's role in their cuts had less to do with automating jobs and more to do with freeing up cash, in part to fund AI investments. But in the end, the financial impact is the same for those who lost their jobs. Going forward, Friend said he plans to be highly selective about his next role, as he believes job security is becoming harder to find in the tech industry.\n\nLaid-off workers who wonder whether AI played a role in their job loss may never get a clear answer.\n\nA company's decision to conduct layoffs is often shaped by a mix of factors — from financial pressures to shifting priorities. And even when leadership offers an explanation for the cuts, it may reflect only part of the story — shaped as much by messaging strategy as by internal reasoning.\n\nNinety percent of analysts surveyed recently by Goldman Sachs said AI hadn't yet affected employment levels at the companies they cover — but 60% expected it to drive lower employment over the next five years.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, some laid-off workers have decided to build AI skills to prepare for the evolving job market.\n\nIn his prior role in product at a software development company, Lee Givens Jr. saw colleagues leave for firms eager to shell out big salaries for AI talent. So when was laid off in 2023, he began thinking about how to better position himself in a tech industry that had clearly shifted toward AI.\n\nGivens Jr. decided to study AI frameworks relevant to his field, hoping it would make him a more attractive candidate. He said he believes that investment paid off, helping him later land a staff product manager role at a Toyota subsidiary, where he's now putting his AI knowledge to work.\n\n\"When there's a major technological shift — like the rise of the internet or AI — you have to reinvent yourself,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "If you work for a San Francisco startup and don't know how to code, you could soon be asked to get creative with vibe coding.\n\nCheckr, an AI-powered background check company, gave Business Insider a glimpse of how employees are actually using AI.\n\nCheckr CEO Daniel Yanisse said that the company is going \"all in\" and trying everything to encourage its employees to fully embrace AI — including staff that don't work in engineering roles.\n\n\"We really pride ourselves on using AI to the maximum possible amount,\" said Yanisse. \"We gave every employee a monthly stipend to try AI tools, and we did AI days and demos. After one year, 95% of the employees use prompting daily.\"\n\n\"This year, we're going to level up and move to building with AI, as in vibe coding,\" Yanisse added. \"I'm working with all of our teams now, and we're going to do our AI days soon in March, where we're going to make every non-technical person vibe code their own business apps.\"\n\nYanisse said that many employees who have no idea how to code, who work in finance, legal, and HR, are already vibecoding apps to automate their workflows and problem-solve, such as building tools that help clean up large spreadsheets.\n\nWhile Checkr is evaluating a variety of builder tools like Lovable, Replit, and Claude Code, Yanisse said Cursor is a clear standout and \"has amazing adoption\" among both engineers and non-technical staff, but Lovable is the best place to start for people with no coding experience.\n\n\"Probably, we're going to buy all of them and just use the right tool for the right person,\" Yanisse said of different AI coding tools.\n\n\"We have AI solution engineers who are available to actually partner and help, so they would come and help you and unstuck you if you have a problem, and take you all the way to success,\" Yanisse added. \"And then you're on your way because then we share success stories with everyone in the company.\"\n\nIn practice, data shows that AI adoption can be complicated in a large enterprise. Competence with AI tools can be very uneven across the board, and security risks can mount without clear guidelines on AI usage.\n\nAccording to a survey published in November by Moveworks, an AI-powered platform that automates IT and HR support, most executives said that non-technical employees are playing a bigger role in driving AI use, and that 78% have seen successful AI projects originate directly from support staff looking to solve daily challenges.\n\nThe National Cybersecurity Alliance also wrote in its Annual Cybersecurity Attitudes and Behaviors Report that AI adoption has surged to 65% globally as of the end of 2025, but more than half of these AI users never received any training in privacy and security risks. The report surveyed over 6,500 workers worldwide.\n\n\"A few years ago, most businesses were still debating whether AI was something they really needed,\" Louis Riat-Bonello of Optisearch, an AI-powered marketing platform that specializes in SEO, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The businesses getting the best results aren't blindly chasing automation. They're using AI to support smarter decisions, move faster, and free up teams to focus on strategy and creativity,\" Riat-Bonello added. \"That balance is what will matter long after the hype fades.\"\n\nYanisse said that in the age of AI, the company is looking for creative and adaptable people, because while AI will eliminate some roles, it will create others.\n\n\"We are constantly training and helping people update their skills and careers,\" said Yanisse. \"The job of the product designer and the job of the marketer are all completely shifting right now.\"\n\n\"We're over 900 people, so we're not a small startup, but I'm a startup guy, and I'm a builder,\" Yanisse added. \"The people who come here need to be OK with uncertainty, be self-driven, adaptable, flexible, willing to do new things, and solve new problems without too much guidance or structure.\"",

    "fullText": "After a much-needed week off, the Virginia Tech Hokies (16-7, 5-5) are back on the hardwood for a noon tipoff Saturday in Raleigh against the North Carolina State Wolfpack (17-6, 8-2). This game kicks off a critical stretch for the Hokies, who will face the Wolfpack on Saturday, followed by games against No. 20 Clemson, Florida State and Miami over the next 10 days. Clemson, N.C. State and Miami are all ahead of the Hokies in the ACC standings.\n\nThe Wolfpack are not yet a lock for the NCAA Tournament, but are trending in that direction. They’ve won five in a row and seven of their last eight games, with their most impressive wins coming against Clemson and SMU.\n\nN.C. State features a balanced offense with at least four players averaging 13 points per game. Senior forward Derrion Williams leads the Pack, averaging 15 per game. The Wolfpack’s top interior scorer is senior Van-Allen Lubin, while the trio of Paul McNeil Jr., Quadir Copeland and Tre Holloman make up an impressive backcourt.\n\nWe learned some unfortunate news on Thursday when Virginia Tech head coach Mike Young said sophomore guard Tyler Johnson would be out again for the Hokies on Saturday. Last weekend, Young was optimistic that Johnson would play against the Wolfpack. Unfortunately, Young said he wasn’t quite ready, but he is on track to return soon in Tech’s current stretch of games.\n\nJunior forward Amani Hansberry leads the Hokies in scoring at 15 points per game, while sophomore guard Ben Hammond (12.8), freshman Neoklis Avdalas (12.5), Tobi Lawal (11.1) and Jailen Bedford (11.0) are all scoring in double figures. Junior guard Jaden Schutt averages almost nine points per game off the bench. Johnson averages 10 points and five rebounds per game, but has missed the last 10 games.\n\nA key for the Hokies is preventing the Wolfpack from taking uncontested 3-pointers. N.C. State is 11th in college basketball in 3-pointers made per game and shoots 40.1% from beyond the arc, which ranks 7th nationally.\n\nHere’s how you can watch Saturday’s game:\n\nWhen: Saturday, February 7, 2026\n\nWhere: Lenovo Center, Raleigh, North Carolina\n\nAnnouncers: Tom Werme and John Henson\n\nRadio: Virginia Tech Sports Network Radio. You can find a list of affiliates here.\n\nBetting odds: The Wolfpack are a 10.5-point favorite, according to FanDuel.",

    "description": "Big Tech's capital expenditures soar with Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft at the forefront, ushering a new era of AI infrastructure spending.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech is taking the AI age to a whole new level.\n\nWhen Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta announced earnings recently, one set of numbers stole the show: The massive projections for data center spending this year.\n\nThough the industry's capital expenditures — spending on property and equipment — have ramped up in recent years, 2026 is shaping up to be leaps and bounds ahead of any private-sector infrastructure spending in modern history.\n\nThe projections draw comparisons to previous transformational eras, such as the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the Information Age of the 1990s.\n\nStill, Wall Street questions whether it will bring a return on investment — and investors are starting to get antsy. Shares of Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta were all down as of Friday morning. Microsoft was slightly up.\n\n\"Investors needed more than promises to underwrite this story,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote Thursday in a research note following Amazon's earnings call.\n\nAmazon said Thursday it is planning $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, a more than 50% increase from 2025 and the largest estimated budget among Big Tech companies.\n\nThe forecast came in $50 billion above analysts' expectations, and they were less than impressed — despite Amazon's 14% revenue growth for the quarter compared with the same period last year.\n\nThe company's stock dropped as much as 10% after the bell on Thursday, and was down 8% on Friday morning.\n\nWith spending this extreme, a beat on earnings should be \"table-stakes,\" Bernstein's Shmulik wrote Thursday night in a research note that dripped with sarcasm.\n\n\"If we're going to peg the share price to 2026 CapEx, maybe Amazon should have guided even higher, Shmulik wrote. \"Why not at this point?\"\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet stunned investors on Wednesday when it said it is planning $175 billion to $185 billion in capex for 2026, doubling its budget for the second year in a row.\n\nGoogle, which trails behind Amazon and Microsoft in cloud services, has dramatically increased its spending as demand for its Gemini AI models grows. Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users, the company said on its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nGoogle's stock was down about 2% Friday morning as investors digested Big Tech's big spending plans for 2026.\n\nOne thing Google has going for it is the growing enthusiasm for Gemini.\n\n\"We believe these investments are rational, given its fast-growing backlog, supporting our view that Alphabet is among the best positioned to emerge as one of the leading, if not the leading, AI platform,\" BNP Paribas analyst Nick Jones wrote Thursday in a research note.\n\nLike its Big Tech peers, Meta will up the ante on AI investment in 2026. It was the only company that seemed to get a pass from investors this earnings season — at first, that is.\n\nMeta said last week it is planning $115 billion to $135 billion in capex, close to doubling its spend from last year. Meta's stock surged 8% on January 29, the morning after its fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors were pleased with the social media giant's strong advertising business, which reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue that quarter. What's more, it saw gains from its advertising AI tools.\n\nSince then, enthusiasm has waned, and the stock has been on a downward slope this week.\n\nMicrosoft reported $37.5 billion in capex for the second quarter of its fiscal 2026. While the company hasn't released full-year capex guidance, S&P last week estimated the figure could be around $97.7 billion, with some analysts projecting slightly more.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business heavily depends on OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker represents 45% of its backlog, meaning Microsoft's future cloud revenue largely depends on it. The company's stock fell 12% on January 29, the morning after it reported earnings last week — Microsoft's biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nInvestors seemed pleased with the 17% jump in total revenue, including a 39% spike in revenue from Azure and other cloud services.",

    "fullText": "Technology has dramatically changed the beverage market.\n\n\"About 30% of milk was still delivered to homes in the 1960s,\" according to USDA agricultural surveys, and prior to that, had been the most common way consumers got their milk, Food52 reported.\n\nIt was actually the growth of supermarkets and the prevalence of car ownership that ultimately made the milk man irrelevant.\n\nShipping and storage technology has also changed the beverage market.\n\nJuice concentrates, for example, were created for a logical reason.\n\n\"Frozen concentrated orange juice was invented in Florida in the 1940s, primarily as a way to provide juice for the military, readily storable and easy to ship. But frozen juice has been losing favor for years,\" the Wall Street Journal reported in 2015.\n\nNow, Coca-Cola has dealt another blow to the struggling market for juice concentrates.\n\nNot-from-concentrate orange juice surpassed the concentrated orange-juice market in the 1980s, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing data from Nielsen.\n\nCoca-Cola's Minute Maid brand, however, has continued to make concentrated orange juice and lemonade in a variety of flavors including raspberry lemonade, pink lemonade, and limeade.\n\nThe beverage giant has decided to discontinue Minute Maid’s frozen canned orange juices and lemonades after 80 years as consumer demand declines.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n\"Minute Maid frozen products will be discontinued in North America in the first quarter of 2026, with in-store inventory available when supplies last,\" a Coca-Cola spokesperson told Food Dive.\n\n“With the juice category growing strongly, we’re focusing on products that better match what our consumers want,” the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Juice concentrate is a thick liquid made by removing the water content from fruit juice. This process involves heating the juice to evaporate the water, leaving behind a concentrated form of the juice's flavor and nutrients. It is like making fruit juice more potent by taking out most of the water,\" according to Business Research Insights.\n\nIt can be stored for longer than fresh juice, and while demand has slipped in U.S. homes, it's still used by manufacturers, and the global market is growing.\n\nThe global juice concentrates market is projected to grow from about $83.9 billion in 2025 to nearly $134.1 billion by 2035, reflecting strong long‑term expansion driven by beverage demand worldwide.\n\nIn the broader fruit concentrate segment, the market is valued at roughly $20.95 billion in 2025 and expected to reach around $36.96 billion by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 5.8%.\n\nOther forecasts show the juice concentrates industry growing from about $67.6 billion in 2025 to an estimated $94.6 billion by 2030, with CAGR near 7%, highlighting rising demand for natural and functional beverage ingredients.\n\nNorth America dominates with nearly 35% market share due to strong demand, advanced infrastructure, and abundant agricultural resources.\n\nOrange juice from concentrate was something my parents always had in my childhood home in the 1980s, though I never actually drank it. Back then, it felt like a household staple, even if it didn’t end up in my glass.\n\nSjors Peters, global innovation marketing leader for beverages at IFF, believes that consumer perceptions around taste, naturality, and health have continued to drive demand for Not From Concentrate (NFC) over Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice (FCOJ), Food Ingredients First reported.\n\n“The preference for NFC juice over FCOJ has also been accentuated by the lack of carryover from previous crops. One effect of higher NFC production has been a drastic reduction in the availability of orange essence oil,” he says.\n\nBack in 2020, Coca-Cola slashed its beverage lineup, killing a number of well-known brands including TaB, its original diet soda product. It also killed the Odwalla juice line, and Zico, a coconut water brand.\n\n\"Reducing the portfolio will allow Coca-Cola to focus on its most profitable offerings, the company explained. Those include its core products like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar as well as brands that fit into trendy new categories, like Topo Chico hard seltzer and AHA, a caffeinated seltzer the company launched last year,\" CNN Business reported at the time.\n\nDuring that culling, Coca-Cola stopped making approximately 200 different beverages. The company explained the decision at the time.\n\n\"The company continues to pursue its beverages for life ambition by calibrating a portfolio with an optimal set of global, regional and local brands with the strongest potential to grow their consumer bases, increase frequency and drive system margins. The company expects to offer a portfolio of approximately 200 master brands, an approximate 50% reduction from the current number,\" it shared in a press release.\n\nSince then, Coca-Cola has not had a widespread purge of brands, but it has made regular cuts when a product or product line did not meet performance expectations.",

    "fullText": "A CORUNA, Spain, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Around a third of countries attending a military AI summit agreed on Thursday to a a declaration ​on how to govern deployment of the technology in warfare, but military ‌heavyweights China and the U.S. opted out.\n\nTensions in relations between the United States and European allies, and uncertainty ‌over how transatlantic ties will look in coming months and years, made some countries hesitant to sign joint agreements, several attendees and delegates said.\n\nThe pledge underscores growing concern among some governments that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could outpace rules around its military use, raising the ⁠risk of accidents, miscalculation or ‌unintended escalation.\n\nGovernments are facing a \"prisoner's dilemma\", caught between putting responsible restrictions in place and not wanting to limit themselves in comparison with adversaries, ‍said Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans.\n\n\"Russia and China are moving very fast. That creates urgency to make progress in developing AI. But seeing it going fast also increases the urgency to keep ​working on its responsible use. The two go hand-in-hand,\" he said in comments to ‌Reuters.\n\nOnly 35 countries out of 85 attending the Responsible AI in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit in A Coruna, Spain, on signed a commitment to 20 principles on AI on Thursday.\n\nThese included affirming human responsibility over AI-powered weapons, encouraging clear chains of command and control, and sharing information on national oversight arrangements \"where consistent with national security\".\n\nThe document also outlined the ⁠importance of risk assessments, robust testing and training ​and education for personnel operating military AI capabilities.\n\nAt two ​prior military AI summits in The Hague and Seoul in 2023 and 2024 respectively, around 60 nations, excluding China but including the United States, ‍endorsed a modest \"blueprint ⁠for action\" without legal commitment.\n\nWhile this year's document was also non-binding, some were still uncomfortable with the idea of endorsing more concrete policies, said Yasmin Afina, a ⁠researcher at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, an adviser on the process.\n\nMajor signatories on Thursday included ‌Canada, Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, South Korea and Ukraine.",

    "title": "Inside the Milan Olympic Village: Real beds, free tech and other athlete perks",
    "description": "The Olympic Village in Milan offers plenty of perks and amenities for athletes, including free food, stress plants and beds that are not made of cardboard.",
    "fullText": "The Olympic Village rises above the security fences that surround it, a collection of structures both temporary and permanent where the athletes will reside over the next two-plus weeks at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nOut on the sidewalk and behind barriers, lookie-loos crane their necks for a peek at the competitors, while pin traders mill through the churning crowd in hopes of making a souvenir swap.\n\nBut what’s it like inside the Village, where the medal hopefuls work out, mingle and relax before some of the biggest moments of their young lives?\n\n“The best part is the food,” said Micah Moore, bobsledder from Trinidad and Tobago, echoing what people have said for centuries about Italy. “Nutrition is so important. And everything you see is free.”\n\nAh, yes, gratis. That’s a common theme in the Olympic Village, where corporate sponsors of the Games have gotten creative with their free goods and services — and swag bags — for the athletes.\n\nThere are multiple rooms devoted to gaming, with virtual-reality glasses over here, and “Call of Duty” over there, and overstuffed chairs and couches everywhere. There are the typical role-playing video games, along with virtual tennis and dirtbike riding, but conspicuously absent are any winter sports. Organizers explain the rooms are meant to be an escape from that all-encompassing world.\n\nSpeaking of escapes, Corona Cero — the non-alcoholic version of that beer — has constructed a pair of round, glass-roofed wooden structures that feel like part-ski lodge, part-yurt and are filled with plants and comfortable seats and soft music where the athletes can kick back with a chilled beverage. (It has been mild weather for a Milan winter.)\n\nThere are rolled-up yoga mats in the corner, and a chalkboard outside lists times for a breathwork class with Sarah, a soundbath session with Guilia, and restorative yoga and meditation in the afternoon.\n\nNot far away, and made of similar wood, is a wagon labeled the Cero (“zero”) Stress Plant Shop. There, an athlete can adopt a houseplant for the duration of his or her stay, nurturing it for a couple weeks before it’s donated to a local charity, perhaps for auction. The competitor is given a pack of seeds upon departure to grow the same plant at home.\n\nFour-time Olympian Madison Chock said she was “pleasantly surprised” the competitors could foster plants. She said the plant that she shares with husband/ice dance partner Evan Bates is named “Stenry,” a combination of their dogs’ names, Stella and Henry. She said the plant is thriving, although she doesn’t know the variety, only that it’s dangly and has leaves that cascade down like a waterfall.\n\nOf course, sitting around and watching plants grow can get a little dull. This week, the arriving athletes seemed more interested in getting accustomed to their free Samsung phones and using their own hand gestures to direct a robotic hand behind glass to pick up a plastic ball encasing a mystery Olympic pin. The AI demonstration by Alibaba Cloud is a futuristic version of those arcade games where you maneuver a metal claw to grab a stuffed animal.\n\nThe Olympics is filled with young, beautiful athletes, so it’s no wonder two of the more popular pop-ups in the Village provide skin and haircare products and services. KIKO Milano has cosmetic stations where athletes can schedule makeup appointments — very popular before the Opening Ceremonies — and Procter & Gamble has built a “Champions Clubhouse” for scalp massages, hair washing and styling, along with barbers for personalized shaving and beard care.\n\nThere are P&G swag bags of course — some athletes arrived without any toiletries — and KIKO engraves complimentary tubes of lipstick with the names of competitors.\n\nCoca-Cola takes that engraving process a step further with a machine that snaps a photo of the user, then embosses that picture onto the iconic red can of soda.\n\nBeyond the keepsakes, the Olympic organizers have gotten an essential right in the Village. Gone are the flimsy cardboard bedframes of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, held during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere was speculation at the time that those beds were designed to discourage casual sex among the competitors because the frames would break apart at the slightest provocation. Organizers brushed off those rumors, heralding the beds as sturdy and eco-friendly.\n\nRegardless, when she arrived at this year’s Olympic Village, Britain figure skater Phebe Bekker posted a Tik-Tok video from her room that answered a popular question among the athletes, many of whom found the cardboard beds uncomfortable.\n\n“We’re looking good,” she said, knocking on her wooden bedframe and testing the mattress. “Heard it here first, there are no cardboard beds, as far as I know.”\n\nJust like the slogan of that popular soft drink. It’s the real thing.\n\nStaff writer Thuc Nhi Nguyen contributed to this report.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "SpaceX and Tesla both began in California before relocating their headquarters to Texas — a move Elon Musk has said created a hiring challenge.\n\nMusk, the CEO of both companies, said married technicians, engineers, and scientists have struggled to bring their families to certain parts of the state. The problem is most acute at SpaceX's south Texas launch site and headquarters, known as Starbase.\n\n\"I call it the 'significant other' problem,\" Musk said during a nearly three-hour interview with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel and Stripe's cofounder John Collison that was posted on Thursday. \"For Starbase, that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low.\"\n\nStarbase — where SpaceX has built and tested its rockets since 2019 — is situated in a sparsely populated area of Texas, close to the US‑Mexico border. It's located across from the largely undeveloped Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThe campus is roughly a 40‑minute drive from Brownsville, the nearest city, according to Google Maps. Brownsville has a population of around 187,000, based on the most recent US Census data.\n\nThat remoteness marks a sharp contrast with SpaceX's former headquarters in El Segundo, California, which is minutes from Los Angeles and part of one of the country's largest job markets.\n\n\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about Starbase. \n\"Remote and mostly dudes.\"\n\nTesla, which moved its headquarters from California to Austin in 2021, faces a similar — though less severe — challenge, Musk said.\n\nThe automaker's campus, called Giga Texas, is a roughly 30-minute drive from downtown Austin, where nearly 1 million people live. Plus, while Tesla's top executives have largely moved to Texas, the electric car company still maintains several robotics, energy, and manufacturing operations in California.\n\n\"Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it's easier for people to just... They don't have to change their life very much. Their commutes are going to be the same,\" he said. \"Tesla still has a majority of its engineering in California.\"\n\nMusk, who has predicted Austin will be \"the biggest boomtown that America has seen in 50 years,\" has made moves to build out his company campuses, including a company town called \"Snailbrook\" near The Boring Company and SpaceX.",

    "fullText": "Investors looking for refuge from the tech sell-off slamming Wall Street should look to the \"old economy.\"\n\nAnalysts at Piper Sandler offered a handful of ideas for weary investors weathering the tech sell-off this week. The latest rout, which started in a small corner of the software space, eventually spread to bigger names like Microsoft after an agentic AI update from Anthropic sparked AI replacement fears. The new bearish AI sentiment has bled into the wider tech sector, with a risk-off shift gripping investors in the last few days.\n\nWhile some commentators argue the software crash is overblown, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, others frame it as a healthy rotation away from tech.\n\nPiper Sandler analysts are in the \"rotation nation\" camp, seeing the tech sell-off as a shift to \"old economy\" plays in cyclical and value shares.\n\n\"The bull market is intact; however, it's not being led by the popular Tech and Growth favorites of investors. Instead, new momentum and leadership are emerging in cyclical and value sectors—Energy, Industrials, Materials, Staples, and Banks,\" they said.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 information technology sector is the worst performer in the index in 2026, down more than 6% year to date. The losses have been particularly pronounced in software this week, with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF falling 17% in the last week.\n\n\"After years of focus on identifying stocks with the greatest potential AI exposure, concerns about disruption have pushed investors back toward 'real economy' industries, including those leveraged to recent signs of accelerating economic growth,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote this week.\n\nThe analysts examined industry exposure to AI automation compared to labor costs and sales to determine which spaces are most insulated. Some of Piper Sandler's \"old economy\" sectors, specifically energy, industrials, and consumer staples, were part of the same group Goldman flagged.\n\nGoldman analysts added that the sell-off has only sped up an existing market rotation into cyclical stocks.\n\n\"The investor search for insulation from AI disruption risk has accelerated the ongoing cyclical rally,\" they wrote.\n\nBeyond clear flight from stocks exposed to AI risks, BNY Investment researchers credit the rotation, in part, to a cyclical recovery in the US economy.\n\n\"The prevailing narrative in US equity markets is one of market broadening and leadership rotation, consistent with our view of a cyclical recovery in the US economy,\" the BNY analysts wrote.",

    "fullText": "At its new Stone Mountain, Georgia, facility, Roomba-like robots shuffle between stacks, another adds shipping labels while another arranges packages in pallets\n\nOne of the reasons Amazon is spending billions on robots? They don’t need bathroom breaks. Arriving a few minutes early to the public tour of Amazon’s hi-tech Stone Mountain, Georgia, warehouse, my request to visit the restroom was met with a resounding no from the security guard in the main lobby.\n\nBetween the main doors and the entrance security gate, I paced and paced after being told I would have to wait for the tour guide to collect me and other guests for a tour of the 640,000-sq-ft, four-story warehouse.\n\nAmazon offers tours to the public at 28 of its 1,200 US warehouses – a recruiting and public-relations tool to boost brand trust and address criticisms of poor working conditions. It was something to consider as I wound up having to go in the parking lot, propping open my rental car door for privacy.\n\nBathroom access is one of the most notorious criticisms of Amazon’s treatment of workers. Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers have reported having to pee in water bottles due to lack of time and access, and have even said their bathroom breaks are timed.\n\nZoe Hoffman, an Amazon spokesperson, said it was “absurd and false to connect a visitor’s tour experience to that of our employees”, adding that workers were allowed “regularly scheduled breaks” throughout their shifts.\n\nNone of this will be an issue if Amazon’s multibillion-dollar robot dreams come true.\n\nAmazon cites 10 different robots through its warehouse network, though the Stone Mountain warehouse had only a handful of them, including the Roomba-like robots moving shelves of products around to stowers and pickers, an automated crane arm palletizing products, and a robot along a conveyor belt printing and adding shipping labels to boxes of products set to be mailed out of the warehouse.\n\nSeveral sections of the warehouse were closed off during the tour for construction for upgrades, though specifics weren’t disclosed.\n\nThe tour began with a spiel about how Amazon is a great place to work, rattling off Amazon’s 1.5 million global employees and 1 million workers in the US, before playing a brief video of Amazon workers at a warehouse in the UK that made similar claims.\n\nThe tour guide touted Amazon’s vast seasonal workforce of 250,000 workers, claiming many of those workers are then hired full-time.\n\nCriticisms of Amazon’s safety record, high injury rates, high employee turnover or the worker organizing efforts at the Stone Mountain warehouse after workers passed out on the job from heat exhaustion in 2022 were not mentioned. The tour guide, however, did finally offer guests a bathroom break before leading us through the warehouse.\n\nThe tour guide, from the local area, explained that the warehouse, which opened in late 2020, “came out of nowhere” from an area once covered in forest.\n\nThroughout the first floor of the warehouse, the ceilings were covered with an assembly line conveyor belt of yellow Amazon totes, either empty or filled with miscellaneous goods from grocery items to electronics. The sounds of the conveyor belt bellowing through the warehouse’s first-floor ceiling is loud, and tour guests were given headphones to be able to hear the tour guide. Signs around the warehouse stated “hearing protection required” but several of the workers didn’t appear to have any earplugs or other protection.\n\nThe second floor of the warehouse included worker stations surrounding stacks of products in a dark room. Robots resembling Roombas shuffled the stacks between stations to a worker, directed by a computer about what to pick or stow, where to place it or pull it from and where to move it.\n\nThe tour guide claimed that before the robots’ arrival, and in some facilities where the robots aren’t used, a worker with a pushcart used to go around pulling or stocking products.\n\nBack on the first floor, a single robotic arm was palletizing yellow totes of products. The tour guide claimed the facility had only one, had no plans to add more, and said it was only there to help human workers. The robot seemed to need human helpers as much as they needed it, unable to reach products that were too high in the tote, which were shuffled to the side for a human worker to fix and send back to them.\n\nNot so long ago, one of Amazon’s top robot executives (to be clear, he oversees robotics and is not himself a robot) was telling journalists they need not worry about robots taking people’s jobs.\n\nTye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, told the Guardian in 2022 he disagreed with the notion that artificial intelligence and robots wouold lead to the elimination of jobs at Amazon. “I just don’t see that at all,” said Brady. “We made our first serious investment in robotics over 10 years ago and in those 10 years we created more than a million jobs.”\n\nHe said: “The need for people to solve problems and use common sense will always be there. We are nowhere near that with robotics. It’s not even close. We have millions of years of evolution for the human brain that’s powered off 20 watts and a banana – that’s incredible.”\n\nNow the message from the top is very different. Last June, Andy Jassy, the Amazon chief executive, told white-collar workers at the company that the advancement of AI would eliminate jobs at the company over the next few years.\n\n“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years we expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy said in a memo.\n\nIn October, the New York Times reported on internal documents at Amazon that were presented to the company’s board, which included plans by the company to replace more than 500,000 jobs at Amazon and avoid hiring 160,000 workers by 2027. The documents cited an ultimate goal to automate 75% of its operations.\n\nAmazon denied the report, claiming “the documents referenced paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans”.\n\nThe company laid off about 14,000 corporate employees the same month in anticipation of adopting more broadly artificial intelligence technology, and recently announced plans to lay off an additional 16,000 employees, though Amazon denied that AI and automation had any role in this round of cuts. An Amazon spokesperson added: “AI is not the reason behind the vast majority of these reductions.”\n\nAmazon is reportedly developing “humanoid” robots to pop out of delivery vans to deliver packages, eventually replacing the work of delivery drivers.\n\nIn November, more than 1,000 Amazon workers signed an open letter expressing concern that the company’s “all-costs-justified, warp-speed” approach to developing the technology puts jobs, democracy and the environment at risk.\n\nStaff are seeing the impact already. An Amazon picker and stower at a warehouse in northern Georgia, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian that human resources at their Amazon site had gradually shifted from humans to artificial intelligence and computers.\n\n“We have had a big change at my warehouse in HR over the past six months. At first I noticed that the human resource personnel were just not available as much,” they said. “We now have a reduced staff for our HR, and we now have an automated texting service for us to use to contact HR.”\n\nThey also claimed Amazon pushes for cross-training and that workers in areas such as picking and stowing are learning other technical skills such as robot repair, in anticipation that their jobs may eventually be automated.\n\n“People are getting hurt stowing and picking, so that’s one of the reasons why Amazon is wanting to get robots that can do the work of the picker and the stower,” the worker said. “They’re letting us know that it’s smart for us to learn how to do something different, like robot repair work or something in it, because eventually this might be replaced.”\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said: “We’re preparing employees for the roles of the future because we believe investing in workers and our employees is more crucial than ever in this rapidly advancing technological age, especially with AI.”",

    "description": "Why tech stack choices should be driven by business context and constraints—not framework preferences—and why this matters even more with agentic coding tools.",
    "fullText": "Developers love to argue about tech stacks.\n\nFlutter vs React Native.\n\nNative vs cross-platform.\n\nJava vs Ruby vs C#.\n\nReact vs Angular.\n\nRiverpod vs Bloc.\n\nDrift vs Hive.\n\nThese debates can go arbitrarily deep, down to library-level choices that have little impact on whether a product succeeds or fails.\n\nEveryone has preferences, and that’s fine. Preferences come from experience. Someone who started with strongly typed languages will value compiler guarantees and explicitness. Someone who started with dynamic languages will value flexibility and speed. Both viewpoints are internally consistent.\n\nWhat they are not is universally correct.\n\nThere is no hard data that can rank one stack as objectively “better” across all contexts. Teams, constraints, markets, and goals differ too much. Most arguments rely on anecdotes, and anecdotes do not generalize.\n\nSo if preference is not a reliable guide, how should a tech stack be chosen?\n\nThis question is often interpreted at the feature or use-case level. That misses the point.\n\nIn almost all non-hobby software, the problem being solved is a business problem.\n\nIf there is no business, no users, no revenue, then the software is irrelevant. It may be elegant or technically impressive, but it has no economic value. Software only matters insofar as it supports a business outcome.\n\nThat framing matters because it establishes the correct hierarchy.\n\nTechnology is not the goal.\n\nTechnology is a tool.\n\nAnd tools are chosen based on the job they need to do.\n\nEarly on, nobody knows whether the business will work.\n\nYou don’t know if users care. You don’t know if they will pay. You don’t know if the problem is real or imagined.\n\nAt this stage, obsessing over the “right” stack is misplaced effort. The dominant constraint is uncertainty, not scalability or architectural purity.\n\n“The FIRST rule of enterprenuership is you use what you have” - Alex Hormozi\n\nThis is simple rule of entrepreneurship applies surprisingly well to engineering.\n\nFounders and early teams start with what they already know. Not because it is theoretically optimal, but because it minimizes friction. Familiar tools reduce cognitive overhead, increase speed, and allow faster learning.\n\nEarly success is rarely determined by technical elegance. It is determined by whether you can ship something people want before you run out of time or money.\n\nAs the business grows, the constraints change.\n\nRevenue appears.\n\nUsers depend on the system.\n\nThe team grows.\n\nThe cost of failure increases.\n\nNow the stack begins to matter more. Not because some technologies are inherently superior, but because the software must support new business realities. Hiring, onboarding, operational cost, maintainability, performance characteristics, and risk management all become relevant.\n\nThis is where teams often conclude that an early stack choice was “wrong.” In most cases, it wasn’t wrong. It was right for the phase the business was in. The mistake was assuming it would remain right indefinitely.\n\nTwitch is often mentioned as a scaling story, but the more interesting part is how long the architecture stayed simple.\n\nAt one point, Twitch was serving millions of users with a monolithic Ruby on Rails application and a single PostgreSQL database. That setup was not elegant or future proof, but it worked. It allowed the team to move quickly, ship features, and grow the business without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\nOver time, the constraints changed. Growth amplified failures. Database contention increased. Reliability, support load, and churn started to matter more than raw development speed. The cost of incidents became visible in a way it had not been before.\n\nThat was when the architecture began to evolve. The database was scaled and restructured, services were split out, and new infrastructure and languages were introduced. None of this happened because the original stack was flawed. It happened because the business had outgrown it.\n\nThe technology changed in response to the business, not the other way around.\n\nIf you want to read more about how Twitch migrated from a monolith to microservices, see Breaking the Monolith at Twitch and Breaking the Monolith at Twitch: Part Two.\n\nIf you want to know more about how Twitch scaled its database, see How Twitch Uses PostgreSQL.\n\nAgentic coding tools make this even more important.\n\nTools like Claude Code and Cursor reduce the advantage of deep, framework-specific familiarity. Generating boilerplate, navigating unfamiliar code, applying patterns across modules, and keeping implementation consistent are no longer manual, error-prone tasks.\n\nWhen an agent can help you stay productive across technologies, the cost of switching or extending a stack drops. What remains expensive is not syntax or APIs, but domain knowledge, product decisions, and the long-term behavior of the system.\n\nIn other words, the more the tooling levels the technical playing field, the more tech stack decisions become about business fit.\n\nInstead of asking whether one technology is better than another in the abstract, ask questions that reflect the reality of the business:\n\nWhat are we optimizing for right now? Speed, cost, reliability, hiring, or time-to-market?\n\nHow quickly do we need to validate this idea?\n\nHow expensive will change be later, and what changes are most likely?\n\nWhat kind of team will maintain this system?\n\nWhat risks could realistically kill the business, and does the stack reduce or increase them?\n\nOnce framed this way, stack decisions become clearer and less emotional. Sometimes multiple choices are equally valid. Sometimes the boring option is correct. Sometimes speed matters more than correctness. Sometimes correctness matters more than speed.\n\nThere is no universal answer. The answer depends on the context.\n\nMost tech stack arguments are debates about taste, not outcomes.\n\nOnce technology is treated as a business decision rather than a personal identity, those arguments lose their intensity. The question stops being “what do I prefer?” and becomes “what does the business need right now?”\n\nThe right stack is not the one that wins debates.\n\nIt is the one that helps the business survive and grow at its current stage.\n\nIf are starting a project and need help with tech stack decision, connect with me on LinkedIn and I’ll take it from there.\n\nSoftware Developer specializing in Flutter, Android, and mobile development.\n Writing about code, architecture, and developer productivity.",

    "description": "Wall Street is weighing whether the AI fears behind the recent tech-driven sell-off were exaggerated.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures turned higher early Friday, pointing cautiously to a rebound from a tech bruising as Wall Street reassessed worries about the impact of AI disruption and the risks of hefty Big Tech spending.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) rose 0.5%, while Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) added 0.7%, retracing earlier premarket losses. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) also switched course, moving up 0.4%, on the heels of sharp closing losses on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\nThe tentative risk-on tone extended beyond stocks, as bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed back above $65,000, having touched a 16-month low overnight. But the biggest cryptocurrency is still on track for its worst weekly performance since 2022 after wiping out all of its post-Trump gains this week.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by that steep sell-off, which initially weighed on shares. But the stock was up almost 6% before the bell as bitcoin revived and Strategy's CEO played down concerns about debt-servicing risks.\n\nSome tech gloom persisted, as Amazon's (AMZN) shares tumbled 8%. In its earnings, the major cloud provider outlined plans for a massive 2026 jump in spending to least $200 billion, even as its forecast for operating income fell short.\n\nElsewhere, Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) warned it will take a charge of over €22 billion ($26 billion) in a plan to scale back its EV push. Shares in the Jeep maker tanked over 20% on Wall Street and in Milan, adding to a picture of EV malaise painted by this week's $60 billion wipeout for Chinese carmaker BYD (BYDDF, 1211.HK).\n\nIn commodities, silver (SI=F) whipsawed but broadly resumed its decline as Chinese selling continued ahead of a national holiday.\n\nLooking ahead, the release of the closely watched January jobs report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week. Fresh signs of trouble in the labor market emerged this week, as job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020 and layoff announcements surged.\n\nJeep maker Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) warned on Friday that it will book a €22.2 billion ($26 billion) charge as it scales back its EV push.\n\nShares plummeted over 20% in premarket on Wall Street and in Milan, where trading was halted briefly. They plunged as much as 24% in Italy, the biggest drop on record for the Peugeot and Fiat automaker, to erase over €5 billion off its market cap.\n\nReddit (RDDT) stock jumped 7% before the bell on Friday after posting better-than-expected fourth quarter results and issuing positive guidance, helped by AI tools to bring more marketers to the platform.",

    "description": "Wilson is releasing the newest addition to the legendary Dynapwr family with the 2026 Dynapwr Forged irons, rounding out a revilized lineup.",
    "fullText": "Wilson is rounding out its 2026 releases with a great answer for improving players demanding better from their irons.\n\nWilson’s new Dynapwr Forged irons enter a crowded player’s distance spot in the market, but with a cavity back design and an AI-generated “Variable Face Technology,” they’re making a push toward the top of the category.\n\n“We wanted to build on the success of the previous award-winning model, while taking strides to elevate the performance to the next level,” Ben Hanser, CAD engineer at Wilson Golf, said in a statement. “The new iron is a statement of Wilson’s dedication to innovation and tradition. By combining forged precision with AI-driven design, we’ve created an iron that delivers distance, control and feel in perfect harmony.”\n\nKeep reading below for more on the Dynapwr Forged irons, including my take on the release.\n\nWhile the previous generation Dynapwr Forged irons were super successful, the 2026 models improve on them by adding a new optimized face thickness with the help of AI. This eliminated the need for the power holes of the previous model.\n\nThe variable face thickness helps boost face flex, in turn increasing ball speeds.\n\nDynapwr Forged also has a new KR-CUP face design, which overlaps the face around the sole, enhancing face flex further, particularly on low strikes.\n\nTo help further improve feel in the forged 8620 carbon steel chassis, the cavities in the 3- to 9-iron are filled with urethane to enhance feel.\n\nWhat is it: A player’s distance cavity back iron with a new AI-designed variable face thickness and urethane-filled cavity.\n\nWho it’s for: Players who are advancing their ball striking ability and want something with a more premium feel without sacrificing forgiveness and speed, or moving to something as compact as a hollow-body.\n\nMany people are going to ask if they should choose between the Dynapwr Forged or the Staff Model XB iron. But truthfully, the new Dynapwr Forged perfectly fills a gap between the XB and the standard Dynapwr iron.\n\nThe Dynapwr Forged is clearly in that player’s distance category with entries like the P790, JPX 925 Forged, Ti Fusion and many others for players looking for speed and forgiveness.\n\nThe Dynapwr Forged is going to fall on the larger and faster end of that spectrum, while the XB falls \n\nWhat’s the difference? I believe it depends on your trend. This Dynapwr Forged is great for a player who is improving and needs to build confidence, but also wants to start getting into the more premium feel. In other words, they are a player who is improving, rather than a player looking to recapture lost performance.\n\nYou can still benift from lots of modern technology, like the new varaible face thickness and urethane-filled cavity, but you can also hone in your precision with a more players shape than the Dynapwr irons.\n\nDynapwr Forged gives Wilson a very complete iron lineup with no one left out. Another step toward the restoration of one of golf’s (and sport’s) great brands.\n\nWilson’s new Dynapwr Forged irons are available for pre-order starting Feb. 5 and will arrive at retail locations on Feb. 19.\n\nThe full set will cost $1,199.99 for 5-GW with steel shafts or $1,299.99 for graphite. A 3- and 4-iron are also available through custom.\n\nWant to find the best driver for your game in 2026? Find a club-fitting location near you at True Spec Golf.\n\nThe post Wilson’s 2026 Dynapwr Forged irons add AI-tech to the iconic family appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "Global markets slid hard on Friday as losses spread across tech stocks, cryptocurrencies, and precious metals, reinforcing fears that investors have moved into a \"sell everything\" mindset.\n\nMuch of the pressure is coming from tech, as doubts grow over whether the AI boom that powered recent gains can live up to expectations.\n\n\"A session of pure carnage overnight as the rotational flows noted in yesterday's note — out of tech and into cyclical morphed into a 'sell everything' mentality across stocks, crypto and commodities,\" Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia, wrote on Friday.\n\nIn Asia, South Korea's tech-heavy Kospi plunged and briefly triggered a trading halt after the index dropped 5%.\n\nHeavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were among the hardest hit, dragging the market lower as investors rushed to cut exposure to technology stocks.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell as much as 2.1% as China's major tech names moved lower, reflecting weaker risk appetite and ongoing pressure on the sector.\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 also declined, tracking the global selloff, while Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed earlier losses ahead of a general election this week.\n\nCryptocurrencies fell alongside equities, extending a week of heavy losses as investors continued to reduce risk.\n\nBitcoin was trading around $64,500 after falling about 10% over 24 hours.\n\nThe selling also swept through commodities, with silver remaining under intense pressure following last week's violent breakdown.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $71.20 per troy ounce. It had hit a record high above $121 per ounce last week.\n\n\"Silver's attempt to stabilise after last week's historic rout has so far proven short‑lived,\" Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a Thursday note, pointing to renewed selling and technical resistance that triggered reversals.\n\nHansen also pointed to fresh selling from China, including disruption around China's only pure-silver fund after it traded far above its underlying value and was later suspended, leaving investors locked in as it repeatedly hit limit-down moves.\n\nHe added that near-term price action in silver is likely to be driven more by market mechanics and positioning than by macroeconomic headlines, given the extreme volatility still coursing through the market.\n\nThe latest moves underscore how quickly sentiment has shifted across asset classes.\n\n\"Investors are questioning their commitment to the pillars that have underpinned markets over the past six months: AI, crypto, and precious metals. This raises the odds of a deeper unwind,\" wrote Sycamore.",

    "title": "Hollywood superagent and investor Michael Ovitz praised Jeffrey Epstein and was invited to his island, files reveal",
    "description": "Michael Ovitz, cofounder of CAA and a tech investor, praised Jeffrey Epstein's \"outstanding multiple talents\" in one email to the disgraced financier.",
    "fullText": "Michael Ovitz, the cofounder of powerhouse Los Angeles talent agency Creative Artists Agency and a prolific tech investor, effusively praised Jeffrey Epstein and made arrangements to meet him at his New York home and off the coast of St. Barts, newly released files reveal.\n\nThe disgraced financier invited Ovitz to his private Caribbean island in 2012 and said he knew Ovitz \"well\" in emails to a Microsoft executive and his publicist, Peggy Siegal. In 2013, Ovitz emailed Epstein, lauding his \"outstanding multiple talents,\" with Epstein emailing Ovitz, \"great to see you smiling again,\" later that year.\n\nA spokesperson for Ovitz denied that he was on anything more than cordial terms with Epstein.\n\n\"Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Epstein did not know each other well, no matter what Mr. Epstein said to Peggy Siegal. They had very limited interaction and correspondence,\" a spokesperson for Ovitz told Business Insider. \"When Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Epstein did correspond, Mr. Ovitz was cordial.\"\n\nOvitz co-founded CAA in 1975, where he represented stars like Tom Cruise and Robert De Niro, leaving the firm in 1995 for a stint as president of Disney. The superagent later built deep links to Silicon Valley: he has invested in hundreds of startups, and has served as an advisor to the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nOvitz is also a senior advisor to Palantir and has recently invested in AI startups, including the Google-backed AI studio Promise and the image generator Black Forest Labs, where he serves as an advisor.\n\nDocuments released last week by the Justice Department from its investigation into Epstein provide a deeper look at his ties to Ovitz. It's not the first time Ovitz's name comes up in relation to Epstein: in 2023, Ovitz was subpoenaed by the US Virgin Islands as part of its lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase for banking with Epstein. That lawsuit has since been settled.\n\nThe new material shows communication between Ovitz and Epstein in the early and mid-2010s — after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor, but before his 2019 arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges — which ended with his death by suicide in a jail cell.\n\nIn a 2010 email exchange, Ovitz wrote to Epstein, \"hope you are well\" and \"been a while\" after a dinner with Jes Staley, the former Barclays CEO who later came under close scrutiny for his Epstein dealings.\n\n\"Had dinner with Jes last night and your ears should still be burning,\" Ovitz wrote, adding that he and Epstein should get together.\n\nJPMorgan Chase declined to comment to Business Insider for this article.\n\nIn February 2012, Epstein planned to see Ovitz at an undisclosed location, according to a Google Calendar reminder. A few months later, in April, Ovitz emailed Epstein that he would drop by the financier's Manhattan home for a drink, writing, \"would love to see you.\"\n\nIn December 2012, after learning that Ovitz was wintering in St. Barts in the Caribbean, Epstein invited him to his private island, Little Saint James, writing, \"will you be near my island, come visit.\"\n\nOvitz declined, saying his boat was stuck in St. Barts after he dropped a rudder. He told Epstein his boat was located about 500 yards from the yacht Al Mirqab, owned by former Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani — which Epstein said he was visiting at the time — and suggested Epstein could stop by. The potential meetup didn't take place, Ovitz's spokesperson told Business Insider after publication.\n\nIn a January 2013 email, Ovitz wrote to Epstein that he and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, had been \"raving about you and your outstanding multiple talents.\" Sinofsky had been relying on Epstein to negotiate his Microsoft exit at the time.\n\nSinofsky later asked Epstein in an email if he knew Ovitz, whom he had just met at Andreessen Horowitz, and Epstein replied, \"very very well.\"\n\nIn May 2013, Epstein emailed Ovitz again, writing, \"great to see you smiling again.\"\n\nIn 2014, Andrew Farkas, a real estate magnate who co-owned a marina with Epstein in St. Thomas, also asked Epstein for an introduction to Ovitz to discuss naming a new performing arts degree at Harvard University.\n\nEpstein's most recent reference to Ovitz in the files is from 2017, when Epstein emailed his publicist Siegal that he knew Ovitz \"WELL.\"\n\nThe Epstein files are full of recognizable names who had correspondence with him, and some of the content is anodyne. The latest documents have caused headaches for some of the movers and shakers whose names appear on them.\n\nOn Wednesday night, powerhouse lawyer Brad Karp stepped down from the chairmanship of his firm, Paul Weiss, saying his ties to Epstein had become a \"distraction\" for it. Prominent longevity influencer Peter Attia publicly apologized for his crude email exchanges with Epstein and stepped down as chief science officer for a protein bar company.\n\nOvitz's CAA has become one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies. The firm rose to prominence by driving ever-higher actor paydays by demanding larger box-office cuts for stars like Brad Pitt.\n\nCAA served as an inspiration for Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz when they built Andreessen Horowitz, which prides itself on being founder-friendly.\n\n\"An important part of A16z's origin story, which you may already know, is that we were founded by Marc & Ben to be 'CAA for the tech industry,'\" reads the firm's website.\n\nBesides his involvement with A16z, Ovitz also chairs the VC firm Treville Capital Group and announced last year that he was launching his own startup, SoundPatrol, that uses AI to fight copyright infringement in music.",

    "description": "The rivaling AI companies pushed GPT-5.3-Codex and Claude Opus 4.6, and had back-to-back appearances on a tech and business podcast.",
    "fullText": "The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic intensified this week.\n\nThe two companies released dueling new AI models on Thursday and had back-to-back podcast appearances on \"TBPN.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, an upgraded model that the company says would improve performance on office productivity and coding tasks, with an expanded \"context window\" that allows it to work through longer documents and more complex projects in a single session.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI punched back with its own new coding-focused model called GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company says runs faster, uses fewer computing resources, and can generate and manage complex software from English instructions. The new version also comes alongside a stand-alone Codex desktop app.\n\nBoth Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and Sholto Douglas, one of Anthropic's leading researchers, appeared on the \"TBPN\" podcast in back-to-back chats with show host John Coogan and Jordi Hays.\n\n\"I think we will be heading towards a workflow where a lot of people just feel like they're managing a team of agents,\" said Altman. \"And as the agents get better, they'll keep operating at a higher and higher level of abstraction.\"\n\nDouglas, who appeared in the subsequent timeslot, told Coogan and Hays that users have been comparing previous Anthropic and OpenAI models, and they have noticed some key differences.\n\n\"The OpenAI models were a bit better at trying really, really, really hard on tough problems, but the Anthropic models were much faster and so forth,\" Douglas said.\n\n\"And so they worked on speed while we worked on making the models much, much better at really, really tough problems,\" Douglas added of the Opus 4.6.\n\nThe latest release is part of a long-running competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, dating back to 2021, when a group of OpenAI researchers left to form Anthropic, aiming to develop safer and more controlled AI systems.\n\nThis week, Anthropic's launch of industry-specific plugins triggered a stock market sell-off as Wall Street worried about AI's impact on software.\n\nAnthropic also took a subtle shot at OpenAI with a series of ads released this week, including one that will air during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe ads feature unnamed humanized AIs dropping ads in the middle of their advice, alongside the promise that its model, Claude, will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI announced in January that ads are coming to ChatGPT for users of the free version.\n\nAltman subsequently hit back, calling Anthropic \"dishonest\" and defending ChatGPT as a product that brings AI \"to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions.\" He also clarified that the ads will be \"clearly labeled\" to differentiate themselves from the chatbot's answers to queries.\n\n\"We are not stupid. We respect our users. We understand that if we did something like what those ads depict, people would rightfully stop using the product,\" Altman told the \"TBPN\" podcast on Thursday.\n\n\"Our first principle with ads is that we're not going to put stuff into the LLM stream,\" Altman added. \"That would feel crazy dystopic, like a bad sci-fi movie.\"",

    "description": "The chaos is mostly a tech-stock phenomenon. The equal-weight S&P 500 is actually at a record high.",
    "fullText": "S&P 500 futures were flat-to-up this morning before the markets opened in New York, a sign that traders may be temporarily sated after the carnage they wreaked in the stock markets over the past few days. The index fell 0.51% yesterday, closing at 6,882, after spending much of the previous month flirting with the 7,000 level.\n\nMarkets were flat or down globally this morning, with the worst performer being South Korea’s KOSPI, which lost 3.86%.\n\nThe damage came from the tech and software sector, as investors began to realize that the promise of AI won’t always be sunshine and roses. Until recently, the markets had assumed that companies would be buoyed by the massive amount of capex (capital expenditure) going into AI, and that AI would generate new efficiencies and higher productivity that would ultimately result in higher revenues and earnings per share. Over the past few days, however, traders have reacted to the notion that AI also has the power to destroy the revenues of companies reliant on selling traditional software that can be replaced by AI.\n\nWhat signals indicate the tech correction may continue?\n\nWhy are retail traders buying during market dips?\n\nHow is equal-weight S&P performing versus cap-weighted?\n\nWhat caused the $1 trillion software market selloff?\n\nAs much as $1 trillion was wiped off the market cap of software companies yesterday, according to Bloomberg. Alphabet closed down nearly 2% yesterday and lost a further 2.53% overnight after revealing on its earnings call that it planned to double AI capex. The beatdown on Alphabet shares came despite better-than-forecast revenue growth that indicates the company’s advertising sales are in no way being cannibalized by consumer adoption of AI, including its own Gemini AI chatbot and its AI Mode in Google Search.\n\nThat’s a problem because until very recently the performance of the S&P 500 was governed by the heavy weight of tech stocks, like Alphabet, within it. “By the end of 2025, the 10 largest companies accounted for nearly 41% of the S&P 500’s total weight,” according to RBC Wealth Management.\n\nBut the chaos is mostly a tech-only phenomenon, the data says. The equal-weight S&P 500—a notional index that values each of the 500 companies equally rather than by total market cap—is actually at a record high this morning because the non-tech companies inside it are doing rather well.\n\n“Tech stocks are being squeezed sharply, but a lot of broader indices are still holding up for the most part,” Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank told clients this morning. There were “363 advancers in the S&P 500 [yesterday], which was actually the most in two weeks.”\n\nPeople are buying stocks, just not tech stocks.\n\nSo who is behind this selective buying? Retail traders who love to buy the dip, is one theory, according to Axios. Retail buyers—ordinary folks trading their own accounts—used to be referred to as “the dumb money” among the institutional investors of Wall Street because they historically waited too long to jump into bull markets and sold too late into bear markets, the opposite of what you’d want to do.",

    "fullText": "US stock futures moved lower early Monday as Amazon’s (AMZN) post-earnings slide weighed heavily on tech sentiment and investors braced for further wreckage after a bruising session on Wall Street.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) slid 0.3%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) fell 0.1%.\n\nThe overnight moves followed a sharp sell-off during Thursday’s regular session, led once again by technology stocks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) have now slipped into negative territory for 2026.\n\nAnd after the bell, Amazon (AMZN) added to the gloom. Shares plunged over 10% in after-hours trading after the company posted earnings per share that missed Wall Street estimates and projected capital expenditures of $200 billion for the year, raising concerns about the extent of AI spend.\n\nThe risk-off tone extended beyond equities. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued sliding, touching levels not seen since 2024, while silver (SI=F) resumed its decline after a recent surge fueled by retail investor interest. Strategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by bitcoin's sell-off, sending shares down.\n\nEarnings also drove Reddit (RDDT) upward after reporting a quarterly earnings beat, issuing upbeat guidance, and announcing a stock buyback program. Roblox (RBLX) shares also surged. Looking ahead, investors will focus on earnings from Toyota (TM) and Philip Morris (PM), due before Friday’s opening bell.\n\nMeanwhile, the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week following the resolution of the federal government shutdown. But other data this week has shown fresh signs of trouble for the labor market, as job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020 and layoff announcements surged.",

    "description": "Open Source Policy Summit 2026: Open source gains urgency as Europe reassesses reliance on US tech",
    "fullText": "Open Source Policy Summit 2026 European tech leaders are waking up to the risk of the US simply turning off their IT services.\n\nThe Register FOSS desk attended the 2026 Open Source Policy Summit in Brussels last week. The tone of the event was distinctly different to that of the same event three years ago. We encountered new notes of determination, expressed forcefully by Finnish MEP Aura Salla:\n\nIn case some listeners didn't see the problem with that:\n\nThe US could turn us off inside one hour.\n\nThe Reg has quoted Salla before. She has been making this point for a while, with increasing directness, but just over a year into Donald Trump's second term as president of the United States, it continues to grow in importance.\n\nAs we covered in October last year, one of the leaders in this effort is the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which switched away from Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook to Open-Xchange and Mozilla Thunderbird. The head of Schleswig's Chancellery and Minister for Digital Transformation, Dirk Schrödter, gave a keynote saying: \"We are free; now everyone must follow.\"\n\nHe noted that although it had saved the state government money, it wasn't without cost. The process had required significant expenditure, but that was good for European businesses that had helped the state in its transition. We liked his summary of the status quo:\n\nWe're in the habit of exporting public money out of Europe, and importing dependencies.\n\nIn a later panel on \"Open Source and Economic Security,\" he noted that digitization in Germany can be difficult, partly due to its state-level IT management and strategy. He recommended a pragmatic approach:\n\nDon't look at the big mountain in the distance. Look at concrete steps you can take to start.\n\nSo, for now, Schleswig is still running Windows, but has replaced Microsoft Office with LibreOffice on \"nearly 100 percent\" of machines. It's using Thunderbird for email, calendars, and contacts, talking to Open-Xchange on the back end, alongside the Matrix-based Element for chat and Nextcloud for collaboration.\n\nOther speakers on the same panel made the point that FOSS doesn't mean free of charge, but spending money with European companies means benefits to European economies – keeping more of the EU's vast public spending inside the EU. As Leontina Sandu put it: \"We spend 0.4 percent of EU money on software licenses. It's a lot – public sector spending is half of the EU's GDP.\" Blogger Markus Sandelin estimates that the EU spends over €200 million a year just on Microsoft 365 licenses.\n\nCompanies working on open source in Europe, of course, stand to profit significantly from this. Thales's Daniel Glazman put it more bluntly: \"Open source will succeed when we forget the word 'cost.'\" IBM's Jochen Friedrich shared a pithy one-line summary of how Europe needs to transform its economies away from old heavy industries and into open \n\nThe Eclipse Foundation's Mike Milinkovich echoed Salla's earlier point that Microsoft effectively had a kill switch over Office 365, but pointed out that the company has more such controls: it also owns GitHub. As he put it, \"more or less every company and organization in Europe pulls from GitHub, because it uses JavaScript and Maven, so this applies to them too.\"\n\nPortuguese professor Mario Campolargo flipped the equation around. Any part of the EU paying for software should be sharing the code it's paying for:\n\nIf the money is public, the code should be public.\n\nOf course, this isn't just a European problem. It applies just as much to the nearly 200 countries of the United Nations. A short item, oddly described as an \"intervention,\" talked about the upcoming UN Open Source Week 2026 and the UN Open Source Principles – including that the city of Barcelona just adopted them.\n\nTo most people working with FOSS, they probably seem simple and reasonable, but having the UN on board adds considerable clout, and spelling them out is the sort of thing that reassures technophobic politicians:",

    "fullText": "Tech has been clobbered by a broad rotation taking place in 2026, and the latest sell-off in software stocks has only added to the pain. Yet, on the other end of that pain has been a $24 billion gain for short-sellers.\n\nThe software rout took off this week, but some of the biggest names in tech have been struggling all year, battling both micro and macro forces that have hurt demand for high-flying AI plays.\n\nFor short-sellers betting against these stocks, the last six weeks have been a windfall. A report from data analytics firm S3 Partners reveals that short-sellers have netted billions in paper profits as they bet tech would drop from nosebleed levels.\n\nThe firm noted that while short sellers have been betting against some of the biggest names in software all year, they have been increasing their bearish positions recently as conditions shifted and volatility surged.\n\n\"U.S. Software stocks have generated $24 billion in MTM PNL for short sellers YTD, while the market capitalization of the sector has declined by $1 trillion,\" the firm's report reads.\n\nS3 highlighted several software stocks that short sellers have been increasingly betting against\n\nOf the software stocks on the list, Microsoft stands out, the firm said, because of the way short-seller behavior around it has changed amid its sharp decline this year.\n\n\"Historically, MSFT behaves like a reversal stock, with shorts covering on the way down,\" S3 noted. \"Now it is trading like a momentum-driven, distressed name, with shorts increasing into weakness.\"\n\nWhile the AI trade has faced intensifying scrutiny lately, the firm sees the widespread bearish trade as specific to software stocks, as short interest in the overall Magnificent 7 and the Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, has been flat.\n\nS3 maintains, though, that hedge funds are focused on increasing their short positions in large-cap tech, even as many sector leaders have already logged big declines.\n\n\"Contagion is visible across short books, with AVGO and AMZN seeing short-interest increases of 15% and 10%, and AVGO down 10% YTD,\" he stated.",

    "description": "Wall Street is looking to Amazon with high hopes after a rough week in tech, as silver plunges again and bitcoin drops near $65,000.",
    "fullText": "US stocks took sizable hits again on Thursday in a fruitless search for a reprieve from a building tech sell-off as investors awaited Amazon earnings, assessed Alphabet's big AI spending plans, and digested jobs data that signaled fresh weakness in the labor market.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved roughly 1.2% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost over 1.1%, or more than 500 points.\n\nThe market is in the midst of a full-on tech wipeout, as investors weigh whether some software stocks took too big a beating. The losses have been spurred by worries about AI disruption to established software players — a risk that had been overlooked by investors focused on the fallout from massive AI spending until recently.\n\nWall Street is still digesting the latest batch of corporate earnings, with Big Tech's AI build-out and demand in high focus. Alphabet (GOOG) shares slid, but pared losses, after the Google parent outlined a significant ramp-up in AI investment — to as high as $185 billion — in its quarterly results late Wednesday.\n\nThe countdown is now on to Amazon's (AMZN) report, set for release after Thursday's market close. Eyes are on the all-important AWS cloud unit, expected to deliver a 21% jump in sales.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market flashed fresh signals of weakness: Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected, and job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020, while a new report found that last month marked the worst January for layoff announcements since 2009. The government's monthly jobs report is due next Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, silver (SI=F) plunged as much as 17%, erasing all of its two-day recovery as Chinese buyers dumped holdings. Wall Street is debating whether the recent record rally in silver and gold (GC=F) ran too high, too fast — and if a further slump awaits.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) also plunged to its lowest level since 2024, wiping out all of the gains accumulated during President Trump's second term. The token broke below $63,000 — amid a crisis of confidence.\n\nYahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:\n\nSilver (SI=F) prices tumbled 14% on Thursday to hover above $75 per ounce, erasing gains from the past two days. Gold (GC=F) futures also slipped to $4,900 per ounce after both metals had risen for a second consecutive day following last Friday’s sell-off.\n\nAnalysts warned that silver’s short-term rebound remains volatile, though they remain bullish on bullion prices over the medium term, despite last week’s dramatic pullback that interrupted a blistering rally over the past year.\n\n\"The widening divergence between gold and silver performance reinforces a recurring theme: silver behaves less like a monetary metal during periods of stress and more like a high-beta hybrid, amplifying both optimism and fear,\" Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's commodity strategy head, wrote on Thursday.\n\n\"History suggests that silver tends to stabilise only once realised volatility falls and speculative positioning is reset — conditions that are not yet fully in place,\" he added.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:\n\nMortgage rates barely budged this week: The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edged higher to 6.11% from 6.10%, while the 15-year fixed averaged 5.50% ticked up to 5.5% from 5.49% last week.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick and Laura Grace Tarpley note that the 10-year Treasury note, a pricing indicator for 30-year fixed mortgage rates, has hovered above 4.2% since mid-January. However, the spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates has narrowed recently, and the 30-year has resisted a substantial move higher.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nCheck out frequently asked questions about mortgage rates and our mortgage calculator here.\n\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes:\n\nCheck out the top takeaways from Sozzi and Schwab's conversation here.\n\nIt hasn't been a great day for jobs data, with the delayed JOLTS report serving as the final piece in a trifecta of negative news about layoffs, hiring, and unemployment claims.\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled below $64,000 on Thursday, its lowest level since October 2024.\n\nThe token is down nearly 50% from its all-time high last year, erasing all the gains made during President Trump's second term. Investors had been optimistic that the administration's crypto-friendly policies would lift digital-asset prices.\n\n\"Bitcoin remains in a larger bear-market structure,\" read a 10X Research note on Thursday. \"In the absence of a strong catalyst and with positioning still stretched, downside risks remain elevated.\"\n\nNotably, the firm points to a significant overhang — overexposed bitcoin ETF holders who are underwater, with an estimated average acquisition price near $90,000.\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out with ether (ETH), which tumbled 13% on Thursday. Investors holding Ethereum ETFs are down approximately 31% from their average cost basis, according to 10X Research data.\n\n\"Under these conditions, attracting incremental allocations from Wall Street investors becomes increasingly difficult, particularly when many existing holders likely regret not reducing exposure at significantly higher levels,\" the note said.\n\nAbsent a significant catalyst, the firm doesn't see a bottom to crypto's bear market until possibly the summer.\n\n\"As we have previously outlined, a cycle low around the FIFA World Cup this summer could mark a more compelling long-term buying opportunity,\" 10X Research analysts said.\n\nPeloton (PTON) shares fell more than 20% after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings and announced its CFO will be exiting.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports:\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) shares soared as much as 9% as the company said it will begin selling compounded copies of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy pill. The pill from Hims & Hers would cost about $100 less than Novo's, Reuters reported.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY) both saw shares tumble about 7% on the news.\n\nSoftware stocks have been hammered in the past few days, accelerating a months-long decline as investors become more fearful of disruption risks posed by new artificial intelligence tools — particularly those from Anthropic.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai was asked about the market belief that software stocks are losing ground during a call with analysts following the Google parent's earnings report Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe CEO said: \"Look, at least from my vantage point, I definitely see we have very, very good SaaS (software as a service) customers who are leaders in their respective categories.\"\n\nThose customers include Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), and Salesforce (CRM), per Bloomberg data.\n\nPichai continued: \"And what I see the successful companies doing is they are definitely incorporating Gemini deeply in critical workflows, be it on improving their product experience and driving growth or using it to drive efficiency within their organizations.\"\n\n\"[J]ust like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services.. I think the [software] companies who are seizing the moment, I think, have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHis comments echo those of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week.\n\nRead more about what's driving fears over AI eating into the competitive moats of SaaS leaders here.\n\nThe performance of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, AWS, will be keenly examined when its earnings report lands later, after Microsoft (MSFT) stock plunged last week, in part due to a slowdown in cloud growth.\n\nThis was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers.\n\n“It isn’t clear how much of Microsoft’s disappointment might be due to company-specific issues and how much might reflect an overall slowing in the cloud space,” said David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, which holds Amazon shares in several portfolios. “If it’s the latter, that could carry over.”\n\n... Amazon’s results come against a backdrop of anti-software sentiment that’s weighing on the entire tech sector as investors try to sort the winners and losers from the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to develop artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft’s aggressive AI-related capital expenditures, alongside the slowing Azure growth, invited new questions about when these investments will pay off more substantially.\n\n“It’s really about what’s already priced into the stock, and I think what was starting to price in for [Microsoft] was a higher growth rate, which is always a little dangerous,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “We haven’t really seen Amazon moving up in the same way.”\n\nAt the market open, US stocks plunged for a third day as a broad sell-off in tech names continued.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, sinking 1.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.5%.\n\nUS weekly applications for unemployment benefits increased by more than expected last week, as snowstorms across much of the country may have led more people to file for assistance.\n\nJobless claims for the week ending Jan. 31 increased by 22,000 to 231,000 claims, exceeding economists' forecasts, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nContinuing claims, a proxy for the total number of people receiving state unemployment benefits, increased to 1.84 million.\n\nDistortions from winter weather notwithstanding, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits suggests the labor market remains broadly stable if not cooling gradually.\n\nThough in a sign of cracks appearing in the \"low hire, low fire\" trend that has characterized the labor market for over a year, layoffs jumped in January to their highest level for that month in 17 years, according to Challenger data (scroll down for more on this).\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports:\n\nJeff Bezos came, he saw, he conquered.\n\nMaybe not in the way you'd expect from a onetime financial savior of an iconic newspaper. There are now two Bezos eras at the Washington Post: The first started when he rescued it in 2013. The second began when he saw it gutted, blessing mass layoffs the company executed on Wednesday.\n\n... On social media and in news coverage in the aftermath, Post employees, the labor union, and alumni (myself included) strongly criticized the decision.\n\nOthers have pointed to more recent moves by Bezos.\n\nLeading up to the Post's deep cuts, several media observers highlighted Amazon's enormous budget to produce and market the new documentary \"Melania,\" about first lady Melania Trump.\n\nAmazon's extraordinary spending prompted questions about the movie working as a kind of bribe from Bezos to the White House. (Amazon says they licensed the movie because they think people will love it. The film's Rotten Tomatoes scores and box office numbers have inspired a news cycle of their own.)\n\nBut the splashy Melania rollout provided an ugly contrast to the austerity Bezos was serving down to the Post's newsroom. In the worst light, critics said Bezos was willing to burn money to please the president but was now unwilling to do so for journalism in the public interest.\n\nRead more here in the takeaway from today's Morning Brief.\n\nChinese EV maker Nio (NIO) sent its shareholders a profit alert on Thursday morning, letting them know that the company expects to post its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter.\n\nNio said it will see an adjusted profit from operations of 200 million Chinese yuan (approximately $29 million) to 700 million yuan (approximately $100 million).\n\nThe company attributed the profit to sustained sales growth, improved margins from its product mix, and ongoing cost-cutting measures.\n\nNio stock popped 6% in premarket trading.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, as tariff woes sent the beauty group's shares tumbling.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) stock fell over 5% during premarket hours on Thursday after bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell below 70,000. Strategy is one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency.\n\nTapestry (TPR) stock rose 5% before the bell. Coach's parent company beat analysts' estimates on revenue and raised its full-year guidance.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) US-listed shares rose 5% before the bell on Thursday after announcing plans to issue its first dividend to shareholders, along with a three-year stock buyback program worth $5 billion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled, falling $71,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the leading cryptocurrency was paring deeper overnight losses in the wake of Bessent's comments, after entering the key mid-$70,000 support region.\n\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferré and Grace O'Donnell report:\n\nSnap (SNAP) stock galloped higher after a strong holiday quarter for advertising lifted earnings above Wall Street's estimates.\n\nSnap stock rose 6% before the bell on Thursday.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the video messaging app reported revenue of $1.71 billion and earnings per share of $0.03. That beat Wall Street estimates of $1.7 billion in revenue and a $0.03 loss per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) demonstrated resilience in the fourth quarter following a difficult 2025, with a strong earnings beat and guidance raise.\n\nThe affordable cosmetics manufacturer lifted its full-year 2026 sales outlook to a range of $1.6 billion to $1.61 billion from its previous range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion. The company also sees greater earnings per share of $3.05-$3.10, an increase from the previous range of $2.80-$2.85.\n\nThe stock soared by as much as 8% in premarket trading on Thursdayas the company looks to regain its footing after higher tariffs and other challenges led the stock to lose 40% in 2025. However, the stock pared some of those gains, perhaps due to lower gross margins amid ongoing tariff costs.\n\nLast year, the company also acquired Hailey Bieber's Rhode brand.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, e.l.f. reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $0.65 versus $0.55 expected by Wall Street analysts. Net sales jumped 38% to $489.5 million, topping estimates of $461 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Our value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine continue to fuel our brands,\" CEO Tarang Amin said in a statement. \"We remain confident in our ability to grow market share and deliver best-in-class growth in beauty, as reflected by our raised fiscal 2026 outlook.\"\n\nRead more about e.l.f.'s quarter from Reuters.\n\nArm Holdings shares fall as licensing sales miss estimates.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) stock rose 5% before the bell on Thursday following Alphabet's (GOOG) capital expenditure plans, which surpassed analysts' expectations.\n\nGoogle's parent company forecast 2026 capital expenditures of $180 billion, news that is a potential boon to Broadcom, which partners with Alphabet on custom chips.\n\n“That is an incredible number. We are laughing because that number is so good for the Google cohort,” Ben Reitzes, Melius Research head of technology research, told CNBC.\n\nGoogle is not the only company increasing its capex spend to build AI data centers: Oracle (ORCL) is doing the same and raised its forecast to around $50 billion.\n\nGoogle's AI software doesn't just use Nvidia (NVDA) chips, but it also uses its own tensor processing units (TPUs). For Gemini 3, Google used TPUs, which Broadcom helped to make.\n\nSilver (SI=F) fell sharply, wiping out a two-day recovery, as the white metal struggled to find a floor following a historic market rout. Gold (GC=F) also declined.\n\nSpot silver plunged as much as 17% on Thursday, having flickered briefly above $90 an ounce in early Asian trading. After a record-breaking rally that appeared to run too far, too fast, the metal has retreated by more than a third from an all-time high hit on Jan. 29.\n\n“Sentiment seems to have turned soggy across most asset classes, including regional equities and metals,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. This has created “a feedback loop amid thin market liquidity,” he said.\n\nThe sudden and sharp decline in precious metals also weighed on sentiment in base metals markets, with copper falling more than 1% to slip below $13,000 a ton. Meanwhile, spot gold dropped as much as 3.5% in choppy trading.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) stock fell around 11% in premarket trading on Thursday after the chip designer's results beat on the top and bottom lines but its forecast was lighter than expected. A memory chip shortage stemming from data center developers scooping up chips and chipmakers shifting production to cater to AI demand added pressure to the company's outlook.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, the company said revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.3 billion, while earnings per share rose to $2.78. Qualcomm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with consensus estimates forecasting $12.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.75, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the fiscal second quarter dimmed as a supply crunch in memory chips weighs on margins and the smartphone market.\n\nSecond quarter revenue is expected in the range of $10.2 billion to $11 billion (analysts were looking for $11 billion at the midpoint). Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 (the Street was hoping for $2.87).\n\n\"While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high tier smartphones, and remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029 revenue goals,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the earnings release.",

    "fullText": "Man misidentified by London supermarket using Facewatch system says: ‘I shouldn’t have to prove I am not a criminal’\n\nA man was ordered to leave a supermarket in London after staff misidentified him using controversial new facial recognition technology.\n\nWarren Rajah was told to abandon his shopping and leave the local store he has been using for a number of years after an “Orwellian” error in a Sainsbury’s in Elephant and Castle, London.\n\nHe said supermarket staff were unable to explain why he was being told to leave, and would only direct him to a QR code leading to the website of the firm Facewatch, which the retailer has hired to run facial recognition in some of its stores. He said when he contacted Facewatch, he was told to send in a picture of himself and a photograph of his passport before the firm confirmed it had no record of him on its database.\n\n“One of the reasons I was angry was because I shouldn’t have to prove I am innocent,” Rajah said. “I shouldn’t have to prove I’m wrongly identified as a criminal.” He described the incident as feeling “quite like Minority Report, Orwellian”.\n\nHe said while doing his normal shop, he was approached by three members of the store’s staff, one of whom appeared to affirm that he was the person pictured on a device they had. It is understood the Facewatch system flagged someone else who had entered the store, and staff mistook Rajah for him.\n\nRajah was concerned some form of permanent record implying he had been involved in criminality might have been created on Facewatch’s system. Eventually, the firm told him he was not on its database and referred him back to Sainsbury’s.\n\n“You felt quite helpless in the situation because you’re just thrown from pillar to post – because Sainsbury’s initially blame Facewatch, then Facewatch retort saying it’s actually Sainsbury’s,” he said. “And then, when Sainsbury’s called me on Wednesday from the executive office, they blamed the store staff. So they’re constantly shifting the blame as to who’s responsible for this.”\n\nRajah was upset that he felt he had had to prove his innocence – and said he had received little assurance about how the information he had to hand over to Facewatch was stored, and whether it had been deleted.\n\nAnd he said that, while he was lucky enough to be able to navigate the system, “what happens to the vulnerable people who, for example, have learning disabilities or don’t know how to scan a QR code? They haven’t put any processes or procedures in place for anybody to challenge this. You should not be expected to send your personal information – that is totally unacceptable.”\n\nSainsbury’s said: “We have been in contact with Mr Rajah to sincerely apologise for his experience in our Elephant and Castle store. This was not an issue with the facial recognition technology in use but a case of the wrong person being approached in store.”\n\nFacewatch said: “We’re sorry to hear about Mr Rajah’s experience and understand why it would have been upsetting. This incident arose from a case of human error in store, where a member of staff approached the wrong customer.\n\n“Our data protection team followed the usual process to confirm his identity and verified that he was not on our database and had not been subject to any alerts generated by Facewatch.”",

    "description": "From scrapped EVs to Formula 1 tech and battery ambitions, Ford's 2026 roadmap is full of sharp turns. Not all of them point where you'd expect.",
    "fullText": "Ford is starting 2026 on a tumultuous note, with bright as well as gloomy prospects for the year ahead. The company began a fresh journey with massive charges totaling $19.5 billion in its bid to restructure its EV roadmap, canceling multiple projects and shifting focus to more profitable avenues. The company's plans to manufacture lithium iron phosphate cells and energy storage systems in partnership with CATL have just attracted the scrutiny of a U.S. House committee. Then it was reported that Ford was planning a partnership with the Chinese giant Xiaomi over electric cars, a rumor that was swiftly denied by both brands.\n\nIn the meantime, the company also landed a plum engineering opportunity and designed Red Bull's Formula One racing car engine. The journey ahead, however, is not going to be an easy one for the brand. Ford chief Jim Farley recently claimed that Chinese car brands are an \"existential threat\" and that they might unsettle the North American market. The warning has already started to take shape. China and Canada have struck a trade deal that ends the 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars and brings it down to just 6.1%, though there's a cap on the number of imported units.\n\nThe likes of BYD have already toppled Tesla as the world's biggest EV brand, and they're now knocking at the North American market's doors. Plus, the progress in tech stack, especially in terms of battery efficiency and in-cabin conveniences, is making Ford EVs look overpriced. All these market factors have kick-started some major internal changes and restructuring at Ford. And what's lined up for the carmaker in 2026 could very well change the company's trajectory in the years to come.\n\nThe global EV market is expected to slow down in 2026, as per a market research shared by Reuters. Moreover, the end of the EV tax credit slowed down the adoption in the North American market. S&P Global also notes that the current year is going to be a tough one for electric cars in the U.S. Ford is no exception and has adjusted its electrification plans accordingly. The biggest casualty of this new shift is the F-150 Lightning electric truck, which is no longer a part of Ford's immediate plans. Instead, the company is turning the iconic ride into a hybrid.\n\nThe company is also canceling its electric vans destined for the European and North American markets. \"Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs, and regulatory changes,\" the company said in a press statement. Instead of duking it out in the premium segment, Ford says it's going to focus on a lineup of smaller and more efficient electric cars. The carmaker notes that the first car to come out under this adjusted roadmap is an upcoming electric pickup truck that will be built atop the Universal EV platform and will arrive next year.",

    "title": "A New AI Math Startup Just Cracked 4 Previously Unsolved Problems",
    "description": "Axiom says its AI found solutions to several long-standing math problems, a sign of the technology’s steadily advancing reasoning capabilities.",
    "fullText": "mathematicians Dawei Chen and Quentin Gendron were trying to untangle a difficult area of algebraic geometry involving differentials, elements of calculus used to measure distance along curved surfaces. While working on one theorem, they ran into an unexpected roadblock: Their argument depended on a strange formula from number theory, but they were unable to solve or justify it. In the end, Chen and Gendron wrote a paper presenting their idea as a conjecture, rather than a theorem.\n\nChen recently spent hours prompting ChatGPT in the hopes of getting the AI to come up with a solution to the still unsolved problem, but it wasn’t working. Then, during a reception at a math conference in Washington, DC, last month, Chen ran into Ken Ono, a well-known mathematician who had recently left his job at the University of Virginia to join Axiom, an artificial intelligence startup cofounded by one of his mentees, Carina Hong.\n\nChen told Ono about the problem, and the following morning, Ono presented him with a proof, courtesy of his startup’s math-solving AI, AxiomProver. “Everything fell into place naturally after that,” says Chen, who worked with Axiom to write up the proof, which has now been posted to arXiv, a public repository for academic papers.\n\nAxiom’s AI tool found a connection between the problem and a numerical phenomenon first studied in the 19th century. It then devised a proof, which it helpfully verified itself. “What AxiomProver found was something that all the humans had missed,” Ono tells WIRED.\n\nThe proof is one of several solutions to unsolved math problems that Axiom says its system has come up with in recent weeks. The AI has not yet solved any of the most famous (or lucrative) problems in the field of mathematics, but it has found answers to questions that have stumped experts in different areas for years. The proofs are evidence of AI’s steadily advancing math abilities. In recent months, other mathematicians have reported using AI tools to explore new ideas and solve existing problems.\n\nThe techniques being developed by Axiom may prove useful outside the world of advanced math. For example, the same approaches could be used to develop software that is more resilient to certain kinds of cybersecurity attacks. This would involve using AI to verify that code is provably reliable and trustworthy.\n\n“Math is really the great test ground and sandbox for reality,” says Hong, Axiom’s CEO. “We do believe that there are a lot of pretty important use cases of high commercial value.”\n\nAxiom’s approach involves combining large language models with a proprietary AI system called AxiomProver that is trained to reason through math problems to reach solutions that are provably correct. In 2024, Google demonstrated a similar idea with a system called AlphaProof. Hong says that AxiomSolver incorporates several significant advances and newer techniques.\n\nOno says the AI-generated proof for the Chen-Gendron conjecture shows how AI can now meaningfully assist professional mathematicians. “This is a new paradigm for proving theorems,” he says.\n\nAxiom’s system is more than just a regular AI model, in that it is able to verify proofs using a specialized mathematical language called Lean. Rather than just search through the literature, this allows AxiomProver to develop genuinely novel ways of solving problems.\n\nAnother one of the new proofs generated by AxiomProver demonstrates how the AI is capable of solving math problems entirely on its own. That proof, which has also been described in a paper posted to arXiv, provides a solution to Fel’s Conjecture, which concerns syzygies, or mathematical expressions where numbers line up in algebra. Remarkably, the conjecture involves formulas first found in the notebook of legendary Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan more than 100 years ago. In this case AxiomProver did not just fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, it devised the proof from start to finish.",

Prices had dropped as much as 17% earlier in the session.\n\nThursday's slide erased two days of gains for the white metal, which plunged as much as 36% on Friday at the height of the selloff.\n\nThe drop marks a sharp reversal for a market that had been on a tear just days earlier, with silver hitting a record high above $121 per ounce last week.\n\nGold also retreated, slipping below the $5,000 level to trade around $4,934 per ounce.\n\nPrices of the precious metals came amid a rise in the US Dollar Index to a two-week high, which makes dollar-denominated commodities pricier.\n\n\"The inverse relationship between precious metals and the US dollar has reasserted itself, leaving gold and silver particularly sensitive to near-term FX moves,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING on Tuesday.\n\n\"Looking ahead, the dollar is likely to remain a key driver of short-term price action, with precious metals broadly moving in the opposite direction,\" she added.\n\nAnalysts warn that silver is likely to remain especially volatile, as the market is far smaller than gold — a dynamic that can amplify price swings.\n\nEven before Friday's selloff, hedge funds had already been trimming long positions in silver and other metals, with managed money reducing exposure to surging metals and reallocating into energy and other commodities.\n\nIn other corners of the market, risk assets more broadly were under pressure, with tech stocks and cryptocurrencies sliding in choppy trading.\n\nSoftware stocks came under pressure this week after Anthropic unveiled a new AI tool capable of handling clerical and administrative work in the legal sector.

    "description": "What was once a stable and profitable tech business now faces an existential question: What happens if AI tools and agents replace business software?",
    "fullText": "In 2011, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared \"software is eating the world.\" Today, AI is beginning to devour software.\n\nInstead of helping the industry improve, new AI tools and agents could end up replacing some software products entirely.\n\nThis anxiety crystallized in recent weeks with three developments: Anthropic's release of a new autonomous AI agent called Cowork, the launch of industry-specific Cowork plugins, and the rise of OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant spreading rapidly through messaging apps.\n\n\"Is this the end for software?\" Raimo Lenshow, a veteran tech analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent note to investors. \"The current situation in software feels very unique with the large overhang of how AI will impact the space in the long-run.\"\n\nToday, companies get stuff done through a complex collection of different software services that help them wrangle data, track financials, sell products, and manage employees, customers, supply chains, and contracts. (If you've ever had to login to Workday, you'll know what I mean).\n\nGenerative AI is a threat to these applications in two main ways. First, if employees get more efficient using AI tools, companies may not need to buy as many business software subscriptions. That would dent the growth of \"seats,\" or how many subscriptions software companies sell. Each employee has a seat, so if there's no new hiring, growth stalls.\n\nThe second threat is more existential. If AI tools and AI agents get good enough, companies could replace the software they use entirely and instead rely on new AI-powered workflows. And with AI coding tools showing big improvements lately, companies could even develop their own software, without needing to buy it from established vendors.\n\nThis is why Anthropic's recent announcements have hit the software sector so hard.\n\nAnthropic's Cowork marks a clear step beyond chatbots. Instead of simply answering questions, Cowork can plan and execute multi-step tasks on a user's computer. Users can grant it access to folders, files, and applications, allowing the AI to clean up documents, build spreadsheets and slide decks, analyze data, automate workflows, and even log into web apps to collect information.\n\nBarclays analysts described Cowork as closer to what Microsoft originally envisioned for Copilot—a true digital worker—but with far greater autonomy. Microsoft shares are down about 12% in the past week or so.\n\nCowork is designed for non-technical and semi-technical users, such as marketers, project managers, and finance professionals, who can direct it using plain English. That matters because it weakens the traditional value proposition of many SaaS tools. If an AI agent can organize files, generate reports, build dashboards, and automate routine workflows on demand, the need for a dedicated, single-purpose application starts to look less obvious.\n\nThe threat became more concrete when Anthropic followed up by launching plugins for Cowork this week. These plugins effectively turn the AI into a specialist for roles like sales, finance, legal, marketing, and customer support, connecting it directly to internal data sources and tools. Anthropic even open-sourced a starter set of plugins, signaling an ecosystem approach rather than a closed product.\n\n\"This is another front-of-mind example of an AI tool lowering the barrier to entry, gaining traction, and disrupting incumbent workflows,\" said Michelle Miller, co-head of the Enterprise Software Technology group at consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\nFor years, companies bought software because building it themselves was too slow and expensive. Generative AI is flipping that equation. Tools like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI-powered coding assistants, and products from StackBlitz, Replit, and others allow non-engineers to create custom tools with relatively simple English language prompts.\n\nNetlify CEO Matt Biilmann has said his own employees have used AI to build internal replacements for SaaS products like survey and quoting tools. Venture capitalist Martin Casado has described building a personal CRM with AI because it was easier than learning a complex off-the-shelf product. Salesforce, the leading CRM software vendor, is down about 40% in the past year.\n\nStackblitz CEO Eric Simons said his startup has created in-house AI agents for many workflows, including business intelligence, data analysis, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\n\"As a result, there are many SaaS vendors we would have likely previously used that are no longer relevant,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The industry is waking up to the fact that AI is becoming extremely good at creating software autonomously,\" he added. \"This brings questions around what 'moats' exist for incumbent companies that are not themselves frontier AI labs.\"\n\nThis shift is especially dangerous for mid-sized SaaS companies. According to AlixPartners, they're being squeezed between nimble AI-native startups on one side and tech giants bundling AI into existing platforms on the other. Enterprise buyers, under pressure to cut costs, are increasingly asking why they need five tools when one AI tool or agent can do some, or most, of the work.\n\nPricing adds another layer of tension. AI systems are expensive to run, making traditional per-seat pricing harder to justify. Companies like ServiceNow are experimenting with hybrid and usage-based models. CEO Bill McDermott has insisted AI isn't hurting results, but investors remain skeptical. ServiceNow shares have plunged 25% in the past month.\n\nIf Cowork represents a top-down push from a well-funded AI lab, OpenClaw, formerly called Moltbot, shows how disruption can also come from the bottom up.\n\nCreated as a personal project and released as open source, OpenClaw is a messaging-first AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage. Relying heavily on Anthropic's Claude models, OpenClaw remembers context, proactively nudges users, and can automate tasks using browser actions, scripts, and scheduled jobs. After a month or so of relative obscurity, it went viral in late January.\n\nWhat caught investors' attention wasn't just OpenClaw's popularity, but what it represents. Instead of logging into multiple apps, users interact with an AI agent in a chat window and let it orchestrate tasks behind the scenes. In effect, the interface becomes conversation, not software menus.\n\nBarclays analysts noted that OpenClaw's underlying \"gateway,\" which routes tasks between agents and tools, resembles the orchestration layer that many enterprise software vendors are now racing to build.\n\nThe difference is that OpenClaw is free, open source, and user-controlled — a worrying combination for software incumbents that rely on expensive licenses. It's also a potential problem because the direct user relationship is now controlled by OpenClaw, not software providers.\n\nNone of this means software is disappearing overnight. Core systems of record — databases, payroll systems, accounting ledgers — remain deeply embedded in corporate operations. But the layers around them are becoming fluid. Dashboards, workflows, reports, and even entire applications can now be generated and used on the fly by AI agents.\n\nFor SaaS companies, the message is stark. Adapt by embracing agents, flexible pricing, and AI-native design — or risk becoming the next thing AI consumes.\n\n\"AI is forcing change across software development, AI governance and data security, go-to-market operations, pricing models, valuation frameworks, and business structure,\" AlixPartners' Miller said. \"Software companies mastering these transitions will define the winners in the next era, and those unable to adapt will be sidelined as industry fundamentals are redrawn.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Anthropic's latest AI tool was seen by the legal software industry as a 'shot across the bow.' Here's what it means.",
    "description": "A new plugin from the AI startup has sent legal tech into a spin, sparking debate across the industry.",
    "fullText": "A new tool from Anthropic is stoking debate over whether AI will replace existing software that has dominated the legal sector for years.\n\nThe release of Anthropic's Cowork legal plugin sparked a steep sell-off in legal software stocks. Shares of Thomson Reuters and RLEX, makers of legal software, dropped about 15% each on Tuesday. Both stocks recovered slightly on Wednesday, though they remain fervently in the red for the week.\n\nThe slump isn't really about one Claude plugin. It pokes at a deeper question: If AI models become good enough for lawyers, will anyone need traditional legal software?\n\nOn one side are the two companies that have ruled legal tech for decades: Thomson Reuters and LexisNexis. They argue that lawyers will keep buying their software tools because their AI features are grounded in a walled garden of vetted case law, statutes, and editorial content. They claim less hallucination risk and fewer career-ending mistakes.\n\nOn the other side are the fast-rising startups, such as Harvey and Legora, and foundation model companies. They're betting lawyers will accept — or learn to manage — more risk in exchange for speed, flexibility, and tools that feel closer to a true \"virtual associate\" than a smarter search box.\n\nThis week's market reaction suggests investors are starting to price in an uncomfortable possibility: a new wave of competitors is finally pushing into a corner of the legal market that hasn't faced a real challenger in decades.\n\nAnalysts at William Blair & Co. wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that Anthropic's entry into the legal market brings \"a structural concern\" about the relevancy and \"moats of information services names under this new AI paradigm.\"\n\nIf you work in legal, it was hard to open LinkedIn over the past 24 hours without running into a wall of hot takes about Anthropic's new plugin.\n\nOne legal-tech startup employee described it to Business Insider as \"the Claude announcement that launched 1,000 ships.\"\n\nZachary Amron, deputy general counsel at the tech company Valon, said it's only a matter of time before Anthropic ships more legal-specific tools. Anthropic has not said publicly if it plans to go deeper in legal.\n\nNot everyone in legal tech is panicking. At GC AI, a startup that builds software for in-house legal teams rather than law firms, the mood was closer to a shrug.\n\nIn an internal memo seen by Business Insider, founder Cecilia Ziniti told employees that Anthropic's legal plugin was \"very raw and not a threat to us.\"\n\nZiniti's broader point was that foundation models may be powerful, but they're still just infrastructure. \"Claude gives people a great engine,\" she wrote. \"We already have one in our car. But does that suddenly mean everyone is going to assemble their own cars in their garage? Do you change your own oil? No.\"\n\nThe analogy mirrors a familiar pattern in tech. Amazon Web Services offers services that are similar to those sold by software companies, including many software-as-a-service companies that run on AWS's cloud. And yet, the specialized software vendors are often still more popular. Trust and experience still command a premium.\n\nZiniti sounded unbothered about Anthropic's impact on her own business. She was less charitable about the outcome for legacy vendors, and said the sell-off in Thomson Reuters and RLEX made sense to her.\n\n\"They make horses,\" she wrote. \"The tech now is cars.\"\n\nOthers saw the Anthropic launch less as a threat than as a demand generator.\n\nLogan Brown, a former Cooley lawyer who now runs a company, Soxton, that provides legal services to startups, said interest in her business spiked almost immediately after Anthropic's legal plugin dropped. She described a deluge of LinkedIn messages from investors betting her company would be among the survivors, because, Brown said, it serves founders, not lawyers, who don't want to gamble on legal paperwork.\n\nSome lawyers are stress-testing Anthropic's Claude chatbot in their day-to-day work.\n\nAmron, the Valon in-house lawyer, said he was already using Claude to assist with contract review. He vibe-coded a skill that compares versions of an agreement, drops the changes into a chart, and flags whether each revision helps or hurts the company.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Amron asked Claude to demo the new legal plugin for him. It generated a mock contract and walked through how it would review it.\n\nWhen the lawyer skimmed the underlying code, he noticed the system tried to pull information from Wikipedia. He wasn't impressed.\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at mrussell@businessinsider.com or Signal at @MeliaRussell.01. Use a personal email address and a non-work device.

    "fullText": "Everyone's freaking out about AI again, which means it's time to rethink how secure your career is.\n\nBI's Ana Altchek has a piece about how to future-proof your job since the only certainty in the job market appears to be more uncertainty.\n\nA market meltdown in software stocks has people on edge this time. The characters might have changed, but the plot is still the same.\n\nA new tool (an AI plugin from Anthropic) launched to automate work (tracking compliance and reviewing legal docs) leads to a sell-off among leaders in the space (legal-software stocks).\n\nWe can debate whether the reaction was warranted (more on that below), but this narrative isn't going away. AI companies will keep automating different types of work, leaving the companies in that space scrambling and their employees nervous.\n\nAna spoke to experts about different ways to get ahead, from auditing your job to the skills you can lean into to build more career immunity. Overall, the idea is not to get caught flat-footed.\n\nFor more on the inner workings and culture of the business world, check out Ana's weekly series \"This Week at Work,\" and (You're still required to read this every day, though. No excuses.)\n\nOne group has felt particularly safe amid the AI chaos.\n\nTrade workers have been sitting pretty as panic rises among the white-collar workforce. A recent survey conducted by The Harris Poll found 75% of Americans agree that \"hands-on skills and practical experience matter more than formal degrees when it comes to career success.\"\n\nAnd even more (78%) agreed \"the stigma around trade or blue-collar work is declining\" because hands-on skills are becoming so valuable.\n\nThe leaders of the AI revolution, from Elon Musk to Jensen Huang, have also praised tradework as a much more resilient career path.\n\nThat is likely the case in the short term. But down the road, all bets are off. Tesla is aggressively pushing into humanoid robots. OpenAI is also quietly scaling its robotics project.\n\nThere's a long way to go, with most robots being more flop than pop. But the potential and interest in developing the space is there, as was evident at this year's Davos. And some see the eventual economic impact of physical AI being far greater than that of software.\n\nBecause eventually, AI will come for all of us if we're not willing to adapt.",

    "fullText": "Whether you’re chasing gym quality on a budget or a fancy folding model, accelerate your training with our expert’s pick of the best running machines\n\nThe best running shoes, tried and tested by runners\n\n The best running watches\n\nAlthough the treadmill has been around since the early 1800s, when it was once used to punish prisoners (sounds about right), it didn’t become a common feature in the home until the late 1960s, when William Staub unleashed his PaceMaster 600 on the US public.\n\nWhere they were once a simple rolling deck, treadmills today are often glossy pieces of interactive tech. Many now offer on-demand, real-time workouts (pioneered by Peloton) and the latest blockbuster movies via streaming services. Even if your treadmill doesn’t sport a whopping touchscreen display, it probably works nicely with heart-rate monitors, smartwatches and smartphone apps to track workouts and offer performance statistics after every session.\n\nRunning decks have become more cushioned to offer better joint protection, and motor technology is now quieter and more efficient than ever. A treadmill still takes up a fair amount of space, but there are now compact folding options to help address this.\n\nThe best treadmills on sale now are a far cry from those torturous devices designed to make the incarcerated sweat away their sins, offering ingenious ways to keep fit and, perhaps more importantly, make fitness more fun.\n\nBest treadmill overall:\n\n Peloton Tread\n\nBest budget treadmill:\nJTX Slimline\n\nBest for gym quality: \n\n JTX Sprint-9 Pro\n\nBest folding treadmill: \n\n ProForm Pro 9000\n\nAs a fitness fan partaking in gym-based strength training, outdoor trail runs, kickboxing classes and cold-water surfing, I have long been tasked with testing exercise gear for leading fitness and technology magazines.\n\nWhatever I’m testing, I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whether that’s surfing with the latest smartwatch in cold weather or feeling the burn with a set of connected kettlebells.\n\nI’m a strong believer in living with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. When it comes to treadmills, that has been to the detriment of any additional storage space my terrace house offers.\n\nWithout wanting to become a “first-world problems” meme, testing treadmills isn’t easy. They’re massive, for one, which means logistical management in having them delivered and then collected.\n\nI tested all the treadmills on this list over several months, trialling some systems for weeks, and others over a couple of arduous sessions. Where I could introduce a model to my home, I did. If it didn’t fit there, it was shoehorned into an office space I rent.\n\nFailing that, I arranged to get hands-on (or should that be feet-on?) with a model at the manufacturer’s headquarters or a dedicated showroom. One of the treadmills was handily used by my local gym.\n\nWith every treadmill, I aimed to test all the connected features, typically pairing a smartwatch (Apple and Garmin) and a chest-based heart-rate monitor, as well as trialling any on-demand video and audio services. Where relevant, I tried live and on-demand workouts on any subscription packages and any gamified content available.\n\nDuring each test, I aimed to rack up as much mileage as possible, sweating it out over longer runs and more intense sprint sessions. If an elevation feature was available, I activated it, and if there was sled or resistance training, I’d dive into that too.\n\nMost of the treadmills were tested in a space where I could assess how much noise they made when in use, rather than trialling them in a busy gym where the thump of a deck or the whine of an electric motor is typically drowned out by background noise.\n\nAll of the units were only ever offered to me on a loan basis, so they’ve made their way back to their respective suppliers. Due to this, it would be wrong of me to comment on their longevity or ability to withstand years of abuse, although I did get a good feel for build quality in the time I spent with them.\n\nPeloton arguably dragged the treadmill into the 21st century when it launched the Tread. The brand ushered in an era of on-demand classes led by real instructors, accountability in the form of live leaderboards and a plethora of engaging workouts able to be performed anywhere and at any time.\n\nWho knew that bolting a big touchscreen to a fairly standard treadmill would cause such a stir? However, Peloton sales soared during the pandemic, and it continues to be one of the best products for most people, beginners and seasoned runners alike. As a result, it has spawned several rivals.\n\nIn terms of cushioning, noise levels and deck comfort, the treadmill experience offered by the Peloton Tread is good, but it’s not the best out there. In fact, there are better for the money. But what makes Peloton worth the cost is that its fitness ecosystem of live and on-demand classes is so good. There’s very little else out there that’s as fun, engaging and supportive, helping not only those at the beginning of their fitness journey but also improving performance in more serious athletes.\n\nWhy we love it\nPeloton’s treadmill itself is a neat piece of equipment, with its compact and easy-to-live-with design slotting into most domestic settings. The unit is competitive in terms of its top speeds and max incline (20km/h and 12.5% grade), while two simple roller mechanisms control both. During some sessions, the Tread will automatically adjust, depending on the goals.\n\nAlthough neither the quietest nor the most cushioned deck to run on, this machine majors in its expansive All-Access membership. This opens up a world of on-treadmill training sessions, live classes hosted by instructors who have now gained quasi-celebrity status, and in-depth training programmes covering everything from couch to 5K up to marathon prep.\n\nShould you not feel like being instructed by a bubbly, gorgeous and irritatingly tanned personal instructor, you can always binge movies, audiobooks and live and on-demand TV shows by harnessing the Peloton Entertainment app offering, or pump a popular music playlist from the impressive 26W front-facing speakers. This is all delivered via the crisp 23.8in full colour, high-definition touchscreen.\n\nAlthough there are now rivals that offer a similar level of interactivity and technology, few have managed to nail the execution quite like Peloton. It’s fun, highly polished and motivating, all at the same time. Above all else, it’s addictive – and surely that’s all you can ask for in the quest to keep fit.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s expensive, and membership to online classes costs an additional £45 a month.\n\nDimensions: 84 x 173 x 157cm (WLH)\nWeight: 132kg\nRunning area: 50 x 150cm\nMax speed: 20km/h\nMax incline: 12.5%\nFolding: no\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, through Peloton’s dedicated Entertainment app\n\nIf you can overlook the fact that this doesn’t feel as robust as its larger, static rivals (see below), this Slimline model from JTX is perfect for those who lack the space at home for a full-size treadmill – it folds flat and can easily be moved into storage when not in use.\n\nThe company also offers an incline version (about £699), which feels surprisingly stable at maximum incline when running, but this cheaper and more basic option is perfect for those who prefer jogging, lower-impact training or simply those who want to increase their daily step count.\n\nWith a 16km/h top speed, it’s no slouch, but the narrow deck and 1.75hp motor won’t suit those hoping for a more punishing workout.\n\nWhy we love it\nUnlike so many treadmills available today, the JTX Slimline is compact and lightweight, making it relatively easy to wheel around tighter spaces. After all, not everyone is blessed with a dedicated gym at home, so we often have to make do with a temporary setup in the living room. The Slimline is perfect for this.\n\nThe machine folds flat when it’s not in use, and it can be propped against a wall or tucked away in a cupboard to keep it out of sight. It features an impressive top speed, which is great for something so compact, while the small performance motor is relatively quiet.\n\nUsers will have to bring their own entertainment in the form of a tablet or music played through headphones, but the unit does feature built-in Bluetooth so it can relay running data to accompanying apps, such as Strava or the Zwift virtual running software.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it feels too flimsy to endure serious sprint training, yet it’s too large and bulky to take the place of a simple walking deck for daily step-count enthusiasts.\n\nDimensions: 70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH)\nWeight: 43kg\nRunning area: 45 x 122cm\nMax speed: 16km/h\nMax incline: 0%\nFolding: yes\nBuilt-in entertainment: no\n\nJTX likes to pride itself on offering commercial-grade fitness equipment for those on a domestic budget. The resulting kit is built to last, comes with a generous warranty and provides a similar experience to what you might find in your local gym.\n\nThe Sprint-9 Pro may lack the bells, whistles and interactive touchscreens of more expensive rivals, but it has a generously sized running deck, a powerful 4hp brushless motor, and a whopping 22km/h top speed at an 11% max incline.\n\nWhy we love it\nWith its punchy motor and serious incline, this treadmill makes it possible to achieve a challenging workout without a fitness professional telling you what to do. You can always set up a tablet or smartphone to indulge in a Peloton-esque experience with the appropriate apps and subscriptions, of course, but JTX also offers 36 preinstalled workout programmes for those who like to keep things slightly more analogue.\n\nThe build quality is excellent, the CushionStep running deck spacious and comfortable, and the built-in Bluetooth speakers make it possible to soundtrack a run when paired with a tablet or phone – just don’t expect Ibiza club levels of sound quality.\n\nDon’t be fooled by its lack of an interactive screen: the Sprint-9 Pro still synchronises running data with services such as Zwift, Strava and Kinomap (as well as connecting to Bluetooth heart-rate monitors). You just have to provide your own technology to make the most of these features.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t have easy-to-reach adjustment dials for speed and incline, and the built-in heart-rate sensors aren’t the most comfortable to hold.\n\nDimensions: 84 x 195 x 155cm (WLH)\nWeight: 125kg\nRunning area: 55 x 152cm\nMax speed: 22km/h\nMax incline: 11%\nFolding: no\nBuilt-in entertainment: no\n\nFolding treadmills can lack the build quality and premium features of their non-collapsible counterparts, but the Pro 9000 is one of the few that aims to pack in the tech. A 3.6hp motor doesn’t want for power, offering a 22km/h top speed and a respectable 12% incline, while the deck features ReBound Pro Cushioning for a little flex underfoot to protect the joints.\n\nThere’s a compromise when it comes to running deck space, though, as it’s slightly narrower than larger, fixed treadmills. However, folding it up is a simple process and, when placed in its upright position, it can be rolled into a cupboard or stored against a wall to free up space.\n\nWhy we love it\nIt’s easy to scrimp on features when producing a folding treadmill, but ProForm packs a lot in here … not to mention an impressive running experience. The motor is plenty powerful enough, with a top speed that rivals anything here, while the Digital Quick Decline/Incline control is great for brutal hill sprint sessions. The deck is great at reaching the desired incline or decline at speed.\n\nProForm has long partnered with iFit, which provides a similar on-demand and live workout environment to Peloton and Technogym. This can be accessed via the wifi-enabled 21.5in HD colour touchscreen display. Users will have to pay a separate monthly subscription, though.\n\nProForm allows access to several streaming services with the touchscreen, as well as the ability to stream music through the twin 2in speakers mounted just below the screen. However, don’t expect mind-blowing performance from these, as it’s often best to stick a pair of headphones on instead.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s not lighter to make packing away a little easier – and the built-in cooling fan is borderline useless.\n\nDimensions: 90 x 196 x 151cm (WLH)\nWeight: 119kg\nRunning area: 51 x 152cm\nMax speed: 22km/h \nMax incline: 12%\nFolding: yes\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes\n\nBest for: running app aficionados\n\nThe T900D is one of the sports brand’s most robust units. It offers pro-grade running speeds and max inclines that can rival more expensive treadmills, and it folds for convenient storage.\n\nIt lacks the connected pizazz of some of the models I’ve tested, and the big, often difficult-to-operate buttons and basic display make it feel like a throwback to treadmills of yore. Yet it performs admirably, offering a generous deck for taller people, as well as simple connectivity with third-party apps, such as Strava and Kinomap.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the build quality isn’t as hardy, and it’s not the nicest piece of design.\n\nDimensions: 88 x 185 x 147cm (WLH); weight: 89kg; running area: 50 x 143cm; max speed: 18km/h; max incline: 10%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: withstanding everyday use\n\nLife Fitness is a common sight in UK gyms and this exact model is in place in one of the fitness facilities I use weekly. It has a basic LCD screen that provides all the running data most users demand, and sessions can be programmed, with control over incline and speeds.\n\nThe build quality is excellent – it’s able to withstand regular punishment – but that is reflected in the price, especially considering the rather basic nature of its built-in programmes and lack of connected features. This is just a good old-fashioned treadmill, which is less likely to cause reliability headaches than some cheaper rivals.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it looks great in a commercial gym, but it’s too basic and bulky for the home.\n\nDimensions: 88 x 202 x 147cm (WLH); weight: 111kg; running area: 51 x 153cm; max speed: 19km/h; max incline: 15%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: immersive training without the big screen\n\nThis is another folding option that follows the ProForm line of thinking – chiefly, a solid running experience without the additional cost of a large touchscreen display. Instead, users are encouraged to tether a smartphone or tablet and make the most of the iFit app, which requires a monthly subscription but opens up the chance to take part in live classes and on-demand workouts. Weighing 90kg, the EXP5i is, however, lighter than the ProForm Pro 9000, and I found it easier to wheel around. The build quality is also excellent.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the running deck is shorter and narrower than many competitors, while the 16km/h top speed will disappoint sprinters.\n\nDimensions: 87 x 180 x 152cm (WLH); weight: 90kg; running area: 51 x 140cm; max speed: 16km/h; max incline: 10%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: premium quality and all-encompassing workouts\n\nThis Italian manufacturer loves nothing more than taking standard gym kit and injecting it with some serious, athlete-inspired smarts. The latest Technogym Run features a slat belt deck, which is not only more cushioning on the knees and other joints but also offers the quietest indoor running experience I have ever tested.\n\nSitting at the premium end of the spectrum, many will balk at the Run’s asking price. But this machine goes beyond merely offering a platform to run on because of its ability to mimic a weighted sled with its Multidrive resistance technology. When set in this mode, users can strengthen muscles in the lower body or intersperse sled work with sprints for high-intensity interval training.\n\nIn addition, Technogym offers access to all its live and on-demand classes, scenic virtual runs and off-tread workouts, which include strength training, yoga and more. Pair it with the firm’s other intelligent fitness equipment and you’ll have one of the smartest setups around.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s priced way beyond what most mere mortals can afford.\n\nDimensions: 83 x 197 x 175cm (WLH); weight: 207kg; running area: 51 x 173cm; max speed: 25km/h; max incline: 15%; folding: no; built-in entertainment: yes, with the Technogym app store allowing access to YouTube, Disney+, Spotify and many more\n\nThere’s a treadmill to suit most budgets, but those with touchscreen displays and interactive features will cost more. The same goes for the most powerful motors, advanced running deck technology and greater connectivity features, as these all demand healthier budgets.\n\nThe most affordable treadmills generally start at about £500 – anything less than that isn’t typically worth your money. Prices then rise to £3,000 or more (see the Technogym Run) for the most technologically advanced and commercial-grade units.\n\nThe smallest treadmill on this list still measures 70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH) and you will want to factor in some wriggle room around that to ensure your arms aren’t bashing against a wall and your head isn’t hitting the ceiling. If storage space is a problem, take a look at the folding treadmills on this list. Typically, they fold flat and feature wheels so that they can be rolled into a more convenient space and stored upright to keep the floor clear.\n\nMore serious runners should look at more powerful motors because they often provide the fastest running speeds and a more natural running experience. Incline and decline features are great for mimicking runs out in the wild, and a well-cushioned deck is important for protecting the joints.\n\nMost manufacturers don’t cite figures for decibel levels emitted during operation, but it’s worth considering that some treadmills are quieter than others. Finally, connected features are fantastic for keeping track of training, ensuring runs are interesting and generally entertaining during an arduous workout. However, that doesn’t mean you necessarily need a massive display, as tethering a tablet or a smartphone can do just as good a job.\n\nIt’s always best to consult the user manual for details on how to lubricate a treadmill belt and how often to do so, as some brands produce systems that don’t need any maintenance and this could void a warranty.\n\nUse a 100% silicone lubricant that the manufacturer supplies, or buy a dedicated treadmill lubricant to avoid damaging the belt. Unplug the treadmill, lift the edges of the treadmill belt and apply lubricant in a zigzag fashion to the centre where your feet strike. Turn on the treadmill and walk slowly for about two minutes to allow the lubricant to work its way across the entirety of the running deck.\n\nWhile a treadmill can be used for walking, it’s typically more versatile than a walking pad in that it can support jogging sessions and faster training. Higher-end treadmills will also have more features than a walking pad, such as the ability to automatically adjust incline and decline, connect to on-demand workout programmes from the likes of Peloton and iFit, and offer built-in workouts. On the other hand, walking pads are usually smaller and easier to store, with some folding in half so they can be housed underneath a desk when not in use.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches\n\n The best cross trainers\n\nLeon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

Nothing, though, quite rivals the rout rippling through stock and credit markets this week.For one, there’s the sheer speed and breadth of it. In the span of two days, hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off the value of stocks, bonds and loans of companies big and small across Silicon Valley.

    "description": "OpenClaw is gaining ground in China as major tech firms add support and users flock to the viral AI agent.",
    "fullText": "The viral AI agent OpenClaw — formerly known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot — has found an audience in China.\n\nSince last week, Chinese tech companies including Tencent, Alibaba, and Volcano Engine, a cloud service platform under ByteDance, have begun integrating OpenClaw into their platforms, making it easier for Chinese users to run the agent. That includes connecting the agent to workplace tools such as Alibaba's collaboration platform, DingTalk, and Tencent Holdings' WeCom, the work version of China's super app, WeChat.\n\nOpenClaw began circulating widely in tech circles last month, attracting high-profile fans including Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan and multiple partners at Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe agent has also taken off among Chinese users, with demos, tutorials, and use cases spreading rapidly across local social platforms.\n\nOpenClaw is designed to run around the clock and plug into a wide range of consumer apps, allowing users to automate tasks such as managing schedules, overseeing vibe-coding sessions, or even building AI employees.\n\nIn a post on Tencent Cloud's developer platform, the company said last Thursday that its servers have rolled out a preconfigured OpenClaw application template, enabling users to deploy the AI assistant in the cloud with minimal setup.\n\nAlibaba Cloud has also rolled out support for OpenClaw on its platforms and said the agent can connect to a range of models from Alibaba's Qwen series.\n\nVolcano Engine, ByteDance's cloud services arm, outlined how developers can deploy Moltbot in its environment in an article published on Monday, while also flagging key safety considerations.\n\n\"Because the tool has extensive data, account, and network access permissions, please deploy it in a dedicated environment, avoid handling sensitive information, and be sure to review permissions regularly and set access restrictions for ECS and API keys,\" the article said, referring to cloud servers and access credentials.\n\nFor OpenClaw to run as a digital assistant across apps, it requires access to users' files, login details, browser activity, and other data.\n\nCybersecurity specialists told Business Insider in a report published on Wednesday that agents like OpenClaw can be vulnerable to \"prompt injections,\" a tactic that uses hidden instructions to trick AI into performing actions such as leaking data or publishing content on users' behalf.\n\nDespite mounting privacy and security concerns, enthusiasm for the agent among Chinese users shows little sign of slowing.\n\nPosts and demos featuring OpenClaw have surged on the Chinese social media platform RedNote.\n\nOne RedNote user who goes by \"Brother C\" posted a video tutorial last Tuesday, walking viewers through how to use OpenClaw. \"See how the 24/7 proactive AI assistant is revolutionizing workflows,\" he wrote. The post drew more than 4,000 likes and was saved over 6,000 times.\n\nAnother user posting under the nickname \"Teacher Du\" shared his own explainer on Monday, describing how OpenClaw could be deployed in everyday workflows. His post was saved more than 2,000 times and received over 1,000 likes.\n\n\"My experience was truly mind-blowing,\" he wrote, adding that the agent could handle \"all sorts of tasks\" and that the \"concept of a true AI employee is getting closer.\"\n\nLike their counterparts in the US, Chinese users are buying Mac Minis to run the agent. A RedNote user named Wu Bin said he had ordered a secondhand Mac Mini to serve as his \"super assistant.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly convenient, I can control it remotely to organize files and handle all sorts of tasks,\" he wrote.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. A user who goes by \"Programmer Yago\" warned in a RedNote post on Sunday that using the agent could leave users' data \"running naked all over the internet.\"\n\nOpenClaw did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",

    "description": "Tech stocks are trading lower as investors assess whether AI could upend current software leadership. Analysts say the market reaction is overblown.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America analysts say Wall Street is blowing the latest AI fears out of proportion as the tech sell-off drags on.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down about 2% on Wednesday, extending losses from Tuesday's session. Analysts say recent losses, fueled by AI disruption worries and some poorly received earnings, are overblown and don't justify the broad sell-off.\n\nThe sell-off kicked off in the software sector after AI start-up Anthropic introduced a new plugin for its Claude Cowork AI agent. The new tool is said to be more automatic in completing clerical tasks than conversational chatbots, fueling worries that AI will replace software and dethrone existing market leaders.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts say these fears are overstated, calling the new AI tool the latest \"boogeyman in software.\"\n\nThe analysts say that while there will be some AI disruption in store for software makers, it will be how companies adapt to the AI era that sets apart the winners and losers.\n\n\"There will naturally be some disruption, especially for point solutions, nice to have tools (as opposed to mission-critical systems), and vendors that are not able or willing to adapt to the new tech paradigm,\" they wrote, noting, \"This does not justify the broad-based indiscriminate selling we are seeing across the sector.\"\n\nBank of America compared the recent tech sector nosedive to the January 2025 sell-off fueled by Chinese AI DeepSeek, which spurred major short-term losses for Wall Street and erased $1 trillion in market capitalization in one day.\n\n\"In several respects, the current indiscriminate selloff resembles the DeepSeek-driven decline of Jan'25, which ultimately proved unfounded and was followed by higher capex and accelerating AI token growth.\"\n\nDespite investors' panic that DeepSeek marked a turning point in the AI arms race, major indexes not only recovered but ended 2025 up by double digits, fueled in large part by AI momentum. The analysts also noted that global cloud capital spending grew 69% in 2025 from the year-ago period, above previous forecasts in spite of worries.\n\nSoftware's dramatic downturn reflects negative investor sentiment around the sector, not a change in fundamentals.\n\nIn fact, Bank of America underlined the incongruence of Wall Street's thinking, which is driving \"inconsistency in AI stock moves.\"\n\n\"Price action implies AI capex is deteriorating to the point of weak ROI and unsustainable growth, while simultaneously suggesting AI adoption will be so pervasive and productivity-enhancing that long-standing software workflows and business models become obsolete. Both outcomes cannot occur at once.\"\n\nWilliam Blair analysts echoed a view calling software weakness a \"sentiment problem.\" They highlighted the post-earnings price declines in Microsoft and ServiceNow stocks, despite the companies' fundamentally strong prints. AMD saw a similar drop after its stock fell over 17% on Wednesday, despite earnings beating on the top and bottom lines.",

The software sector led a tech-sell-off with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF down nearly 4%, adding to its year-to-date 22% loss.\n\nBut Wall Street's fears about further disruption from AI were brushed aside by one of the icons of the AI space on Tuesday. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang weighed in on the latest jitters at a Cisco AI event.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI. You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.\"\n\nHuang outlined his view that software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace, explaining that AI will use the tools software offers rather than reinventing its own.\n\nThe CEO named Service Now, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, specifically as bright spots in the space.\n\nRecent weakness in the software sector comes amid a broader market rotation away from tech. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has seen a nearly 20% decline in the past year, and the sector fell into a bear market last week.\n\nHere are some of the stocks dragging the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF lower during Wednesday's session:",

    "description": "CBS News contributor Peter Attia apologized for his past emails with Epstein. Eight Sleep no longer lists him on its website as an advisor.",
    "fullText": "Peter Attia, the prominent longevity doctor and CBS contributor who is under scrutiny for his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has vanished from a list of advisors for a sleep technology company.\n\nAttia had been prominently showcased as one of three members of Eight Sleep's scientific advisory board, a post he had held since May 14, 2024. His photo no longer appears as part of the panel on the company homepage.\n\nCompany officials and Attia did not respond to requests for comment. It's not clear exactly when his name and photo were removed, but the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine shows they were there as recently as January 22.\n\nThe disappearance comes days after the Justice Department's latest release of documents from the investigation into Epstein, the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nEarlier this week, Attia addressed the appearance of his name in the files, saying that he was not involved in criminal activity and was never on Epstein's plane or private island or at any sex parties.\n\n\"I apologize and regret putting myself in a position where emails, some of them embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible, are now public, and that is on me. I accept that reality and the humiliation that comes with it,\" he added.\n\nThe documents include many email exchanges between Attia and Epstein, including one where he said that female genitalia is \"indeed, low carb.\"\n\nAttia subsequently stepped down as chief science officer of David Protein, a popular protein snack bar company he invested in and helped promote.\n\nDays before his correspondence with Epstein became public, Attia was named by CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss as one of 19 new contributors. CBS has not publicly addressed his ties to Epstein.\n\nAttia is the founder of the longevity app Outlive, the author of the bestselling book \"Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,\" and host of the podcast \"The Peter Attia Drive.\" He appeared on a segment of CBS's \"60 Minutes\" in October.\n\nHis emails with Epstein date to the mid to late 2010s — after Epstein's guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from a minor but before he was arrested on federal charges of running a sex-trafficking operation with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nIn his statement, Attia said he met Epstein in 2014 and over the next five years, visited his Manhattan home seven or eight times to \"research studies and to meet others he introduced me to.\"\n\n\"When I was at his home, it was either meeting with him directly, meeting with small groups of scientists, doctors, or business leaders, and once at a dinner in 2015 with a number of guests including prominent heads of state,\" he wrote. \"In retrospect, the presence and credibility of such venerable people in different orbits led me to make assumptions about him that clouded my judgment in ways it shouldn't have.\"\n\nHe said that he asked Epstein about his 2008 conviction and \"he characterized it as prostitution-related charges.\"\n\n\"In 2018, I came to learn this was grossly minimized,\" Attia added. \"I was incredibly naïve to believe him. I mistook his social acceptance in the eyes of the credible people I saw him with for acceptability, and that was a serious error in my judgment. To be clear, I never witnessed illegal behavior and never saw anyone who appeared underage in his presence.\"\n\nEight Sleep, founded in 2014 and the maker of \"sleep fitness\" products, was valued at $500 million in 2021. It recently raised a $100 million round in August.",
