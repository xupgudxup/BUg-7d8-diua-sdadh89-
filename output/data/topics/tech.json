    "description": "Chinese app Rednote started off as a shopping app. Now, it's one of the hottest hubs for Chinese tech workers in Silicon Valley to talk shop about AI.",
    "fullText": "When the Chinese app Rednote launched in 2013, it was mainly used for shopping and cosmetics reviews. Now, it's one of the hottest hubs for Chinese tech workers in Silicon Valley to talk shop about AI.\n\nRednote is also known as Xiaohongshu, which translates to \"Little Red Book.\" For Chinese tech workers in the Bay Area working at companies like OpenAI and Meta, Rednote has become a sort of home away from home for shopping and food recommendations. And since the launch of ChatGPT, AI-related content on Rednote has exploded.\n\nTechnology-related content on the app has more than doubled in the past year, and the number of tech-related creators has more than tripled, according to Rednote. Many users post video reviews or tutorials of AI models, just like people review their favorite beauty products.\n\n\"Every time a new model is out, people on Xiaohongshu will share their reviews,\" said Tony Peng, founder of the Recode China AI newsletter. \"If I want real user-generated feedback, I go to Xiaohongshu.\"\n\nMany American Gen Z users downloaded Rednote in January amid fears of a TikTok ban. More than half of the app's users were born after 1995, Rednote said.\n\nTech founders told Business Insider that they have used Rednote to promote their startups, demo products, and hire people. Some of the most popular posts on Rednote focus on Big Tech companies or AI giants such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google DeepMind. Users may share their anxieties about the tech job market, ask for help, or discuss the compensation packages they've received.\n\nBrandon Chen, cofounder and CEO of the AI-powered chat app Intent, needed to apply for a visa last year to work in the US.\n\nTo do this, he had to prepare hundreds of PDFs for his lawyer, and he decided to write an AI program to help organize them. He posted before-and-after screenshots of his project on Rednote. Soon, people messaged him asking if he would release it as an app so they could use it.\n\n\"I thought it was amazing. I just randomly developed something for myself,\" Chen told Business Insider.\n\nHe ended up releasing it as a product called Riffo.\n\nChen said he used Rednote to promote his product and even to recruit workers in Japan. He posted on Rednote asking if any Japanese speakers could help with his social media expansion efforts, and within 15 minutes, someone reached out, Chen said.\n\nQian Chen, a journalist and media entrepreneur who cofounded the tech media company Valley101, said she distributes her videos on channels including YouTube, WeChat, and Rednote. The videos she has produced on topics like Meta's recent AI layoffs, and the battle between ChatGPT and Google, have performed especially well on Rednote, she said.\n\nRednote helps startup founders foster communities, users say.\n\nBill Zhu, founder and CEO of Pokee AI, which uses AI to build workflows, said he found a tight-knit community on Rednote to share his learnings, attract users for his products, connect with others, and ask for feedback. Rednote users are often drawn to posts about personal experiences, Zhu said. In Rednote posts, he has chronicled his fundraising efforts, including successes and setbacks.\n\n\"You can actually connect with the founder,\" Zhu said. \"It's someone you're actually talking to. You can reach out to this person building this awesome piece of tech that is able to solve these problems.\"\n\nDuring the back-to-school season in September, Rednote launched an \"AI Guide\" campaign, inviting 20 professors to join a discussion on the app.\n\nRednote has gained more international users thanks to its AI translation feature, which enables users to translate posts from Chinese to English or other languages with a single click. And while most of the content that appears on Rednote is in Chinese, the app is increasingly featuring English content, including an AMA, or Ask Me Anything, event with Thomas Wolf, cofounder and chief science officer of Hugging Face.\n\nAn atmosphere of \"sincere sharing\" has fueled a trend of AI-themed AMAs on Rednote, said San Bing, Rednote's senior director of tech community.\n\nThe AMAs are popular because Rednote users are eager to learn about cutting-edge technology, said Peng, the founder of Recode China AI.\n\n\"For AMAs, you can get firsthand answers to tell you, what is the next frontier?\" Peng said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Tech stocks have driven a disproportionate share of the market's gains in recent years. Now, it might be time for them to share the limelight.",
    "fullText": "Tech stocks have driven a disproportionate share of the market's gains in recent years. Now, it's time for them to share the limelight, says Joe Quinlan, the chief market strategist at Bank of America.\n\n\"There's plenty of places to put money to work better other than, say, Mag 7,\" he said, referencing the largest stocks in the S&P 500 by market capitalization.\n\nSpecifically, cyclical stocks should start to look attractive next year, Quinlan said, calling the theme his highest-conviction investing idea right now, and recommending a barbell approach between tech and cyclical shares.\n\nCyclical stocks are those that rebound when the economy is recovering from a downturn or is expanding. Quinlan highlighted sectors like industrials, materials, and financials as places to look for opportunities.\n\nCyclicals may seem like a curious recommendation at the moment. The labor market appears to be softening, with rising layoffs and weaker job growth fueling concerns about a consumer-led slowdown. But Quinlan said that the job market is just learning to adjust to the new environment, not entering a downward spiral.\n\n\"The labor market is weakening in some parts, but it's strengthening in others, so it's really a mixed bag,\" he said. \"But the key is, companies are learning to live with the technology that comes with artificial intelligence, they're learning immigration constraints. It's just going to make us more productive, say, 18-24 months out.\"\n\nQuinlan pointed out several drivers that should propel economic growth in 2026 and boost cyclical stocks.\n\n\"It's continued consumer spending, particularly among higher income households; capital investment not just in data centers but also refurbishing, building out more factory capacity; a weaker dollar helps our exports; global growth is picking up, so that's good for multinational earnings,\" he said.\n\n\"And then you've got the fiscal and monetary stimulus: fiscally you're going to see a lot more money dropped in bottom lines because of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" Quinlan continued, adding that he sees two Federal Reserve interest rate cuts coming in 2026, starting mid-year, in addition to the cut that is widely expected in December. Rate cuts stimulate economic activity by encouraging borrowing and spending.\n\nStrategists at JPMorgan and HSBC have also said cyclical stocks are one of their preferred areas of the market to invest in next year amid robust projections for economic growth.\n\nYear-to-date, the industrials, materials, and financials sectors have returned 17.4%, 4.5%, and 10.8%, respectively. The S&P 500, by comparison, has risen 16.4% in 2025.\n\nSo far in 2025, cyclicals have outperformed defensive stocks, which get a boost from economic uncertainty, around the world. That recent rally has US cyclical stocks trading at a valuation premium relative to defensive stocks, as the below chart from Goldman Sachs shows.\n\nExamples of funds that offer exposure to cyclical stocks, particularly in Quinlan's preferred sectors, include the iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ), the State Street Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB), and the Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH).",

    "fullText": "Worried about how AI is affecting your job? You're not alone.\n\nEveryone from the board to management to employees has concerns about the new technology, said Joe Atkinson, PwC's global head of AI, in an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box Asia on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a complex time in the world of AI implementation,\" said Atkinson. The pace of AI change is \"overwhelming to everybody\" and there's a \"mismatch\" between how quickly organizational change can keep up with it, he said.\n\nGlobal companies routinely look to PwC, one of the industry's leading consulting and accounting firms, for answers to their most consequential business questions. With AI rapidly transforming how businesses operate, guidance on reorganizing for an AI-first future is becoming one of the most sought-after offerings.\n\nAtkinson said that the next phase of implementing AI inside companies is scaling the technology's capabilities, and companies that move quickly will see the most reward.\n\n\"We've talked for the last year about proofs of concept and experimentation, and frankly, those days are over. We now have to scale the impact of AI in organizations,\" Atkinson said.\n\n\"The good news for employees is if we scale the impact of AI for organizations, I truly believe we create and unlock growth,\" he added.\n\nAccording to PwC's data, organizations that adopt AI more quickly have seen three times the revenue per employee compared to those that proceed more slowly.\n\n\"That opportunity means that it's not only a big upside for organisations. It is a big upside for employees who lean in and use these tools to help create greater productivity, outputs, and creativity,\" Atkinson said.\n\nPwC and other leading consulting firms have embraced AI, pitching themselves as client zero for the solutions they offer to clients and implementing AI solutions across all operations.\n\nNew hires at PwC will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years because of AI, Jenn Kosar, PwC's AI assurance leader, told Business Insider in August.\n\nThe technology is also affecting the firm's hiring plans. In August, Business Insider obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years, in part due to \"the impact of AI.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "TheStreet aims to feature only the best products and services. If you buy something via one of our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nWhile Black Friday and Cyber Monday have been over for weeks now, there are still many amazing deals for anyone looking to invest in flashy new tech. Whether you're buying for yourself or someone on your holiday gift list, Walmart is currently selling a surprisingly awesome Android tablet for the unbeatable price of just $86.\n\nThe Aeezo 10.1-Inch Android 15 Tablet typically retails for $160, but it's 47% off right now — a deal that feels like the kind reserved just for shopping holidays. If you want the convenience of a big screen without having to shell out hundreds for one of the overpriced name brands, you're going to want to jump on this sale while you still can. Plus, it comes with all the accessories you could need, including a wireless keyboard, mouse, and stylus.\n\nFor a tablet of this price, the specs are fairly impressive. At the heart of this device is an octa-core CPU, which not only optimizes performance but also keeps your tablet from overheating, even when you're really clocking out its specs. With 24 gigabytes (GB) of RAM, you'll be able to multitask with ease and jump from app to app in seconds. There's also 128 GB of space available to play with, so there's plenty of room for a whole host of apps, as well as photos and even important documents you may want to keep on hand.\n\nWith Android 15 pre-installed, you'll be able to surf, stream, and even game. This 10-inch tablet could easily serve as a portable fun machine and ride the line between portable arcade and home theater. It also comes with a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, so you can even use it to get serious work done. All in a device that's less than $100. It's honestly a little shocking.\n\n\"This is exactly what I was looking for to tote around and not have to drag around my heavier laptop,\" one shopper said. \"It’s the perfect size, performs wonderfully, and is a reasonable price.\"\n\nSpecifications: Octa-Core CPU, 24 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of space.\n\nScreen: 10.1-inch HD screen with a max resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels.\n\nBattery: 5,000 milliampere-hour battery that runs up to 6 hours on a full charge.\n\nIts screen is large enough to be considered immersive without being too cumbersome. The extra inches compared to your phone will make games like Balatro and Stardew Valley come alive.\n\nLike any great tablet, this one features two different cameras: a front-facing 5-megapixel camera and a rear 8-megapixel camera. There's also a miniSD card slot that accommodates sizes of up to one terabyte (TB) if you need a little extra storage space.\n\nMeize 11-Inch Android Tablet, $118 (was $190) at Walmart\n\nBestski 10.1-Inch Android 14 Tablet, $70 (was $200) at Walmart\n\nVeat00l 10.1-Inch Android 13 Tablet, $90 (was $250) at Walmart\n\nThe Aeezo 10-Inch Android 15 Tablet is available at Walmart for the unbelievably low price of just $86.

    "fullText": "Gen Z are the first generation to have grown up with social media, they were the earliest adopters, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. Now they are fighting back\n\nLate one night in April 2020, towards the start of the Covid lockdowns, Shanley Clémot McLaren was scrolling on her phone when she noticed a Snapchat post by her 16-year-old sister. “She’s basically filming herself from her bed, and she’s like: ‘Guys you shouldn’t be doing this. These fisha accounts are really not OK. Girls, please protect yourselves.’ And I’m like: ‘What is fisha?’ I was 21, but I felt old,” she says.\n\nShe went into her sister’s bedroom, where her sibling showed her a Snapchat account named “fisha” plus the code of their Paris suburb. Fisha is French slang for publicly shaming someone – from the verb “afficher”, meaning to display or make public. The account contained intimate images of girls from her sister’s school and dozens of others, “along with the personal data of the victims – their names, phone numbers, addresses, everything to find them, everything to put them in danger”.\n\nMcLaren, her sister and their friends reported the account to Snapchat dozens of times, but received no response. Then they discovered there were fisha accounts for different suburbs, towns and cities across France and beyond. Faced with the impunity of the social media platforms, and their lack of moderation, they launched the hashtag #StopFisha.\n\nIt went viral, online and in the media. #StopFisha became a rallying cry, a safe space to share information and advice, a protest movement. Now it was the social media companies being shamed. “The wave became a counter-wave,” says McLaren, who is now 26. The French government got involved, and launched an online campaign on the dangers and legal consequences of fisha accounts. The social media companies began to moderate at last, and #StopFisha is now a “trusted flagger” with Snapchat and TikTok, so when they report fisha content, it is taken down within hours. “I realised that if you want change in your societies, if you come with your idea alone, it won’t work. You need support behind you.”\n\nFour years later, this strategy is playing out on an even larger scale. McLaren and other young activists across Europe are banding together against social media and its ruinous effects on their generation. Individually, young people are powerless to sway big tech, but they are also a substantial part of its business model – so, collectively, they are powerful.\n\nThis is the first generation to have grown up with social media: they were the earliest adopters of it, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. The array of problems is ever-expanding: misogynistic, hateful and disturbing content; addictive and skewed algorithms; invasion of privacy; online forums encouraging harmful behaviours; sextortion; screen addiction; deepfake pornography; misinformation and disinformation; radicalisation; surveillance; biased AI – the list goes on. As the use of social media has risen, there has been a corresponding increase in youth mental health problems, anxiety, depression, self-harm and even suicide.\n\n“Across Europe, a generation is suffering through a silent crisis,” says a new report from People vs Big Tech – a coalition of more than 140 digital rights NGOs from around Europe – and Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, their youth-led spin-off. A big factor is “the design and dominance of social media platforms”.\n\nCtrl+Alt+Reclaim, for people aged 15 to 29, came about in September last year when People vs Big Tech put out a call – on social media, paradoxically. About 20 young people who were already active on these issues came together at a “boot camp” in London. “We were really given the tools to create the movement that we wanted to build,” says McLaren, who attended with her partner. “They booked a big room, they brought the food, pencils, paper, everything we needed. And they were like: ‘This is your space, and we’re here to help.’”\n\nThe group is Europe’s first digital justice movement by and for young people. Their demands are very simple, or at least they ought to be: inclusion of young people in decision-making; a safer, healthier, more equitable social media environment; control and transparency over personal data and how it is used; and an end to the stranglehold a handful of US-based corporations have over social media and online spaces. The overarching principle is: “Nothing for us, without us.”\n\n“This is not just us being angry; it’s us having the right to speak,” says McLaren, who is now a youth mobilisation lead for Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim. Debates over digital rights are already going on, of course, but, she says: “We find it really unfair that we’re not at the table. Young people have so much to say, and they’re real experts, because they have lived experience … So why aren’t they given the proper space?”\n\nMcLaren’s work with #StopFisha took her on a journey into a wider, murkier world of gender-based digital rights: misogynist trolling and sexism, cyberstalking, deepfake pornography – but she realised this was just one facet of the problem. What women were experiencing online, other groups were experiencing in their own ways.\n\nA fellow activist, Yassine, 23, is well aware of this. Originally from north Africa and now living in Germany, Yassine identifies as non-binary. They fled to Europe to escape intolerance in their own country, but the reality of life, even in a supposedly liberal country such as Germany, hit them like a “slap”, they say. “You’re here for your safety, but then you’re trying to fight not only the system that is punishing the queerness of you, but you also have another layer of being a migrant. So you have two battles instead of one.”\n\nAs a migrant they are seen as a threat, Yassine says. “Our bodies and movements must be tracked, fingerprinted and surveilled through intrusive digital systems designed to protect the EU.” For queer people, there are similar challenges. These include “shadow-banning”, for example, by which tech platforms “silence conversations about queer rights, racism or anything that is challenging the dominant system”, either wilfully or algorithmically, through built-in biases.\n\nMeasures such as identity verification “are also putting a lot of people at risk of being erased from these spaces”, says Yassine. There can be good reasons for them, but they can also end up discriminating against non-binary or transgender people – who are often presented with binary gender options; male or female – as well as against refugees and undocumented people, who may be afraid or unable to submit their details online. Given their often tenuous residency status, and sometimes limited digital literacy and access, migrants tend not to speak out, Yassine says. “It definitely feels like you are in a position of: ‘You need to be grateful that you are here, and you should not question the laws.’ But the laws are harming my data.”\n\nOn a more day-to-day level, Yassine says, they must “walk through online spaces knowing they could do harm to me”. If they click on the comments under a social media post, for example, they know they are likely to find racist, homophobic or hateful attacks. Like McLaren, Yassine says that complaining is futile. “I know that they will come back with, ‘This is not a community guidelines breach’, and all of that.”\n\nThese are not mere glitches in the system, says Yassine, who now leads on digital rights at IGLYO, a long-running LGBTQ+ youth rights organisation, founded in Brussels, with a network of groups across Europe. “The systems we design inherit the very structures they arise from, so they inevitably become systems that are patriarchal and racist by design.”\n\nAdele Zeynep Walton’s participation in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim came through personal experience of online harm. In 2022, Walton’s 21-year-old sister, Aimee, took her own life. She had been struggling with her mental health, but had also been spending time on online suicide and self-harm forums, which Walton believes contributed to her death. After that, Walton began to question the digital realm she had grown up in, and her own screen addiction.\n\nWalton’s parents made her first Facebook account when she was 10, she says. She has been on Instagram since she was 12. Her own feelings of body dysmorphia began when she was 13, sparked by pro-anorexia content her friends were sharing. “I became a consumer of that, then I got immersed in this world,” she says. “Generations like mine thought it was totally normal, having this everyday battle with this addictive thing, having this constant need for external validation. I thought those were things that were just wrong with me.”\n\nIn researching her book Logging Off: The Human Cost of our Digital World, Walton, 26, also became aware of how little control young people have over the content that is algorithmically served up to them. “We don’t really have any choice over what our feeds look like. Despite the fact there are things where you can say, ‘I don’t want to see this type of content’, within a week, you’re still seeing it again.”\n\nAlycia Colijn, 29, another member of Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, knows something about this. She studied data science and marketing analytics at university in Rotterdam, researching AI-driven algorithms – how they can be used to manipulate behaviour, and in whose interests. During her studies she began to think: “It’s weird that I’m trained to gather as much data as I can, and to build a model that can respond to or predict what people want to buy, but I’ve never had a conversation around ethics.” Now she is researching these issues as co-founder of Encode Europe, which advocates for human-centric AI. “I realised how much power these algorithms have over us; over our society, but also over our democracies,” she says. “Can we still speak of free will if the best psychologists in the world are building algorithms that make us addicted?”\n\nThe more she learned, the more concerned Colijn became. “We made social media into a social experiment,” she says. “It turned out to be the place where you could best gather personal data from individuals. Data turned into the new gold, and then tech bros became some of the most powerful people in the world, even though they aren’t necessarily known for caring about society.”\n\nSocial media companies have had ample opportunities to respond to these myriad harms, but invariably they have chosen not to. Just as McLaren found with Snapchat and the fisha accounts, hateful and racist content is still minimally moderated on platforms such as X, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. After Donald Trump’s re-election, Mark Zuckerberg stated at the start of this year that Meta would be reducing factcheckers across Facebook and Instagram, just as X has under Elon Musk. This has facilitated the free flow of misinformation. Meta, Amazon and Google were also among the companies announcing they were rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, post-Trump’s election. The shift towards the right politically, in the US and Europe, has inevitably affected these platforms’ tolerance of hateful and racist content, says Yassine. “People feel like now they have more rights to be harmful than rights to be protected.”\n\nAll the while, the tech CEOs have become more powerful, economically, politically and in terms of information control. “We don’t believe that power should be in those hands,” says Colijn. “That’s not a true democracy.”\n\nEurope’s politicians aren’t doing much better. Having drafted the Digital Services Act in 2023, which threatened social media companies with fines or bans if they failed to regulate harmful content, the European Commission announced last month it would be rolling back some of its data privacy laws, to allow big tech companies to use people’s personal data for training AI systems.\n\n“Big tech, combined with the AI innovators, say they are the growth of tomorrow’s economy, and that we have to trust them. I don’t think that’s true,” says Colijn. She also disagrees with their argument that regulation harms innovation. “The only thing deregulation fosters is harmful innovation. If we want responsible innovation, we need regulation in place.”\n\nWalton agrees. “Governments and MPs are shooting themselves in the foot by pandering to tech giants, because that just tells young people that they don’t care about our future,” she says. “There’s this massive knowledge gap between the people who are making the decisions, and the tech justice movement and everyday people who are experiencing the harms.”\n\nCtrl+Alt+Reclaim is not calling for the wholesale destruction of social media. All these activists say they have found community, solidarity and joy in online spaces: “We’re fighting for these spaces to accommodate us,” says Yassine. “We’re not protesting to cancel them. We know how harmful they are, but they are still spaces where we have hope.”\n\nColijn echoes this. “Social media used to be a fun place with the promise of connecting the world,” she says. “That’s where we started.” And that’s what they want it to be again.\n\nWill big tech pay attention? They might not have a choice, as countries and legislators begin to take action. This week Australia will become the first country to ban social media accounts for under-16s on major platforms including Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok and X. Last week, after a two-year deliberation, X was fined €120m (£105m) by the EU for breaching data laws. But these companies continue to platform content that is hateful, racist, harmful, misleading or inflammatory, with impunity.\n\nMeanwhile, Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim is just getting started. Other discussions on the table include campaigning for an EU-funded social media platform, an alternative to the big tech oligopoly, created by and for the public. Another alternative is direct action, either protest or consumer activism such as coordinated boycotts. “I think it’s lazy for us to be like: we don’t have any power,” says Walton. “Because we could literally say that about anything: fast fashion, fossil fuels … OK, but how do we change things?”\n\nThe other alternative is simply to log off. “The other side of the coin to this movement of tech justice, and a sort of liberation from the harms that we’ve experienced over the past 20 years, is reducing our screen time,” says Walton. “It is spending more time in community. It is connecting with people who maybe you would have never spoken to on social media, because you’d be in different echo chambers.”\n\nAlmost all the activists in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim attest to having had some form of screen addiction. As much as social media has brought them together, it has also led to much less face-to-face socialising. “I’ve had to sort of rewire my brain to get used to the awkwardness and get comfortable with being in a social setting and not knowing anyone,” says Walton. “Actually, it would be really nice to return to proper connection.”\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Campaign urges PM to show independence from US and push to rein in development of superintelligence\n\nMore than 100 UK parliamentarians are calling on the government to introduce binding regulations on the most powerful AI systems as concern grows that ministers are moving too slowly to create safeguards in the face of lobbying from the technology industry.\n\nA former AI minister and defence secretary are part of a cross-party group of Westminster MPs, peers and elected members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures demanding stricter controls on frontier systems, citing fears superintelligent AI “would compromise national and global security”.\n\nThe push for tougher regulation is being coordinated by a nonprofit organisation called Control AI whose backers include the co-founder of Skype, Jaan Tallinn. It is calling on Keir Starmer to show independence from Donald Trump’s White House, which opposes the regulation of AI. One of the “godfathers” of the technology, Yoshua Bengio, recently said it was less regulated than a sandwich.\n\nThe campaigners include the Labour peer and former defence secretary Des Browne, who said superintelligent AI “would be the most perilous technological development since we gained the ability to wage nuclear war”. He said only international cooperation “can prevent a reckless race for advantage that could imperil us all”.\n\nThe Conservative peer and former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said that “even while very significant and senior figures in AI are blowing the whistle, governments are miles behind the AI companies and are leaving them to pursue its development with virtually no regulation”.\n\nBritain hosted an AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023, which concluded there was “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional” from the most advanced AI systems. It set up the AI Safety Institute, now called the AI Security Institute, which has become an internationally respected body. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on the summit’s call to address risks through international cooperation.\n\nGoldsmith said the UK should “resume its global leadership on AI security by championing an international agreement to prohibit the development of superintelligence until we know what we are dealing with and how to contain it”.\n\nThe calls for state intervention in the AI race come after one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI scientists told the Guardian humanity would have to decide by 2030 whether to take the “ultimate risk” of letting AI systems train themselves to become more powerful. Jared Kaplan, the co-founder and chief scientist at frontier AI company Anthropic, said: “We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like: Oh, wow, AI is a big deal.”\n\nLabour’s programme set out in July 2024 said it would legislate “to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models”. But no bill has been published and the government has faced White House pressure not to inhibit commercial AI development, mostly pioneered by US firms.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI is already regulated in the UK, with a range of existing rules already in place. We have been clear on the need to ensure the UK and its laws are ready for the challenges and opportunities AI will bring and that position has not changed.”\n\nThe bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who is backing the Control AI campaign, called for an independent AI watchdog to scrutinise public sector use and for AI companies to be required to meet minimum testing standards before releasing new models.\n\n“There are all kinds of risks and the government doesn’t seem to have adopted a precautionary principle,” he said. “At the moment there are significant risks: the mental health of children and adults, the environmental costs and other big risks in terms of the alignment of generalised AI and [the question of] what is good for humanity. The government seems to be moving away from regulation.”\n\nThe UK’s first AI minister under Rishi Sunak, Jonathan Berry, said the time was coming when binding regulations should be applied to models that present existential risks. He said rules should be global and would create tripwires so if AI models reached a certain power their makers would have to show they had been tested, designed with off switches and were capable of being retrained.\n\n“International frontier AI safety has not gone on in leaps and bounds as we had hoped,” he said. He cited recent cases of chatbots being involved in encouraging suicides, people using them as therapists and believing they are gods. “The risks, now, are very serious and we need to be constantly on our guard,” he said.\n\nThe chief executive of Control AI, Andrea Miotti, criticised the current “timid approach” and said: “There has been a lot of lobbying from the UK and US. AI companies are lobbying governments in the UK and US to stall regulation arguing it is premature and would crush innovation. Some of these are the same companies who say AIs could destroy humanity.”\n\nHe said the speed with which AI technology was advancing meant mandatory standards could be needed in the next one or two years.",
