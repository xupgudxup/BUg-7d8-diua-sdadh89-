    "description": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin studied graduate computer science at Stanford—but admits Gen Z no longer needs a degree to land a high-paying job at the tech giant.",
    "fullText": "Whether it’s Nike’s Phil Knight, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, or Google’s Sergey Brin, many of the world’s most influential business founders can trace part of their success back to Stanford University. Nestled in the foothills of Silicon Valley, the school has long functioned as a launchpad for tech’s elite.\n\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. As tech reshapes entry-level work and companies rethink traditional hiring pipelines, the payoff of a four-year degree—especially from elite institutions—is increasingly up for debate.\n\nStill, Brin doesn’t regret his own academic path. Speaking to Stanford engineering students last month, he said his decision to study computer science was not driven by a fixation on credentials.\n\n“I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he said. “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”\n\nEven in an era when AI can write code, Brin cautioned students against chasing—or abandoning—fields of study based solely on automation fears.\n\n“I wouldn’t go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,” he said. “The AI is probably even better at comparative literature, just to be perfectly honest anyway.”\n\nBrin met Google cofounder Larry Page in 1994 during his second year of graduate studies at Stanford. Together they developed PageRank, an algorithm they later renamed Google and would become a company in 1998.\n\nGoogle’s hiring practices today reflect how dramatically the industry has shifted. The tech giant is now embracing workers without college degrees.\n\n“In as much as we’ve hired a lot of academic stars, we’ve hired tons of people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees,” Brin said. “They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.”\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, the share of job postings at Google requiring a degree dropped from 93% to 77%, according to analysis from the Burning Glass Institute. And Google isn’t alone: companies including Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco have reduced degree requirements in recent years, signaling a broader industry shift toward skills-based hiring.\n\nThat’s forcing a broader reckoning over what a degree actually signals and whether it’s still a reliable proxy for talent.\n\n“I don’t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you’re going to be a great worker or great person,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in 2024. For many roles, skills matter far more than credentials, he added: “If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn’t show up in their resume.”",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - Apple will use Google's Gemini models for its revamped Siri coming later this year under a multi-year deal that deepens the tech giants' alliance in the ​artificial intelligence era and bolsters Alphabet's position in the race against OpenAI.\n\nThe deal announced Monday marks a major ‌vote of confidence for Google. Its technology already drives much of Samsung's \"Galaxy AI,\" but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apple's installed base ‌of more than two billion active devices.\n\n\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" Google said, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAlphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed.\n\nThe iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its ⁠devices, allowing the company's Siri voice assistant ‌to tap into the chatbot's expertise to answer complicated questions.\n\nApple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters' request for ‍comment.\n\n\"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players ​in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure.\n\nMonday's tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAI's ‌partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

    "description": "Apple goes with Google's tech despite using OpenAI's ChatGPT elsewhere in iOS.",
    "fullText": "The “more intelligent” version of Siri that Apple plans to release later this year will be backed by Google’s Gemini language models, the company announced today. CNBC reports that the deal is part of a “multi-year partnership” between Apple and Google that will allow Apple to use Google’s AI models in its own software.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” reads an Apple statement given to CNBC.\n\nToday’s announcement confirms Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting late last year that Apple and Google were nearing a deal. Apple didn’t disclose terms, but Gurman said that Apple would be paying Google “about $1 billion a year” for access to its AI models “following an extensive evaluation period.”\n\nBloomberg has also reported that the Gemini model would be run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, “ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s infrastructure,” and that Apple still hopes to improve its own in-house language models to the point that they can eventually be used instead of relying on third-party models.\n\nAlthough Apple’s iPhones and iOS compete with Google’s Android operating system and the many smartphones that use it, the companies still cooperate in plenty of other areas. Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (though that deal has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years).\n\nApple’s announcement is a blow to OpenAI and the many versions of its ChatGPT model, which Apple has used elsewhere in iOS and macOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple also tested OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude models before deciding to go with Gemini. ChatGPT came out ahead of Gemini in tests that Ars ran using earlier versions of the models, but Google’s models have apparently improved enough (and amassed enough users) to worry OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” last month and pushed back several planned ChatGPT features so that the company could better respond to Google’s Gemini 3 release.\n\nApple originally promised the improved, AI-powered Siri for 2024’s iOS 18 release, but ultimately delayed the feature because it didn’t work reliably enough. The new version of Siri should arrive in an update to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe later this year.",

    "description": "Michael Burry, the investor from \"The Big Short,\" said return on invested capital is the \"measure to beat all measures\" when looking at AI companies.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short,\" says the era of Big Tech turning relatively small investments into huge profits is ending.\n\nIn a recent Substack exchange with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Burry said the most important metric AI industry investors should be watching isn't revenue growth, hiring, or even market size, but return on invested capital, or ROIC.\n\nROIC is a measure of how efficiently a company turns the money it puts into its business into profit.\n\n\"The measure to beat all measures is return on invested capital (ROIC), and ROIC was very high at these software companies. Now that they are becoming capital-intensive hardware companies, ROIC is sure to fall, and this will pressure shares in the long run,\" Burry wrote.\n\nAI, Burry said, is pushing companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta away from their historically asset-light software models and toward a far more capital-intensive future defined by data centers, chips, and energy.\n\nEven if AI expands Big Tech's addressable market, he said, falling ROIC could pressure stock prices for years to come.\n\nBurry rose to fame after his bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled in \"The Big Short.\" Outside the occasional cryptic social media post, Burry, for a long time, spoke publicly only rarely.\n\nThat changed late last year when he closed his hedge fund to outside cash and began writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nPerhaps most notably, he has recently compared the AI boom to the late-1990s dot-com bubble, calling OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time.\" Netscape's IPO marked the beginning of dot-com hype in 1995. Five years later, the bubble burst.\n\nBurry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, has made large bets against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, two darlings of the AI era, according to a regulatory filing released in September last year.\n\nLeading AI companies, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, are spending big to build out the infrastructure they need to support their energy- and data-intensive chatbots and other AI applications. Debt and equity investors have lined up to back these projects.\n\nSo far, however, those companies have not shown significant profit returns on their AI products, leading investors like Burry to sound the alarm that AI is a bubble on the verge of bursting.\n\nAgreed. And still, return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off. Will it be the Panic of 2026? 2027? Does not have to be. https://t.co/VBWjh26vnc\n\n\"At some point, this spending on the AI buildout has to have a return on investment higher than the cost of that investment, or there is just no economic value added,\" Burry wrote in the Substack post.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Louise Allen, the chief product officer at Planview, who's in her 60s and is based in Austin. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the chief product officer at Planview, an AI-driven portfolio management platform. Planview helps people organize and manage their workloads by providing teams with visibility into tasks in progress, who's responsible, and how everything connects.\n\nI've been the CPO since June 2021. I spent 13 years as the company's senior vice president of product management and solutions marketing.\n\nBefore entering the tech industry, I was a professional tennis player for 11 years.\n\nI was a decorated athlete and fortunate to have played in all four Grand Slam tournaments, finishing third at Wimbledon in 1983. I'd ranked 60th in the world and trained alongside some of the fiercest competitors the sport has ever seen. I earned six figures in prize money throughout my career.\n\nI'd also faced significant obstacles — most notably, back-to-back ACL injuries, which put me on medical rest for the better part of two years.\n\nAfter just over a decade of intense training, global travel, and high-stakes competition, I knew my time on the circuit had to end. I couldn't tell you why, exactly; I just felt called to try something new.\n\nTech offered me the opportunity to challenge myself and use the skills I'd honed on the court: Vision, planning, adaptation, and relentless commitment to improvement. I was excited by the pace of innovation, the potential to create something new, and the opportunity to solve real problems.\n\nWhen I hung up my racket, I returned to school and earned my MBA at 34. My first role in tech was secured thanks to a reference from Billie Jean King, which helped me land a product marketing internship at a small startup.\n\nThe hardest part of starting a corporate job was my schedule not being my own — working hard and learning were all pretty natural to me, but starting at the bottom of the totem pole and having a lot of my time directed by others was a big adjustment.\n\nI was relatively late to making a career change into tech by most professional standards, but I had come to tennis relatively late, too, and that never stopped me.\n\nIt was a much smaller company back then, with just one product line. Product management was just getting started, and I was able to get in on the ground floor of that.\n\nAs the company grew and evolved, so did my role. I moved from tactical roles to more strategic leadership.\n\nToday, Planview is a very different company with broader offerings and a transformed value proposition. I'm in more C-level conversations in a week than I used to have in a year.\n\nI see hyping up teams as a key part of the role; it's what gets everyone excited about and aligned with the overall vision. People need to walk away being fired up about what we do, and my days are often filled with high-level conversations across teams, customers, and other C-suite leaders.\n\nA typical day includes strategy meetings, product road map reviews, and customer-facing discussions, both in-person and virtual. All of these conversations are focused on steering the ship in the right direction.\n\nI've also learned to become more selfish with my time as I've risen in the company. Putting in 12-hour days just isn't what I want to be doing at this point in my career, and I don't want my teams to feel like they need to, either.\n\nMaintaining the flexibility of a hybrid schedule is a priority for us at Planview, which we prioritize across our teams. I try to lead by example, modeling the work-life balance that's so critical to preventing burnout and maintaining productivity and creativity.\n\nAs for older professionals, I'd like to emphasize that businesses do — really — see a lot of value in curating intergenerational teams. With age comes historical knowledge and insight into why certain processes are structured as they are; with youth, fresh eyes, ideas, and insights.\n\nTake it one step at a time, and through the route that feels right to you. That might mean taking an internship or contract role, joining a professional network in your field of interest, or finding a mentor who can vouch for you, as Billie Jean King did for me.\n\nIt's also critical to focus on your skills rather than your work history. All of your experiences, no matter how unrelated they may seem, can add value. Many of the more technical or field-specific details can be taught, but core capabilities such as relationship-building, time management, presentation and communication skills, and teamwork are more challenging to learn.\n\nTennis taught me risk management, strategic planning, and resilience, all of which I use every day in my work. Those soft skills are often what set you apart, especially in leadership.",

Krishnan told Reuters that \"any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind\", adding it was \"premature to read more into it\". A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.\n\nONGOING TUG OF WAR OVER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nApple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian ⁠industry group that represents the firms, did not respond ‌to requests for comment.\n\nIndian government requirements have irked technology firms before. Last month it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security ‍cameras over fears of Chinese spying.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung - whose phones use Google's Android operating system - hold 19% and 15%, respectively, of India's market share and Apple 5%, Counterpoint Research estimates.\n\nAmong the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code - the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly ​tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.\n\nThe Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to ‌block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to \"avoid malicious usage\".\n\n\"Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,\" said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.\n\nThe security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.\n\nCOMPANIES SAY SOURCE CODE REVIEW, ANALYSIS 'NOT POSSIBLE'\n\nSmartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China's request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and U.S. law enforcement has also tried and failed to ⁠get it.\n\nIndia's proposals for \"vulnerability analysis\" and \"source code review\" would require smartphone makers to perform a \"complete ​security assessment\", after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and ​analysis.\n\n\"This is not possible ... due to secrecy and privacy,\" MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. \"Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.\"\n\nMAIT asked the ministry last ‍week to drop the proposal, a source ⁠with direct knowledge said.\n\nThe Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.\n\nMAIT's ⁠document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone's battery and seeking government approval for software updates is \"impractical\" as they need to be issued promptly.\n\nIndia also wants the phone's logs - digital records ‌of its system activity - to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.\n\n\"There is not enough room on device to store ‌1-year log events,\" MAIT said in the document.",

In October, I got an idea to build what I call a fantasy board of directors from another CEO, and with his permission, I made a version of my own to use as a personal thought partner.\n\nWe have an actual human board, and it's fantastic. I get really good advice from them. But I wanted to use AI to create a fantasy board because mine is limited by the five people who are on it and the experiences that they have in life.\n\nSo the first thing my executive team and I did was create a fantasy draft. It's a bit of a play on fantasy football and fantasy basketball. But instead of it being a competitive thing, where each of us would draft our own teams, we drafted just one together.\n\nWe started by making a spreadsheet of essentially famous people, largely but not entirely, from the business world. We divided them into categories, including iconic business leaders, tech CEOs, VCs, authors, and thought leaders. We also had a category for different voices, such as Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.\n\nNext, we had something like a draft where we picked a couple of people from each category that we wanted on the board. We settled on about 15 names, including Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThere are also two people on it that I know. One is me. The other is Fred Wilson, a VC I've worked with for the past 25 years at other companies.\n\nFrom here, we had AI build 5,000-word profiles for each person, and we gave the AI a certain template to follow. We wanted the fantasy board members to be able to react to things as real board members would, with actual things they've said about how companies and boards perform.\n\nNext, we built the agent. We loaded all these profiles in and then wrote a really long instruction set about what we were trying to accomplish and what our company does. We also loaded materials from past board meetings, our quarterly business review decks, and other things that real board members would have at their disposal or in their heads.\n\nAll of this took maybe an hour or two.\n\nSo now the fantasy board exists, and I use it as a thought partner. For example, I will provide a draft of a board book before sending it to my actual board, and I'll say: These are materials for an upcoming meeting. What do you think of them? Are there topics you would have expected me to cover that I didn't? What questions am I likely to get back from our board? In return, I'll get really useful commentary.\n\nOne thing we put in the instruction set is that when I ask the board for its opinion, very generically, I want it to tell me the consensus opinion and notable outlying dissent with quotes of things that the fantasy board members have actually said.\n\nI'll also ask it for help with internal projects. I'll say things like: Hey, I'm doing a presentation for our kickoff meeting next week. What do you think are the top three themes I should hit?\n\nRecently, I asked my fantasy board to give me a performance review for 2025. It nailed it. The board called out the things that I would have said are my strengths and things that I would have said are problems. I sent the review to my executive team just as an FYI, and they all came back to me and said it was pretty impressive.\n\nI don't use the fantasy board every day, but I'm probably using it at least every other week for something. There are two big limitations. \n\nOne is that anything agentic is only as good as its inputs. My fantasy board only knows what I've told it about my business, or what's publicly available. It doesn't actually know what happens every day in the company. Even though I'm pretty good about feeding it information, it just doesn't have all the context.\n\nThe other limitation is that they're not real people. When you have a real board of directors, you have a real thought partner as a strategic advisor. If you have a board meeting, people are in a room together. They have body language. They have facial expressions. You can tell when they lean in, when they lean back. You can tell when they roll their eyes because they don't believe something you said. You can call them out on that.\n\nWith any AI agents, you need to be really careful not to believe the bullshit. They're predictive, and they're good, but not perfect. They're not human, and they miss a lot of cues.\n\nI told my real board about my fantasy board at our last meeting, which was in November, right after we built it. I explained what it was and how I've been using it. They thought it was great. A couple of them asked me afterward how I built it. They asked for a road map and said that they'd like to do something like it.\n\nThey viewed the fantasy board the same way I do, which is that it's a nice add-on, a sort of augmentation of thought partnership, but that it's never going to be a substitute for a real board.",

    "fullText": "Helen Mirren, 80, isn't buying into the fantasy of eternal youth.\n\nIn an interview with Elle published on Sunday, Mirren spoke about the tech industry's obsession with living forever and why trying to hack aging misses the point.\n\n\"To me, the word longevity is being active, proactive, and productive over a long period of one's life,\" Mirren told Elle. \"Living has to do with enjoying the physical elements of life; the beauty of nature; the excitement of professional success, if you're lucky enough to have it; and family and kids.\"\n\nTo her, longevity means \"contributing in as many diverse ways as possible, for as long as possible,\" she said.\n\nAt the end of the day, trying to beat aging becomes a distraction from living fully. Accepting life's limits, Mirren said, is simply part of growing up.\n\n\"Life is finite. There is no fighting that — as much as people like to put themselves into ice, hoping that they might wake up in 50 years. It's a dream and a fantasy. It's very strange to me. I don't call it growing old. I call it growing up. You constantly grow up through life. But the tech bros who cannot face the idea that they will get old and die just can't deal with it. I think it's so funny. They just haven't grown up yet,\" she said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Mirren has spoken about her views on aging. In October, she told Allure that she loves \"everything\" about growing older.\n\n\"Fuck it, I'm alive and I'm working and I can drink a glass of wine and I can wear makeup and I can listen to music and I can watch a beautiful sunset and I can go to the theater and I can watch a movie and I can binge Netflix and I can live life. It's a beautiful thing,\" she said.\n\nTo stay healthy, Mirren has long championed a 12-minute military workout developed in the 1950s by the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\nShe's also said that it's never too late to start moving, particularly for people in their 50s and 60s.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be joining a gym. It can be small changes like taking a short walk or practicing yoga, which I still enjoy,\" Mirren said.",

Instead, the person who picked up the phone, \"Alex,\" and said he could help him fix his tablet, was actually a fraudster.\n\nDavid Welles, 87, followed Alex’s instructions and downloaded remote access software onto his smartphone and laptop, according to The New York Times (1).\n\n“A big mistake,” Welles told the publication in a story published Dec. 12. “All of a sudden, on the laptop, I could see it going blank, and little lights flashing around.”\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nCiting text messages and other records, The Times reports Welles spent almost five hours on the phone with Alex while trying to fix his problems. Meanwhile, Alex was rooting around in his computer for usernames and passwords — managing to access Welles’ checking account at Citibank and make a wire transfer of $85,000.\n\nHere’s how tech support scams work — and why consumers searching for support numbers online are vulnerable.\n\nLosses from internet crime exceeded $16 billion in 2024 — a 33% increase in losses from 2023 — according to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Those over the age of 60 were hit hardest, losing $4.8 billion while submitting the most complaints.\n\nFake tech-support scams are on the rise, exploiting the fact that many major tech companies don’t offer easily accessible phone support. In 2024, about 36,000 complaints were filed to the IC3 about tech support scams. Of those, 16,777 were filed by those 60 or older.\n\nIn terms of dollars, those complaints led to a staggering $1,464,755,976 in losses (of that, $982,440,006 were losses for those 60 and older).\n\nBut the number of incidents and amount lost could be much higher due to unreported fraud.",

    "fullText": "Yet another data center will soon emerge near the Far Westside of San Antonio, according to a recent Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) filing. It's set to further the Lone Star State's reputation as a tech cluster.\n\nThe quaint town of Castroville, with a population of just over 3,000, will soon house a $400 million development owned by Microsoft. Online records show that the project, named SAT 82, will take up roughly 195,000 square feet in Medina County.\n\nAlthough it's only a one-story building, it will take nearly two years to build, according to the TDLR. Construction at the spot, 3580 FM 471 North, will begin on Thursday, August 13, 2026. A visit to the property revealed that equipment and a welcome poster were already on site. An open field, a two-lane road, and residential properties sit nearby.\n\nIn time, the structure will likely take on the look of a windowless warehouse. It may be hard for residents to get a clear glimpse of the center, as each contains extensive fencing around its perimeters for safety and security purposes, Microsoft's website states.\n\nSAT 82 joins six others in Medina County, according to the TDLR: SAT 80, SAT 81, SAT 89/90, SAT 93, SAT 94, and another with the title SAT 82, but with a different address.\n\nThe centers provide the infrastructure needed to open a phone application, join a virtual Zoom meeting, play an online game, and more. According to the company's website, they also allow the company's Azure cloud platform, AI, and collaboration tools to continue operating as normal.\n\nEarlier this fall, community members in a private Redbird Ranch neighborhood Facebook group voiced concerns over Microsoft's presence in the area. A few users worried the company's projects would worsen traffic. Others highlighted the massive amount of water that data centers use.\n\nIn a 2024 sustainability report, Microsoft said that its water consumption in 2023 - which includes but is not limited to data centers - increased by 1.7 billion gallons from the previous year, coming in at 2.1 billion gallons. The company attributed the increase to its business growth.\n\n\"Improvements as part of our Redmond campus modernization project are estimated to yield over 50% reduction in water use for new facilities,\" it continued in the report.\n\nConstruction on the property is expected to wrap up by 2028, according to the TDLR.\n\nThis article originally published at Microsoft bets $400M on tiny Texas town with new massive data center.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're discussing the proposed tax on billionaires that's dividing the tech elite.",
    "fullText": "California's billionaires are at a crossroads.\n\nOne of the biggest business stories kicking off the year is the proposed wealth tax in California. The state's rich and powerful, worth more than $1 billion, would face a one-time 5% tax on their assets if the plan gets approved.\n\nThe proposal, which aims to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit, has prompted plenty of grumbling among the California elite.\n\nAs Business Insider first reported, some have already taken action, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nPage converted his secretive family office out of California in late December and incorporated it in Delaware, according to my colleague Hugh Langley's exclusive reporting. Page also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures. He lists principal office addresses outside of California for those entities.\n\nSeparately, an entity tied to both Brin and Page moved out of California at the end of 2025.\n\nThe timing of these moves is crucial. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. Hence, the rush to move assets before the end of the year.\n\nBrin and Page are two of the richest people on the planet, with a combined net worth north of half a trillion dollars, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a very different tone. He said he's \"perfectly fine\" with the tax and gave no indication he plans to leave Silicon Valley, even if it costs him.\n\nOthers are more pessimistic. LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman called the proposal \"horrendous\" for innovation, warning that poorly designed wealth taxes don't raise reliable revenue — they push money and talent elsewhere.\n\nAlex Spiro, the celebrity lawyer who represents several billionaires, sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom last month warning that the tax would drive capital and innovation out of California.\n\nEarlier this month, White House AI Czar David Sacks predicted Austin would overtake San Francisco as the American tech hub. His social media post ricocheted throughout tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from traditionalists.\n\nWhere do you stand on the proposed billionaire's tax in California?

    "fullText": "Swedish producer is trying to to accelerate the process of extracting the elements vital for hi-tech products\n\nIt is deep winter with temperatures dropping to -20C. The sun never rises above the horizon, instead bathing Sweden’s most northerly town of Kiruna in a blue crepuscular light, or “civil twilight” as it is known, for two or three hours a day stretching visibility a few metres, notwithstanding heavy snow.\n\nBut 900 metres below the arctic conditions, a team of 20 gather every day, forgoing the brief glimpse of natural light and spearheading the EU’s race to mine its own rare earths. Despite identification of several deposits around the continent, and some rare earth refineries including Solvay in France, there are no operational rare earth mines in Europe.\n\nAcross the globe, the scramble for rare earths has become the source of huge geopolitical tension, with China accused last year by the EU of “weaponising” its near monopoly on raw materials and end products, essential for everything from smartphones, to electric cars, to fridges, music speakers and military jets.\n\nChina’s willingness to slap export bans on rare earths led to the vicious trade war with Donald Trump last year and is partly driving his current bid to take over Greenland, which is rich in these materials, now among the most precious in the world.\n\nEvery day the team at LKAB mine in Kiruna drive 4km (2.5 miles) down an impressive network of tunnels to get closer to what is known as the Per Geijer deposit of magnetite-hematite-phosphate named after the Swedish geologist who identified it more than 100 years ago.\n\nThe team are now operating at two levels – 900m and 1.3km deep underground as they try to connect the existing vast iron ore mine in Kiruna with Per Geijer about 2km away.\n\nUsing remote technology they drill a fan of 84 holes in the rock face; pump them with explosives which are then blasted between 1.15am and 1.45am every night, sometimes disturbing the inhabitants overground, and causing subsidence that has led to the state-owned compamy moving parts of the town and its church.\n\nLess than four hours later the team are back.\n\n“At 5am in the morning, when we have ventilated out the blasting fumes, we start the mucking out,” says 37-year-old Kiruna native Jim Lidström, who leads the tunnelling to what is one of Europe’s largest deposits of rare earths.\n\nOnce cleared, a separate team of men and women, sitting in a modern console centre 1.3k below ground, “scale” the rock, remotely controlling machines that break the detritus into transportable chunks for onward transport to a driverless train.\n\nLidström’s team then set about making the tunnel stable and usable, drilling bolts into the freshly made walls and then spraying it with a layer of concrete or “shotcrete” before the whole process starts all over again.\n\n“We do about five metres a day,” Lidström says.\n\nThe hunt for rare earths is slow.\n\nThe 17 rare earth elements – all found in Kiruna – include neodymium and praseodymium, critical materials for the powerful permanent magnets needed for everything from electric cars to household appliances and military jets.\n\nAlthough geological surveys show large ore bodies across the west – including the Fen complex in Norway, thought to be Europe’s largest deposit – from mine to refined end production could take 10 to 15 years, say experts.\n\n“I think people often miss the point. They say ‘why don’t we just produce rare earths in Europe?’. But you have to have the entire supply chain to do that,” says Nigel Steward, a professor at Imperial College London, a materials scientist and a former executive in the US mining industry.\n\nThe experience in Kiruna shows just how challenging it is to reduce the EU’s dependency on China, which is now the core supplier of rare earth magnets and willing to choke supplies, as it did last year, if politically desirable.\n\nState-owned LKAB is now trying to accelerate the process of mining, extraction, and separation of the crumbs from the ore, to help the EU de-risk as quickly as possible.\n\nJan Moström, the chief executive of LKAB, explains that it could take “years and years” if the company tried to expose the entire length of the Per Geijer deposit for mining purposes.\n\n“But that is not what we are going to do. What we are going to do is to open up incrementally,” he says.\n\nHe refuses to give a timeline because of its sensitivity, instead explaining the complex task ahead in the vast network of tunnels circling the deposit.\n\n“The main focus for us now in the Kiruna system is to find a mine design to deal with the mining of the present reserves down to the main level, at 1,365 metres , then to work out how we go beneath that and develop that resource into reserves, and also how to connect the Per Geijer deposit into the [existing iron ore mining] system. We will start to develop it incrementally, and that is the huge difference [from previous approaches],” he says.\n\nFor Moström, who has spent his career in mines, the last 11 with LKAB, the stranglehold Beijing has built in rare earths was no accident, and something he has been pressing home in Brussels repeatedly.\n\nAs the US and Europe started to regulate against toxic waste in the 1980s, China which had none of the environmental concerns, ploughed on charring the landscape as it went building a chokehold on raw materials now critical for modern life.\n\n“I’ve been talking in Brussels the past two or three years about the huge disadvantages we created in the 1970s and the 1980s when we closed the mining industry and started importing metals from South America, Africa, Australia,” he says.\n\nAsked why it has taken the EU so long to wake up to the dangers of dependency on China’s rare earth supply, he is blunt: “Politicians will never be more courageous than the voters.”\n\n“Nobody saw any future in mining, then the super-cycle started and China started to consume enormous volumes of metals,” he says referring to the boom at the turn of the century when China drove a huge commodities boom on the back of urbanisation.\n\n“I have the perception that the European Commission, the commissioners, really understand the importance of domestic mining and some sort of self-sufficiency,” Moström says.\n\nAs part of the acceleration efforts, LKAB has put €80m (£69m) into a new “demonstration” plant in nearby Luleå to test the process of separation before mining even begins. It has also taken a stake in the Norwegian company REEtec to develop an environmentally friendly way of refining the extract.\n\nContrary to what the name suggests, rare earths – a group of 17 soft metals with unique properties such as strong magnetismor high temperature resistance – are not rare.\n\nSpeckled like crumbs in the earth’s crust, the tag “rare” stuck because of the difficulty accessing them, mining them, and separating them from the ore in which they are found, a process that can take a decade.\n\nLKAB has already been visited by a line of Brussels dignitaries, including industry commissioner Stéphane Séjourné in September, because is represents the EU’s best current hope of weaning itself of a dependency on Chinese supplies that has left Europe vulnerable to increasing geopolitical tensions.\n\nDespite the rhetoric in Brussels, London and Washington over the need to wean industries off China, Beijing will hold the rare earth cards for years to come.\n\n“Right now China controls 85% of the final processing of light rare earths and it control 100% of the heavy rare earths,” says Darren Wilson, the chief executive of LKAB’s industrial minerals division.\n\nAccording to senior European Commission officials in December the EU uses 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets, a year of which 17,000 to 18,000 come from China, creating an unbalanced and high-risk trade relationship.\n\nLast April, in retaliation against Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, China imposed global export restrictions on rare earths, hitting Europe’s car industry. It threatened to impose more restrictions in October, until a 12-month truce was agreed with Trump at in Korea the same month.\n\nAs George Riddell, a senior adviser at Flint Global and a trade expert, says: “China has not just got the capacity to weaponise its trade but shown it has the willingness to do so.”\n\nAll hopes rest on LKAB now being the first to reduce the EU’s reliance on China, with a pre-existing highly developed mining operation employing about 2,000 workers directly and double that indirectly.\n\nMagnetic properties of some metals were discovered by the Greeks 4,000 years ago.\n\nPermanent magnets, found in speakers, headphones, toys, cars and military equipment are typically manufactured from a neodymium-iron-boron alloy.\n\nThe process begins by melting suitable raw materials, placing them into a mould that is then chilled, resulting in a powder. All the particles have then to align in the right direction to create a powerful magnetic force. The powder is sintered in a furnace, bonding the particles together into a mass that is then cut for final use.\n\nPermanent magnets were developed in the research department of the General Motors Company in the US and by the Japanese materials scientist Masato Sagawa in the 1980s.\n\nBut making these powerful magnets generates radioactive byproducts that can contaminate water and soil.\n\nAs the west introduced environmental regulations in the 1980s, US rare earth suppliers “started exporting their product to China because they were willing to process it,” says Imperial College London’s Steward.\n\nGM is now working with Mountain Pass, the only operational rare earth mine in the US, which is thought to be about two years away from producing products for the American market.\n\n“There is no reason why we can’t remake magnets. They were our inventions, in the west. That is the crazy thing,” Steward says.",

    "fullText": "Zurich-based firm taps into latest robot tech to ‘fibre-spray’ high-end sports shoes worn by the likes of Roger Federer\n\nA robot leg whirs around in a complex ballet as an almost invisible spray of “flying fibre” builds a hi-tech £300 sports shoe at its foot.\n\nThis nearly entirely automated process – like a sci-fi future brought to life – is part of the gameplan from On, the Swiss sports brand that is taking on the sector’s mighty champions Nike and Adidas with a mix of technology and chutzpah.\n\nThe brand is expanding rapidly after teaming up with the former tennis pro Roger Federer to create shoes suitable for the Swiss star’s sport and a mix of fashion-led collaborations including with the luxury brand LOEWE, actor Zendaya and singers FKA twigs and Burna Boy. In China, sales have doubled year-on-year. Growth has been strong in the US and mainland Europe and this month On will open its fourth London store, in Kensington.\n\n“We’re an innovation brand at heart,” says its co-founder, David Allemann, “because we are really going for the long run.”\n\nHe’s speaking from On’s Zurich head office, which has the vibe of a tech firm or luxe gym with light-filled spaces and quirky design features from the spiral staircase and workout room to a hanging fossilised tree.\n\nAllemann says the company’s inspirations are disruptors such as Apple and Dyson. These two brands were on the “mood board” when On was set up as they combine “unique design” with “innovation in terms of user-experience or technology”.\n\nAllemann, a former McKinsey consultant, ditched his job in 2010 as marketing boss of the furniture brand Vitra to start On with a former McKinsey colleague, Caspar Coppetti, and the Swiss Ironman world champion and triathlete Olivier Bernhard.\n\nBernhard’s idea was for a shoe that would protect his body from the impact of long-distance running but also promote speed. The original prototype, developed by Bernhard, an inventive individual as well as a committed sportsman, started out with sections of hose-pipe glued to the bottom of an old pair of trainers.\n\nThe three friends, all keen runners, tried out early versions together and put about £600,000 of their life savings into launching the company. They ordered 1,200 pairs of shoes, which they sold at running meets before convincing some specialist retailers to place orders.\n\nIn 2021, the trio floated the brand on the New York Stock Exchange at a value of $8bn (£5.95bn) , raising almost $750m for the business and netting them about $120m in cash while keeping a large stake in the business. This year they expect to sell 30m pairs. The brand is now worth $16bn.\n\nAfter their innovative design took off, On developed the LightSpray flying fibre technology after a team member met a young student, Johannes Voelchert, at a design fair in 2019. The company decided to fund him for a year to develop his vision, which was inspired by a glue gun used to make Halloween spider-web decorations.\n\n“We said: hey, he’s crazy, but we like that because Olivier was crazy as well,” says Allemann.\n\nVoelchert is now part of a team of hundreds of research and technology experts, from more than 90 countries and numerous industry backgrounds, helping to develop new ideas for On in Zurich with a particular eye on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\n“We call that the explorer spirit,” says Allemann.\n\nThe idea is to foster innovation and creativity so that, even as a bigger company employing 4,000 people around the world, the whole business, from designers to manufacturers, can take risks on ideas without necessarily knowing the final outcome. “We’re still able to set sail without exactly knowing where we’re arriving without calling home the next day,” Allemann says.\n\nAllemann adds that On is now seeing the benefit of “many little sprouts that now are growing up”, from its move into different sports – such as outdoor training and tennis – to its development of apparel and the opening of retail stores.\n\nThe small brand may control just 1% of the $450bn global sportswear market, according to GlobalData, but it is expanding rapidly.\n\nOn plays in the premium market with its shoes starting from about £120, excluding seasonal promotions, up to £495. That compares with Nike, which runs from £60 to £290, and Adidas, from £40 to £450.\n\nDespite high-end purchases coming under pressure from cost of living increases, sales for the brand are on track to increase by just over a third to hit nearly 3bn Swiss Francs (£2.8bn) this year. On says it has grabbed as much as a fifth of the running shoe market in the UK and other European countries.\n\nIt faces some heavyweight competition. On is just one-tenth the size of Nike, which holds about 14% of the global sportswear market, according to industry analysts GlobalData, with Adidas on 9%. However, both have faced difficulties in recent years, creating space for new challenges including On, Hoka and revitalised old brands such as New Balance or Onitsuka Tiger, now owned by ASICS.\n\nThe company also faced a class action lawsuit last year in the US, where customers claimed its shoes make a “noisy and embarrassing squeak”. Its “CloudTec” trainers, designed with holes to feel like “running on clouds” – were criticised on social media over the noise. On said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.\n\nOn’s Cloudboom Strike LS laceless shoe, which is made by just nine robots in Zurich and costs £310, has already won the attention of running enthusiasts after the Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri won this year’s New York and last year’s Boston marathon. She also took a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in a pair.\n\nIn Zurich, the robots in their lab-like room are still outnumbered by humans, who monitor their work and complete the final process. Most of the brand’s footwear is made in traditional factories in Asia. But this year On is aiming to open its first robot-led factory to create a more accessible version of the shoe, the upper half of which is made from a single nearly one mile-long filament of thermoplastic polyurethane in just three minutes. Traditionally, a shoe takes several humans hours of work.\n\nThe factory’s location has not yet been decided, but will be close to one of its main retail markets, with the long-term aim of producing on every continent. That would be a dramatic change from today’s industry, which is largely based in Asia, particularly Vietnam and China.\n\nAllemann says local manufacturing is attractive as it has “a huge advantage from a sustainability point of view, because you don’t have to ship shoes around the world, but also from an agility to market point of view – you can produce much faster, according to what people want”.\n\nHe says LightSpray shoes have a 75% lower CO2 footprint than an ordinary sports shoe, which plays to On’s aim to create more sustainable and recyclable kit.\n\nRetail expansion is also a big part of the story. The latest London opening will make the UK capital its biggest retail centre, with plans for as many as seven in future. It is now part of a global portfolio of 60 outlets, with plans for up to 25 more a year despite the rise of online selling.\n\n“We feel there’s still a lot of potential in retail, if done right. City centres are still a very important place for society, and shopping and sports are an important ingredient to that.”\n\nWith those in their late teens, 20s and 30s keen on sport, particularly training and running, Allemann says the shops “are not just stores but also community hubs where running clubs start”.\n\nHe believes On will continue to expand because participating in sport brings people together in a way the online world cannot.\n\n“Running and sports, that’s such an important part of your life that we see consumers are willing to invest in great performance, innovation and better feel, but also in great design and what that tells us about them.”",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Below are key security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, prompting ​opposition from tech companies, according to four sources, as well as industry and government ‌documents seen by Reuters.\n\nManufacturers must test and provide proprietary source code for review by government-designated labs to ‌identify vulnerabilities in phone operating systems that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nIndustry group MAIT, which represents Apple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi, has told the government this is \"not possible\" due to corporate secrecy and global privacy policies.\n\nBACKGROUND PERMISSION RESTRICTIONS:\n\nApps cannot access cameras, microphones or location services in ⁠the background when phones are inactive. ‌Continuous status bar notifications are required when these permissions are active.\n\nManufacturers say this lacks any global precedent and there is no specific test method ‍prescribed.\n\nDevices must periodically display warnings prompting users to review all app permissions, with continuous notifications. Companies say notice should be limited to \"highly critical\" permissions.\n\nDevices must store security audit logs, including ​app installations and login attempts, for 12 months.\n\nMAIT argues consumer phones lack the storage capacity ‌for a year of data.\n\nPhones must periodically scan for malware and identify potentially harmful applications.\n\nManufacturers warn that constant on-device scanning significantly drains the battery and slows hardware performance.\n\nOPTION TO REMOVE PRE-INSTALLED APPS:\n\nAll pre-installed apps bundled with the phone operating system, except those essential for basic phone functions, must be deletable.\n\nCompanies argue many apps are critical system components that cannot be ⁠removed.\n\nINFORMING GOVERNMENT OF MAJOR UPDATES:\n\nPhone makers must notify a ​government organisation before releasing any major updates or security ​patches.\n\nManufacturers argue this is \"impractical\" because security fixes must be released quickly to protect users from active exploits, while government delays could leave users vulnerable.\n\nDevices ‍must detect if phones have ⁠been rooted or \"jailbroken\", where users bypass built-in security restrictions, and display continuous warning banners to recommend corrective measures.\n\nCompanies say there is no reliable mechanism to detect jailbreaking.\n\nPhones ⁠must permanently block installation of older software versions, even if officially signed by the manufacturer, to prevent security ‌downgrades.\n\nThere is no global standard related to this requirement, manufacturers say.",

By targeting core digital infrastructure, our investments scale across many sectors and benefit a broad range of users. Improving the security, stability, and reusability of open software components directly enhances the productivity, competitive edge, and capacity for innovation of startups and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe open source ecosystem, while incredibly successful, is also increasingly fragile. Many more people are using the software than contributing to it. It is time to invest in digital commons, volunteer communities and the open source ecosystem to build the digital world we want to see. We are working to strengthen the self-determined use of digital technologies and systems by individuals, industry, and governments.\n\nTo prepare an application, we ask that you review and consider all information regarding the selection criteria and the subsequent process. Applications are accepted exclusively through our application platform.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot provide prior advice on whether a project generally falls under our objectives. If you would like to apply for support for a project, please first check thoroughly whether all the criteria listed below apply.\n\nSubmission through our application system: submissions must be completed through the online application portal. No supplemental materials should be sent via email or any other form of communication at this time.\n\nCompleteness: applications must be completed in German or English. The questions must be answered to a degree that allows us to assess and evaluate the applications.\n\nProposed activities: the activities listed in the application must be related to developing or maintaining open digital base technologies. Development is our primary focus, although security audits, conference attendance, and other community-based events can be included in the application should they be necessary.\n\nEstimated costs: The cost of the work described in the application must exceed €50,000 (current minimum).\n\nPublic financing: Projects are not eligible to receive financing or work commissions from the Sovereign Tech Fund if other public entities are already making or have made grants or investments for the same proposed activities.\n\nFOSS: all code and documentation to be supported must be licensed such that it may be freely reusable, changeable, and redistributable. OSI-approved or FSF Free/Libre licenses are acceptable for code. Creative-Commons-like licenses for documentation may not include non-commercial or “no derivative” clauses.\n\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund invests in open digital base technologies that are vital to the development of other software or enable digital networking. We invest in projects that benefit and strengthen the open source ecosystem. Examples include libraries for programming languages, package managers, open implementations of communication protocols, administration tools for developers, digital encryption technologies, and more. We do not finance the development of prototypes. Our currently funded projects show the range and type of technologies that characterize open digital base technologies.\n\nWe are currently not looking for user-facing applications, such as messaging apps or file storage services. If this changes, we will announce it here.\n\nThese are the criteria we use to review all projects that fulfill the basic requirements:\n\nA technology is prevalent when it is widely used for or within other technologies.\n\nA technology is relevant if it is significant for one or more important societal sectors, e.g., education, health care, energy sector, industry.\n\nA technology is vulnerable if important work – to keep the quality of the project or to enhance it – is not (sufficiently) funded by other actors or cannot be completed for other structural reasons.\n\nThere are benefits for society or critical sectors of society (e.g., education, health care, energy, industry) by funding the technology.\n\nWe evaluate the work that is planned in the proposed project. For example, we examine the feasibility and overall impact of the activities described in the proposal.\n\nThe applicants, their organization, or community demonstrate that they have the necessary knowledge, insight, and technological skills to do the proposed work. They are either a recognized part of the community around the technology, or they have the endorsement of that community or the maintainer.\n\nLastly, the evaluation is guided by our strategy and mission. That is, from start to finish, we look at how the project fits into the Sovereign Tech Agency’s mission and contributes to the goal of sustainably strengthening the open source ecosystem in the public interest.\n\nCreate an account to submit an application. Please note that you will only receive a submission confirmation from us if you agreed to receive emails or SMS from us when you registered. If you change this in the settings after your registration, it will only affect future messages from us, such as acceptances or rejections.\n\nDownload a preview of the application form (PDF)\n\nAfter you submit an application, your submission goes through a multistep review and selection process. First, we check if the submission meets the basic requirements listed above. Those that do, are reviewed by the Sovereign Tech Fund using the criteria. You will hear from us whether your application passes those two stages.\n\nUpon positive review, a member of the program team gets in touch with the person or persons who submitted the application to scope the proposal in more detail. During this scoping phase, we work with you to clarify open questions, refine the scope of work, and create a project description, based on the application and conversations between you and the program manager.\n\nThe Sovereign Tech Agency then consults with a pool of external experts and practitioners and includes their perspectives to arrive at the final selection.\n\nThe last step includes a legal compliance review, the creation of additional supporting documentation, and the creation of a contract.\n\nFor technical problems, contact [email protected]\n\nWhen you submit an application, we’ll confirm that we have received it. Then, you can expect to hear back from us within 10 weeks. We’ll inform you whether the proposal has passed the review, and whether we’re continuing with you to the scoping phase. For some projects, the response time will be shorter, depending on the overall amount of applications to be reviewed.\n\nThe overall time between submitting an application and a potential start date of the contract is approximately 6 months.",

    "description": "Samsung, TCL, Hisense, and LG all revealed new TVs at CES 2026. Here are the top display models and tech advancements announced at the show.",
    "fullText": "The CES trade show is the premier event for showcasing extravagant new consumer tech concepts and prototypes. This year's show, held in Las Vegas from January 6 to 9, was no different. But mixed in with all the spectacle were plenty of announcements for products you'll actually be able to buy, including an assortment of brand-new TVs.\n\nI've been reviewing home theater gear for over a decade, so I know that not every display breakthrough sticks. With that in mind, I've separated the real upgrades from the marketing fog to find the top TVs and display trends from CES. And this year, one takeaway is clear: TV brands are pushing Micro RGB. This type of display promises a significant upgrade in color performance. At the same time, OLED makers are coming out swinging with brighter panels, and brands are continuing to expand their extra-large screen offerings with TVs as big as 130 inches.\n\nBelow, I've detailed the top five TV advancements I'm most excited about from CES, outlining a few clear themes that could shape what you'll be shopping for in 2026. Though exact pricing and release dates are still pending, all of the TVs highlighted below are expected to be available this year. For more display recommendations, be sure to visit my complete guide to all of the best TVs you can buy right now.\n\nIf I had to pick one trend to represent the TV industry's biggest push for 2026, it would be Micro RGB. Samsung, Hisense, LG, and TCL are all offering some variation of this technology, and it dominated the announcements out of CES.\n\nMicro RGB TVs, also called RGB Mini LED TVs by some companies, are a type of LED TV that use a new kind of backlighting system designed to offer a big boost in color performance. Rather than using a backlight with white or blue light and then relying on a filter to produce colors, Micro RGB TVs have individual red, blue, and green LEDs. Hisense is taking this approach even further by adding cyan to certain models. Using a backlight system like this enables purer color production and a wider range of hues. At the end of the day, this should translate to a more colorful and brighter image than you'd see on a typical LED, QLED, Mini LED, or OLED TV.\n\nThe first two Micro RGB TVs from Samsung and Hisense actually hit the market last year, but they were limited to a 116-inch and 115-inch model that cost a staggering $30,000 each. Though pricing hasn't been confirmed yet, brands are releasing a bigger lineup of Micro RGB TVs this year, with sizes starting at 55 inches. This is exciting since it should translate to much more affordable options. Most notably, shoppers should keep an eye on the Samsung R85H series, the Hisense UR8 and UR9 series, and the TCL RM9L Series, which have the best chance of featuring this new tech at consumer-friendly prices.\n\nAlthough most brands are promoting Micro RGB as the next big thing in TV technology, TCL is taking a different approach. The company is still releasing Micro RGB models this year, but it's positioning a different kind of TV as its flagship offering. TCL refers to this display type as \"SQD,\" which stands for Super Quantum Dots.\n\nIn essence, SQD TVs are an evolution of QLED TVs. They still use white or blue backlights but incorporate a layer of super quantum dot crystals, which are larger than the standard type, along with an Ultra Color Filter. That's a lot of tech jargon, but in practice, TCL says this combination results in colors that rival or surpass those of Micro RGB TVs while avoiding potential flaws that RGB backlight systems can introduce. SQD TVs can also get incredibly bright, with TCL stating that its premium model can reach up to 10,000 nits, which would match the highest brightness that any consumer TV has achieved.\n\nTCL's first SQD TV, the X11L, is already available for preorder in an 85-inch size ($8,000). A 75-inch ($7,000) and 98-inch ($10,000) size are also set to launch soon. Though far from cheap, those prices aren't unreasonable for a new high-end TV technology, and TCL is known for offering huge discounts throughout the year. Likewise, SQD technology will also be used on the brand's step-down QM8L and QM7L, which are expected to be released later this year and will likely cost substantially less.\n\nI'll be reviewing the X11L soon, so check back for full details on its performance.\n\nThough I'm excited to check out new Micro RGB and SQD TVs this year, it's important not to forget about OLEDs. The best OLED TVs remain some of the most impressive displays you can buy, and I don't see that changing in 2026. Both LG and Samsung announced new flagship OLED models that promise boosts in brightness and new design perks.\n\nThe LG G6 will succeed the G5, which was my favorite high-end TV of 2025. LG says the G6 can get 20% brighter than the G5. Since the G5 was already the brightest OLED available, that's a notable improvement. The G6 will also boast improved reflection handling via a new polarizer filter, which LG says will cut reflections in half while maintaining deep black levels. Reflections have been a pain point for some LG OLED buyers, so this could be a big perk. LG is also bringing back its striking Wallpaper OLED in the form of the new LG W6. This ultra-thin TV is only 9mm thick and uses a wireless connection box to keep your wall free from cables.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung is launching the S95H as the successor to its S95F. Samsung says this new model can get 35% brighter than the S95F, which could make it even brighter than the G6. In addition, the TV uses a new metal art-style bezel that gives it a look \n\nUltimately, I expect new Micro RGB and SQD TVs to have an edge in color and brightness over top OLEDs, but the G6 and S95H will deliver higher contrast, which could still result in better overall image quality. Time will tell, but I'm excited to see how the latest premium OLEDs stack up against 2026's other new TV offerings.\n\nOver the last few years, TV brands have been expanding their extra-large screen offerings, with an increasing number of 75-inch and larger options. In 2025, we saw more 98-, 100-, 115-, and 116-inch models than ever before. That trend will continue in 2026, and some brands are taking it even further with massive 130-inch screens.\n\nSamsung's 130-inch R95H is the most notable super-sized TV set to be released this year. This is Samsung's flagship Micro RGB model, so it should offer some of the most impressive brightness and color capabilities of any TV in 2026. And it will offer that incredible performance in an absolutely massive screen size. It also boasts a unique stand that Samsung calls its \"Timeless Frame\" design, which makes it appear as though the TV is floating within the stand that surrounds it. Pricing details have not been revealed, but I expect this one to be exclusive to luxury buyers.\n\nAlso of special note is a new 98-inch Samsung LS03H Frame TV, the largest Frame TV the brand has ever produced. Frame TVs are popular for their art-style designs with thin wall mounts and magnetic bezels. However, unlike previous Frame models, this new 98-inch option will have its ports built into the TV, rather than using a separate box. It will also come with a bezel rather than requiring buyers to purchase one separately.\n\nSamsung's Frame TVs are popular displays for design-focused shoppers, and brands like Hisense and TCL both offer their own take on art-style TVs. At CES 2026, LG revealed its own entry into the frame TV market with the new Gallery TV.\n\nThe Gallery TV features all the essentials that other art-inspired sets offer, including the ability to mount flush on your wall, an anti-glare screen to help mimic the look of canvas, and support for magnetic bezel attachments, allowing you to alter the frame style. LG is also launching a new Gallery+ service with access to more than 4,500 works of art, pieces of animation, and other images. The Gallery TV will use a Mini LED panel, but it's not clear if it will have any kind of dimming capabilities. Based on what has been announced so far, it appears poised to compete with Samsung's higher-end Frame Pro model.\n\nAlthough the Gallery TV with frame is unlikely to substantially outperform any existing frame-style TVs in overall image quality, the arrival of another art-focused TV is an exciting development for design-focused shoppers seeking more options. Pricing is still pending, but the Gallery TV with frame will be available in 55- and 65-inch sizes later this year.",

    "description": "Meta's Manus deal faces a probe from China's regulator. Analysts say it's about sending a message that China's AI talent isn't easy pickings.",
    "fullText": "China has a message for US tech firms: Hands off our AI talent and tech.\n\nThat's what Beijing is signalling by announcing a probe into Meta's acquisition of Manus, analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThe probe, confirmed by China's Ministry of Commerce in a Thursday press conference, will investigate whether the acquisition complies with the country's laws and regulations concerning export controls, according to a statement translated by Google.\n\nManus was launched in China last March by the AI product studio Butterfly Effect and drew global attention after saying it had designed a \"general-purpose\" AI agent that can conduct tasks with limited human supervision. In mid-2025, the startup relocated to Singapore.\n\nIn December, Meta announced that it would acquire Manus and sever its ties with China completely. The deal reportedly exceeds $2 billion. Meta did not respond to a request for comment for this story from Business Insider.\n\nWhile China and the US have long engaged in tit-for-tat regulatory exchanges involving their tech companies, analysts told Business Insider this probe is notable because it appears to be aimed at discouraging so-called \"Singapore washing\" — the process of moving a company from China to Singapore to reduce regulatory scrutiny.\n\nTikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and fast-fashion giant Shein are among those that have shifted their headquarters from China to Singapore.\n\nThe probe is also a means to discourage Chinese AI startups from choosing the US, analysts said.\n\n\"I see Beijing's probe as an effort to prevent the loss of AI technology and talent to foreign acquisition, especially to the US,\" Wendy Chang, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta said it plans to bring over Manus' top leadership and will continue to run its AI agent platform separately, alongside integrating the technology into Meta's own products.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company, has been the subject of US export controls for years, which limit the sale of its advanced chips to China. The Manus probe shows how the battleground has moved from beyond chips to \"models, agents, talent, and enterprise deployment,\" Murthy Grandhi, a company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, told Business Insider.\n\nHanna Dohmen, senior research analyst at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, told Business Insider that while the probe \"isn't entirely surprising,\" the approach regulators are taking is \"more novel\" because it \"appears to focus on the movement of talent and IP.\"\n\nTalent has become a focal point of the AI race, with companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google offering huge pay packages to entice the best and brightest. Last year, Meta invested $14 billion in AI training startup Scale AI, bringing its CEO, Alexandr Wang, over to run the tech giant's AI efforts.\n\nChina's Manus probe could signal that it was policing \"outbound AI technology transfer with greater rigor,\" said Grandhi, adding that it could accelerate the \"bifurcation of AI ecosystems.\"\n\nThe US and China have been taking diverging approaches to AI, with Chinese companies tending to favor AI models that are more open, such as DeepSeek.\n\nIt's not clear how long China's probe will last, should it progress into a full investigation. Other investigations from China's Ministry have taken more than a year.\n\nGrandhi said that in his view, the most likely outcome is that the deal will be approved \"with constraints, rather than an outright block.\"\n\n\"Whatever the outcome may be, this certainly sends a signal to other US or foreign companies that are considering similar acquisitions,\" added Dohmen.",

    "description": "Michelle Hu, owner of Étoile, shares how learning from her failed beauty tech app led to Étoile's over $9 milion revenue last year.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michelle Hu, a 30-year-old business owner based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy first business died as quickly as it started.\n\nIn 2017, I was working as an investment banking analyst at Citi when I launched Mei, a beauty app where users could filter through and book appointments with makeup artists, hair stylists, and more. It was a one-year process of trying to scale and pouring in about $30,000 in the process, but we ultimately never launched.\n\nIn the meantime, I was selling handmade acrylic makeup holders online under the brand name Étoile. Mei failed, but I saw Étoile gaining traction on its own. I realized it could take off — and it did.\n\nTwo years later, I quit my job and went all in on Étoile. I transformed it into a world for beauty enthusiasts, crafting accessories that elevate daily rituals. We made over $9 million in revenue last year and recently launched our products in nearly 30 Anthropologie stores across the US.\n\nHere's what I learned from my failed business that helped me the second time around.\n\nI was so in love with the beauty industry that I jumped right in with Mei, but I had no tech background and no idea what really went into building an app. I remember thinking the idea of creating this techy business app sounded cool, but it just wasn't a fit for my skill set or interests. I had no business creating an app.\n\nWhen time's got hard, and the app required more time, energy, and money than I bargained for, I didn't have the passion for my product to drive me. Starting Étoile, a consumer product business, felt a lot more aligned with me.\n\nI learned it's important to start a business in an industry you love, because when things get difficult, you need the passion to fuel you. I'm not passionate about tech, but I am passionate about designing products. That passion fuels me to work through the hurdles.\n\nI now realize that I never had product-market fit with Mei. Most people text or DM to book makeup artists or hairstylists, and I learned the hard way that it's difficult to change consumer behavior.\n\nMy initial vision for Étoile was for it to be an \"everything store\" for beauty, featuring items such as ring lights and vanity tables. However, our customer base was fragmented.\n\nThat's when I took what I learned from Mei and scaled back on items that weren't driving a significant amount of revenue, focusing on what worked: our travel range of products. Since then, we've developed a strong customer base that's excited about our product. I can feel the difference between having headwinds in the business versus having tailwinds.\n\nWhen we hit that product-market fit magic, everything seemed to move a lot more efficiently in the business.\n\nI think the biggest financial mistake I made was not vetting the people we chose to build the app. It sounds silly because it seems so obvious, but I think I was just so new to the world of business and thought, \"If they've made one app before, then they can make any app.\"\n\nWe hired college students from around the world and basically threw money at them without meeting them or vetting them. We couldn't afford people with a strong portfolio, so we just filtered through others who were just as scrappy as us. I didn't realize there was such a big scope of different app developers.\n\nI've always lived by the saying, \"move fast and break things,\" but when you're spending so much money to hire people, do more research.\n\nI think hiring is still a tricky one. The thing that helps is that we have a much bigger budget than we did with Mei. The people we choose to work with have a strong portfolio of brands that they've previously worked with. I think bigger budgets have allowed for better opportunities.\n\nWhen I shut down Mei, I had to admit that things weren't working and even learn to be OK with failure.\n\nAt the start of Étoile, I held onto our product strategy so tightly, even when it wasn't working. My thought process was that we had our products ready to go, stored in a warehouse, and marketed to our audience, so I thought it would be a bad look to pull back on them, even when they weren't working.\n\nWhen I finally made the shift and pulled back on items like mirrors and tables, the business made a complete 180. It reaffirmed that it's important to admit when things aren't working and not to have so much pride when it comes to my business.\n\nDo you have a story to share about lessons learned from a failed business? If so, please contact the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

For those without synesthesia, this may be the closest you can come to experiencing it.\n\nAccording to Lollipop Star's website, the candy is designed with a standard lollipop on top of a thicker handle at the bottom, which houses the electronics. Users could bite down lightly on the candy to activate the vibrations. Earplugs are included to help isolate the sound in noisy environments.\n\nBased on photos from Lollipop Star's booth at the CES, each candy is tied to a specific artist and flavor. For example, Ice Spice's version comes in peach, Akon's is blueberry, and Armani White's is lime.\n\nOn its website, the company says that the novelty candy will come at an affordable price of $9 each.\n\nThe Tamagotchi of the AI era is here.\n\nA new AI pet from Chinese startup Takway AI, called Sweekar, debuted in the US at CES. Unlike most AI companions that exist entirely virtually, this creature has a physical form that appears to grow.\n\nBased on demo videos, the Sweekar starts out as a palm-sized, egg-shaped device with glowing ears. After an incubation period that can last up to two days, the shell appears to crack open, revealing a newborn digital creature.\n\nFrom there, Sweekar moves through a series of life stages. The baby phase lasts roughly five to seven days, followed by a teenage stage that can stretch from about three to six weeks. Eventually, the pet reaches adulthood, developing greater intelligence and a more defined personality, as well as more independence.\n\nEarly in its life, the pet requires frequent attention, including regular care and help learning basic language. Just like a Tamagotchi, Sweekar can die from neglect.\n\nTakway AI said in a press release that it plans to launch Sweekar on Kickstarter later this year. The company expects the device to be priced at around $150.\n\nVacuum cleaning robots are taking a major step up.\n\nRoborock's Saros Rover prototype became the first robot vacuum to climb stairs at CES. Based on demo videos, the prototype robot vacuum uses a pair of articulated wheel-legs that lift and lever its body up, before folding away and redeploying for the next step.\n\nThe process isn't fast, according to demo videos, but the Rover cleans the stairs as it goes. Roborock said in a press release that the system works on traditional, curved, and carpeted staircases, as well as ramps, thresholds, and other household obstacles.\n\nThe Saros Rover remains an early prototype, and Roborock hasn't shared pricing or a launch timeline. The company has said in a press release, however, that it plans to bring the stair-climbing robot vacuum to market.\n\nLenovo showcased numerous concept devices at CES 2026, but one of its boldest ideas was a gaming laptop featuring a screen that physically expands wider.\n\nThe Legion Pro Rollable, as Lenovo described in a press release, is built around a 16-inch flexible OLED display that can expand sideways to two larger sizes. From photos, the device appears to have a screen screen stretches from a standard 16:10 aspect ratio to 21:9 or an ultra-wide 24:9, effectively turning a compact gaming laptop into a widescreen display better suited for immersive games.\n\nAccording to Lenovo, the Legion Pro has the same lower chassis, ports, and supports high-end graphics, just like some of Lenovo's other products. The rollable device was named Best Gaming Product in the Official Best of CES 2026 Awards, though Lenovo has not announced plans to turn it into a retail device.\n\nAI-Tails is betting that AI can spot health issues in cats long before their owners do.\n\nAt CES, the Swiss startup has unveiled a smart feeding and drinking station that uses AI, cameras, and pattern-recognition software to analyze a cat's behavior and facial expressions, signals that are often too subtle for humans to notice without veterinary expertise. The company's website said that the goal is to monitor a pet's well-being continuously and flag potential problems in real time.\n\nVideos of a live demo at CES show that the system features separate bowls for food and water. with built-in sensors and cameras, analyze consumption patterns, body temperature, and facial cues.\n\nThe feeding station is currently available for preorder and is expected to ship worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2026, according to the company's website. The models are expected to be priced between $199 and $299.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says saving for retirement will be \"irrelevant\" if he's right about what the future holds.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO predicted AI would help create an \"abundance\" of resources for all.\n\nPeople would have \"whatever stuff they want\" and access to superb healthcare and education, he said.\n\nSaving for retirement has been a cornerstone of personal finance for well over a century. It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said. That would mean \"better medical care than anyone has today, available for everyone within five years,\" he continued. \"No scarcity of goods and services. You can learn anything you want about anything for free.\"\n\nHowever, the serial entrepreneur warned of a \"bumpy\" transition to this utopian world, marked by jarring change and social unrest. He also flagged a potential loss of purpose.\n\n\"Now, if you actually get all the stuff you want, is that actually the future you want?\" he asked. '\"Because it means that your job won't matter.\"\n\nMusk is known for transforming the auto sector with Tesla's electric vehicles, and revolutionizing the aerospace industry with SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nHis companies are developing self-driving cars, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces, AI assistants, and other innovations as he paves his way to becoming the first trillionaire in history.\n\nDespite his track record, Musk's latest prediction clashes hard with the reality faced by many Americans. Years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and anemic wage growth have created an affordability crisis.\n\nMillions of people feel priced out of getting a college degree, accessing quality healthcare, owning a home, or having children. A comfortable retirement also feels out of reach, with surveys showing the majority of Americans aren't saving nearly enough.",

    "description": "Robotaxi reporter Lloyd Lee breaks down what he saw — and heard — on the ground at the world's largest consumer tech show, CES, in Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The race to dominate the robotaxi space may not be as close as some companies suggest.\n\nLloyd Lee, Business Insider's reporter covering robotaxis and emerging mobility tech, went to CES for the first time to check out the autonomous service from Zoox, Vay, and other providers. Lee, who has taken a few rides with robotaxis recently entering the market, said the experience sharpened his view that one company appears to be significantly ahead — and that the industry still faces major hurdles before the vehicles can truly go mainstream.\n\nIn the Q&A below with BI News Chief Steve Russolillo, Lee breaks down his biggest takeaways from CES, the most impressive tech he saw, and how the experience will shape his coverage in the year ahead.\n\nSteve Russolillo: Lloyd, this is your first time at CES. What are your impressions and biggest takeaways from the event?\n\nLloyd Lee: First, CES is a massive event. It is humanly impossible to stop by every booth no matter how militant you are with your time. Second, I was struck by how much space the convention was dedicated to automobility. I agree with what Paul Costa, a 25-year Apple veteran who worked on the company's self-driving car project and is now at Ford, told me: CES has become a car show as much as it remains a tech show.\n\nRussolillo: What's the craziest and wildest piece of new technology that you saw?\n\nLee: Hyundai Motor Group's booth had a really impressive display of how far it's trying to take autonomy — from EV charging stations and robotaxis to robotic arms and humanoid robots. Boston Dynamics, a Hyundai unit, demoed its Atlas humanoid robot at the booth. Just the way it activates and stands up is terrifying and awe-striking at the same time.\n\nRussolillo: You cover robotaxis for BI and had the opportunity to test drive two different robotaxis this week. What stood out to you the most?\n\nLee: I tried two robotaxi services for the first time, including Amazon's Zoox. There are obviously a lot of smart people working on this technology. But I have to say: Trying those services only made me realize 1.) how far ahead Waymo is or at least appears to be, and 2.) just how difficult it is to make a profitable business case for robotaxis right now.\n\nGetting autonomous driving right is only part of the challenge. There's also the operations side — like fleet scaling and management — that Waymo has had to build up to help make robotaxis feel like a real autonomous ride-hailing service you can use in your day-to-day. (That is if you live in the city Waymo operates.) And even then, we know Waymo is burning money on its service.\n\nRussolillo: What are some of the predictions you've heard from sources about tech, AI and business?\n\nLee: Chris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte with expertise in software-defined vehicles, had a few interesting points.\n\nRussolillo: What startup you never heard before really stole the show and impressed you?\n\nLee: Perhaps less stole the show, but I thought Vay, a German startup developing a driverless car rental service, reminded me that there's still room for some contrarian voices in the driverless space. Remote driving is the big bogeyman for robotaxi companies. You don't want to be caught using it. This startup's entire business model is built around it. Vay is using remote driving — with a potential to pursue autonomy in the future — for a small fraction of the overall driving experience: Getting the car delivered to a renter without a human inside. It was a \"Huh, I never thought about that\" moment.\n\nRussolillo: What did you learn that might change how you go about your tech coverage for BI?\n\nLee: Broadly, emerging technologies like humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and, more generally, AI, contain a lot of unknowns and uncertainties. And company leaders in those spaces can be evasive when you ask for specifics, or they simply don't know the answer. Possibly both. My instinct is to resolve that ambiguity, which in this space, will not always be realistic. Instead, I should write to the uncertainty, not through it. Name the ambiguity, build the story around it.",

    "description": "France's defense ministry picked Mistral to supply military AI systems running on national infrastructure, demonstrating Europe's push for tech sovereignty.",
    "fullText": "French AI startup Mistral has secured a major vote of confidence from its home government after landing a deal to provide AI technology to France's military.\n\nFrance's Ministry of the Armed Forces said on Thursday that it has formally notified a framework agreement with Mistral AI, giving the country's armed forces, defense agencies, and affiliated public institutions access to the company's advanced AI models, software, and services.\n\nUnder the deal overseen by the ministry's defense AI agency, Mistral's AI systems will be deployed on French-controlled infrastructure, a key priority for the military as governments grow increasingly cautious about where sensitive data is processed and which laws govern it.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post announcing the deal, Mistral said its AI systems would be deployed on France's own infrastructure and fine-tuned using defense-specific data to support operational military needs.\n\nThe financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Mistral was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant win for Mistral, which was founded in 2023 and is valued at roughly $13.6 billion, following a 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) funding round announced last year.\n\nThe startup has positioned itself as a European alternative to US AI heavyweights, such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, pitching its models as powerful yet more compatible with Europe's sovereignty and data control ambitions.\n\nIn its statement, translated by Business Insider, the defense ministry said the partnership is intended to strengthen France's \"technological sovereignty\" and ensure the armed forces maintain control over critical AI tools used across military operations and administration.\n\nBertrand Rondepierre, director of the ministry's defense AI agency, said the agreement represents \"a major step\" in strengthening the ministry's generative AI capabilities and preparing the armed forces for future challenges, while maintaining sovereign control over the technologies used.\n\nThe deal comes as European governments reassess their dependence on US technology in strategic sectors ranging from cloud computing to semiconductors and now AI.\n\nThe French ministry's move mirrors that of the US government, which has increasingly inked major contracts with domestic AI companies to develop tools for military and national security use, including recent deals with OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other defense-focused startups.\n\nAs generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in military planning, logistics, and analysis, Mistral's latest win helps to position the startup as one of Europe's key players in the race to develop sovereign alternatives to American tech giants.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

The sprawling event aims to showcase cutting-edge technology developed by startups and big brands.\n\nMany of these fancy developments will be available to actually buy, moving from outlandish concepts to production devices, although some are still limited to costly prototypes.\n\nThe rise of the humanoid robot continues, with the show floor filled with myriad prototypes, some of which operated autonomously rather than being remotely controlled or performing set routines this year.\n\nNot one but two different robots promised to do your laundry, make breakfast and serve drinks. In demos LG’s CLOiD home robot, which is reportedly due to undergo real-world testing next year, looked like a disembodied torso on a rolling platform, slowly and autonomously doing chores linked with various LG kitchen appliances.\n\nThe Chinese company Switchbot’s Onero H1, however, looks more like a security bot crossed with a robot vacuum with articulating arms ready to do chores. The company says it should go on sale later this year for an undisclosed sum. It joined impressive demos from many other Chinese robotics outfits, including Unitree, Booster Robotics and X-Humanoid, the recent winner of Beijing’s humanoid robot half-marathon.\n\nThis also promises to be that year that Boston Dynamics’ long-tested Atlas robot finally goes from awkward prototype to polished product, with a new design unveiled during the parent company Hyundai’s CES show.\n\nThe South Korean firm is partnering with Google’s DeepMind for robotic AI research and plans to deploy the Atlas robots, which are water resistant, can lift 50kg and automatically swap their batteries, to its manufacturing plants in the next couple of years.\n\nRobot vacuums are the more prevalent home robot for now, but even they have new tricks. Dreame’s Cyber10 Ultra arm-equipped robovac can lift up to 500g and use brushes and other nozzles while cleaning your floors. It will reportedly go on sale around August for about €1,800 (£1,560), although it was the company’s Cyber X concept with four legs and tank-like tracks that had attenders captivated because it might help it finally vanquish the mortal enemy of robot vacuums: climbing stairs.\n\nHowever, if actually cleaning the stairs is the goal, Roborock’s first two-wheel-leg robovac might be better. The Saros Rover is in development, shown off in prototype form, and can raise, lower and jump its way to each step, cleaning as it goes.\n\nNot even the humble fridge was safe this year from the march of robotics. Samsung debuted its new Family Hub fridge, which includes a screen on the front but its party piece is voice-controlled doors you can open and close hands-free.\n\nLess novel but potentially just as useful, GE built a barcode scanner into its new Profile fridge, which is designed to scan things as you discard them to automatically add them to a shopping list ready for when you need it. A camera inside the fridge lets you check remotely to see if anything’s finished or rotten.\n\nScores of new laptops were on show from all the major manufacturers including Acer, Dell, Samsung and others. But Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept was the start of the show: a regular-looking 16in laptop with a OLED screen that unrolls horizontally to a full-size 24in monitor for gaming and productivity on the go. Meanwhile, the company’s new ThinkPad Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist is going from concept to actual product with a motorised rotating hinge that automatically turns the screen to face you or your audience if you are presenting.\n\nSamsung used CES to show off its cutting-edge trifolding flexible screen Android phone-tablet hybrid, which takes the book-style folding design and adds another section that unfolds again like a pamphlet to reveal a large wide-screen tablet. Having gone on sale in South Korea just before the end of 2025 the Galaxy Z TriFold is expected to reach the US and other markets in the first half of this year for a big sum.\n\nBut for those who long for the days of physical keyboards on phones, the accessory company Clicks is bringing back the BlackBerry with its new Communicator: an Android phone with a physical keyboard. Designed as a “communication companion” with custom software that puts messaging above doomscrolling on social media, the Communicator can be used as a primary phone or as a partner to your existing iPhone or Android. It has a notification LED around the power button and a fingerprint scanner in the space bar. Reservations are open and the phone is due to ship later this year.\n\nClicks already sells keyboard cases for the iPhone, Pixel and other devices for those that don’t want to replace their phone completely with a BlackBerry. But it also had a new slide-out keyboard Bluetooth that doubles as a magnetic wireless charging battery pack on show at CES. The Power Keyboard magnetically sticks to the back of the phone and will be compatible with iPhones and Androids supporting Qi2, shipping in the spring.",

    "fullText": "You can pinpoint the exact minute of the high-water mark for tech-based enthusiasm: January 9, 2007, 9:41 AM PST, the moment Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone to the world.\n\nCell phones weren’t new—neither were cellphones with touch screens—but this one was different: so high-tech it seemed like it couldn’t be real, but so perfectly designed, it felt inevitable. And people were hyped. Not just tech nerds: normal people. The crowd at the 2007 Macworld Conference & Expo broke into rapturous applause when Jobs showed off the iPhone’s multi-touch—an ovation for a software feature!—because it seemed like Jobs was touching a better future.\n\nThe iPhone, people said, was like something out of Star Trek. But unlike communicators or tri-corders, it was obtainable (if you had $500) evidence of a future where technology would finally free us from the drudgery of our lives so we could boldly go—wherever, it doesn't matter.\n\nSteve Jobs mentioned Star Trek as an inspiration for the iPhone all the time; apparently the show is quite popular among tech people. Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek, and thus was the spiritual father of the iPhone. He spent the 1960s lounging poolside in Los Angeles, dreaming of a post-scarcity tomorrow where the wise, brave men of The Federation kept the Romulans at bay and there were hot alien chicks on every Class-M planet. At the same time, the future’s real prophet, Philip K. Dick, was huddled in a dank Oakland apartment, a stone’s throw from Silicon Valley, popping amphetamines like breath mints and feverishly typing dystopian visions of corporate surveillance states and nightmare techno-realities into his Hermes Rocket typewriter.\n\nRoddenberry's Federation promised technology would help humanity evolve beyond its baser instincts. Dick saw technology amplifying our worst impulses.\n\nSo what happened? How did we go from a Roddenberry future where each new product release seemed like another step closer to collective utopia to our Dick-esque present, where the first question we ask of any new technology is “How is this going to hurt me?\"\n\nVisionary heads of start-ups like to blather about \"paradigm shifts\" and \"world-changing technology\" but people don’t get excited for tech products that are going to, say, cure cancer. Most of life (for pampered Westerners, anyway) is dealing with routine annoyances, and tech promises a way out. Remember printing MapQuest directions before leaving the house? It was a pain in the ass. People were excited for the iPhone because it solved the MapQuest problem and so many other small, intimate problems, like “I can't instantly send a photo to my friend” or “I get bored while I’m riding the bus.” Products that do this flourish, and ones that fail are discarded like a Juicero.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how great the iPhone was back in 2007 in terms of solving annoyances. Buying one meant you no longer had to carry a notepad, camera, laptop, MP3 player, GPS device, flashlight, or alarm clock. It was all crammed into a single black mirror. But speaking of black mirror ...\n\n\"We’re in an era of incremental updates, not industry-defining breakthroughs,\" says Heather Sliwinski, founder of tech public relations firm Changemaker Communications. \"Today's new iPhone offers a slightly better camera, marginally different dimensions or AI features that no one is asking for. Those aren't updates that go viral or justify consumers shelling out thousands of dollars for a device that's only slightly better than what they already own.\"\n\nIn economics, \"marginal utility\" is the additional satisfaction or benefit a consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good or service. The marginal utility leap between a flip phone and the first iPhone was huge. But economics teaches us that marginal utility diminishes with each additional unit consumed. Each new iPhone release provided progressively less additional satisfaction compared to what users already had. Slightly faster chips, slightly better cameras, USB-C instead of Lightning, titanium instead of aluminum—who cares?\n\nIf we were merely bored with tech products, it would be one thing. But increasingly, devices that were desired because we want to make our lives easier or more enjoyable are making them harder and worse.\n\n“When you buy a new tech product today, you're not just buying one physical product. You're committing to downloading another app, creating another account and managing another subscription,\" Sliwinski says. \"Consumers are exhausted by the endless management that comes with each new device.\"\n\nIn economics, you’d call that “diseconomies of scale”: what happens when a business becomes so large its bureaucracy costs outweigh efficiency gains. In personal terms, it’s when the time and energy it takes to sync, charge, and coordinate your “time-saving” device makes you the middle manager of your own life.\n\nThen there’s the kipple. In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Philip K. Dick defines “kipple” as useless objects that accumulate: ”junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers or yesterday's homeopape.” That drawer full of orphaned power cords and connectors, your broken earbuds, the extra game controllers, the Roku, Chomecast, and old Fitbit are physical kipple, but the virtual kipple is worse. “Personally, I have at least four different apps that I need to download and manage just to live in my apartment complex—smart lock system, community laundry, rent payments, maintenance requests,” Sliwinski says.\n\nAccording to Dick, kipple doesn't just accumulate; it metastasizes, growing constantly until the Star Trek lifestyle you envisioned becomes a Dick-esque swamp of dependencies, and The future goes from being a place you want to live to somewhere you’re trapped.\n\nThe door refused to open. It said, “Five cents, please.”He searched his pockets. No more coins; nothing. “I’ll pay you tomorrow,” he told the door. ― Philip K. Dick, Ubik\n\n\"Corporations have spent years trying to manufacture excitement around relatively low-importance features instead of genuinely useful developments, and consumers have learned to recognize that pattern,\" says Kaveh Vahdat, founder of RiseOpp, a Fractional CMO and SEO firm based in San Francisco.\n\nNowhere does this consumer indifference seem greater than with AI. \"Consumers are testing Sora or testing Grok and all of that, but there’s really not been a single use case or product for AI that I think consumers are excited about,\" says Sliwinski.\n\nThis will not stop tech companies. Even without excitement, artificial intelligence is everywhere in tech, from toothbrushes to baby strollers (I think PKD would have found the AI stroller darkly funny: it's self-driving, but it won't work if you put a baby in it.) \"There’s a lot of buzz around AI but we’re missing the 'so what?'\"\n\nBeyond \"so what?\" consumers have started asking \"How will this hurt me?\" \"Is AI going to encourage my child to take their own life? Is it going to steal my job? Is it destroying everything pure about humanity?\"\n\nTech companies don't seem like they're scaling back on AI or doing an effective job of explaining its benefits, and if the recent past is an indicator, if they can't make our lives easier, they'll try to imprison us instead, employing psychologists, neuroscientists, and \"growth hackers\" specifically to make products harder to put down. The innovation isn't in new products that make life easier, but in encouraging addiction through variable reward schedules, social validation metrics, parasocial relationships, and other dark arts until eventually we end up like the half-lifers in Ubik, husks in cryopods, living in a manufactured reality where we still have to pay for the doors to open. That's the PKD take, anyway.\n\n\"Maybe 10 to 20 years down the road we will have another huge step change like the iPhone that can condense all these different devices that we’re using or apps that we’re using —but the tech isn’t there yet,\" Sliwinski says.\n\nIn Star Trek, humanity doesn’t abandon scarcity. Technology eventually makes scarcity indefensible, and that's only possible after a planet-wide war. From that Roddenberry-esque perspective, enshittification is what happens when old economic systems try to survive in a world where technology keeps eroding their justification, and each tiny \"I don't care\" iteration to tech products is a small step closer to Star Trek's promised land of holodecks, abundance, and hot aliens.",

    "description": "Love it or hate it, Lego's Smart Brick has elicited strong reactions from its adult fanbase as they process the analog toymaker's embrace of tech.",
    "fullText": "Small speakers hum as two \"Star Wars\"-themed Lego lightsabers clash. Lights beam from the top of a Lego-built airplane. A roaring engine sound kicks in as multiple vehicles race across the floor.\n\nIt's all part of a high-tech — and polarizing — update from Lego called Smart Play that the toymaker unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this week in Las Vegas.\n\nLego says its new line of chip-based bricks is \"one of the most significant evolutions\" since the launch of figurines in 1978.\n\nAt the center of the system is what Lego calls a Smart Brick. It's the same size as the classic two-by-four Lego piece — a design that has remained largely unchanged since the company began producing plastic bricks in the early 1930s — but it contains sensors, lights, and a tiny speaker.\n\nThe move pushes the famously analog toy deeper into the world of embedded technology. Among adult fans of Lego — known as AFOLs — the reaction has been mixed.\n\nOnline, some longtime builders and parents have voiced concern about what they see as the growing \"tech-ification\" of toys traditionally more reliant on one's imagination.\n\nIn interviews with Business Insider, Lego purists, toy enthusiasts, and industry watchers said they're intrigued by the technology — but some worry the added electronics will push Lego's prices even higher.\n\n\"I've loved the creativity involved without Smart Bricks,\" Jake Doll, 33, a Lego enthusiast who posts to AFOL communities on TikTok, told Business Insider. \"I think they'll put more investment in tech as it can increase the overall purchase price.\"\n\nThe bricks can sense what's happening around them, including light detection, player movement, and proximity to other figurines. When multiple Smart Bricks are used together, they communicate wirelessly with one another, allowing Lego sets to react in coordinated ways.\n\nLego says the system doesn't rely on AI or a constant internet connection. The bricks charge wirelessly, don't require disposable batteries, and play pre-programmed sounds directly from built-in speakers.\n\nThe company plans to debut the technology in three \"Star Wars\"-themed sets: a $70 Darth Vader set with 473 pieces, a $100 Luke's Red Five X-Wing set with 584 pieces, and a $160 Darth Vader's Throne Room Duel & A-Wing set with 962 pieces. They will hit store shelves on March 1.\n\n\"This isn't changing direction from what the Lego brand has always been,\" Tom Donaldson, the head of Legos's Creative Play Lab, told Business Insider in a statement. \"It's an expansion — we're staying true to our brand while innovating to meet how kids play today. The Lego brick our fans know and love isn't going anywhere; we're just making our play even more magical.\"\n\nBob Friedland, 50, a toy expert and former Toys R Us executive, told Business Insider he isn't planning to buy the Lego Smart Play sets when they launch.\n\nRight now, he owns 115 sets, according to his Lego app. That includes collections themed around \"Hocus Pocus,\" \"Stranger Things,\" and van Gogh's Starry Night. In a phone interview, Friedland said he's more interested in a $28, fully analog Lego DeLorean DMC replica from \"Back to the Future.\"\n\nHe said that Lego — which launched a 9,000-piece Star Wars-themed build for $999 in September — risks alienating already inflation-strained customers with increasingly expensive sets.\n\n\"These bricks will definitely bump up against the already-existing feeling that Lego is too expensive,\" he said.\n\nSmart Play isn't Lego's first attempt to blend bricks with technology.\n\nIn 1998, the company launched Lego Mindstorms, a line of programmable robotics kits that allowed builders to create machines that responded to sensors and computer code. More recently, Lego introduced the Lego Super Mario line in 2020, which featured interactive figures that triggered sound effects when placed on certain blocks.\n\nFriedland said that much of the online concern around toy \"tech-ification\" is attributable to other companies focusing on launching AI in teddy bears and dolls.\n\nMattel, for example, has partnered with OpenAI to put AI tech in some Barbie dolls. Child development researchers have warned that AI-enabled plushies aren't meeting basic safety standards. Online chatbots have appeared on children's iPads.\n\nBut other parents said they aren't sure their Lego-loving kids are even going to be interested in the company's new tech.\n\n\"As an adult fan, my joy stems from the building process and sharing that experience with my kids,\" Reid Exley, 43, a father of two and Lego enthusiast with more than 50 sets, said. \"My kids would likely enjoy the novelty of the sounds and interactivity. However, I suspect that novelty would quickly wear off and Lego play would remain largely unchanged.\"\n\nSome fans see Lego's launch of the Smart Play system less as a distraction — and more as an intriguing puzzle with potential.\n\n\"Are dolls that cry less creative than dolls that don't? Not really,\" Friedland said. \"I can already see myself trying to figure out Easter eggs that are unlocked by placing the Smart Brick in the right place or tapping it in the right sequence while it's next to the right colored brick.\"\n\nHe also told Business Insider that the current state of childhood play needs some new tech disruption. The Lego set, in his mind, could fit that bill.\n\n\"Parents who are wary of tech will likely look at this as a better alternative than a phone or iPad,\" he said. \"I think this is a much better solution than the AI toys out there.\"",

    "fullText": "Saving for retirement has been a cornerstone of personal finance for well over a century. It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said. That would mean \"better medical care than anyone has today, available for everyone within five years,\" he continued. \"No scarcity of goods and services. You can learn anything you want about anything for free.\"\n\nHowever, the serial entrepreneur warned of a \"bumpy\" transition to this utopian world, marked by jarring change and social unrest. He also flagged a potential loss of purpose.\n\n\"Now, if you actually get all the stuff you want, is that actually the future you want?\" he asked. '\"Because it means that your job won't matter.\"\n\nMusk is known for transforming the auto sector with Tesla's electric vehicles, and revolutionizing the aerospace industry with SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nHis companies are developing self-driving cars, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces, AI assistants, and other innovations as he paves his way to becoming the first trillionaire in history.\n\nDespite his track record, Musk's latest prediction clashes hard with the reality faced by many Americans. Years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and anemic wage growth have created an affordability crisis.\n\nMillions of people feel priced out of getting a college degree, accessing quality healthcare, owning a home, or having children. A comfortable retirement also feels out of reach, with surveys showing the majority of Americans aren't saving nearly enough.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Musk's blue-sky vision of an abundant future may seem like wishful thinking — or even dangerous advice if it leads people to stop saving, but the world doesn't change as he expects, leaving them short in retirement.",

I’m Ron Minsky. It is my\ngreat pleasure to introduce Richard Eisenberg. Richard’s a senior\ncontributor to the Haskell ecosystem. He’s worked on Haskell’s type\nsystem in a lot of different ways over the last eight years. He’s on\nthe GHC Steering Committee. He’s the Chair of the Haskell\nFoundation. One might wonder, what’s he doing here? Well, it turns out\nRichard has joined Jane Street. He’s working on our Tools and\nCompilers team, and in particular, working on the team that works on\nthe front end of the OCaml compiler. So, thanks for joining me,\nRichard.\n\nSo, maybe a good place to start out with is to talk about your\nbackground. You’ve done all this exciting work in the Haskell\necosystem. Maybe tell us a little bit more about how you got involved\nin Haskell and what kind of work you’ve done there.\n\nYeah, sure. I first really encountered Haskell when I went back to\ngraduate school. I’d been a high school teacher for a little while and\nthen I thought, ‘oh, you know, it’s time to get a Ph.D. in programming\nlanguages,’ kind of, as you do.\n\nIn the process toward that, I discovered dependent types. I didn’t\nwanna just show up in grad school and not know anything. So I did some\nbackground reading and I discovered that, you know, these fancy type\nsystems have so much expressiveness, and so much of a way of being\nable to sort of define what it is that you’re programming before you\neven write a line of code, that you can just express your ideas so\nmuch more clearly and then get the compiler to check that you actually\ndid it correctly. This was just sort of, you know, my brain exploded\nwhen I learned about this.\n\nI feel like, you know, I kind of pretend to know something about\nprogramming languages on TV, but like, actually my academic background\nis distributed systems, not programming languages, and there’s lots of\ngaps in my knowledge. And so, I kinda don’t really know what dependent\ntypes are. Can you give a suitably beginner-friendly explanation of\nwhat dependent types are?\n\nSure. And I’m gonna start by avoiding the trap of trying to define the\nterm, ‘dependent type.’\n\nAnd instead, just sort of describe ‘a language with dependent types\nallows you to do this thing.’ And that thing is to essentially encode\na proof of correctness into your program such that every time you\ncompile your program, that proof is checked. And so you know—if you’ve\nset things up the right way—that your program does what you think it\ndoes. And so, I’ll give a concrete example.\n\nAnd that is, to imagine a sorting function. So normally we think of a\nsorting function, let’s just say, it’s a function from a list of\n‘ints’ to a list of ints, right? It takes this list of ints’ input,\nand then does some transformation, and then produces a list. But\nactually, that’s a very loose description of a sorting function. We\ncan do better than that.\n\nI wanna say that a sorting function takes in a list of ints, and it\nproduces a list of ints in, I’m gonna say, non-descending order\n(because maybe there’s duplicates, so I don’t want to say ‘ascending\norder’ because someone out there might say that’s wrong). So we get\nthis list out that’s in non-descending order. Okay, that’s closer, but\nthat’s still not quite right because maybe my function just always\nreturned to the empty list. That’s a list in non-descending order.\n\nSo instead, I really want to say that it’s a function that takes in a\nlist of ints, and returns a result that is in non-descending order,\nand is a permutation of the input list. And that’s a rather glorious\ntype that I can assign to a sorting function. But it accurately\ndescribes what that sorting function does.\n\nAnd then I can implement that in any number of ways, using any of the\ncommon sorting algorithms that you learn in computer science, and any\nof those different algorithms will meet that specification, and then,\nif I’ve encoded this, my compiler will check that my algorithm\nactually does sorting and doesn’t do some other thing. And so now,\nhaving sort of explained that, I can return back and actually say what\nI mean by ‘dependent type.’\n\nA dependent type is a type that can depend on some input that you give\ninto a function, essentially. So, in this case, the output of the\nfunction, not just a list of ints, but the output depends on the\ninput. The output must be a permutation of the input. And so, that’s\nthe dependent type.\n\nSo when I started grad school, then I saw Haskell, and here was a\nlanguage that had this fancy type system and had all this\nexpressiveness. Didn’t quite have dependent types, but it had a lot of\nthat stuff. That just got me excited. And then, through that I started\nworking with Stephanie Weirich at University of Pennsylvania. She was\ndoing a lot of Haskell work. She collaborated a bunch with Simon\nPeyton Jones, who then I started collaborating with, and things just\nsort of took off from there. It was a pretty fast introduction into\nthat world.\n\nI wanna go a little deeper on that. I feel like we’ve started with\nthe, like, ‘Well, of course I got a Ph.D. in PL and was interested in\ndependent types.’ Like, how do you even get there? Where does your\ninterest and background in programming languages come [from] in the\nfirst place?\n\nSo, once upon a time, I wanted to program. I don’t know why I wanted\nto program. I was too little to have that level of introspection.\n\nSo I guess, uh, I learned Basic when I was, I think, five\nsomehow. There was a friend of my parents that decided I should learn\nBasic and so that happened.\n\nBut I then got more into it, I guess, when I was in 7th grade, so this\nwas, probably I was 12 years old. And someone told me that Pascal was\na good language to learn. So, you know, I pleaded with my parents and\neventually they bought me the Pascal compiler ‘cause back in those\ndays, you actually had to pay for compilers. At least on, sort of—we\nhad a Macintosh. If I had some kind of Unix system, maybe it would’ve\nbeen different.\n\nWell, which Pascal compiler did you use?\n\nUm, THINK Pascal? Was that a thing?\n\nTHINK Pascal, so not Borland. I guess Borland was \nDOS side of the world.\n\nYeah, yeah. Borland, yes, Borland was for like, ‘real programmers.’\n\nSo I got this, and somewhere along the way, I had decided that every\npiece of software should be, like, if you read the instruction manual,\nthat should tell you everything you need to know about that piece of\nsoftware. I don’t know why I assumed that, but that was my starting\npoint. And so, it came with these two big books and most of the books\nwere just like on compiler flags and setting up projects and none of\nthis stuff about programming. At the end of one of the books was a\nsyntax reference with no glosses, no further information, just a\nsyntax reference using those, sort of, block and line diagrams to\nrepresent recursive loops in the syntax. And I was like, ‘Okay, well,\nif my assumption is that this book defines how to program, and this is\nthe only thing it has, then all the information must be here.’\n\nSo I just stared at these syntax diagrams probably for hours and\nhours. Like, ‘Okay, what does all of this mean?’ And then eventually\nsort of bootstrapped my way into learning how to program Pascal. And\nso, that being my first ‘real programming experience,’ somehow that\nbuilt the structures in my brain just around syntax and languages, and\nit kind of went from there.\n\nAnd then fast-forward 10 years or so, and I took a PL course as an\nundergrad from Norman Ramsey and it just lit me up. It was just like,\nthis is really cool stuff. I really enjoy this kind of thinking. And\nit turned out, I took that at the end of my senior year of undergrad,\nand so it was sort of too late to immediately go into grad school at\nthat point and I had this whole machine going toward high school\nteaching. So I did that for a while, but then I ended up returning.\n\nI love that your entrée into programming was, roughly speaking, a\ntraumatic experience with syntax. That seems… (laughs)\n\nBut it wasn’t traumatic. It was fantastic. Somehow, this was just what\nI needed. This was what my 12-year-old-self needed: big syntax blocks.\n\n(laughs) Okay. So, you went off, you got your Ph.D., you started\nworking on Haskell. Where did it go from there?\n\nWell, I was working on my Ph.D. It was basically, Stephanie and I had\nthis idea about how to encode dependent types, but it required some\nmore support from the Haskell compiler. And so, I was pleading [with]\nthe Haskell people to create this for me. And then, eventually Simon\njust wrote and said, ‘Why don’t you just do it?’ And that was a new\nconcept for me. I was like, ‘I could influence this language? Well,\nyou know, I’m just this random person.’\n\nBut between Stephanie and Simon mentoring me, I got to a point where I\ncould contribute and then it just grew from there. So, [I] did a bunch\nof that as a Ph.D. student. Then after leaving my Ph.D., I was a\nprofessor for a few years at Bryn Mawr College. What was great about\nthat experience was, they were open to the idea that open source\ncontributions were a form of publication, right? A lot of professors\nhave a lot of pressure to keep producing papers. That was definitely\nthere for me, too. But alongside papers, I couldn’t just do\nsoftware. But I could do, sort of, traditional scholarly publications\nand software. So that gave me a chance to continue my implementation\nwork, remain a part of this open source community, while still doing\nthe high-level scholarly research that I had been doing. So that was a\nreally nice part of it.\n\nIt turned out that, to my great surprise, that—well, this wasn’t to my\ngreat surprise—it turned out that this was a lot of work. That\nmaintaining a research program with a bunch of papers every year, and\ndoing these open source contributions, and teaching, there was just\nmore than could comfortably fit into one job, especially during term\ntime. And to my own surprise, I realized that the teaching part was\nthe part that maybe I could pause on. I had done that full-time as a\nhigh school teacher for eight years, now I was back doing it. It was\nfun, but I thought it was time to sort of push in a slightly different\ndirection.\n\nSo after a couple years at Bryn Mawr, I left to join Tweed which is a\nsoftware consultancy based in Paris. They do a ton of Haskell\nwork. And they hired me, basically just to continue my contributions\nin the Haskell space. So, I continued doing research there, continued\ncontributing to the compiler there. And, you know, after a few years\nof that, that was fun, and I got to a point where I was looking to be\npart of a cohesive team all working together, and realizing that after\nso many years just working in one language, I was really ready to see\nwhat things were like in a different space. And so the timing worked\nout really well when you, Ron, reached out to me and started the\ndiscussions that led to me joining Jane Street.\n\nRight. And often in these interviews, I’ll ask someone, like, ‘so how\ndid you get here?’ But actually, I was part of the dramatis personae\nof how you actually arrived.\n\nYou were the—the dramatis personae, yeah. (laughs)\n\n(laughs) Right, which is, at some point, I was like, ‘oh, it would be\nreally good if Richard worked here,’ and I started reaching out and\ntrying to convince you to come. Which took, it’s important, I\ncalculated, 11 months from (laughs) when I started.\n\nYeah, yeah. That’s right. I mean, you know, of course the story [of]\nme coming to Jane Street starts with you asking me, and me saying\n‘No.’\n\nAnd again, it was a matter of timing. I’ve been aware of Jane Street\nfor a long time, been sort of wondering what was happening over there,\nand somehow when you first reached out, it just wasn’t the right time\nfor me yet. And then the second time, it was sort of a better time. I\ncouldn’t even tell you why. It’s just, this is the way that life\nflows.\n\nBut, you know, one of the barriers which we’ve joked about is that I\ngrew up in the New York area and actually ended up going to high\nschool in New York and commuting from New Jersey. So every day I was\ngoing back and forth across the George Washington Bridge, and swore to\nmyself then that I would never commute to and from New York City. And\nalso just sort of had this negative vibe from the financial industry,\nand I was just like, ‘I don’t know. Like, I want to be creating\nsomething that other people use,’ right?\n\nBut actually, this is fantastic. I’m having great fun. Part of it is\nthat I’m working as part of this larger ecosystem. It’s not just a\nclosed thing where I’m only doing stuff that’s internal to Jane\nStreet. But instead, contributing to this open source ecosystem,\nworking on an open language, OCaml, and really continuing some of\nthese research trends that I started 10 years ago. Now that I’m here,\nit just all fits very naturally together.\n\nI feel like, in general, one of my takeaways is that there’s lots of\ninteresting work in lots of different places and the preconceptions\nyou have when you are young often (laughs) don’t work out over\ntime. So a thing you talked about earlier is a topic that I feel like\nI should know something about, but don’t. I like your first high-level\ndescription ‘cause it actually lines up with the very little bit I\nknow about dependent types.\n\nAnd there’s also something that’s always made me a little nervous\nabout them because a basic fact about proofs is—proofs seem pretty\nhard to construct. People go to great trouble to build automated\nproving systems where you have tactic libraries, like, little tiny\nprograms that you can run to, like, ‘try this way or try that way’ of\ncoming up with a proof of a thing. And it all sounds really hard and\nwhen you talk to people who do kind of theorem proving on large scale\nsoftware systems, it sounds like a pretty challenging operation where\nthis is kind of a lot of engineering work that just goes into just\nconstructing the proof. So I’m curious how you think of the\npracticalities of that? Like, how convenient can you make it? And if\nyou make it a deeply embedded part of the programming process, does\nthat work well with the other things you might wanna do? Does it\ninterfere with the ordinary process of programming? How do you see the\npragmatics of that working out?\n\nYeah, that’s a great question. And this is a question that doesn’t\nhave an answer yet. This is, I think, still something that the\nprogramming languages community is grappling with. I have my own\ntakes, but this is still sort of an open question out there.\n\nI think, first of all, that for a programming language to be\neffective, everything needs to be opt-in, right? If you have a\nlanguage that supports dependent types—and there’s a bunch out\nthere. So actually, OCaml’s module system is a dependent type\nsystem. It’s missing one or two key features that makes it really sort\nof go. But that definitely has aspects of dependent types in\nit. Haskell has aspects of dependent types.\n\nThere are other languages, Coq, Agda, Idris, Lean, these are the ones\nthat really have embraced dependent types. But in any of these\nlanguages, you don’t have to use these dependent types. You can just\nwrite a sorting function that is described as ‘a list of ints to a\nlist of ints.’ That’s fine. And I think that’s a key aspect of any\nkind of system that’s gonna be using this dependent types feature,\nbecause not everyone wants to prove everything all the time. As you\nsay, proofs are expensive. And so, what you need is, you need the\nability to only prove the parts that you think are worthwhile proving.\n\nSo let’s say we have an important part of the system that might be\neasy to get wrong that we want to prove something about. How do we do\nthat? Is that still worth it? And one thing to think about is, what’s\nyour cost-benefit analysis, right? If you do this proving, can you\nspend less time on testing? Can you spend less time on debugging? Can\nyou spend less time on catastrophic failure because you missed\nsomething when debugging?\n\nIt is a lot harder to do these programs with proofs. But sometimes,\nthat’s really worth it. It’s a matter of applying good taste, like it\nis everywhere in programming, right? Any programming language gives\nyou a ton of tools to work with, and it takes time and experience and\ntaste to figure out when it’s time to use which tools.\n\nRight. And I do really like that, kind of, pay-as-you-go kind of\nattitude of, like, you want some kind of base language that’s\nrelatively simple to work with, and then the ability to add on more\nfeatures that give you more power of various kinds, and not be forced\nto pay for that complexity constantly in everything you do. Which is,\nI think, actually a really hard thing to get right in the design—of\nlike, not having these more powerful features leak in and corrupt the\nrest of your experience within the language.\n\nThat’s right. It’s a very careful thing. And my push in Haskell has\nbeen to try to increase or add new features to help support dependent\ntypes, and there’s been a large community of people really excited for\nthis. And in my measurement, my biased measurement, a smaller\ncommunity of people who have been saying, ‘No, no, no. Don’t do this\nbecause it’s gonna make it impossible to write simple programs.’ And\nmany, many, many times, I’ve had to reassure people, ‘No, no. All\nthose simple programs will continue to exist, they’ll continue to\nwork. You can do what you want.’ But I also wanna give power to people\nwho want to use the fancy dependent types.\n\nGreat. Okay. So let’s leave Haskell and dependent types behind for the\nmoment because that’s not primarily what you’re working on here. Maybe\nyou can tell us, what are you working on here? Like, what is the\nmission that you are on here, working on OCaml?\n\nSo, I’ll start more broadly and then I’ll get narrower. My broad\nmission is my belief that type systems are a fantastic way to\nstructure thought and structure programs. So by being able to write\ndown what you intend to do before doing it, then you can check what\nyou’ve done, and you can also help formulate your thoughts. And when I\nsay, ‘write down what you intend to do before doing it,’ I mean, write\ndown a specification in types.\n\nThe flip side of that, is that it must be the case that you can do\nthat without paying a one-time cost. It’s gonna be problematic if you\nwant to write an efficient program, and yet, by defining your program\ncarefully ahead of time, now it’s no longer as efficient at\nruntime. This checking and this writing of a specification should all\nhappen at compile time. This should be happening in front of the\nprogrammer and not in front of any users. If any of those details leak\ninto user land by slowing your program down or somehow interfering\nwith the operation of your program, then there’s a misdesign in the\nlanguage.\n\nSo coming down to what I’m actually working on here at Jane Street, so\nthe feature I’m working on is something called unboxed types. There’s\nvarious different ways of characterizing it, but one way to do so is,\nit allows inlining of type definitions. So what we might want to have\nin our design is to have a structure that has four fields that\ndescribe some aspects of a trade. And then maybe we store that\nstructure in some larger structure, and maybe that’s stored in some\nlarger structure.\n\nWell, if you do that the naïve way in OCaml, every time you store one\nstructure inside of another, it’s stored by a pointer. And it means\nnow when I wanna access the price of this trade that’s all the way\ndown (it’s a nested structure) I have to follow this pointer, then\nthat pointer, then that pointer, then that pointer, each time I have a\ncache miss, each time I have to load into memory. This is really bad.\n\nRight. And this highlights a kind of basic fact about OCaml, that it\nhas a very fancy, at least on the scale of modern language that people\nmight use, a very fancy type system and a brutally simple memory\nrepresentation. OCaml’s internal implementation might have been like a\nScheme or Lisp written in the mid-‘60s or something, which is to say,\neverything looks like either some immediate value, it’s no bigger than\na word that fits in a register, or a heap-allocated value, which is\nlike one header word and then one full word for every slot inside of\nit, and we have all the fancy, like, type goo on top of it that you\nwant, but all of the physical representation looks just like that.\n\nExactly. Exactly. It means that we’re building this beautiful type\ndiscipline in our software to try to avoid errors, and try to express\nourselves, and try to communicate more clearly among developers—and\nwe’re paying for that at runtime! This is ridiculous. To me, every\ntime a type system feature slows down your program or otherwise\ninterferes is just a misdesign. And so, the fact that this is our\ncurrent state of play is problematic. The task I’m working on is\ncoming up with a new design for OCaml’s type system, or this aspect of\nOCaml’s type system, that allows us to have this rich type structure\nwithout paying for it at runtime.\n\nThat’s right. Although it’s not that you can pick a type structure\nthat’s kind of oblivious to the performance details, right? In some\nsense it’s the opposite. The idea of the unboxed type work and a lot\nof the work that we’re doing now is really about taking design\ndecisions that have to do with performance and making them explicit at\nthe level of types.\n\nYes, that’s right. Because you can’t, I mean, in the end, we need to\nexecute this somehow. There needs to be an execution model. And so, if\nwe try to ignore all of these execution details in the type system,\nthen there’s not gonna be a way of making it fast. And so, the work\nis, in some sense, taking some of these execution-oriented details,\nmaking them manifest in the type system, getting programmers the\nability to write types that take these into account, so that we can\nthen execute fast.\n\nRight. In some sense, I think of this as really being about enabling\nperformance engineering, right? There’s kind of two different lines of\npeople thinking about how to optimize programs via compilers. One is,\nyou make your compiler smarter so it can do more and optimize things\nfor you. So the user can write kind of an ordinary program that just\nreflects, ‘what do they want to achieve and what’s the logical\nstructure,’ and then the compiler will, like, do something good. And\nthen, the other direction is trying to give a lot of precise\nunderstanding to the programmer so they can know exactly what they’re\ndoing and they can optimize their program. And these are both\nimportant.\n\nBut, like, in some sense the scale of optimizations are very\ndifferent. Like, if you come up with a way of making your compiler\nfaster that, like, takes most user programs and makes them 20% faster,\nthat’s an enormous win. Like, that’s a shockingly good\noutcome. Whereas, if you give people good performance engineering\ntools, the idea that they can think hard about a particular program\nand make it five, or 10, or 100 times faster is like, in some sense,\ntotally normal. And so, there’s a kind of extra power of giving\nindividuals the ability to optimize. It obviously misses out on scope\nand there’s something great about being able to go and in one swell\nfoop (laughs) make 20 different, or 100 different, or all the\ndifferent programs faster. But you can’t get the same kind of order of\nmagnitude of improvements that you can get from giving one programmer\nthe ability to really carefully engineer their system.\n\nWell, there’s a real tension because what in the end we’re doing in\nprogramming languages is, we’re trying to find a way for humans to\ncommunicate precisely to computers. And we have at our disposal our\ntool, one of our tools is the fact that this is happening on a\ncomputer. So we can write computer programs to try to sort of help\ncover this distance, right?\n\nIn the early days, humans were just completely at a disadvantage and\nthe humans wrote in assembly code. And this was kind of terrible. And\nwe’ve come some way since then, and so now instead of writing sort of\ninstruction-by-instruction that’s gonna be executed by the processor,\nwe can write in a high-level language and have a compiler translate\nthat high-level language to something that the computer can\nexecute. Hopefully along the way, it can actually make that\nfaster. But sometimes, we’ve gotten ourselves sort of too\nhigh-level. If we abstract away too many of the details of execution,\nit’s exactly as you were saying. It means that the programmer can no\nlonger do the performance engineering. And so, we need to expose just\nenough to the programmer so that now there’s some more details that\nthey can think about. Now they can do that performance engineering.\n\nBut still, I think the burden sits on the compiler to take those few\nhints that the programmer gives to make blazingly fast code come out\nthe other end. And it’s just really about this interplay between how\nmany details do we wanna expose? Certainly not all the details because\nthat’s too hard for the programmer. But we need to expose some. And\nso, it’s about, over time, programming languages developing more and\nmore features that sort of figure out the right line and the right\nbalance between this desire for high-level languages, closer to human\nthought, and low-level details, easier to execute.\n\nSo, before when we were talking about dependent types, we were talking\nabout how it’s important to have this kind of pay-as-you-go\nphenomenon, like, it gets harder as you try and get more power. It\nfeels like the same kind of thing shows up here.\n\nSo, when you try and get more control over the shape of data in the\nway that you described, what are the trade-offs? And how do you think\nabout designing the language in such a way that you don’t have\nwhatever extra complexity is there infect everything that you do?\n\nWell, we have to be really careful. So, with unboxed types, one of the\nchallenges is gonna be that unboxed types interfere with\npolymorphism. So, in a language like OCaml, you can write a function,\nsay, that computes the length of a list. And that’s gonna work over a\nlist, no matter what the list contains. And so the way that we say\nthat, is that in the type of the length function, there’s a type\nvariable. We say that it’s an ‘alpha list’ where alpha can stand for\nany type that you might wanna put in there. Once we introduce unboxed\ntypes, that no longer works out. Some of these types won’t be suitable\nreplacements for alpha. And so it means that, by having these unboxed\ntypes in the system, now this really powerful feature of polymorphism\nbecomes constrained. And so, algorithms that people are used to being\nable to use everywhere, no longer work so well.\n\nSo one of the challenges that we have is, how can we recover that? How\ncan we still keep this nice feature of polymorphism and without having\nunboxed types interfere? And so, one of the things that we’re thinking\nabout doing is some amount of essentially what could become runtime\ncode generation. It comes down to building experience with the\nfeature. As we start understanding this language feature better, we’re\ngoing to create programs using these unboxed types, recognize areas in\nwhich the current programming paradigms that we engage in no longer\nwork, and then figure out ways around them. It’s this give and take as\nwe’re doing the language design.\n\nAnd just to focus in on this code generation thing for a second, the\nbasic issue here is that the way you make in OCaml today, separate\ncompilation of work, and make the ability to write a function in one\nplace and use it polymorphically on lots of different types is, again,\nyou’re just kind of taking advantage of this rock stupid memory\nrepresentation. Like, what’s a list? A list is a collection of\nheap-allocated values, every one has, like, two slots. One is a place\nto put the data and the other is a place to have a pointer to the next\nthing on the list. And when you iterate over it, that thing always has\nthe same shape, it always has the same number of bytes, and so you\ncould just write one piece of code that kind of uniformly walks over\nit. And what happens in the unboxed types world is, suddenly you want\nthe system to contemplate multiple different possible shapes of the\ndata. And so, kind of at a mechanical level, you need different\nmachine instructions in order to do the walking of the data structure,\ndepending on what that structure is.\n\nAnd so, that’s how you might end up with wanting code generations. The\nway to kind of claw back the polymorphism is to generate the\ncode. Maybe you can generate the extra code at compile time, maybe you\nhave to generate the extra code at runtime. But you somehow now have\nto generate code for multiple different scenarios that essentially\nrepresent different physical shapes of the data.\n\nExactly. And right now, our best thought is that this will happen at\ncompile time, that we’ll be able to figure out what code we need to\ngenerate at compile time. That will prevent a few programming idioms\nthat someone might potentially want. I don’t think anyone will ever\nwant those (laughs) idioms in practice so I think we’ll be able to get\naway with it. But it does mean we’re thinking carefully about this\ndesign and it’s a hard thing. I’m not aware of another language that’s\nreally tackled the problem in the way that we expect to tackle it over\nthe next few months.\n\nSo another language I think is interesting to compare to, in all of\nthis, is Rust.\n\nSo Rust is a language which tries really hard to do two things at the\nsame time which are not trivial to do at the same time. One is to give\nstronger sense of type safety so that you can write programs that\nyou’re confident aren’t going to crash, so you get lots of protection\nfrom bugs from the type system. And also give the user a lot of\ncontrol over low-level details over how memory is managed. And we’re\nessentially trying to push OCaml in some sense at that high level of\ndescription in the same direction.\n\nHow do you think the Rust approach differs from the approach you see\nus trying to take with OCaml?\n\nThis is a good comparison. This takes us a little bit away from\nunboxed types and polymorphism because I think the way that that\nappears in Rust is quite different. But the notion of this sort of\nfiner level of control is definitely accurate. But Rust gives up\nsomething really big to do what they do. They give up garbage\ncollection. Within Jane Street and generally in programming, I think a\nlot of the time garbage collection is fantastic, right? It allows us\nto program without worrying about these low-level details that for\nmost programs, we don’t need to.\n\nSo, for instance, when I’m writing the OCaml compiler—which is written\nin OCaml, of course—I do want it to be performant, but I don’t really\ncare about microsecond latency. And so, I’m happy to write my compiler\nin a way that allocates a bunch of memory and then when it’s done with\nthat memory, the garbage collector comes and gets rid of it. This is\nreally, really convenient. In Rust, we don’t have that. In Rust, we\nare forced to think about memory, allocation, and deallocation at\nevery point in time. And this gives us this fine level of control, but\nit comes at a real cost, and it means now we’re sort of fighting\nagainst this ‘pay-as-you-go principle’ that we were talking about\nearlier. In Rust, for memory, you don’t pay as you go. Everyone has to\npay all the time for Rust fine memory control. So we wanna keep the\nhigh-level, garbage-collected OCaml for most applications, and then\nwhen we really want to have this fine level of control, we wanna have\nthat, too.\n\nAnd so, some of the work that we’re doing is around adding that finer\nlevel of control, but just where we need it.\n\nSo, one thing I wonder is whether this pay-as-you-go principle really\napplies in general or whether it’s like itself a kind of trade-off? I\nthink, if you’d asked the question of like, ‘well we should think of\ntypes in general as pay-as-you-go.’ Maybe your baseline should be by\ndefault untyped, and then when you want some extra control, you should\nadd types to it and lock it down more.\n\nThat seems in principle reasonable. But all the languages that I’ve\ndealt with that have pay-as-you-go types or what you might call\ngradual type systems, actually inherit quite a lot of complexity and\nproblems from that choice. It’s often simpler and better, at least for\nsome kinds of problems, to have a uniform approach where you sort of\nfigure out what trade-offs you wanna do and you kind of apply those\ntrade-offs uniformly. And I think, at least from my perspective, the\nbase choice you make in a language like Haskell or OCaml of like,\n‘actually, even though it has some ups and downs, we’re just going to\nhave types everywhere and that’s just how it’s gonna be,’ I think is\nat least a reasonable place in the trade off space of designs.\n\nAnd I wonder if the same is true about this kind of thing about\npay-as-you-go control? Whereas, I can imagine for some kinds of\napplications, you would want the property that, ‘yeah, I am explicit\nabout memory everywhere. I kind of have a hard guarantee that anywhere\nI look I have all of this extra information.’ I don’t know. How do you\nthink about this question of where pay-as-you-go is the right way or\nthe wrong way to think about designing something?\n\nI think that’s a great question and I agree. I mean, pay-as-you-go\ntypes, people have wanted that for some time. It hasn’t ever really\nhappened. And, I mean, you could almost say that C++ and C have\npay-as-you-go types and that they have type systems, but the type\nsystems are sort of completely broken.\n\n(laughs) Pay-as-you-go but then what do you get? I like that.\n\nWell, right, but, I mean, just to clarify for our listeners. What I\nmean by ‘completely broken’ is that at any point in time in C and C++\nyou can just say, ‘Oh, ignore the type system. And I’m gonna just take\nthis thing and change its type to be something else.’ And the\nlanguages, you know, they take this stance of, trust the programmer,\nthat when the programmer decides to do this, that this is a good\nidea. But we lose the guarantees that one would want from a type\nsystem like that when you dereference a pointer that there’s actually\nsomething there when you dereference it.\n\nSo, getting back to memory control, I like the idea of pay-as-you-go\nthere, or maybe it’s not even pay-as-you-go as much as a language that\ncan have multiple different modes of use with very easy interop. In\nthat we can have a system where there’s not fine memory management,\nthat you just sort of use the current OCaml’s system of uniform memory\nrepresentation, and then another part where maybe this particular team\nor this particular file says, ‘No, no. Here I really want careful\nmemory management.’ This is a different kind of pay-as-you-go. It’s\nsort of at the file level or something like that, or the package\nlevel, I suppose. And then as long as one piece of code can easily\ncall the other, that also works well.\n\nWe also see this kind of idea coming out in polyglot systems where we\nactually have multiple languages all calling one another because maybe\nthis part of the system is easier to write in some language, that part\nof the system is easier to write in some other language. It’s all a\nway of, these sort of different approaches to attack the same problem\nthat we don’t wanna have all of this complexity. We want to sort of\nnarrow down what complexity we have, where.\n\nRight. So there’s almost a notion of different dialects within the\nsame language?\n\nWith a really high quality FFI that really captures all of the\nimportant details so you can kind of interoperate, right? In fact, the\nwork of polyglot stories are actually really challenging to\nengineers. There’s like, a ton—\n\n… of hard work. I mean, we’ve done a bunch of work trying to get the\nPython-OCaml interop story working just right. We’ve made good\nprogress there but it’s actually quite challenging. And I feel like\nthe work is quadratic in the number of different (laughs) languages\nthat you need to hook together ‘cause it’s often unique, weird issues\nthat come with every pairing of things that you wanna make all one to\nthe other.\n\nI think that’s right. And that’s one of the appeals of having one\nlanguage that maybe is flexible enough to operate in multiple\ndifferent modes. So, in particular, in our design for unboxed types,\nwe are planning to make a box operation explicit. And the box\noperation is going to be ‘the spot’ that allocates memory. And so,\nnormally, you’ll be able to get uses of this box operation for\nfree. Programmers won’t ever notice it, they won’t write it. It just,\nall the existing code will have all the boxes inserted. But it would\nbe really easy to imagine some kind of compiler setting that turns\nthat feature off. Meaning that every time you wanna allocate memory,\nyou have to explicitly ask for it.\n\nSo this doesn’t bring you all the way to Rust, in that there’s still a\ngarbage collector operating, you still don’t have to manually\ndeallocate memory. But if I wanna write a program that absolutely,\nwhere every allocation is known, we haven’t designed this out. Maybe\nwe’re gonna go there, maybe we’re not gonna go there. Nothing is for\ncertain. But it turned out that in our design, it just naturally fell\nout that we could just add this compiler flag that just turns off\nboxing and it would be super easy to implement and we could experiment\nto see how easy it is to work with.\n\nSo, here we’re talking about a lot of very ambitious changes to\nOCaml. One uncomfortable fact about all of this is, like, we don’t own\nOCaml, we are not the (laughs) primary upstream developers. Every time\nwe wanna make a change to OCaml, there’s a bunch of people who we have\nto convince that it’s a good change. So one of the things that you’re\nthinking about in particular is, the kind of relationship of the work\nthat we’re doing here and our connection to the larger OCaml\ncommunity. Say a little bit more about how you think about this whole\nprocess.\n\nSo, I wanna start by pushing back against ‘unfortunate fact.’ I don’t\nsee that as an unfortunate fact at all. So OCaml was born as a\nresearch project out of Inria in France and still is there. That’s\nsort of its beating heart. And we are really significant benefactors\nof that work that others have done, that others continue to do. And\nso, Jane Street has chosen to work in part of this open source\nlanguage community where we’re taking others’ ideas and we’re\ncontributing our ideas back.\n\nSo in this podcast and in our work, we have these grand ideas. ‘Oh,\nwe’re gonna add this to OCaml. We’re gonna do this, we’re gonna do\nthat. Of course, what I really mean is, we’re going to experiment with\nthis idea internally. And then as that experiment unfolds, as we gain\nexperience and become more sure that it’s a right—I shouldn’t say a\nright idea. There’s many right ideas. But as we gain more confidence\nin a particular design, we can then work with the rest of the OCaml\ncommunity to try to make this part of everyone’s OCaml and not just\nJane Street’s.\n\nAnd in that way, we’re giving back to that community. At the same\ntime, we’re continuing to reap rewards from other work happening in\nthat community. So the biggest example of which is the multicore\nsupport that’s coming in OCaml 5. Still gonna be some time before Jane\nStreet’s ready to upgrade to OCaml 5. But that was a huge pile of work\ndone mostly outside, or maybe entirely outside of Jane Street’s walls,\nand we benefit by being part of this open source ecosystem. And so, I\nthink that this is a really great place to be where we’re\nparticipating, we’re getting new input of technical content, like\nmulticore OCaml, as well as design ideas. And I’m even thinking of\nsomething just a few weeks ago where I found an infelicity in the\ncompiler, made an improvement, pushed that upstream, and then we got\nfresh ideas from folks outside of Jane Street’s walls about, ‘Here’s\nactually an even better way to do it,’ and that was great. And then we\ncould incorporate that here. Without being part of this open source\necosystem, we wouldn’t have gotten that insight and we would be poorer\nfor it.\n\nSo, in the Haskell world, you spent a lot of time working on exciting\nnew type system features for Haskell and now you’re doing, in\nsubstance, similar kinds of work here. But I think that work flow is\npretty different, right? I think then, in the Haskell world, it was\nlike the primary work and ideation and evaluation was all deeply\nintegrated from the beginning in the open source world. And here,\nwe’re doing this work where we’re still open source, still, you know,\nyou can go look at the results on GitHub. But we are mostly iterating\ninternally, and then, over time, as we gain experience, as we gain\nmore confidence that the things we’ve built are good ideas, working to\nsee what subsets of these we can get upstreamed. I’m curious how that\nhas changed your feeling about the work, how it changes the texture of\nthe work that you do?\n\nSo working within the context of Jane Street gives us a lot more\nopportunity for experimentation. So a real big challenge of doing\nlanguage design is that, by necessity, you come up with an idea and\nmaybe you think it’s a good idea and you experiment with it on a few\nsmall programs on your own machine or you get your friend to sort of\nexperiment. You bounce the idea. Maybe, you know, you’re even\nproactive and you convene a committee of experts on this idea and now\nyou have, you know, five people thinking really hard about this one\nidea and trying to come up with the absolute best design.\n\nBut then, once you come up with the design, if you’re just in an open\nsource environment—without the context of a place like Jane Street—you\ndevelop the idea, implement it, and release it, and then now you have\nthousands or hundreds of thousands of programmers using it, and maybe\nit was a bad idea. But by the time you discover that it was a bad\nidea, it’s a little bit too late because maybe you have 90,000\nprogrammers who think it’s a bad idea, but you have a thousand who\nthink it’s a fantastic idea and will be very, very, very upset if you\nbreak their programs by changing it. And now you’re in a bad way.\n\nAnd even the people who think it’s a bad idea, who would like to get\nrid of it, don’t necessarily want you to break their programs in the\ninterim before they’ve (laughs) stopped relying on the feature.\n\nThat’s right. And so, it’s really, really hard to make changes to a\nproper open source programming language. In the context of Jane Street\non the other hand, it’s—I don’t wanna say dead easy. There’s work\ninvolved, but it is tractable and somewhat easy in that we can develop\nan idea, push it out there, get other programmers in the firm to start\nusing it, and then as that happens, we can say, ‘Mm. This isn’t quite\nworking out the way that we thought it would.’ That, you know, theory\nmeets reality, and theory loses.\n\nAnd so, then we can make a change to the feature and we have sort of\nan operation that we use internally called a ‘tree smash,’ where some\nJane Street engineers work together to come up with a big diff that\nhappens to all of Jane Street’s code, all at once, and we can change\nthe spelling of a keyword if we want to. And in fact, we’re imagining\nthis now. So Jane Street has been working on a feature called ‘local\ntypes’ or ‘stack allocation.’ These two things are kind of the same\nthing. And we’re realizing that one aspect of the design was just a\nbit wrong. And there’s already a ton of code written using the old\ndesign, but we’ve invented a new keyword and a new place for the\nkeyword to appear, and all this stuff.\n\nAnd so, it’s gonna be some work to fix it, but there’s no part of us\nthat’s saying, ‘Oh no. Now we need to think about a migration plan and\nwe need to make sure that no one is too unhappy with this.’ We’re just\ngonna go do it. And so, it means by the time we get to upstreaming,\neverything is battle-tested. And so, it just increases the level of\nconfidence in the design when we go through that process.\n\nOne of the concerns I could see people having about this kind of\nprocess is, it’s going to do a lot of training on, ‘What are the\nrequirements within Jane Street?’ But there are all sorts of ways in\nwhich you could imagine the requirements in Jane Street and outside of\nJane Street being different. I’m curious how you think about the\ndesign process in a way where you end up with language features that\nare likely to be of quite general utility, ‘cause I think, in the end,\nthe only ones you’re gonna get accepted upstream are the ones that\npeople think are more broadly useful than just being useful for us.\n\nSo that’s indeed a challenge, right? It’s a challenge of overfitting,\nright? We have a very particular style of code within Jane Street and\na very particular use case that we’re working on. I think that is sort\nof a harder question to answer in some sense. I think one way that we\naddress that is by seeking outside feedback from the very\nbeginning. So, the plan that we have for unboxed types, another Jane\nStreet engineer, Stephen Dolan, he made a presentation about this\ndesign for unboxed types, I think in 2019. We’ve been thinking about\nthis for a long time. The local types and stack allocation feature,\nthis has also been featured in a number of presentations that we’ve\nmade to the OCaml community, out in public.\n\nAnd so, by incorporating that process early, we can get broad\nfeedback. That’s not the kind of feedback that tells us, ‘Oh, should\nthe keyword go here, or should it go there?’ Right? That’s the kind of\nthing that we develop internally. But I think that, by giving these\npresentations, by involving the broader community, even from the very\nbeginning, that helps to prevent some of this overfitting problem.\n\nSo, another interesting aspect of your background is, you’ve spent a\nlot of time, years really, working in the Haskell community and\nworking on Haskell. And now, you’re working on a totally new\nprogramming language using it both as the surface language in which\nyou write your programs, and also helping to design that language. I’m\ncurious, what struck you about difference? I’m curious, what are the\ndifferences that have struck you about Haskell and OCaml at multiple\ndifferent levels?\n\nIt’s been really fun over the past, I guess, six months now being part\nof these two language communities. So, I should say, I’m still quite\nactive in the Haskell world. I have not left the Haskell world. I’m\nliving both Haskell and OCaml on a daily basis. So let me think of a\ncouple of interesting points of comparison.\n\nSo, one is, it seems kind of simple, but actually I think it affects\nthe way that we program. The approach toward interfaces. In Haskell,\nyou tend to write your type signatures sort of right next to the\nfunction and Haskell uses a lot of type signatures. OCaml doesn’t so\nmuch. And so, OCaml there’s these separate interface files where you\ndefine the interface to your whole module, but it’s kind of apart and\nit means, in my experience, looking at a bunch of OCaml code. OCaml\ncode tends to be rather less documented than similar Haskell code, and\nI think that’s in part because in Haskell, you put your types right\nthere and that’s a form of documentation. And once you put your types\nin, then you can also put more documentation there and it becomes part\nof the habit of the Haskell programmer to put those comments right in\nthere.\n\nA flip side of this, is that Haskell has this feature called\ntypeclasses. And typeclasses allow you to use essentially one\nfunctioning to mean a variety of different things. OCaml doesn’t have\nthat feature. And so, what that can mean sometimes is that Haskell\ncode can become quite a bit harder to understand because if you have a\nbunch of these function names, any of which can mean a variety of\ndifferent things, all strung together, then it takes a lot of work on\nthe part of the reader to try to understand what on earth is going on\nthere. And that problem just doesn’t arise in OCaml. OCaml is much\nmore explicit about what operations it’s taking.\n\nSo maybe I can even, taking these two examples, generalize that a\nlittle bit and say, I find Haskell to be somewhat more explicit about\nwhat’s happening at compile time. Whereas, OCaml is somewhat more\nexplicit about what’s happening at runtime. So another place where\nthat comes into play is that, the Haskell compiler—and this connects\nwith a topic we were talking about earlier—the Haskell compiler\noptimizes much more aggressively than the OCaml one does. And that’s\nbecause in Haskell, Haskell’s a lazy language which means that if you\nsay, ‘Let X equal some big computation,’ we’re not gonna compute the\nbig computation until we need the value of X. In OCaml, if you say,\n‘Let X equal a big computation,’ we just compute that thing right\naway.\n\nAnd so, that means, on the one hand you might say, ‘Oh, well maybe\nHaskell is more efficient,’ because maybe some code path never uses\nthe value of X and so it means that we can discard that whole big\nthing. But it also means that it’s much harder to predict in Haskell\nhow fast your program is going to run or what its performance\ncharacteristics are gonna be. In OCaml, it’s much easier to predict\nthat. You can just sort of read your file top to bottom and, within a\nfunction, it just performs the operations that you see roughly in the\norder that you see them. And that means, OCaml again is more explicit\nabout what happens at runtime, but without some of the type\nannotations that we see in Haskell, a little less explicit about\nwhat’s happening at compile time.\n\nYou mentioned a couple of things that are different that I wonder if\nthey’re really language differences, or just cultural differences. If\nyou look at the tendency to do fewer type annotations on the\ndefinition of functions, you could put more type annotations. And I\nthink there are some people who write OCaml who do, but there’s\ncertainly a tendency not to and I think the Jane Street house style\ncertainly is one that does not have lots of type annotations, outside\nof interface files where those are essentially required everywhere.\n\nAnd the documentation thing, too, like, the interface files are a very\nnatural place to put documentation and I am constantly dissatisfied\nthat I think we put way too little documentation in the (laughs)\nplaces that we could. And I don’t know that there’s anything exactly\nabout the language that forces that. Like, I’m not sure that I buy\n‘the need to put type annotations right on functions’ is the thing\nthat really makes that difference.\n\nThat may be true. It’s hard to say. I do think that form follows\nfunction, function follows form a little bit, in that, when you’re\nused to describing the specification of a thing right next to that\nthing, that, to me, is going to encourage you to write\ndocumentation. Whereas, in OCaml, you write the specification over\nthere, in that other file, nowhere near where you write your\nimplementation. And sometimes I think that means that you’re less\nlikely to put those comments on the implementation when you need them.\n\nIt’s funny. My intuition is the opposite of, like, ‘Oh, I’ve written\nthis very bare interface file that just has types,’ and I think\nempathetically about the person who’s reading it. It’s like, ‘How will\nthey have any idea what this means? I had better put a comment here.’\n(laughs)\n\nRight. So the comment and the interface files are good, but I think\nit’s not just that. I mean, and this could also be, I have a bias in\nthat, most of the OCaml that I’m reading and writing is in the OCaml\ncompiler itself. Maybe this is different than everything else at Jane\nStreet. In fact, I’m sure it is. And it has been striking for me after\nspending so many years working in Haskell’s compiler, that Haskell’s\ncompiler has many, many, many more comments than OCaml’s compiler\ndoes. Maybe I’m overfitting on this particular piece of software\ninstead of just the language in general.\n\nI do think looking at the innards of a compiler is always a weird\nplace to think about how one should write code for the\nlanguage. Because, like, one of the facts about OCaml—as it is often\nthe case for many languages—is that OCaml was written by people who\ndidn’t yet really know how to program in OCaml kind of by\ndefinition. And lots of the code that’s there now has been there for a\nlong time and you can sorta see that. I think if you went to those\nsame people today and been like, ‘How would you write this now?’\nThey’d all be like, ‘Oh, really very differently.’ But, you know,\nparts of it just kind of haven’t been rewritten and have the shape\nthat they did years ago and are harder to understand than kind of\nanyone would exactly like it to be today.\n\nAnd to be fair, that exact same thing is true in the Haskell\ncompiler. There are stretches of that that no one would write it that\nway today. But it was written that way before anyone really knew how\nto program in Haskell.\n\nSo another difference that’s always struck me about Haskell is the\ndifferent approach to language extensions. And I think about this in\ntwo different ways. One is, OCaml is just massively more\nconservative. There was a period in time early in OCaml’s development\nwhere you could almost see the process of Ph.D. students\ngraduating. It’s like someone graduates, they write some language\nfeature, and it gets added to the language. And that stopped pretty\nearly in OCaml. OCaml got pretty conservative about making changes. It\nwas like, ‘No, no, no, we’re gonna add things that are like, really\ngood, and it was pretty restrictive about what would go in. And\nthroughout that time, it kind of had one language, pretty much. OCaml\nworked in one particular way and that was kinda that.\n\nHaskell on the other hand, has had a lot of glorious experimentation\naround language features and those experimental language features were\noften hidden behind pragmas, right? There’s lots of different things\nyou could turn on and off. And so there kind of isn’t one Haskell or\ntwo Haskells, but there’s like 10,000 different Haskells, depending on\nwhich collection of flags you wanna turn on or turn off. You have 10\ndifferent pragmas and now you have two of the 10 different possible\narrangements of the language features. I’m curious how you think about\nthose different sets of choices?\n\nYeah. I mean, that’s a great question. So I do have to push back\nagainst your sense of scale. So Haskell has, when I last counted, and\nthis was a few years ago, 150 or so extensions. So Haskell has\nactually 2150 languages.\n\nOuch, indeed. So I think that this comes from the origin of Haskell\nversus the origin of OCaml so actually you probably know more about\nthe origin of OCaml than I do. But I know Haskell was started by\ncommittee. There was a committee that met starting in, I think, 1989\ninto 1990, coalescing these ideas around a lazy functional programming\nlanguage. And then this eventually became a Haskell standard and there\nwere multiple different compilers for Haskell that all implemented the\nsame standard Haskell. And then maybe one compiler would think, ‘Ooh,\nwouldn’t it be fun if we had X?’ And so, then they would add that\nfeature, but everyone still wanted to make sure that it was a Haskell\ncompiler and not this other special language based on Haskell\ncompilers. So there was an idea of language extension. So you could\nhave base Haskell plus these various extensions.\n\nSo, in other words, OCaml is like Python and Haskell is like Scheme?\n\nSure. Yes. In that OCaml has a manual for the language, but there is\nnot a standard. There are not multiple different software artifacts\nthat all compile some OCaml language that exists beyond a single\ncompiler. But, in any case, going back to Haskell, that was the early\ndays of Haskell and there were multiple Haskell compilers. As time has\ngone on, all of the other ones have either died off or there are still\na few other Haskell compilers out there, but there’s not really an\nattempt to stay current with the newest features. And there’s really\nnow just one: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, or GHC. And that’s the one\nthat, when I say that there’s 150 language extensions, the GHC is\nsupporting that.\n\nAnd so, when you have multiple different things, if you wanted to find\na common core that all of these different compilers can interop with,\nit makes a lot of sense to have individual extensions when you say\nyou’re deviating from this common core. Now there’s really just one\ncompiler.\n\nI think that the current system, the current plan at Haskell, is not\nvery well motivated. And instead, the feedback that I hear from users\nis that they find the whole language extension system very heavy and\nit means that, to get much done in Haskell, you need to now start your\nfile with the list of 20 extensions that you’re using. And newcomers\ncan’t tell the difference between brand new experimental extensions\nthat might change from one compiler to another, or extensions that\nhave been around for 20 years, or there are some extensions that have\nbeen around for 20 years but actually we know are dangerous and you\nreally shouldn’t use.\n\nAnd when I say, ‘We know,’ I mean, like, I know this and a couple of\nother Haskellers know this, but someone just picking up the language\nwon’t know that. And I personally find that quite problematic. And so,\nthere’s a debate going on right now within the GHC Steering Committee\nwho is a body chosen to sort of help evaluate the evolution of the\nlanguage to reimagine all of this. And I’m hoping that we end up with\na structure that looks quite different from what we have today, while\nstill retaining backward compatibility.\n\nSo if you have your 20 language extensions at the top of your file,\nthat will continue to work in this new vision. But I am hoping that we\ncan reorganize it in a way that’s a little bit more user-friendly.\n\nDo you think in the end it would make sense to move toward something\nwhere there’s closer to one standard language that includes most of\nthe extensions, and so that most users end up not thinking about that\n‘two to the whatever’ configuration space?\n\nI do think settling on one standard language would be good. I think we\ncan get 80% of the way there and go from 150 extensions to maybe seven\nor something like that. I don’t think we’ll be able to get all the way\nthere because there’s just too many different use cases for Haskell,\nthere’s too many different people who have slightly different ideas of\nwhat that core should be. So if we just sort of got rid of the\nextensions mechanism, I think that that would cause too much of a rift\nin the community and probably not be tenable. But we can get close.\n\nSo, throughout this conversation, I feel like there’s been a\nparticular kind of vision and idea of what programming is that’s\nmotivated a lot of your thinking. And that has something to do with\nhaving a language that’s simultaneously expressive, it lets you say\nwhat you wanna say, but also has real tools for reasoning, in both\ntype systems and, you know, more sophisticated mode-dependent types,\nor essentially automated tools for reasoning about your program. So in\nthe last, I don’t know, few months, couple of years, there’s been an\nenormous amount of motion in a totally different direction for making\nprogramming better, which is various AI-assisted ways of making\nprogramming easier. With all of this kind of recent work on large\nlanguage models, things like ChatGPT, Codex, all of that, making an\nenormous difference to how people are programming on a regular\nbasis. I’m curious how you think about this and how it fits into your\nbroader way of thinking about programming?\n\nI see this evolution of sort of AI-assisted programming as not quite\nthe sea change that maybe others have seen it to be. I see it as a big\nstep. It’s not a small step change. But it doesn’t remove the need to\ncommunicate precisely. In that, to me, the interesting thing about a\nprogramming language is that it’s a mode of communication that is\nprecise. In a sense, that’s almost the definition of what makes a\nprogramming language a programming language, as opposed to some other\nkind of language. There’s a precise semantics to everything that is\nsaid in that language. And that language is used as a medium of\ncommunication, both from human to computer. That’s how we often think\nof it. But also from human to human.\n\nWith the advent of AI-assisted programming, now we have sort of a new\nmethod of communication in that it’s a communication from computer\nback to human. In that, you might have something like ChatGPT\nproducing the code, but a human still has to read that code and make\nsure that it does what you think it does. And as a medium of precise\ncommunication, it’s still very important to have a programming\nlanguage that allows that communication to happen.\n\nAnd so, this new mode of communication is going to put different\npressures on language design than what we’ve had in the past. But I\ndon’t think it removes the need for programming language design. But\nlike I said, it does create different pressures and these have been\nevident for some time in that one little maxim I’ve had in my head for\nyears now about language design is that you wanna optimize for\nreading, not for writing. Code gets read much more often than it gets\nwritten.\n\nAnd so, when designing a new language feature, maybe you’re thinking,\n‘Okay, I could do this very cleverly with, like, a nicely placed\ntwiddle in this spot in the code. And I could use that twiddle to mean\nsomething very important about my program. And maybe that’s very\nconcise, but it’s hard to read, it’s hard to search for, it’s hard to\ntrain new people to understand. Instead, it tends to be better to\nwrite out words in your design and programming language, that’s easier\nto search for, and easier to learn, and just easier to organize in\nyour brain. If we end up getting to a mode where humans are doing even\nless and less writing, and computers are doing more and more of it,\nthen those pressures just increase. And we wanna make the language\neasier to read and maybe even harder to write. Maybe we even get to a\npoint where if computers are doing all of the code generation, it’s\njust kind of, you know, symbolic and structured. It’s not just text.\n\nSo we get these richer programming languages but I just don’t see it\nas, there was yesterday and then there’s tomorrow and it’s gonna be\ntotally different and let’s just start from scratch. I see this as\njust one phase in evolution of this precise communication medium.\n\nOne of the things that’s really striking about these AI assistants, at\nleast in their current form, is they’re really surprisingly powerful,\nright? They can really do a kind of stunningly good job of taking a\nquery and understanding it and providing a piece of code that tries to\ndo what it is that you asked for it to do.\n\nBut they’re also strikingly fallible. They make lots of mistakes. And,\nyeah, the reading thing is pretty important because you ask ChatGPT\nor, you know, whatever your favorite large language model is, to write\na piece of code and look at the result. And it’s super easy for the\nresult to just be wrong in all sorts of different ways. And I can sort\nof see the rising requirement of making things more readable. I’m\ncurious how you think things like dependent types fit into this story?\n\nSo, dependent types in their essence are a way of writing precise\nspecifications. So the sorting example that I gave earlier, I\ndescribed that, you know, you could have a function instead of going\nfrom ‘a list of ints to a list of ints’ to something more\nglorious. Well, before dependent types, or you know, language without\ndependent types, you could just do that in comments. But probably in\nyour comments, you’re not going to be as precise as you could be if\nyou really wrote it in types, right? You say, you know, return to the\ninput list in ascending order, or something like that. But what does\nthat really mean?\n\nWe need a language where we can precisely specify what this function\nis doing. So as I said earlier, ascending isn’t quite right. I mean,\nif you write in a comment, ‘This returns the input list in ascending\norder,’ well, what if the input list has duplicates? Now you can’t\neven meet that specification. Where actually, that specification\ndoesn’t make any sense at all because the input list isn’t in\nascending order. What does that mean to say to put the input list in\nascending order? That’s a contradiction in terms, because the input\nlist isn’t in ascending order.\n\nAnd so, there’s some amount of interpretation that humans can provide,\ninterpretation that a large language model can provide, but in the\nend, it’s gonna come down to precise communication and\nspecification. And so, where do dependent types fit in? Well, they can\nbecome the input to the large language model. Maybe now we have\nprogrammers who are well-versed in precise communication of\nspecifications, not implementations, and we can say, ‘ChatGPT, give me\na function of this type.’ And then you have your nice type that takes\nan input list, and it returns an output list that is a permutation of\nthe input list in non-decreasing order and we specify that.\n\nAnd then now, that gives a nice specification for ChatGPT to go off\nand say, ‘Okay, here’s an implementation that meets that. Oh, and by\nthe way, it has this asymptotic running time because I’m a nice large\nlanguage model and I’m gonna tell you that.’ And then, now we actually\nhave a model by which we can check that the result meets its\nspecification if it is in this precise language of dependent types.\n\nAlthough I have to say, I think I am more pessimistic about the idea\nof people actually going off and writing down the specifications\neven. ‘Cause those are actually pretty hard to write.\n\nI wonder if a more plausible model is, you go to your large language\nmodel and say, ‘Please write me a specification for a function that\nsorts a list.’ And then it, like, spits something out. And then you\nlook at it and think, yeah, that seems about right. And then you go\nfrom there to next stages. But the role that this kind of concise\nspecification has, it’s like a smaller and maybe more readable thing\nthat you can use as part of verifying whether the later pieces in fact\ndo what you think they’re supposed to do.\n\nYes, but I think there’s a real danger here. I agree with what you say\nin that, writing a precise specification is hard. And humans are\nlazy. So if it’s hard, we’re gonna ask the computer to do it. If we’re\nasking the computer to write the specification of the function that\nit’s going to write, now we’re getting into thin ice. Because if we’re\nworking in a system where the human is not expert enough to be able to\nread the specification and know that it’s the right specification, now\nwe’ve lost. Now the computer can just sort of go off and do whatever\nit wants and we have no way of knowing whether it’s right or wrong\nbecause we’ve lost that ability to sort of have that precise\ncommunication.\n\nI think one of the tricky things here is, people are often pretty bad\nat the reading part of this, right? The idea if something gets written\nand now you have to read it, especially if it wasn’t written in a\nreally clear way, reading some piece of code that is not really\nwell-structured is actually really challenging. Like, one of the\nactually most important parts of the process of code review I find, is\nnot so much that, like, one person writes the code and someone else\nreads it to validate that it’s done the right thing. It’s more like,\nsomebody writes the code and the other person says, ‘Oh, man. This is,\nlike, too messy for me to even read.’ And then there’s some kind of\nback and forth process where you try and get something that’s actually\nsimple enough to be understood. And I think it’s an interesting open\nquestion of, like, as we start using more of these AI assistants, how\ngood they will be at generating things that are actually simple.\n\nAlthough, if we have precise specifications, the simplicity of the\nimplementation becomes less important.\n\nThat’s fair. I mean, in some sense there’s a kind of open\ntechnological question of, like, how good will large language models\nbe, acting as tactics for theorem provers?\n\nRight. Yeah. I mean, but if we’re in an environment where there is a\ntight correspondence between the specification and the implementation,\nand what I mean by ‘tight correspondence’ is this dependent type’s\nmodel where you can—and there’s other models, it’s not just dependent\ntypes, there’s refinement types, there’s other ways of checking an\nimplementation against a specification. But if we’re in an environment\nwhere we can check an implementation against a specification, the\nspecification is simple enough and communicated precisely whether\nthat’s in very careful natural language or probably not just natural\nlanguage ‘cause natural language is very, very squishy. But probably\nin some specification language, you could call that specification\nlanguage ‘dependent types’ if you want or you could call it something\nelse. But if we can communicate that specification, check the\nimplementation against the specification, now suddenly there’s not all\nthat much incentive to ever read the implementation.\n\nRight. It becomes a little bit like, you know, reading the output of\nthe compiler.\n\nYeah. It’s interesting. I do wonder whether a whole potential kind of\ndirection for innovation here, which you more or less have pointed in\nthe direction of, is designing languages that work usefully in this\nkind of intermediate things to generate in the process of working with\nsome kind of AI assistant. The thing that’s generated as an\nintermedium really affects the overall process of working on the\nsystem and generating confidence it’s doing the right thing. It’s not\na totally new problem, I guess, in the context of language design. But\nit does put new kinds of pressure and maybe changes the trade-offs\nthat show up.\n\nYeah, that’s right. I mean, you know, it’s too early, I think, to\nstart to design a programming language around this kind of\ninteraction. We’ve only been having these interactions with these\nassistants for a few months. And they’re changing fast. So I think now\nwould be the wrong time. In two years, maybe one could start thinking\nabout designing a language from scratch to do this. That sounds\nplausible to me. But I think a good starting point would be languages\nthat we have now because they’re designed for precise\ncommunication. That’s, in the end, what we need. And, again, maybe\nthere’s less pressure on the writing piece and more pressure on the\nreading piece. But I don’t think that they’re so divorced from each\nother that it means that we throw out everything we have and start\nfrom scratch. That seems, to me, pretty unlikely.\n\nThat makes sense. Well, thanks so much for joining me.

    "fullText": "The head of Paramount Skydance's streaming product and tech is leaving the company, Business Insider has learned.\n\nVibol Hou told colleagues in the company's streaming tech Slack channel that he's leaving Paramount at the end of January.\n\n\"After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHou's exit has been anticipated within Paramount for months.\n\nIn Hou's Slack message, he referenced a previous memo from Dane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, that hinted at the move.\n\n\"Vibol has expressed interest in exploring other opportunities, and while he will remain in his role with an anticipated transition early next year, we will continue to explore new projects together,\" Glasgow wrote in a mid-October email viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHou was at Paramount or its subsidiaries for over a decade, including six years at its free streamer, Pluto TV. In that span, Paramount went through several corporate changes, from a ViacomCBS merger to the Paramount Skydance merger that closed in the summer of 2025.\n\n\"What we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message. \"But we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver.\"\n\nHou's Slack message was received warmly, with 118 \"care\" emojis, 67 classic \"red heart\" emojis, and 43 \"thank you\" emojis, among other signals of support as of early Thursday afternoon.\n\nSince Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison took over in early August, he's made several noteworthy moves, like landing UFC rights in the US and hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News.\n\nSeveral top executives have left the company as Ellison has taken control, including co-CEOs Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins, streaming head Tom Ryan, and international markets head Pam Kaufman.\n\nEllison is now focused on buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which has rejected its takeover offer eight times.\n\nParamount did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead Hou's Slack message to colleagues announcing the move:\n\nAs Dane shared in his note, I'll be transitioning out of my role and leaving the company at the end of January. After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next.\n\nWhat we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy — but we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver. Yet again and again, this team showed grit, creativity, and passion. Whether you came from Pluto or another part of Streaming, the story is the same: we took on impossible problems and innovated our way through.\n\nThe culture we live — being curious about everything, feeling that hunger to solve problems, caring deeply for others, iterating constantly, and innovating in everything we do — belongs to all of you now. You should be proud of what you've achieved, and you should be confident that this is a team that can handle anything thrown its way.\n\nAs to the future, I have a lot of confidence in Dane and the vision and strategic pillars he's laid out for the year ahead. They set a strong foundation for where this organization can go over the next several years, and I'm excited to see what you all do together under his leadership.\n\nI plan to hold my last open office hours next Friday so anyone who wants to drop in, ask questions, or just say hello/goodbye has a space to do that together. In the meantime, if you'd like to stay in touch beyond my time here, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\nServing alongside you has been one of the great privileges of my life, and I'll be proudly cheering you on as you write the next chapter together.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "fullText": "on January 8, 2026 at 6:36AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nAt the start of the year, you can always rely on the Consumer Electronics Show to be a hub for exciting innovations, bold prototypes, and downright weird ideas that aim to make life more convenient. While CES 2026 is (predictably) being dominated by AI shoehorned into various products this week, the show still has a few surprises up its sleeve. Between iterative gaming laptop upgrades for 2026 and flashy new OLED TVs, the event is also serving as a hub for interesting and weird technology.\n\nSome of this gear--like Razer's holographic AI companion tube--is already scheduled to be released later this year, while more experimental stuff, like brain-scanning headphones, are still a long way from being seen on store shelves. In case you couldn't make it to Las Vegas this year, here's a quick look at the technology that caught our eyes.\n\nAsus and XReal have teamed up for a new set of extended reality glasses, and on paper, these have some seriously impressive tech inside. Scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses and a dock that lets you connect them to a console or PC via HDMI and DisplayPort.\n\nWhat's better than one 3K 16-inch OLED screen on a gaming laptop? Two 3K 16-inch OLED screens, of course. While this isn't the first time Asus has experimented with a multi-monitor display on one of its ROG laptops, this new take on the Zephyrus Duo looks like a wild approach to dual-screen gaming.\n\nHolograms make everything cooler, and Asus is leveraging this technology to create a seriously cool PC gaming case. The Asus ROG GM1000 can use its case fans to project holographic images, and users can upload their own GIFs and short MP4s to create custom effects.\n\nGameSir might be onto something, as the idea of a gaming controller with a dedicated steering wheel right in the center sounds like a fun idea. You've got all the inputs you'd require from modern gaming, a direct drive motor, and up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering, the company claims (via The Verge). Pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed.\n\nGameSir's other big controller reveal was the X5 Alteron, a Swiss Army knife of a peripheral designed for iPad, iPhone, Android, and Nintendo Switch. HyperX is helping develop it, and the modular system lets you customize the controller with various modules. This means that you can customize it extensively with different D-pads, thumbsticks, and buttons to create your dream controller.\n\nA gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port, the 8BitDo FlipPad borrows heavily from the design of the classic Nintendo Game Boy. The company says it'll reveal more details on the Android and iOS controller ahead of its launch in Summer 2026.\n\nIt might look visually inspired by Nespresso coffee machines, but the new mid-tower case unveiled by CyberPowerPC at CES has an elegant quality. It has everything you'd expect--tempered glass panels, mesh ventilation, and ports--but the real showstopper here is a selection of knobs for controlling the LEDs on this sleek case.\n\n8BitDo makes some of the best controllers, and at CES 2026, it unveiled the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E wireless modular controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple devices, and Android. Just don't expect this to be a budget-friendly option, as the Ultimate 3E will retail for $150 at launch in Q2 2026.\n\nIf you're a fan of Kojima Productions--the studio headed by famed game developer Hideo Kojima--then you'll want to check out these new peripherals from Asus. This special-edition hardware features hand-drawn illustrations by Yoji Shinkawa--the art director for the Death Stranding games--and it'll launch on February 4.\n\nThe newly revealed Corsair Galleon 100 SD mechanical keyboard doesn't have a numpad, but it does have a built-in Elgato Stream Deck Plus. This part of the keyboard features 12 customizable buttons, a five-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and rotary dials. It launches on January 29 and it's priced at $350.\n\nRazer's Project Ava is aiming to be a holographic AI desktop companion that can fulfill several roles. From lifestyle reminders to gaming wingman, the device will come with several AI personalities and is expected to launch within the first half of 2026.\n\nWe're skeptical about this concept for a \"non-invasive\" gaming headset that supposedly improves your skills in competitive games, but at least Neurable and HyperX's protoype looks like a comfy set of brain-scanning cans.\n\nUltrawide monitors have become a popular option over the years, but laptop users can't enjoy them on the go--unless they want to lug a spare monitor around. That's where this concept for a rollable screen comes in: Lenovo is courting \"athletes who need pro-level performance\" with its gaming laptop. The screen can unfurl to 16, 21.5, and 24 inches.\n\nHyperX isn't the only company with AI-powered headphones at CES 2026, as Razer also showed off its Project Motoko concept. The idea behind this wireless headset is that it uses a ton of tech--including two 4K cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, near and far field microphones, and built-in AI--to serve a similar function to other AI wearables, like taking photos, translating foreign text, or conversing with an AI assistant.\n\nIt's not gaming tech, but this $399 ultrasonic chef's knife from Seattle Ultrasonics is the closest thing we have to owning a high-frequency blade in real life. Can it effortlessly cut through a Metal Gear mech? Probably not, but the vibrating piezoelectric ceramic crystals will let you slice through fruit and vegetables easily.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't have a new GPU to show off this year, the company did reveal its DLSS 4.5 upscaling technology. The company claims it can dynamically boost performance in compatible games, enabling up to 240+ frames per second with path tracing on 50-series GPU cards.",

    "description": "Peter Boockvar cautioned investors against \"blindly\" relying on tech stocks to power their portfolios, and advised looking at other parts of the market.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street remains bullish on AI, but the investment chief of a $12 billion firm thinks investors need to be careful not to pin all of their hopes on the technology.\n\nPeter Boockvar, the chief investment officer of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners, thinks greater opportunities lie outside of the AI trade despite the stellar gains it delivered for the market in 2025.\n\nMany of the tech sector's most dominant players, including Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, have stumbled out of the gate in 2026. Boockvar says the industry's previous growth isn't sustainable and that its days of dominance are numbered.\n\nIn his view, the AI trade won't function as the market-driving force that investors have come to know in recent years. While there will still be growth opportunities, being selective will be of much greater importance.\n\n\"Investors need to not just blindly rely on that AI tech trade as the leadership group, and understand that there are a lot of other parts of the market that can do well now.\"\n\nThe CIO said on CNBC that he believes market tides are slowly shifting in a direction that doesn't favor prominent AI stocks. In his view, the market has been showing signs of fatigue that some investors may be ignoring.\n\n\"I do think in 2026 the AI tech trade is losing some steam in terms of its dominance,\" he said. \"We've seen the market response to Nvidia's report a couple of months ago. We've seen the market punish Meta for its excessive spending.\"\n\nBoockvar pointed to the struggles of other top AI companies like Oracle, whose lackluster Q3 earnings prompted concerns of AI overspending, and also flagged CoreWeave, a stock that surged 90% in 2025 but still drew consistent concerns of excessive debt and potential lack of profitability.\n\n\"I think that entire trade is becoming more differentiated, that we've reached a point where investors are realizing they're going to be winners and they're going to be losers,\" Boockvar added.\n\nBoockvar highlighted surging capex in 2025 as part of his bearish thesis for this year, arguing that companies should diversify their spending beyond data centers.\n\n\"All the capex growth in 2025 was the data center building\" he said. \"Hopefully in 2026, with the tax incentives in terms of immediate expense, other parts of the economy can take that baton.\"",

    "fullText": "State residents worth more than $1bn could face one-off, 5% tax to help fund education, food assistance and healthcare\n\nA battle is brewing in California over a plan to tax billionaires – with tech titans divided over whether they should pay up, or flee the state.\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\n“We chose to live in Silicon Valley,” Huang said. “And whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with Google co-founder Larry Page, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they’re leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nThe tax proposal is being led by the labor union Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. If passed, the tax would retroactively apply to residents as of 1 January, and billionaires would have five years to pay it.\n\nThis means Huang would pay roughly $7bn and Page and Thiel would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $1.3bn, respectively, based on their current net worth.\n\n“What remains undeniable is the underlying unfairness of the current system,” Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for SEIU-UHW, said in an email. “Regular working people pay higher effective tax rates than the wealthiest Americans … Asking those who have benefited most from the economy to contribute more – particularly to stabilize health care systems under direct threat – is a reasonable step.”\n\nThe proposal is still in the beginning phases. Under California law, it needs to collect 874,641 signatures to qualify for the state ballot in November. It would also need to be signed by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who has said he opposes the wealth tax.\n\n“You can’t isolate yourself from the 49 others,” Newsom said when asked about wealth taxes during the New York Times DealBook Summit last month. “We’re in a competitive environment.”\n\nThis puts Newsom at odds with Ro Khanna, the California representative who represents Silicon Valley and who has championed the idea of a wealth tax. Khanna says tech billionaires will likely stay in the state, despite a tax, because California is where the larger industry, innovation and talent pool are located. “A billionaire tax is good for American innovation,” Khanna said, adding that it would spread the wealth to other sectors.\n\nWhen Thiel indicated he was leaving California because of the proposed tax, Khanna posted to X: “I echo what FDR said with sarcasm of economic royalists when they threatened to leave, ‘I will miss them very much.’”\n\nThis is not California’s first billionaire exodus. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, famously departed for Texas in 2020, which stood to save him millions in taxes. He has also shifted several of his companies’ headquarters there. Most recently, in 2024, Musk announced he was moving SpaceX to Texas because of a California law that aimed to protect transgender children in schools. He called the law a “final straw”.\n\nOther tech billionaires have also decamped to Texas, which has no state income tax. Citing a better tax environment, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale moved to Austin in 2020, and Larry Ellison transitioned Oracle’s headquarters there in 2020 (he has since said he’s moving the company to Nashville). Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, has long lived in Texas.\n\nSacks made his announcement on 31 December, posting an image of the Texas flag on X and saying: “God bless Texas.” In a separate post the following day, Sacks wrote: “As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.”\n\nMusk, Lonsdale and Dell all responded with hearty welcomes. “No one will fight harder for the independent and free spirit of Texas than people who know [sic] it’s like when that’s taken away,” Musk wrote.\n\nPage has not publicly said where he’s moving, but in December companies associated with the Google co-founder filed documents to incorporate in Florida, according to the New York Times. Thiel, who owns a home in the Hollywood Hills, also seems to have set his sights on Florida. His investment firm, Thiel Capital, announced on 31 December that it had opened an office in Miami. The firm said Thiel has maintained a personal residence in the city since 2020.\n\nOn X, tech investors and other billionaires have blasted the proposed wealth tax. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook executive, said that without billionaires, California’s “budget deficit will only get bigger”, and Vinod Khosla, another investor, said that under the proposed tax, “California will lose its most important taxpayers and net off much worse”.\n\nSome have indicated they’d work to oust Khanna from Congress. Martin Casado, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote that Khanna had “devolved into an obnoxious jerk” and that his support of the wealth tax had alienated him from moderates. In response, Garry Tan, the CEO of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote: “Time to primary him.”\n\nThe SEIU’s Jimenez said states like Massachusetts and Washington, which have other forms of wealth taxes, have seen billions of dollars raised to help the state. At the same time, she said, high-income residents have continued to see their portfolios grow. Jimenez added that the union is “heartened” by Huang’s recent comments and is hopeful that more billionaires will follow suit.\n\nAs for Huang, he said Nvidia is in Silicon Valley because that’s where the engineers are and he’s not worried about a billionaire tax.\n\n“Not this person,” Huang said. “This person is trying to build the future of AI.”\n\nRepresentatives for Page, Thiel, Sacks and Newsom did not return requests for comment.",

IWF analysts said the images would be considered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under UK law.\n\n“We can confirm our analysts have discovered criminal imagery of children aged between 11 and 13 which appears to have been created using the tool,” said Ngaire Alexander, the head of the IWF’s hotline, which investigates reports of CSAM from members of the public.\n\nX, Elon Musk’s social media platform, has been deluged with images of women and children whose clothes have been digitally removed by the Grok tool, sparking public outcry and condemnation from politicians.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, the House of Commons women and equalities committee said it would no longer use X for its communications, saying it was no longer appropriate to do so given preventing violence against women and girls was among its key policy areas.\n\nThe decision marks the first significant move by a Westminster organisation to exit X in response to the misuse of Grok. While the decision concerned only the committee’s account, some individual members, including the Labour chair, Sarah Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.\n\nAlexander said the imagery viewed by the IWF has been used to create even more extreme material – known as Category A, which includes penetrative sexual activity – using a different AI tool.\n\n“We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material. Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream. That is unacceptable,” Alexander added.\n\nMusk’s xAI, which owns Grok and X, has been approached for comment.\n\nDowning Street said “all options were on the table”, including a boycott of X as ministers backed the UK regulator, Ofcom, to take action.\n\nOn Wednesday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “X needs to deal with this urgently and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users.\n\n“It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law.”\n\nRequests for Grok to manipulate images of women to “put her in a bikini” continued to flood in on X on Wednesday. Despite the warnings of EU and UK regulatory action, there was no evidence that the platform had installed tighter safeguards, and pictures of teenage girls continue to be stripped down digitally at the request of X users, to show them in small, revealing items of underwear, or positioned in sexually explicit poses.\n\nSome users have demanded more extreme content, asking the chatbot to decorate bikinis with swastikas, or requesting alterations to photographs of women so they appear to be victims of abuse. The chatbot has obliged by adding cigarette burns, facial bruising, and blood to some images of women.\n\nThe UK’s data watchdog – the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) – said it had contacted X and xAI “to seek clarity on the measures they have in place to comply with UK data protection law and protect individuals’ rights”, adding people have “a right to use social media knowing their personal data is being handled lawfully and with respect”.\n\nX has said it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, “by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary”.",

    "description": "Ford announced plans to deploy eyes-off driving technology on public roads by 2028. The legacy automaker is making the tech in-house to get there.",
    "fullText": "Ford said it's developing autonomous capabilities, such as eyes-off driving, that will be ready for public roads by 2028.\n\nThe legacy automaker said in an announcement on Wednesday that it will be cheaper to develop self-driving technology in-house than to seek an outside supplier.\n\n\"Because we own the technology behind our driver assistance systems, we can deliver significantly more capability at a 30% lower cost than if we bought it from outside suppliers, which makes advanced driver assistance scalable,\" Ford announced during CES in Las Vegas.\n\nChris Morse, a spokesperson for Ford, told Business Insider that the cost is compared to \"the supplier system that we have on-road today.\" A specific supplier was not named.\n\nKey team members behind Ford's ADAS ambitions gave Business Insider a broad overview of some of the advantages of an in-house approach.\n\nSammy Omari, head of ADAS and infotainment at Ford Motor Company, said the company can have greater oversight over how the sensors are utilized and integrated into the vehicles.\n\n\"How can we now combine the information from all these sensors in the most cost-effective way to get to the highest performance?\" he said. \"These are some of the key reasons why we can get to that price point.\"\n\nPaul Costa, a former Apple employee who now leads Ford's electrical engineering team, told Business Insider that the company can reduce the number of separate computer modules inside its vehicles — an ADAS computer, an infotainment system, an audio system, and a networking computer — into one computer without having to compromise performance.\n\nCosta said Ford has \"great suppliers,\" but seeking third parties doesn't allow for integration of modules, and the size of the computers themselves is larger.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" he said. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nThere are several players in the business of licensing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for car makers, including Nvidia, Waymo, and Wayve, among others. Ford previously announced a partnership with Mobileye in 2020 to develop its ADAS software, called BlueCruise.\n\nA spokesperson for Mobileye declined to comment.\n\nLeading EV companies in the US — namely Tesla and Rivian — have taken an in-house approach to developing their own self-driving technology. Rivian announced earlier in December that it designed its own silicon chip to power the autonomous driving computer inside its future vehicles.\n\nCosta told Business Insider that Ford isn't interested in making its own chip and the automaker is happy with its current suppliers.\n\n\"We're not interested in a TOPS war,\" Costa said, referring to a metric chipmakers commonly like to tout.\n\n\"Honestly, I don't want custom silicon,\" he later added. \"If I can get other people's volume on silicon that I need, that is good for democratization.\"",

    "description": "The 'Best of CES' award winners are official, highlighting the best new tech that CES had to offer.",
    "fullText": "In the middle of the Las Vegas Convention Center, amidst the world's largest tech trade show, an awards show was taking place. The audience included nominees ranging from large companies like Nvidia to scrappy startups introducing themselves to the world, alongside journalists, tech insiders, and enthusiasts gathering to watch the Best of CES 2026 awards. After days of scouring showroom floors, speaking with innovators about their new technologies, and deliberating for six hours, finalists and winners were chosen by experts from CNET, PCMag, Mashable, ZDNET, and Lifehacker. I had the privilege of helping to judge and present several awards, and aside from my gratitude for the experience, my takeaway was simple: There's a lot of new technology worth being excited about.\n\nCNET Group, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association, awarded winners across 22 categories, plus a 'Best Overall' award. To qualify for a Best of CES award, a product or service had to be an official exhibitor at CES 2026 and either include a compelling new concept or idea, solve a major consumer problem, or set a new bar in performance, design, or quality. The official Best of CES 2026 winners were announced live Wednesday, Jan. 7, at 4 p.m. PT. Here are all the finalists and winners of Best of CES 2026.\n\nTombot's Jennie has been capturing hearts at CES for years, but the realistic robot puppy is finally launching in 2026. Designed to comfort seniors with dementia and help combat loneliness, Jennie is packed with sensors and motors, allowing it to move its head to look at you, raise its eyebrows, wag its tail, and bark when you ask if it wants a treat. Seniors at a memory care facility we visited loved Jennie.\n\niGuard is a smart stove shutoff that helps older adults age in place. This new version of the device uses radar to tell when a person is in the kitchen, and has a configurable five-minute grace period. It can also report to a caregiver app if your loved one didn’t show up in the kitchen to make breakfast as usual.\n\nQira is Lenovo's answer to Apple Intelligence, a hybrid AI assistant that leverages a mix of on-device processing and cloud-based models for a powerful personalized assistant that's available anywhere, even as you switch from the phone in your pocket to the laptop or tablet in your hand.\n\nNvidia is once again the talk of CES, and the biggest announcement by the world's most profitable company is the Rubin AI platform. Nvidia’s six new Rubin chips work together to reduce the costs of data processed by AI, known as tokens. That's important for big tech companies, and all of us, as AI models become more compute-intensive.\n\nThis AI wearable brings it back to basics. Users can jot down quick notes throughout their day that they don't want to forget by clicking on the button and speaking into the ring. Then, an LLM on the app will process what you said for easy access and even take actions for you.\n\nSamsung Music Studio 5 (Winner)\n\nThe Samsung Music Studio 5 houses a 4-inch woofer and dual tweeters in one of the most compelling designs we've seen in a home speaker. In addition to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, it supports the Samsung Seamless Codec for compatibility with other Samsung Galaxy ecosystem products.\n\nxMEMS Sycamore-N loudspeaker chip\n\nAs smartglasses become more mainstream, they require an audio chip that is as advanced as their AI features. The xMEMS Sycamore-N loudspeaker chip enhances the smartglasses audio experience. Based on our listening tests, they provide a high-fidelity listening experience, and at one millimeter thin, directly aid in keeping smartglasses form factors thinner and lighter.\n\nAs a part of LG's Sound Suite, the H7 Soundbar extends the usefulness of Flex Connect to any TV with an HDMI input. The soundbar looks good and it sounded great with movies. The only drawback is that you can only add LG branded Flex Connect speakers to the soundbar and not those from other brands.\n\nIntel Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) (Winner)\n\nIntel’s Core Ultra 300 Series “Panther Lake” platform is our winner for delivering bar-raising integrated graphics performance to the mass consumer market. The top chip offers up to 12 new “Xe3” Xe cores for (by far) the best-ever integrated graphics performance from Intel silicon, enabling graphics and gaming workloads for a huge range of portable laptop categories through 2026 and beyond.\n\nIt's all about the TOPS: The mainstream version of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 laptop processor family maintains the 80 trillion operations per second of the higher end X2 Elite chips. Expected in laptops starting around $800, it promises field leading NPU performance at a lower price.\n\nAMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 392, AI Max Plus 388\n\nAMD’s expanded Ryzen AI Max+ platform democratizes workstation power with the 392 and 388 models, featuring 40 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, 60 TFLOPS of compute, and 192GB unified memory. These chips bring elite local AI and GPU-free performance to thinner, more affordable devices with a superior price-to-performance ratio.\n\nAfter developing alignment-free wireless power for two years, Willo demonstrated the ability to deliver power over the air for multiple devices simultaneously, regardless of their position or movement. This represents a breakthrough in energy technology, offering wireless charging without the need for a pad, coil, or dock.\n\nJackery's solar energy-seeking robot showed an ability to follow you around like a puppy, but its real job is to follow the sun, collecting energy with its retractable 300W solar panels. The idea is that this autonomous bot can always find the sun, and then bring you the power when you need it.\n\nA water heater that automatically generates bitcoin with daily use. It utilizes the excess heat generated from bitcoin mining to heat running water in a home, offsetting up to 80 percent of electricity and water costs with the earnings from the process. You can control and manage it with an app or web console for ease of use.\n\nLego Smart Play System (Winner)\n\nA single 2-by-8 Lego brick filled with light, sound, and proximity sensors to enable new ways to play. This little block, and the tinier snap-on tab that gives it instructions, can drive anything from lightsaber duels to board games, adding color and sound effects based on what you build and how you play.\n\nIxana's Wi-R is a chip that sends data through a hyperlocal field generated by your body. This alternative to Bluetooth and WiFi is still a concept, but it has some upsides to conventional data protocols such as less power drain and less potential for clogged signal.\n\nLenovo Legion Pro Rollable Concept (Winner)\n\nRollable OLED displays have been a thing for a couple years, but they’ve been limited to enterprise laptops, if they ever even come out. The Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept uses this tech to bring ultrawide gaming to a laptop for the first time. Is the future rollable? We don’t know, but either way it’d be the perfect portable battlestation.\n\nA gaming PC with multiple monitors has become the norm, and while portable monitors have been around for a while, there haven't been many ways to have this experience built-in to a laptop. The Asus Zephyrus Duo takes the multiple-display idea Asus has been playing with since the original Zephyrus Duo and expands it to something actually useful: a full second display.\n\nXreal’s AR glasses are some of the best, and now PC company ASUS is partnering with Xreal to make them better, especially for gamers. These AR glasses have everything even the pickiest player needs, giving you a virtual 171-inch screen right on your face. That screen is OLED and 1080p, but the real kicker is the 240hz refresh rate. It’s smooth big-screen gaming, on the go.\n\nThe Ecoldbrew combines a portable grinder and brewer into a compact gadget that whips up a batch of cold brew coffee in five minutes. The cleverly designed device slots onto its own thermos, but it's a common size so you can easily attach it to the top of your own thermos if you have one that you love. Slated to launch on Kickstarter soon, it starts at an affordable $99.\n\nSeattle Ultrasonics' C-200 UltraSonic Chef's Knife has a Japanese steel blade that vibrates about 30,000 times per second. Its movement is so subtle that you can't see or hear it move, but you will notice how effortlessly it slices through food without clinging to it. The C-200 retails for $399, a similar price point as other nice knives. The first batch ships this month.\n\nWe've covered our fair share of smart ovens at CES but Apecoo has boiled it down to the essentials. This compact cooker uses a camera above and scale below to ID food type and size and then deploys a precise cooking program pulled from a deep AI algorithm. Perfectly cooked steak, anyone? This machine can determine the exact thickness of meat or volume of veggies like no oven before it. The oven even recognizes multiple types of food at once and uses appropriate cooking times and temps for each. Best of all, it's about half the size of a typical smart oven.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 Aura Edition (Winner)\n\nModular laptop designs for greater serviceability and sustainability are a definite trend at CES 2026, and the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best example of it. Lenovo’s flagship business laptop introduces its Space Frame design that lets you access and replace individual parts when something breaks instead of needing to buy a new laptop.\n\nYes, it's clearly inspired by the MacBook Pro, but MSI's big, redesigned Stealth pours on the special sauce. This thin rig deploys Intel's Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) CPUs and GeForce graphics up to a roaring RTX 5090, alongside amped-up cooling and airflow. Plus, a new, subtler MSI design and a 240Hz Gorilla Glass panel will excite gamers and prosumer creators alike.\n\nAsus' Zenbook Duo is a niche device, but it's the most elegant expression of a dual-screen laptop we've seen yet. The 2026 Zenbook Duo has matured on its design with notable improvements from last year: thinner bezels, a more sturdy kickstand, and a better hinge. Powered with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 386H CPU, it’s well-equipped for diverse creative workloads.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold (Winner)\n\nThe culmination of Samsung's efforts to make a sleeker and more versatile folding phone. It's a true hybrid gadget that's a standard phone when closed and opens up to a sprawling 10-inch display, making this a practical, two-in-one device that fits securely in your pocket.\n\nThe Motorola Razr Fold is a solid entry in the book-style folding phone category thanks to its large screens, clean software, and powerful cameras. Together with stylus support, it's a fine option for those who need a device that's focused on productivity\n\nThe OhSnap Mcon is a Bluetooth controller with a slide-out plate to mount your iPhone (via MagSafe) or Android phone (via magnets) for a portable gaming experience. The pocketable accessory can be used in three ways: as a mounted handheld device, a wireless gaming controller, and a docked gaming console when your phone is connected to an external monitor.\n\nCoro feels like a product that should have existed for years. It solves the problem of measuring how much your baby is eating in a simple and meaningful way. I wish it was around when my babies were young.\n\nEarflo is a medical device designed to look and work like a sippy cup for kids as young as two. When you sip from the cup, a small mask forms a seal on your nose, and with each swallow, air flows through the nose. The pressure on the nasal cavity helps releasing trapped fluid in the ear. In a peer-reviewed study, after four weeks of Earflo use, 90 percent of children did not need ear tube surgery three months later.\n\nKids and parents already spend quality time building with Lego. Now, in Lego's CES debut, the company is launching its new Smart Bricks as part of its new Smart Play platform, which brings Lego creations and characters to life. Lego Smart Brick includes a tiny chip inside that enables Legos to tell color, direction, distance, sound and more. Now Lego creations can interact with families, enabling more time together.\n\nSatellai's new collar (Satellai Collar Go) and software (Petsense AI) are proactive tools that could flag subtle behavioral shifts in your dog before they become obvious health problems. It can also warn you when your dog has left your yard, and retails for a reasonable $79.\n\nPawport launched its smart pet door in late 2025. The pet door uses ultra-wideband technology, which can detect how close your dog is to the door. That lets you customize how close your dog needs to be before the door opens, both coming in and out of the house. It also extends the collar tags’ battery life from 12 to 18 months.\n\nOne of the devices debuting is the Yumshare Daily Feast, an automatic wet cat food feeder Petkit describes as its first entry into robotic wet feeding. The unit can dispense scheduled meals over seven days while monitoring consumption through an integrated camera, and can automatically discard spoiled and leftover food.\n\nOf the many humanoid robots to have made their debut at CES 2026, it's Boston Dynamics' Atlas that stands out as the best of the bunch. The prototype version demoed at the show impressed us with its naturalistic walking gait, meanwhile the sleek product version is ready to be deployed into Hyundai manufacturing facilities from this year, where it might just be working on your next car.\n\nThe Solar Mars Bot may never make it to Mars, but it solves several problems with portable generators. It's far easier to move wherever you need and it can chase the sun without intervention.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nThe Roborock Saros Rover can traverse the biggest obstacle for robot vacuums: stairs. It's the first model that can navigate to different floors on its own without the help of a separate attachment. It pulls off this feat thanks to a pair of bendable legs that it controlls independently to avoid obstacles, and it can even clean stairs as it climbs.\n\nThe Lockin V7 Max is a new smart lock that doesn't require recharging or replacing its batteries. Instead of using a removable battery, the V7 Max uses Lockin AuraCharge, an external device that you plug in approximately four meters away, sending a light beam to a receiver on the lock. The lock converts the light into energy to charge its battery.\n\nThe Robotin R2 is the first robot vacuum that can wash and dry a carpet, just like a carpet cleaner. It comes with a core module and two modular attachments that let it switch from vacuuming and mopping to carpet washing and drying. It takes about one hour to clean a 300-400 square foot room and two hours to dry. There's also an absolutely massive base station with two clean water tanks, a large dustbin and a dirty water tank.\n\nThis might save lives. A French startup has created a $200 portable device to test food samples for allergens. The startup, Allergen Alert, only had mock-up devices at CES, but it's licensing the tech from French biofirm bioMérieux. If the startup can pull off the food testing, the impact could be huge. Expect it to arrive in this year's second half.\n\nIf the name sounds familiar, it's because Pebble was the first company to popularize smartwatches in 2010s. After several company moves, the brand is back as a startup with a new lineup of affordable watches with battery life improvements and improved form factors. It also has a new AI ring.\n\nThe Nirva AI jewelry is a startup that aims to continuously learn from your real-world behavior by recording your audio throughout the day. From those recordings, it offers advice on work, relationships and everyday decision-making. Nirva positions itself as a personal AI companion, designed to understand your life as you live it. Think of it as \"audio journaling\" after a long day.\n\nClear Drop Soft Plastic Compactor (Winner)\n\nAnxious about plastic waste? Clear Drop's Soft Plastic Compactor can mash them into dense bricks to send off to be recycled into products like patio furniture. Clear Drop's product and subscription ensures none of your recycled soft plating ends up in a landfill.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nCambridge Consultants Ouroboros smartwatch\n\nUshering in the new age of right-to-repair legislation is this concept smartwatch design from Cambridge Consultants. It's proof that you can make a smartwatch that allows for self repair without compromising on design or user experience.\n\nThere's plenty of talk about autonomy in cars, but Stutt brings the next-generation technology to an accessible application. The Ev1 mobility scooter can map and then navigate spaces autonomously, allowing people to get around via voice commands. It can also autocorrect manual navigation to prevent bumping into obstacles. This is the rare device that combines mobility, accessibility and autonomy, and it's hard not to be impressed.\n\nDolby Atmos adds a literal new dimension to car audio. However, not everyone can buy a new luxury car just to upgrade their listening experience. Pioneer’s Sphera receiver allows almost anyone to add Dolby Atmos via Apple CarPlay to the car they already own with the speakers already installed and immerse themselves in spatial audio.\n\nPromising huge improvements in energy density, charging speed and safety, solid state battery tech is a holy grail for electric cars, home energy, drones and a host of other applications. Donut Lab is first to market with a solid state battery in a production EV which can be found in partner Verge Motorcycles’ TS Pro Gen 2.\n\nWheelchairs are available at airports, hotels, resorts, theme parks, and cruises, but standard wheelchairs require ongoing effort, and they can struggle through difficult terrain. WheelMoves is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are.\n\nThe Jitlife JS07i is a rideable suitcase that travelers can use to drive long distances through airports. It's the size of a standard cabin bag but carries up to 250 pounds, has a maximum speed of 8 miles per hour, and can travel six miles on a charge. Already popular overseas, rideable luggage is making its way to the US, and Jitlife is the best we tried.\n\nThe Samsung S95H is the most impressive TV we saw at CES for a number of reasons, firstly, it’s 35 percent brighter than before. Secondly, it’s a wired TV which is great for gaming, but it has a wireless option for a cleaner look and which enables more connections. Thirdly, it’s the first OLED that can show artwork from the Samsung Art Store — the S95H has anti-burn-in technology that enables it to work like a Frame TV, but with even better image quality.\n\nThe 116UXS builds on the still very new and promising RGB LED TV concept by adding even more color to the mix. Its mini-LED backlight array uses red, green, and blue LEDs, then adds a fourth sky blue (cyan) LED that Hisense says lets it cover 110 percent of the BT.2020 color range.\n\nThe W6 is LG's \"wallpaper\" TV, an OLED TV only 9mm deep that can be mounted nearly flush against a wall. It's one of LG's brightest OLEDs yet, and it's almost completely wireless thanks to its Zero Connect box you can place up to 30 feet away to send it video and its Dolby Atmos FlexConnect-powered LG Sound Suite support for building a spatial audio system around it.\n\nHaving a tiny animated girl living on a small screen inside a physical cylander case is certainly very weird. Lepro's new AI companion Ami is exactly that. Its not quite an AI assistant meant to help with actual tasks. Its an AI meant for a loney person looking for some interaction. The characters dance and gyrate inside the case and can do so at the user's request as well, upping the weirdness factor.\n\nSuck on this lollipop and listen to a song directly from your mouth to your ears using bone conduction technology, so you can \"experience music you can taste.\" I tried it out, and though you had to bite down on it a bit to hear the music, it did work. It's a weird, fun novelty item. It costs $8.99.\n\niPolish touts itself as the \"world's first digital color-changing nails.\" They take the form of press-on nails that you can individually put into a little wand to instantly change the color via a selection of over 400 shades on an app.\n\nPerimenopause affects people transitioning to menopause, and is commonly marked by symptoms such as anxiety, hot flashes, and night sweats. Peri is a wearable designed to track those symptoms, and help you make informed decisions about how to manage them — whether that's through lifestyle changes and supplements alone, or hormone replacement therapy.\n\nA majority of those who menstruate report severe period pain. This wearable neurostimulation device aims to reduce period symptoms and cramps. By attaching near the ear and delivering gentle neurostimulation, the device targets the auricular branches of the trigeminal and vagus nerves to regulate menstrual cycle symptoms and help the body return to a rested state.\n\nFood allergies are common and can cause a wide range of unpleasant symptoms. Severe reactions can be deadly. Allergen Alert is a mini, portable lab that allows you to test food for common allergens on the spot at a restaurant, school, or anywhere you dine out. A single-use pouch analyzes the food sample inserted into the device and displays results within minutes.\n\nBeatbot AquaSense X ecosystem (Winner)\n\nBeatbot has introduced the world's first self-emptying pool robot cleaner. In addition to its industry leading navigation and suction, the AquaSense x Ecosystem removes the worst chore associated with robot vacs — cleaning the debris baskets filled with soggy leaves, slime and bugs. The standalone cleaning dock empties debris into a disposable bag in a bin waiting below. Next, it rinses the internal mechanisms with fresh water fed from an attached hose, keeping the filter, debris baskets and vents clear and clean.\n\nThe Luba 3 AWD stole the show at CES 2026, easily climbing slopes up to 80 percent thanks to its four-wheel drive design. This smart mower also offers wire free navigation enhanced by LiDAR and AI vision, plus adjustable cutting heights. This attractive robot lawnmower can also overcome and avoid obstacles in your yard, from tennis balls to rogue hedgehogs.\n\nBirdfy's smart 4K hummingbird feeder has a beautiful, unique design that more closely resembles an actual flower. Most importantly, it captures slow-motion video at 120 frames per second, letting you see the flap of hummingbirds' wings as they flit through your backyard. Using AI and its 8MP camera, the Hum Bloom will identify 150 different species of avian visitors.\n\nSamsung Galazy Z Trifold (Winner)\n\nA vanguard in melding eye-catching design with genuine utility, the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold achieves CES's highest honor, Best Overall. This slim device lives up to the promise of a foldable, full size tablet-phone hybrid that's as functional as it is pocketable. Its futuristic allure and seamless practicality elevate the tech while keeping it within reach.",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Kings captain is the latest in a high-profile list of partners and investors in the high-tech SoCal golf team.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles Kings center and captain Anže Kopitar will retire at the end of the 2025-26 season and like many retirees he’ll be devoting his time to a different passion: golf.\n\nKopitar is the newest investor and limited partner in the Los Angeles Golf Club, one of five teams in the TGL golf league, a newly formed team golf league in its second season that hosts matches inside an arena and features a fusion of virtual courses and high-tech, rotating greens that aims to attract a new generation of golfing fans and provide an innovative arena experience.\n\n“Myself being a pretty passionate golfer and really loving the game, following stuff and seeing the TGL getting some traction and how fun it was to watch, I didn't really think about getting the opportunity, but when the opportunity presents itself, I just kind of jumped on it,” Kopitar said.\n\nThe Kings captain said that he was approached by LAGC president Neil Hubman about becoming an investor and he was eager to be on board.\n\nKopitar’s personal experience with golf is uniquely tied to his time in Los Angeles. Hailing from Slovenia, he didn’t have much experience with golf growing up, but after his decades-long transplant to sunny SoCal, he found himself playing it more and more, especially in charity games put on by the Kings.\n\nThe competitive drive that has made him one of the best hockey players of his generation also played into getting him into golf  as well after a disappointing charity tournament performance left a sour taste in his mouth.\n\n“I wasn't really into it until I severely embarrassed myself my second year on that charity golf tournament. So I figured I’d just work at it a little bit. And then I hit the seven iron right in the sweet spot and then I was hooked,” Kopitar said.\n\nKopitar joins an investor group that includes several other notable athletes and figures in entertainment like primary owners Alexis Ohanian, Serena Williams and Venus Williams and an extended investor group that includes Giannis Antetokounmpo, Alex Morgan and Shonda Rhimes.\n\nWhile he plans to move his family back home to Slovenia when the NHL season is done, taking a stake in LAGC gives Kopitar and his family a new way to stay connected to the community that he’s called his home and left his mark on for two decades.\n\n“It'll be a great excuse for me to come here and see everybody and be a part of this community like I've been for 20 years… Both of my kiddos were born here. We have friends outside of hockey here. Now this thing that popped up with LA Golf Club,” Kopitar said. “It’ll be very fun to come back here and maybe not be as stressed as I am during the season.\"\n\nLAGC's season kicked off with a Jan. 2 match against Boston Common Golf at SoFi Center in Palm Springs, Fla. that ended in a 7-5 victory for Boston Common, the first match of many that Kopitar will have the chance to watch as a new member of the organization.\n\n“Anže represents everything we value at LAGC, elite competition, leadership and a deep connection to Los Angeles. He’s a world-class athlete, a passionate golfer, and someone who understands what it means to represent this city at the highest level. We’re proud to welcome him into our investor group.” Hubman said in LAGC’s official announcement.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

Kanai said a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable and demanded it be retracted.\n\nRelations between Japan and China worsened late last year after Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan.\n\nIn December, Japan said Chinese military aircraft locked radar on its fighter jets even though there was a safe distance between them. Tokyo is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending.\n\nLast week, China launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan for two days to warn against what it calls separatist and external forces.\n\nAt that time, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi slammed both Japan and Taiwan’s “pro-independence forces.” Wang said Japan's current leaders openly challenge China’s territorial sovereignty and the postwar international order. Japan was defeated in World War II by the United States and its allies.\n\nIn his meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in Beijing on Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping mentioned China’s and South Korea’s historical rivalry against Japan, calling on the two countries to “join hands to defend the fruits of victory in World War II and safeguard peace and stability in northeast Asia.”",

    "fullText": "It's CES week, when the tech world gathers in Las Vegas to check out the latest gadgets, prototypes, and innovations that will shape the future. Lifehacker's tech team is on the ground at the convention, tracking down big stories and cool gear.\n\nBilling itself as \"The Most Powerful Tech Event in the World,\" CES (short for \"Consumer Electronics Show\") is the Consumer Technology Association's trade convention. It began in 1967 as a small showcase for televisions and radios, but over the decades CES has become a gathering of the tribes for tech culture. Everyone is there, from huge companies like Samsung and Sony, to scores of journalists, to scrappy startups with big dreams. From innovative AI tools to electric vehicles, laptops, e-readers, and robotic dogs, CES is where tech companies show off their wares, journalists dig up the next big story, and tech insiders network and sneak a look into the future.\n\nCES is held in Las Vegas from Jan. 6-9. The Las Vegas Convention Center hosts the main show floor, but there are CES-related events at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, The Sphere, and other locations across Las Vegas.\n\nMost major electronics and technology companies are attending CES 2026 in some form. Here are some of the most vital exhibitors:\n\nSamsung Electronics: Samsung's theme this year is \"Your Companion to AI Living,\" and the focus is how artificial intelligence can enhance people's day-to-day lives.\n\nLG Electronics: Describing it as \"innovation in tune with you\" and \"affectionate intelligence,\" LG is showing off its take on AI designed to power robots, appliances, vehicles and TVs.\n\nSony: Sony's main focus this year is mobility.

This year's list of no-shows includes Apple (which never really does CES), iRobot, and Tesla. Big brands with a more limited presence include Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nAlong with the expected innovations in televisions and laptops, CES 2026 is crammed with artificial intelligence, robots, and mobility devices, and health-focused wearables. Here are some of the biggest announcements at CES 2026 so far.\n\nAt its keynote, NVIDIA unveiled Alpamayo, \"the world's first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI.\" This could be serious competition for Tesla.\n\nHP showed off a new mini desktop computer, The Eliteboard G1a. You just plug the keyboard into any monitor and go to town. Only time will tell if this is a gimmick or a new form factor.\n\nHyundai and Boston Dynamics showed off humanoid robot Atlas. But Hyundai didn't show off any new electric vehicles, suggesting a cautious outlook for the near future.\n\nBroadcom showed off Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips, providing a practical look into the future.\n\nBelow is a guide to some of the major events at CES 2026.\n\nSunday, January 4: Media Day 1 at Mandalay Bay\n\nMonday, January 5: Media Day 2 at Mandalay Bay.

    "fullText": "Fifa plans to create AI-enabled 3D avatars of every player at the 2026 World Cup to enhance the tournament's semi-automated offside technology.\n\nThis will mean creating a digital scan of all 1,248 players in the 26-man squads of the 48 teams.\n\nEach player will enter a chamber to be scanned, a process that should take just one second and only needs to be done once during their pre-tournament photo shoot.\n\nFifa says the scan \"captures highly accurate body-part dimensions\" to make more accurate offside decisions.\n\nIt expects this to mean tournament officials will be able to \"track players reliably during fast or obstructed movements\" and says final decisions will be \"displayed more realistically and in a more engaging way\".\n\nThere was controversy in the Premier League earlier this season when a Newcastle goal against Manchester City was allowed to stand.\n\nRuben Dias appeared to be jumping in the semi-automated offside graphic. This did not match the television pictures of the game.\n\nFifa hopes that by taking accurate scans of each player it can improve how these decisions are shown to supporters.\n\nThe technology was tested in Fifa's Intercontinental Cup, with Flamengo and Pyramids FC players scanned ahead of their match in December.\n\nFifa announced last month it was testing new technology which can determine if the ball goes out of play before a goal is scored. It has also developed 'real-time 3D recreation' to make line-of-sight offside decisions.",

    "description": "Big Tech is largely throwing in the towel on big, virtual-reality face computers. But they're trying again with smaller glasses like Meta's Ray-Bans.",
    "fullText": "The tech industry has spent roughly a gazillion dollars trying to convince people to strap face computers on their heads. It hasn't worked.\n\nBut the tech guys haven't given up. Their new pitch: Instead of buying bulky goggles that replace your reality with a computer-generated version of something else, what about some glasses?\n\nYou can see evidence of the switch-up with a couple of recent news stories:\n\nAt first glance, this makes a bunch of sense: People don't wear big heavy stuff on their head unless they have to — like if they're skiing, perhaps. But lots of people wear glasses. So if the tech guys want to sell new tech, they should stop trying to make things people don't wear and focus on the things people already wear.\n\nThe reality is a little more complicated: Shrinking a computer — or even parts of a computer — into something that looks, feels, and weighs like glasses is incredibly hard. The lighter and cheaper you make them, the less they can do — which makes it harder to justify why you'd wear them at all.\n\nSo when Meta says it has been selling a ton of Ray-Ban Display Glasses, which start at $800 a pair, you need to put that in context: The company sold an estimated 15,000 units in the last three months of 2025.\n\nWe are likely to get a much better sense of consumer demand for this stuff in the next couple years, as more competition arrives.\n\nGoogle plans to sell glasses that work much like Meta's this year, though I assume they will be cheaper, since they don't use the \"neural wristband\" Meta includes with its glasses. It is also working on more ambitious glasses with more functionality — seemingly like the \"Orion\" headset Meta showed off in 2024, but has yet to start selling.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has reportedly shifted resources from its Apple Vision Pro so it can make some Meta-style glasses itself. And Meta is plugging away at \"Phoenix\" — a headset that's bigger than its Ray-Bans but still much smaller than the Quest headsets it has been selling for years. Those were supposed to launch in 2026 but have been pushed back to 2027, Business Insider's Jyoti Mann reported this week.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems like he's not losing sleep over California's proposed wealth tax.\n\nWhen Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow asked Huang about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Huang said that the potential levy hasn't crossed his mind once and that he is \"trying to build the future of AI.\"\n\n\"I've got to tell you, I have not even thought about it once,\" Huang told Ludlow. \"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it. I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\n\"We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is,\" Huang added.\n\nHuang is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes, which estimated his net worth at approximately $162.6 billion as of January 6. Most of Huang's wealth comes from his around 3% stake in Nvidia, which just showed off its new Vera Rubin chips at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nBased on his net worth as reported by Forbes, a 5% tax on his total wealth would amount to more than $8 billion, to be paid over five years, according to the proposed plan.\n\nThe California wealth tax was proposed by the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West in order to offset anticipated budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nA wealth tax is different from an income tax and is a levy on an individual's entire net worth instead of annual income. The union estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state and apply to the around 200 billionaires who are residents of California.\n\nThe proposal is still very far from reality and would need 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be voted on or rejected by California voters.\n\nBillionaires from Palmer Luckey to David Sacks have already voiced their full-throated disapproval.\n\nAccording to filings viewed by Business Insider, Larry Page, the Google cofounder, converted many of his assets from California to Delaware in December to derisk them from the potential wealth tax. His departure meets an end-of-2025 deadline, since the tax, if passed, would only apply to billionaires who are still residents of California on January 1, 2026.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his wealthy clients and warned that they would \"permanently relocate\" if the California billionaire tax comes to pass.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "Yasmin Santos left Meta to start Altar Native, an herbal alcohol alternative. Her products are taking off among sober-curious and stressed execs.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yasmin Santos, a former Meta ad specialist and the founder of the herbal alcohol alternative brand Altar Native. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I stopped drinking in 2018, it was for my health, not my career. It turned out to be great for both.\n\nI gave up alcohol to heal a gut issue, thinking it would just be temporary. But when I was finally healthy enough to drink again, I realized something had shifted. My body no longer wanted it. The buzz wasn't fun; it just felt wrong.\n\nStill, I missed the ritual. I missed the ease alcohol could bring in social settings. At the same time, I was caring for my mother, who was bedridden with early-onset dementia. I could see how much pain she was in, and how the pharmaceuticals she relied on often did more harm than good. I prayed for another way and felt a clear answer: \"The plants are there for you.\"\n\nThat's when I discovered herbalism — and the vast world of plants that humans have used for thousands of years to support their well-being. I learned about kava, CBD, kratom, and damiana — each with different properties that our ancestors used to calm, energize, or restore balance. It was like opening a door into a forgotten world of natural solutions.\n\nI'd bring little dropper bottles to social gatherings, letting friends try my blends. The response was overwhelming. People wanted to know where they could buy them. That was in 2021, and the spark became my company, Altar Native.\n\nThrough 2022, I refined the branding and recipes, and by January 2024, we were officially launched. I started small, still freelancing in marketing to fund the business, and using an $11,000 inheritance from my mom as seed money.\n\nBefore I started selling the tinctures themselves, I'd tested the idea with a \"cater bar\" — a mobile alcohol-free bar I could take to festivals and private events. It helped me prove the concept and reach my first customers. Between the events and tincture sales, I've had a 115% growth rate in the year since, and I'm projecting that I'll reach months with six-figure sales in the next few years.\n\nWhat has surprised me most is our customer base. I thought my audience would be \"wellness girlies\" who are into yoga and Pilates. But our biggest fans turned out to be van lifers, surfers, climbers, and outdoor adventurers; the sort of people who want to connect deeply to nature and stay clear-headed doing it.\n\nOur second demographic emerged unexpectedly: professional men, aged 40 to 55, often high-level business professionals. They order our \"Adapt\" blend, which helps regulate cortisol and balance energy.\n\nThey don't want alcohol, but they still want something to take the edge off — and since I come from the same corporate background, I get it, and I know exactly how to create what they're looking for.\n\nWe're riding a wave. Since the pandemic, people have woken up to the reality that how they care for their bodies defines their quality of life. They're drinking less, questioning what they put in their systems, and searching for alternatives that help them feel good without dulling their senses.\n\nThat's where I see Altar Native: at the intersection of wellness and ritual, bridging ancient plant wisdom with modern life. I call it \"herbal mixology\": the art of crafting functional, plant-based blends that elevate your mood and state of mind, without the use of alcohol.\n\nOur tinctures can be mixed into mocktails, added to tea or sparkling water, or taken straight on the tongue. My personal routine includes our \"Ecstatic\" blend in the morning with cacao instead of coffee to keep me focused without the afternoon crash. I take \"Adapt\" throughout the day when I need balance, and \"Lucid\" at night to calm my nerves and stave off anxiety.\n\nI haven't taken on investors yet. I've bootstrapped everything — through Meta income, freelancing, and careful reinvestment. My goal is to scale sustainably, eventually moving into ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages while staying true to our values of intentionality and environmental stewardship.\n\nMy co-manufacturer in Pennsylvania handles extraction, bottling, labeling, and fulfillment — allowing me to focus on building the brand.\n\nI'd love to grow Altar Native into a major player in this space, and maybe even exit one day, if it means partnering with a company that shares our vision for conscious, plant-based living.\n\nI was in a sorority in college, and each graduating senior was given a paper plate superlative award based on their personality and habits. Mine was \"Most likely to sell a million-dollar business to 'Shark Tank.'\" We'll see!\n\nBut for now, I'm focused on being a steward of this idea: helping it grow, and helping others find natural ways to reconnect with themselves.\n\nBecause for me, this isn't just about business. It's about remembering what the earth has always offered us — and choosing to listen.",

    "title": "This Personalized Running Spreadsheet Is My Tech Upgrade of the Week",
    "description": "Use my template below, or grab a blank spreadsheet and start logging now.",
    "fullText": "There's something deeply satisfying about tracking your running progress in a spreadsheet you built yourself. No algorithm showing off other people's workouts, no concerns about what happens to your data if the company pivots or shuts down. Just you, your numbers, and a system designed exactly the way you want it. And when I wrote about this earlier this year, I received some truly heartwarming messages from runners who'd been thinking the same thing. So many of us runners are tired of relying on apps, and we're instead drawn to a simple, customizable spreadsheet.\n\nSure, there's no shortage of fitness tracking apps out there. Strava, Garmin Connect, Nike Run Club—they all have their strengths. But owning your own spreadsheet offers something different: complete control. You can design your system to match your specific training needs. I also appreciate the intentionality that gets introduced when you have to design your own tracking system.\n\nThere's also the simple economics. Spreadsheets are free. They don't have premium tiers, they don't expire when you stop paying, and they don't suddenly lock features you've been using for months. Plus, creating custom charts and graphs to visualize your progress becomes a matter of a few clicks rather than hoping the app updates to include the exact view you're looking for.\n\nThis is not the first spreadsheet I've shared with my Lifehacker community, but this might be my magnum opus: a running tracker that logs every workout, calculates weekly mileage automatically, visualizes training load over time, and helps me plan toward specific race goals. It's evolved over months of use, shaped by what actually matters when I lace up my shoes each morning.\n\nHere she is. If the idea of a spreadsheet appeals to you, but you hate my spreadsheet, that's fine! I'm not even crying about it! Let's take a look at how you can perfect your own DIY running tracker.\n\nThe key to a sustainable running spreadsheet is tracking what actually helps you without drowning in data entry. Here's what I've found worth logging:\n\nThe essentials: Date, distance, time, and pace. These four fields form the backbone of any useful running log. They let you calculate weekly mileage, monitor whether you're getting faster, and spot trends over time.\n\nThe context: Route or location, weather conditions, and how you felt during the run. These qualitative details help you understand the story behind the numbers. That slower pace might make sense when you remember it was 95 degrees, or you were running hills, or you resolved to run slower now in order to run faster later.\n\nThe training details: Type of run (easy, tempo, intervals, long run), elevation gain if relevant to your training, and any specific workout structure. This helps you ensure you're balancing different types of training rather than just logging junk miles.\n\nWhat I don't track: Every single calorie burned (those estimates are notoriously unreliable anyway).\n\nStart simple. Create columns for your essential data and add a few basic formulas: total weekly mileage, average pace for the week, maybe a running total for the month. Google Sheets and Excel both make this straightforward, and you can always add complexity later.\n\nConsider organizing with separate tabs for different purposes. I keep one tab as my main running log where each row represents a workout, another tab for monthly summaries that automatically calculate totals and averages, and a third for goal tracking where I can see my progress toward specific races or mileage targets.\n\nThe beauty of building your own system is that you can iterate. After a month of tracking, you'll notice what information you actually reference and what just clutters the spreadsheet. Maybe you thought you'd care about cadence but never look at that column, or perhaps you wish you'd been tracking which shoes you wore to monitor when they need replacing. Adjust accordingly.\n\nNumbers in rows tell one story, but charts and graphs reveal patterns you might otherwise miss. Create a simple line graph showing your weekly mileage over time and you'll instantly see when you're ramping up training, when you backed off for recovery, and whether your current volume is sustainable.\n\nI like having a few standard visualizations: a line chart of weekly mileage, a bar graph comparing monthly totals across the year, and a scatter plot showing the relationship between distance and pace to spot my comfortable running ranges. None of this requires advanced spreadsheet skills—most programs will generate decent charts automatically once you select your data.\n\nThe point here isn't to use my exact system, but to recognize that you can build something better suited to your needs than any one-size-fits-all app. Your training is unique to you—your goals, your schedule, your body, your definition of progress. Why not track it in a way that reflects that? Keep what works, discard what doesn't, and enjoy this life upgrade.",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "description": "Chinese humanoid robot makers will dominate CES 2026, with nearly a dozen firms and a record Hong Kong delegation showcasing next-gen machines.",
    "fullText": "Chinese robotics players are emerging as a major force at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026), with a strong presence of humanoid robots set to take place in Las Vegas from January 4 to 9.\n\nMore than a dozen companies from China will exhibit at the event, joined by a record-sized delegation from Hong Kong.\n\nExpected participants include Unitree Robotics, AgiBot, Galbot, EngineAI, Noetix Robotics, and the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Centre, also known as X-Humanoid, reports China online media outlets. Hangzhou-based Unitree plans to showcase its \"next-generation humanoids\", while AgiBot will present its full product lineup.\n\nLast week, Chinese robotics firm UBTech reached a key milestone by producing its 1,000th Walker S2 humanoid robot at its Liuzhou manufacturing facility.\n\nChina's advances in humanoid robotics are no longer confined to research centers or industrial labs.\n\nIn Beijing, humanoid machines are now appearing in retail environments next to common consumer products, highlighting how quickly the technology is entering everyday commerce. This shift from experimentation to commercialization is set to gain international attention at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, where China's growing influence in the sector will be prominently on display.\n\nOfficial CES figures show that Chinese companies make up the majority of exhibitors in the humanoid robotics category this year. Of the 38 companies participating, 21 are from China, giving the country more than half of the total presence.\n\nThe group includes well-known names such as Unitree Robotics, alongside newcomers like AgiBot and Noetix Robotics, many of which are using the event to pursue international expansion, reports Ajupress.\n\nThe size and diversity of China's showing highlights its growing influence in a sector widely viewed as a critical intersection of advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence.\n\nIndustry analysts note that the number of exhibitors suggests a broad, coordinated effort to establish leadership before the global humanoid market fully takes shape.\n\nChina's advantage is also evident in intellectual property and production capability. Over the past five years, Chinese entities have filed 7,705 humanoid-related patents, compared with 1,561 in the United States, according to a December report by Morgan Stanley. At the same time, Chinese manufacturers are pushing rapidly toward large-scale production, reinforcing their lead beyond research and design, reports Ajupress.\n\nChinese technology companies registered a major presence at CES 2026, with robotics, AI, and consumer electronics set to dominate their showcases.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), Unitree sales manager Pedro Zheng invited visitors via LinkedIn last month to \"experience\" the company's next-generation humanoid robots at the event. Hangzhou-based Unitree previously drew attention at CES with a range of humanoid and quadruped robots, underscoring the rapid expansion of its product lineup.\n\nAgiBot, founded by former Huawei \"Genius Youth\" recruit Peng Zhihui, has also confirmed its participation. In a post on X, the Shanghai-based company said it would present its full product portfolio and industry-leading solutions.\n\nFounding partner Yao Maoqing told the Global Times that the showcase reflects AgiBot's ambition to build an ecosystem of humanoid robots capable of operating across industries, environments, and everyday life, moving beyond single-task machines toward embodied intelligence.\n\nChinese firms will face competition from global players such as Boston Dynamics, now owned by South Korean automaker Hyundai. Boston Dynamics announced last month that its new Atlas humanoid robot will make its public debut at CES 2026, according to SCMP.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Br0hD6jUw&pp=ygUdcm9ib3QgaW50ZXJlc3RpbmcgZW5naW5lZXJpbmfSBwkJTQoBhyohjO8%3D\n\nThe Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center will display several Tiangong Walker models, highlighting full autonomy and \"one-brain, many-machines\" coordination for industrial sorting and heavy-duty tasks. Booster Robotics will showcase its Booster K1 and T1 platforms, focusing on multitasking, scenario-ready robotic systems, according to the Global Times.\n\nBeyond robotics, Chinese smart eyewear makers Rokid, Even Realities, and XReal are expected to exhibit, alongside robot vacuum cleaner brands Dreame Technology and Roborock. Lenovo Group will host its largest-ever Tech World event at CES as part of its \"Hybrid AI\" strategy, featuring speakers including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan.\n\nHong Kong will also send its largest CES delegation to date, with 60 tech companies showcasing innovations across AI, health, smart cities, and sports technology.",

    "description": "Here are the highlights from the world's largest technology trade show happening in Las Vegas, including a new Nvidia chip architecture.",
    "fullText": "The tech scene is starting the year off strong.\n\nOn January 6, the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest and most influential technology trade show, is set to kick off in Las Vegas.\n\nA CES keynote presentation of a new chip from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang already got the show started.\n\nBased on early announcements, the audience can expect novelties this year like the Sweekar AI pet that physically grows, robots that can bend backwards, and a wallpaper TV that is only 0.35 inches thick. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee is also on the scene to report on the latest autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nFollow this post over the rest of the week to keep up with the most groundbreaking tech at the 2026 CES.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang officially introduced the Vera Rubin architecture, which is now in production and expected to ramp up in volume in the second half of the year. This move follows a blockbuster year for its Blackwell chip, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.\n\nIn a press briefing ahead of Huang's keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as \"six chips that make one AI supercomputer.\"\n\n\"Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,\" Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.\n\nHuang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.\n\nRubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.\n\nNamed after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.\n\nThe Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including Amazon Web Services, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.\n\nThe accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.\n\nHuang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.\n\nNvidia's Huang also used his presentation to unveil Alpamayo, a new open AI model and toolset designed to bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHuang said that Mercedes-Benz cars powered by the system are already expected to hit the road in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" said Huang.\n\nAlpamayo is Nvidia's first full-stack push into self-driving technology, with the goal of using vision-language-action models to handle rare and unfamiliar driving scenarios.\n\nMercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said during the presentation that he recently tested the Nvidia-powered system on public roads and drove for more than an hour through heavy traffic.\n\n\"It feels that the car is on rails. You're just driving, and it does everything,\" Källenius said. \"If you're moving an object that weighs 4,000 pounds at 50 miles an hour, sorry is not going to cut it.\"\n\nBoston Dynamics is teaming up with Google DeepMind to integrate the Gemini AI into its humanoid robot, Atlas, and its robot dog called Spot. Unveiled with Boston Dynamics's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, at CES on Monday, the partnership aims to let Atlas understand natural-language commands, adapt on the fly, and interact more naturally with people, with the goal of pushing the machine from lab demos into real-world work.\n\nExecutives of Boston Dynamics said in a press release that by embedding a foundation model, Atlas could move beyond preprogrammed actions to navigating unfamiliar environments and identifying and manipulating objects, all of which are core skills for manual labor.\n\n\"Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works,\" said CEO Robert Playter in the press release, \"And it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children—useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling.\"",

    "fullText": "A photo of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in US custody may have turned him into an accidental fashion influencer.\n\nWhen US President Donald Trump posted a photo of Maduro on January 3 after he was captured by US forces, internet sleuths quickly identified the outfit — and haven't stopped talking about it since. Maduro appears to be wearing a gray Nike Tech fleece set in the picture.\n\nFollowing the January 3 post, searches for \"Nike Tech\" on Google spiked, according to Google Trends.\n\nThe online conversations about the athleisure line also surged dramatically on X, intelligence platform PeakMetrics told Business Insider. Nike Tech was mentioned in over 5,000 X posts a day between January 3 and January 5, according to PeakMetrics. That's up from the roughly 325 posts a day it averaged from November 1 to December 31.\n\nOn TikTok, users posted AI-generated versions of the photo and poked fun at the fashion choice. Some users joked that it was a new Nike campaign. Others made \"steal the look\" posts that broke down the cost of the full outfit, including the darkened eye mask and ear covering. The jacket and joggers cost over $200 combined.\n\nVENEZUELAN PRESIDENT PUT IN NIKE TECH,SHIPPED TO NEW YORKI #venezuela #president #fyp #news #update\n\nAs of Monday morning, the style of the Nike Tech fleece zip-up jacket that Maduro was photographed in was sold out on Nike's US website in several sizes.\n\nThe fleece jacket already appeared to be a hot item before Maduro donned it on the Navy ship USS Iwo Jima. It appeared to be partially sold out in November and December, according to screenshots archived on Wayback Machine.\n\nIt's been the subject of a viral debate in recent weeks, with some young men bragging on social media about being \"team Nike Tech\" or \"team quarter-zip\" to show whether they're a part of Corporate America or not.\n\nSome members of Gen Z and Gen Alpha also had their eyes on Nike Tech for the holidays. A clip of a girl opening her Christmas gift, a Nike Tech set, garnered over 1 million likes on TikTok and earned a comment from Nike itself.\n\nNike also made its way onto teens' wish lists this year, and it dominated Piper Sandler's semi-annual teen survey as the No. 1 clothing brand in fall 2025.\n\nMaduro, the longtime Venezuelan leader, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in an overnight raid in Caracas over the weekend and taken to the US, where Maduro faces federal charges.",

    "description": "Small drones are \"the defining threat of our time,\" Brig. Gen. Ross said, requiring a layered defense network to stop them.",
    "fullText": "The US military is racing to develop better defenses against drones, but there's no silver bullet, no wonder weapon, that will single-handedly defeat everything, the commander of the Pentagon's new counter-drone force said.\n\nJoint Interagency Task Force 401 says stopping drones isn't about one weapon or system. The counter-drone fight will require a mix of different tools, from ways to physically shoot down drones to electronic and other non-kinetic solutions.\n\nIt also demands easier, faster processes for testing and buying systems across the services.\n\nThe task force was created last fall to expedite counter-drone technologies across the Department of Defense, replacing the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, which was established in 2019. Since its establishment, the task force has assessed and contributed to the US military's counter-drone arsenal, including forces at home and abroad.\n\nBut there's no one system they've found that can stop small uncrewed aerial systems, or UAS, which the task force's commander, Brig. Gen. Matt Ross, called \"the defining threat of our time.\"\n\n\"There's no silver bullet for counter-UAS. There's just not,\" Ross said last month at a media roundtable. \"If there was, we would already have it,\" he added.\n\nInstead, the task force is focused on a suite of technologies for layered, integrated protection from drones. \"Our formations must be able to detect, track, identify, and defeat these systems anywhere on the planet,\" Ross said. \"This requires us to layer our defenses by integrating sensors with kinetic and non-kinetic effectors and battle management systems into a responsive, interoperable network.\"\n\nHe said that many defense technologies already exist for countering medium-sized drones, which the Pentagon classifies as Group 3, but more work remains in smaller drones under Group 1 and 2, UAS such as the quadcopters that dominate in Ukraine.\n\nAnd the counter-drone problem isn't just about what systems are needed to protect service members and civilians. \"The technology is not going to solve this problem for us. We can't field a system that will stop every drone. It will all come down to the installation commander or the person responsible for that site and how they use the tools that we provide them,\" Ross said.\n\nIn its first 100 days, the task force has identified a key goal: creating a shared command-and-control system that makes it easier for different teams and regions to share data. It also wants to build a marketplace where the military services, law enforcement, and other agencies can find counter-drone systems suited to their specific threats, review performance data and user feedback, and potentially buy those systems in one place.\n\nThe task force notably isn't operating in isolation. There's overlap between the task force's focus on stopping Group 3 drones, systems like Shield AI's V-BAT or the Army's AAI RQ-7, and the responsibilities of the Golden Dome missile defense project, which has to include defenses for Group 3 drones.\n\nThe task force plans to share data with the Golden Dome project, and Ross said he's currently discussing what that looks like with Space Force's Gen. Michael Guetlein.\n\nAnother priority for the task force is helping protect against small drones at major events, including the FIFA World Cup this year, with matches set to be held at 11 large stadiums in cities across the US.\n\nRoss said that based on US forces overseas, \"we're heavily indexed against Group 3 systems, and those are larger systems that fly a longer distance and carry heavier payloads. And I want to make sure that we have just as robust protection against Group 1 and Group 2 systems that are smaller and much more likely to be seen over a widely attended gathering, stadium, or a watch party specifically for the World Cup.\"",

    "description": "To prevent students from relying on artificial intelligence to write and do homework for them, many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments and having students finish essays in class.",
    "fullText": "Higher Education\n\n AI Nudges Syracuse Professors Back Toward Blue Books, In-Class Work\n\n To prevent students from relying on artificial intelligence to write and do homework for them, many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments and having students finish essays in class.\n\n December 23, 2025 • \n Emalyn Muzzy, syracuse.com\n\n Facebook\n\n LinkedIn\n\n Twitter\n\nPrint\n\n Email\n\n (TNS) — Oksana Korol remembers her parents telling her how they took oral exams in college. Professors would give them a problem to solve. They had 10 minutes to think it through, then explain their answer and reasoning.\n\n“That is completely AI-proof,” said Korol, a biology professor at Onondaga Community College.\n\nKorol, like countless other professors in Central New York, has had to change the way she teaches her class and assesses students’ learning due to the ballooning use of generative artificial intelligence. Many, like her, are relying on those old-school techniques to AI-proof their tests and papers.\n\nAs AI continues to push itself into our everyday lives, it has created a culture of do or die for higher education. Professors have to either adapt their classes or risk students using AI to avoid thinking through tough assignments. Universities can offer courses teaching students to think critically about AI or assume young minds already know how to ask tough questions.\n\nIf higher education as a whole does not adapt, it could be left behind as students embrace AI in their studies.\n\nAt the three largest educational institutions in Syracuse — Syracuse University, Le Moyne College and Onondaga Community College — many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments while students use AI to study in futuristic ways.\n\nOCC and SU student handbooks outline how using AI to complete entire assignments and papers is considered plagiarism or academic misconduct. Le Moyne College does not have a college-wide AI policy, although Provost Jim Hannan said the institution is starting the process to create guidance.\n\nWithout uniform guidance from school leadership, it’s often up to professors to figure out how to handle AI. Some professors spend free time teaching themselves how to wield AI in a productive manner. Others side-eye the technology.\n\nAll of them, however, must understand how it impacts their students’ learning.\n\n“We have to learn how to use (AI) first. That arms race is exhausting and overwhelming when our workloads, admittedly, are already pretty heavy,” said OCC professor Michelle Malinovsky.\n\nIN-CLASS ASSESSMENTS MAKE A RETURN\nWhen a student uses an AI prompt generator to write a research paper, there are signs the student didn’t do it themselves. Malinovsky said older AI versions used the same rhetoric model. Le Moyne English professor Ann Ryan said a student’s paper may be too clean.\n\nThere is no true way to prove a student used AI, unless the student accidentally leaves their prompt in the paper or admits to it, said Rubin.\n\nWhile there are AI detection software, most don’t work, Rubin and Malinovsky said. For that reason, SU and OCC do not recommend using the programs.\n\n“It’s incredibly inaccurate. It’s always reactionary and it causes a huge issue in terms of equity and bias,” Malinovsky said.\n\nSU, Le Moyne and OCC either encourage or require professors to decide how they want students to use AI. They each have three similar pre-made policies professors can put into their syllabuses.\n\nThe policies state that AI cannot be used under any circumstance, students can use limited AI or AI can be used freely within reason.\n\n“It’s a first step of allowing faculty to think about the use and letting students know how an individual faculty member plans to allow or not allow on assessment in the classroom,” said SU Chief Digital Officer Jeff Rubin.\n\nWith the traditional research paper becoming harder to assign, many professors are flipping the classroom. For example, Ryan has students writing in class and brainstorming with classmates.\n\n“I’m workshopping papers in class as students are writing them. Traditionally in a literature class you’d say, ‘You got a 12-page paper due in three weeks,’” Ryan said. “So what we’re doing is we’re writing papers in class.”\n\nMalinovsky, who teaches English and is also a librarian, said she has implemented similar practices. She encourages students to send pictures of handwritten assignments.\n\n“(AI) challenges professors to rethink the assessment. Perhaps if they’re worried about AI use, then bring some of that assessment back into the classroom,” Rubin said.\n\nProfessors have also started to make work more reflective. For Ryan’s class, students had to add a one-to-two page coda on how what they learned in class impacted them to their final paper. They then shared that reflection with the class.\n\nLearning assessments appear to be returning to traditional, in-person techniques. Korol said she has done away with online exams and implemented more in-class tests.\n\n“I think that we’re back to the blue books and we’re maybe going back to the oral exams,” Korol at OCC said.\n\nEven with the potential for misuse, AI can be a powerful tool if harnessed correctly. While assessments embrace older techniques, study strategies are flying forward.\n\nMultiple professors said they see students upload class slides or paste class notes into a chatbot and ask it to create study tools like a practice quiz or study questions. Anthropic , the creator of AI bot Claude,analyzed student chatsand found they also use it to troubleshoot coding problems or synthesize complex information.\n\nKorol has gone one step farther and created a prototype AI tutor, where she uploads questions for students to answer. The AI tutor knows not just the correct answer but the important ideas behind it, meaning students can express the answers in different ways.\n\n“The tutor has been specifically told not to give out the answer, and instead it’s been told to keep asking leading questions. And if you read through this conversation, you will see that the hints are getting more and more transparent as we go along,” Korol said.\n\nKorol has not yet used the tutor with students but is trying to figure out how to deploy the app for campus-wide use.\n\nTEACHING ABOUT AI\nSU is taking AI education one step further: it has begun offering classes and a minor about the impact of AI. Beginning in fall 2026, the Maxwell School of Public Affairs will offer the AI Policy minor. Classes include programming and public policy analysis.\n\nThe idea is not to teach students how to create or use AI, but rather to think critically about its real world applications, said program director Johannes Himmelreich.\n\n“AI is going to have significant social impact. This will create policy challenges that require an understanding of the technology as well as the policy analysis skills,” Himmelreich said.\n\nMalinovsky described generative AI as the “wild west.” There are no specific federal regulations on AI, with regulators instead relying on a patchwork of laws. On Dec. 11, President Donald Trump put out an executive order blocking states from creating their own regulations.\n\nHimmelreich wants students to be able to tackle topics such as how to grow AI without destroying the environment, how AI could impact warfare or if AI could be conscious enough to deserve rights.\n\nThe idea of a minor exploring AI has been under discussion since 2020, a couple years before the public explosion of generative AI.\n\n“ChatGPT wasn’t a technological surprise at all. I mean, I’ve been in demos that OpenAI gave for the older models that weren’t a chat interface. And the difference is that OpenAI changed its policy around how accessible they want the technology to be,” Himmelreich said.\n\nThinking critically about AI is a core part of Milton Santiago’s Generative AI Filmmaking class. He launched the three-credit course this past fall, teaching students how to use generative AI in filmmaking while also discussing its impact.\n\n“We can intercept a lot of the ethical and moral questions that surround these tools currently, which actually I think is probably the biggest benefit of the class,” Santiago said. “Students do have to wrestle with questions of where does creativity begin and end? What does authorship actually look like? Is the environmental impact as this technology stands today worth using the tools?”\n\nTeaching about AI is not only happening in classes or studies surrounding the topic. Malinovsky said she talks about AI a lot in her English classes. To help her students better understand why they need to do their own work, she sometimes has students do the work themselves then ask an AI chatbot to do the work. Then the students compare and discuss.\n\nAs generative AI continues to develop, faculty are learning how to use it along with students. Some, like Ryan, are skeptical of its application and try to avoid it while others, like Santiago , spend hours figuring out the best application for students.\n\n“This has shaken up what education does in a way that other technologies haven’t,” Hannan said.",

    "description": "As more workers use AI, a recent study adds to growing evidence the tech doesn’t always deliver on promises of boosted productivity.",
    "fullText": "Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture.\n\nIt’s like a new telling of the “Tortoise and the Hare”: A group of experienced software engineers entered into an experiment where they were tasked with completing some of their work with the help of AI tools. Thinking like the speedy hare, the developers expected AI to expedite their work and increase productivity. Instead, the technology slowed them down more. The AI-free tortoise approach, in the context of the experiment, would have been faster.\n\nThe results of this experiment, part of a recent study, came as a surprise to the software developers tasked with using AI—and to the study’s authors, Joel Becker and Nate Rush, technical staff members of nonprofit technology research organization Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR).\n\nThe researchers enlisted 16 software developers, who had an average of five years of experience, to conduct 246 tasks, each one a part of projects on which they were already working. For half the tasks, the developers were allowed to use AI tools—most of them selected code editor Cursor Pro or Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet—and for the other half, the developers conducted the tasks on their own.\n\nBelieving the AI tools would make them more productive, the software developers predicted the technology would reduce their task completion time by an average of 24%. Instead, AI resulted in their task time ballooning to 19% greater than when they weren’t using the technology.\n\n“While I like to believe that my productivity didn’t suffer while using AI for my tasks, it’s not unlikely that it might not have helped me as much as I anticipated or maybe even hampered my efforts,” Philipp Burckhardt, a participant in the study, wrote in a blog post about his experience.\n\nSo where did the hares veer off the path? The experienced developers, in the midst of their own projects, likely approached their work with plenty of additional context their AI assistants did not have, meaning they had to retrofit their own agenda and problem-solving strategies into the AI’s outputs, which they also spent ample time debugging, according to the study.\n\n“The majority of developers who participated in the study noted that even when they get AI outputs that are generally useful to them—and speak to the fact that AI generally can often do bits of very impressive work, or sort of very impressive work—these developers have to spend a lot of time cleaning up the resulting code to make it actually fit for the project,” study author Rush told Fortune.\n\nOther developers lost time writing prompts for the chatbots or waiting around for the AI to generate results.\n\nThe results of the study contradict lofty promises about AI’s ability to transform the economy and workforce, including a 15% boost to U.S. GDP by 2035 and eventually a 25% increase in productivity.  In fact, many companies have yet to see a return on AI investments. An MIT report published in August found out of 300 AI deployments, only 5% achieved rapid revenue acceleration.  Only 6% of companies fully trust AI to run core business practices, according to a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services research report published last month.\n\nBut Rush and Becker have shied away from making sweeping claims about what the results of their study mean for the future of AI.\n\nFor one, the study’s sample was small and non-generalizable, including only a specialized group of people to whom these AI tools were brand new. The study also measures technology at a specific moment in time, the authors said, not ruling out the possibility that AI tools could be developed in the future that would indeed help developers enhance their workflow.\n\nThe purpose of the study was, broadly speaking, to pump the brakes on the torrid implementation of AI in the workplace and elsewhere, acknowledging more data about AI’s actual effects need to be made known and accessible before more decisions are made about its applications.\n\n“Some of the decisions we’re making right now around development and deployment of these systems are potentially very high consequence,” Rush said. “If we’re going to do that, let’s not just take the obvious answer. Let’s make high-quality measurements.”\n\nEconomists have already asserted that METR’s research aligns with broader narratives on AI and productivity. While AI is beginning to chip away at entry-level positions, according to LinkedIn chief economic opportunity officer Aneesh Raman, it may offer diminishing returns for skilled workers such as experienced software developers.\n\n“For those people who have already had 20 years, or in this specific example, five years of experience, maybe it’s not their main task that we should look for and force them to start using these tools if they’re already well functioning in the job with their existing work methods,” Anders Humlum, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, told Fortune.\n\nHumlum has similarly conducted research on AI’s impact on productivity. He found in a working study from May that among 25,000 workers in 7,000 workplaces in Denmark—a country with similar AI uptake as the U.S.—productivity improved a modest 3% among employees using the tools.\n\nHumlum’s research supports MIT economist and Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu’s assertion that markets have overestimated productivity gains from AI. Acemoglu argues only 4.6% of tasks within the U.S. economy will be made more efficient with AI.\n\n“In a rush to automate everything, even the processes that shouldn’t be automated, businesses will waste time and energy and will not get any of the productivity benefits that are promised,” Acemoglu previously wrote for Fortune. “The hard truth is that getting productivity gains from any technology requires organizational adjustment, a range of complementary investments, and improvements in worker skills, via training and on-the-job learning.”\n\nThe case of the software developers’ hampered productivity points to this need for critical thought on when AI tools are implemented, Humlum said. While previous research on AI productivity has looked at self-reported data or specific and contained tasks, data on challenges from skilled workers using the technology complicate the picture.\n\n“In the real world, many tasks are not as easy as just typing into ChatGPT,” Humlum said. “Many experts have a lot of experience [they’ve] accumulated that is highly beneficial, and we should not just ignore that and give up on that valuable expertise that has been accumulated.”\n\n“I would just take this as a good reminder to be very cautious about when to use these tools,” he added.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 20, 2025.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei doesn't seem to mind angering tech CEOs, whether it's with his warnings about AI or pushing export controls.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei doesn't mince words.\n\nHe's rankled some rival tech CEOs by boldly predicting that AI could wipe out half of entry-level, white-collar jobs and that the upheaval could happen between now and the next five years.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, I warn about these things not to be a prophet of doom, but because warning about them is the first step towards solving them,\" Amodei said in December during The New York Times' DealBook Summit.\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Amodei still has a lot to warn about. By his own admission, the longtime AI researcher turned executive has said his vision for the future has led some to dismiss him as a \"doomer,\" even as he thinks AI could unlock a 150-year lifespan.\n\n\"Actual people who are building the technology, they're excited about the potential, but they're also worried,\" he said during the December event. \"They're worried about the national security risks. They're worried about alignment of the models; they're worried about the economic impacts of the models.\"\n\nUnder Amodei's leadership, Anthropic, once the underdog of the AI startups, is poised to remain a major part of the race.\n\nHere's a look at Amodei's life and career so far.\n\nDario Amodei was born in 1983 in San Francisco to Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei. A few years later, his sister Daniela, who would later help him cofound Anthropic in 2021, followed. Engel worked on library renovation and construction projects. Amodei's father was a leatherworker raised in a small town near the Italian island of Elba.\n\nDespite growing up in what became Big Tech's cradle, Amodei said he was much more interested in hard sciences. His sister said Amodei's intelligence was apparent from an early age. She told Bloomberg that her brother would declare \"counting days,\" seeing how high he could go.\n\n\"It'd be like a whole day,\" she said. \"What kind of 3-year-old has that attention span?\"\n\nAfter attending Lowell High School, Amodei studied physics at Caltech before transferring to Stanford to complete his degree. He was pursuing a graduate degree at Princeton when Riccardo Amodei died from a rare illness. His father's death was a seminal moment, tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz wrote. Amodei shifted from studying theoretical physics to biophysics. Amodei told Kantrowitz that the survival rate of his father's illness improved rapidly in just a few years after his death.\n\nIt's a lesson that Anthropic's CEO said remains with him.\n\n\"I get really angry when someone's like, 'This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down,'\" Amodei told Kantrowitz, who writes the Big Techology newsletter. \"You heard what I just said, my father died because of cures that could have happened a few years [earlier]. I understand the benefit of this technology.\"\n\nIn 2011, Amodei obtained a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton. During postdoctoral research at Stanford, Amodei told Kantrowitz that he saw how artificial intelligence could help researchers like him tackle questions in biology that seemed \"beyond human scale.\" In 2014, Andrew Ng, a computer science professor at Stanford and cofounder of Coursera, recruited Amodei to join him at Baidu, a Chinese search engine.\n\nWhile working on speech recognition systems at Baidu, Amodei said he got the inclination of AI scaling, the theory that by increasing everything feeding into AI, the performance improves.\n\n\"I noticed that the models started to do better and better as you gave them more data, as you made the models larger, as you trained them for longer,\" Amodei told podcaster Lex Fridman in 2024. \"And I didn't measure things precisely in those days, but along with colleagues, we very much got the informal sense that the more data and the more compute and the more training you put into these models, the better they perform.\"\n\nElon Musk and Sam Altman, then friends, assembled a group of leading AI thinkers for a dinner at a Menlo Park hotel. Musk, Wired later reported, wanted to know if it was too late for a rival AI lab to rise to challenge Google, planting the seeds for what would become OpenAI.\n\nAmodei, who, according to Kantrowitz, was at the dinner, elected to join Google instead. While at Google, Amodei published well-regarded research laying out potential concerns for AI advancements. But after just 10 months at the tech giant, Amodei left for OpenAI.\n\nAt OpenAI, Amodei played a big role in the development of GPT-2 and 3, the startup's large language models. His experience galvanized his belief in the power of scaling, but it also reinforced he desire to tie AI advacements to safety.\n\n\"You don't tell the models what their values are just by pouring more compute into them,\" Amodei told Fortune in 2023. \"And so there were a set of people who believed in those two ideas.\"\n\nOver time, Amodei said he lost faith that OpenAI's leaders shared his beliefs. In 2020, after rising to become OpenAI's vice president of research, Amodei quit.\n\nThe breakup remains a major point of conversation around Silicon Valley.\n\nDuring the December event, Amodei took multiple perceived swipes at Altman, even as he repeatedly refused to directly name OpenAI's CEO.\n\nAmodei said that Anthropic was cautiously trying to thread the needle between the enormous investment required for data center construction and the risk of overextending itself. In contrast, he said others in AI are \"yoloing and who pull the risk dial too far.\"\n\nThe most clear potential shot at Altman came after Amodei was asked about the OpenAI CEO's decision to declare a \"code red\" to employees amid fears that ChatGPT was losing its edge.\n\n\"We have a little bit of a privileged position where we can just keep growing and just keep developing our models, and we don't have to do any code reds,\" Amodei said.\n\nWith seven other former OpenAI employees, Amodei cofounded Anthropic in 2021. It was a close-knit group. One of the cofounders, Daniela Amodei, is Dario's sister. Some of them had even roomed together, dating back to their time in a shared house when they all worked at OpenAI.\n\nInside Silicon Valley, there were doubts that a new startup could catch up to OpenAI. Just over two years in, Anthropic reached unicorn status.\n\nAmodei told Time Magazine that by the summer of 2022, Anthropic had finished training its chatbot, Claude. However, the company held back from releasing it. OpenAI, Amodei's now-rival, released ChatGPT months later.\n\n\"I suspect it was the right thing to do,\" Amodei told the magazine in 2024, when Time named Anthropic one of its most influential companies and put him on the cover. \"But it's not totally clear-cut.\"\n\nAnthropic launched Claude almost a year after ChatGPT's release. The startup's bot still won praise. Over time, it has built up a devoted following, particularly for its coding ability.\n\nUnlike OpenAI, Anthropic is largely devoted to businesses and not consumer AI. In May, Reuters reported that Anthropic is making $3 billion in annualized revenue, a significant jump.\n\nIn 2025, Amodei, his sister Daniela, and the rest of the cofounders were all minted billionaires based on the company's valuation. Forbes estimates that Amodei is worth roughly $3.7 billion, as of mid-December.\n\nAmodei said that Anthropic's focus on enterprise clients has created a \"durable\" revenue stream with \"better margins\" than competitors who are more focused on consumer products.\n\n\"We're trying to manage that risk well while also buying an amount of compute that allows us to be competitive with the other players,\" he said during the December event. \"We're very efficient in training, we're very efficient in inference. We have good margins. I think we can manage it. I think the odds are on our side.\"\n\nIn November, Anthropic announced it would spend $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute, a deal that also positioned it as the first model to be available on the three largest clouds. As part of the agreement, Anthropic is set to receive up to $5 billion from Microsoft and up to $10 billion from Nvidia.\n\nAmodei later said that partnering with Nvidia hasn't changed his view that its CEO Jensen Huang is mistaken in his view that US companies should sell advanced chips to China.\n\n\"This isn't personal, this is a policy question,\" Amodei said. \"This is a question of how best to defend our national security.\"\n\nOther views have also put Amodei up against his competitors and even the White House. In October, AI czar David Sacks, accused Anthropic of \"running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.\" Amodei said that Sacks' claims were \"inaccurate.\"\n\nNotably, Amodei has not changed his opposition to a White House-favored federal preemption of state-level AI laws. Some Republicans in Congress have attempted to pass a 10-year moratorium into law, although the policy has split even within their own party.\n\n\"It's like saying, I'm driving a car, I'm going to rip out the steering wheel because I don't need to steer for 10 years,\" Amodei said in December.",

    "description": "Maddy Zhang spent over four years at Google. She shared five tips for getting into Big Tech, from referrals to technical interviews.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech can seem impenetrable. This Google alum has some tips for getting your foot in the door.\n\nMaddy Zhang spent over four years working as a software engineer for Google, touching both the search and advertising businesses. She now works at Airbnb, per her LinkedIn, and previously held internships at Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft.\n\nOn the \"A Life Engineered\" podcast, Zhang shared five tips for landing a job at Google or one of its competitors.\n\nFirst, she recommended applying to jobs early — as in, within hours of the openings being posted.\n\n\"Because there's so much competition, it's honestly an employer's market,\" Zhang said. \"If you wait a day, probably there's going to be hundreds of applicants for it.\"\n\nWhile the recruiter is supposed to look at all of the applications, they'll likely look at the first batch and ignore the rest, she said.\n\nApplying quickly can help you land a job, LinkedIn data shows. Responding quickly helps too: US job seekers who reply to a prospective employer's message within 24 hours are 4.1 times as likely to get hired and 6.7 times as likely to get an interview, according to Indeed.\n\nNext, she advised getting referred by a current employee. Zhang's friends who have applied with referrals had a higher success rate, she said. But that doesn't mean ask anyone on LinkedIn to support you.\n\n\"If you don't actually have a connection with them, it's not going to help,\" she said.\n\nWhile a good résumé or referral might get you through the recruiter's initial pass, applicants must then pass a technical interview. Many engineers prepare using LeetCode — a tool Zhang said was still valuable.\n\n\"I know no one really likes it,\" she said. \"It's a necessary evil.\"\n\nZhang recommended doing a mix of easy, medium, and hard LeetCode problems. When you get stuck, she advised not just looking at the answer, but retyping and running the solution.\n\nIt's easy to think that Google is filled to the brim with Stanford graduates. That wasn't Zhang's experience, though. Her next piece of advice: Don't underestimate yourself based on your school.\n\nMost of Zhang's friends didn't go to \"good computer science schools,\" she said. Many attended state schools or community colleges before transferring.\n\n\"As you progress forward in your career, your school matters less and less,\" she said.\n\nEven with the best application, interview prep, and referrals, there's no guarantee of a job. That's Zhang's final piece of advice: remember it's a numbers game.\n\nZhang said that she had been rejected hundreds of times. When she was younger, those rejections made her want to give up on the industry. She's since learned that it's not personal.\n\n\"Maybe I had a bad day, maybe the interviewer had more qualified candidates, maybe there's something I couldn't control,\" Zhang said.\n\n\"Rejection is nothing on who you are as a software engineer.\"",

    "title": "Cloud outages 2025: how global businesses survived blackouts",
    "description": "Entrepreneurs and tech workers from around the world describe how they navigated the many cloud outages in 2025.",
    "fullText": "November 18 was supposed to be a routine workday for Rwanda-based entrepreneur Derrick Ikenga. But it turned out to be a nightmare he wasn’t prepared for.\n\nCloudflare, a U.S.-based cloud services and cybersecurity firm, faced a massive global outage that day, taking down large parts of the internet, including operations of giants like X (formerly Twitter) and ChatGPT.\n\nIkenga’s company, which builds sales automation tools for clients, also uses Cloudflare. The outage brought the tools to a grinding halt, sending his clients into panic mode.\n\nFor many entrepreneurs and tech workers, this was a familiar experience in 2025. Today, an estimated 94% of enterprise services worldwide rely on at least one major cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, for hosting, data storage, or delivery. Together, the three largest providers control more than 62% of the global cloud market.\n\nBetween August 2024 and August 2025, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud together experienced more than 100 service outages. The duration of these outages varied between a few minutes and several hours. AWS saw one of the biggest and most widespread cloud outages of 2025 when its services went down for 15 hours in October. The outage affected over 4 million users and more than 1,000 companies.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, cloud service providers are responsible for restoring services as soon as possible. In some cases, providers compensate affected customers with free cloud credit.\n\nEach time such disruptions occurred, everyday moments began to fail in unexpected ways. Online payments failed. Doctors were unable to access patients’ health records. CCTV cameras went offline. Doorbells stopped working. Smart mattresses lost their sleep-tracking features.\n\nThe outage offered a glimpse into just how deeply cloud infrastructure is woven into modern life, powering everything from bank transfers to flight bookings and movie streams.\n\nRest of World brings together first-person accounts from entrepreneurs and technology workers around the world, tracing what happened when the cloud failed in 2025.\n\nThe quotes have been edited for length and brevity.\n\nFrancisco Osorio, a Mexico-based senior go-to-market marketing engineer at Simetrik, an operational control and management automation company\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless.\n\nI am responsible for the smooth functioning of my company’s website, among other things. During the November AWS outage, the website stopped functioning, but I was unable to take any action because I lost access to all my work-related platforms, like HubSpot, Slack, and Salesforce. [Some users of AWS experienced issues on November 5, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. An AWS spokesperson denied the claims in comments to Reuters.]\n\nEven as we were sorting through internal issues, our clients also couldn’t log into the platform, which was a more serious concern because we need to comply with service level agreements under which we assure quality and quantity of service.\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless. All I could tell everyone around was, “I’m deeply sorry, I cannot help you today. Our platforms are not running.”\n\nSundeep Narwani, India-based co-founder of Narrative Research Labs, a firm focusing on AI in media\n\nBeing an AI company, we’re quite heavily dependent on the cloud. The outages have wasted a lot of time for our clients and us, rendering us helpless in most cases.\n\nThe outages have wasted a lot of our time.\n\nThe first time it happened, we didn’t know what to do or how to deal with it, and we entered panic mode. My biggest concern was on two fronts: downtime disrupting our processes, and our clients being obviously very angry because we deliver a lot of daily reports for them.\n\nWhen it happened the second time, we created a standard operating procedure to deal with it because someone like me, who is involved in business development apart from being the CEO, cannot be available all the time to handle these issues.\n\nWe delegate a project manager to handle issues of cloud outages and ensure our customers are taken care of during such times while finding a quick solution to the downtime.\n\nWe have also purchased a local server to replicate what AWS does, so that if there is any kind of outage again, we have one local server to tide us over. Obviously, it doesn’t have the same kind of performance that AWS gives us, but at least the team can function. But these are just temporary options.\n\nDavid Nandwa, founder of Honeycoin, a Kenyan cross-border payment company\n\nWe have faced cloud outage issues in the past and were also hit with the recent AWS outage in November.\n\nThe approach we have applied to dealing with this is to have a “distributed stack” or multiple fallback options. We rely on multiple clouds, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Heroku. During the recent AWS outage, we temporarily switched to Google Cloud to maintain service availability for most of our customers.\n\nIf all cloud providers are down, we then fall back to using an on-premise server that we’ve created. It doesn’t perform as efficiently as our providers, but it comes in handy in moments where all the major providers are down. It’s locally hosted, so it’s an option to process requests when all else fails.\n\nSubscribing to multiple cloud providers definitely helps us not only to hedge against future risk but also to decrease reliance on a single one, and risk losing our data completely.\n\nHowever, multiple providers mean multiple bills at the end of the month.\n\nThe one-off cost of a single on-premise server installation is something we’re seriously considering to decrease reliance on the large players and also have more digital sovereignty. It’s pretty simple to set up, but it requires a lot of work to move our stack from any of the globally reputable providers to our own direct stack.\n\nOlumide Egbigbola, Nigeria-based product manager at Leatherback, a cross-border payment startup\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases.\n\nCloud infrastructure is the backbone of most of the things that we do, as most of our critical services are hosted in the cloud. So any downtime from our cloud provider is immediately felt by our individuals and business users. We face complaints of transaction delays, and the app slowing down or being unresponsive.\n\nThis usually causes a lot of anxiety amongst users who can’t access their money.\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases other than inform our users about the downtime.\n\nWe try to spread our cloud services and route traffic through regions that are less affected or unaffected, so that users can at least perform minimal activities while we wait for the major downtime to be over.",

After enrolling at Penn State, Henderson was mentored by Ty Howle, Virginia Tech’s new offensive coordinator and tight ends coach. Henderson redshirted in 2025, so he has four years of eligibility remaining with the Hokies.\n\nHenderson was a late riser in the recruiting world. However, once he worked out for Howle and James Franklin, it was over. Henderson began picking up offers, but committed to the Nittany Lions as a junior. Henderson’s addition, with more tight ends potentially on the way, makes it clear that the position will not be ignored in 2026 like it was last season.\n\nHenderson is a big get for Virginia Tech.

    "description": "Tech companies looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly being voted down",
    "fullText": "SPRING CITY, Pa. — Tech companies and developers looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly losing fights in communities where people don’t want to live next to them, or even near them.\n\nCommunities across the United States are reading about — and learning from — each other's battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.\n\nIn many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. Some don’t have zoning.\n\nBut as more people hear about a data center coming to their community, once-sleepy municipal board meetings in farming towns and growing suburbs now feature crowded rooms of angry residents pressuring local officials to reject the requests.\n\n“Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked supervisors last month in Pennsylvania's East Vincent Township. “Because that’s where it’s literally going, is in my backyard.”\n\nA growing number of proposals are going down in defeat, sounding alarms across the data center constellation of Big Tech firms, real estate developers, electric utilities, labor unions and more.\n\nAndy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL, counted seven or eight deals he’d worked on in recent months that saw opponents going door-to-door, handing out shirts or putting signs in people’s yards.\n\n“It’s becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said.\n\nData Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development.\n\nBetween April and June alone, its latest reporting period, it counted 20 proposals valued at $98 billion in 11 states that were blocked or delayed amid local opposition and state-level pushback. That amounts to two-thirds of the projects it was tracking.\n\nSome environmental and consumer advocacy groups say they’re fielding calls every day, and are working to educate communities on how to protect themselves.\n\n“I’ve been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I’d guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I’ve ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson of the Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition.\n\nIn Indiana alone, Gustafson counted more than a dozen projects that lost rezoning petitions.\n\nFor some people angry over steep increases in electric bills, their patience is thin for data centers that could bring still-higher increases.\n\nLosing open space, farmland, forest or rural character is a big concern. So is the damage to quality of life, property values or health by on-site diesel generators kicking on or the constant hum of servers. Others worry that wells and aquifers could run dry.\n\nLawsuits are flying — both ways — over whether local governments violated their own rules.\n\nBig Tech firms Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook — which are collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers across the globe — didn’t answer Associated Press questions about the effect of community pushback.\n\nMicrosoft, however, has acknowledged the difficulties. In an October securities filing, it listed its operational risks as including “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development.”\n\nEven with high-level support from state and federal governments, the pushback is having an impact.\n\nMaxx Kossof, vice president of investment at Chicago-based developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about losing a zoning fight are considering selling properties once they secure a power source — a highly sought-after commodity that makes a proposal far more viable and valuable.\n\n“You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it’s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.”\n\nSome in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers — such as polluting water and air — and are difficult to overcome.\n\nStill, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers.\n\n“It's definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?’” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers.\n\nWinning over local officials, however, hasn't translated to winning over residents.\n\nDevelopers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat.\n\nThe project would have funded half the city’s budget and developers promised environmentally friendly features. But town meetings overflowed, and emails, texts and phone calls were overwhelmingly opposed, “999 to one against,” Higdon said.\n\nHad council approved it, “every person that voted for it would no longer be in office,” the mayor said. “That's for sure.”\n\nIn Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city’s environmental review was adequate.\n\nResidents found each other through social media and, from there, learned to organize, protest, door-knock and get their message out.\n\nThey say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city — responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy — released internal emails that confirmed it.\n\n“It’s the secrecy. The secrecy just drives people crazy,” said Jonathan Thornton, a realtor who lives across a road from the site.\n\nDocuments revealing the extent of the project emerged days before a city rezoning vote in October. Mortenson, which is developing it for a Fortune 50 company that it hasn't named, says it is considering changes based on public feedback and that “more engagement with the community is appropriate.\"\n\nRebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm.\n\nShe found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle.\n\n“I don’t think this fight is over at all,” Gramdorf said.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "fullText": "Florida football landed a Power 4 conference quarterback out of the transfer portal, securing a commitment Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo brings dual threat ability and familiarity with the scheme under new Florida Gators offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner, who was his offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech for the last two seasons. He visited UF over the weekend along with teammate and wide receiver Bailey Stockwell.\n\nA redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining, the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo showed promise as a backup quarterback in two seasons with the Yellow Jackets, throwing for 938 yards with 2 TDs to 3 interceptions over two seasons while rushing for 95 yards and 1 TD. Philo has appeared in seven games over two seasons and while alternating with starter Haynes King, helped lead Georgia Tech to a 28-23 upset win over Miami on Nov. 9, 2024.\n\nA three-star recruit out of Prince Andrew Christian School in Bogart, Ga., Philo broke Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence's high school record for passing yards in the state of Georgia with 13,922 yards during his prep career.\n\nPhilo will compete with redshirt freshman Tramel Jones Jr. for the starting quarterback job at Florida. Jones, who announced his intention to return to UF in December, completed 21 of 35 passes for 191 yards and 2 TDs in two games as former UF quarterback DJ Lagway's backup last season. Florida also brings back redshirt sophomore quarterback Aidan Warner and adds incoming four-star freshman quarterback Will Griffin, who plans to enroll at UF this month for the spring semester.\n\nPhilo joins Baylor safety DJ Coleman as the second commitment in UF's 2026 transfer portal class.\n\nKevin Brockway is The Gainesville Sun’s Florida beat writer.

The second thing is that the other team scores a goal you don't expect in extra time. So, is it then a surprise?\" the Dutchman said.\n\nWhat did surprise many inside Craven Cottage was that Wirtz's equaliser was confirmed after a video assistant referee (VAR) check - despite replays suggesting he was in an offside position.\n\n\"I was sure it was offside so I didn't even celebrate,\" Wirtz told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I felt the same.

And, of course, more gains by way of the stock market.\n\nHow can I tell after a year in which the S&P 500's (^GSPC) total return was 17.88%, bringing the index's three-year total return to 86.11%? Because I am always getting asked by people for stock ideas, especially after years of the market basically moving up and to the right.\n\nAs a rule, I don't give out stock ideas, as that is no longer my career (I was an analyst for a decade). So I come to you at the start of 2026 with a tidy list of stock ideas provided by my contacts.\n\nI caution that I am not endorsing the picks of these money management pros. This is not me saying to dump your life savings into these stocks or even buy a single share.\n\nDo your homework on each one. In doing so, you may find you like other stocks in the industry better.\n\n\"One chip company in the world is fueling the AI revolution, and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out, the [earnings] numbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15% to 20% at a minimum [earnings growth] going into 2026. You put that together, and I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a base case to end 2026.\"\n\n\"We love Palantir. From a defense standpoint, they are the leader in AI and data, with Defense Department approval and usage. And then beyond that, corporate adoption and sovereign adoption. So we think the name continues [to go higher]. It's one of those names, you can't justify it from a valuation standpoint. But the narrative is quite compelling. And that can drive stocks for a very long time, like it did Amazon for the first 20 years of Amazon's post-IPO life.\"\n\n\"I think Broadcom is a little misunderstood. We were big buyers of it during COVID actually when it was giving you over a 3% dividend yield. So you know we like dividends. So what I like about it is the VMware side of the business and the programable side. These are very specialized chips. So not competing as much with Nvidia, and I think they're creating their own market. And I think their growth rate and the ownership has been tremendous.\n\n\"We've been trimming this position because it grew to so much in our accounts. I mean, we had up to 7% of our portfolio in Broadcom. We didn't want that much. We still like it, but we're not expecting the 5,060% return. We'd be very happy with Broadcom [returning] about 10%.\"",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain’s fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.\n\n“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.\n\nButerin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.\n\nEthereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.\n\nZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.\n\n“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.\n\nGeorge Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.\n\n“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.",

    "title": "Scientists Made A Breakthrough In LED Tech That Could Change Everything",
    "description": "LEDs are all around us and come in quite a few different forms, but this new discovery just might open up a whole new realm of potential applications.",
    "fullText": "LEDs are everything, from some of the largest TV screens you can buy, to the types of bulbs that you use in your home. But, not all LED materials are the same. Some are OLEDs or QLEDs, while others are a bit more nuanced. Some don't even allow you to move electricity through them. It's this later group that has attracted some intriguing attention from scientists in recent years, and now, a group of researchers working with the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge have made an intriguing discovery that could change how we think about LEDs altogether. According to the study, which was published in the journal Nature, scientists have managed to move electricity through tiny insulating particles that aren't typically capable of conducting electricity. These particles are made up of various elements, including some rare-earth elements such as neodymium and ytterbium, and the breakthrough here could potentially open new doors for LED technology as a whole.\n\nResearchers note that the particles in question, called insulating lanthanide nanoparticles (LnNPs) have been known to shine very brightly when they are placed under light. However, scientists have always struggled to get the particles to actually conduct electricity. Previous attempts to do just that have shown that charges often can't reach the lanthanide ions inside without extreme heat or voltage.\n\nTo bypass this issue, those involved in this new study began looking for a way to hybridize the particles instead. They used 9-ACA organic dye molecules with the LnNPs, letting them replace the surface insulators on the particles, thus allowing them to be charged using a technique known as triplet energy transfer.\n\nAccording to the study, the biggest issue that held the LnNPs from being electrically excited is their energy gap. In the past, this limited these particles to only being used in deep-tissue imaging that didn't rely on electric energy. By replacing the surface insulators, though, the researchers managed to bypass this core problem, thus opening the door to use these particles in more expanded LED operations.\n\nAnd when the changes were made, the scientists were then able to inject electrons into the organic layer, thus forming what they call \"excitons.\" From here, the energy is transferred to the lanthanide ions, which allows them to emit an almost completely pure near-infrared (NIR) light, even going so far as to out perform most other organic NIR LEDs in both narrowness and efficiency.\n\nThe researchers say that these new LnLEDs open a lot of possibilities for hybrid optoelectronics in biomedical tools. This could allow for better non-bleaching deep imaging applications. Whether this advancement is as huge as previous research that aimed to make X-rays safer or not still remains to be seen, but it does open a lot of new possibilities. The researchers say they still want to improve on the brightness offered by the new hybrid LEDs, but the current method should be easily scalable to other insulators, allowing for even more experimentation.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "AI safety expert David Dalrymple said rapid advances could outpace efforts to control powerful systems\n\nThe world “may not have time” to prepare for the safety risks posed by cutting-edge AI systems, according to a leading figure at the UK government’s scientific research agency.\n\nDavid Dalrymple, a programme director and AI safety expert at the Aria agency, told the Guardian people should be concerned about the growing capability of the technology.\n\n“I think we should be concerned about systems that can perform all of the functions that humans perform to get things done in the world, but better,” he said. “We will be outcompeted in all of the domains that we need to be dominant in, in order to maintain control of our civilisation, society and planet.”\n\nDalrymple said there was a gap in understanding between the public sector and AI companies about the power of looming breakthroughs in the technology.\n\n“I would advise that things are moving really fast and we may not have time to get ahead of it from a safety perspective,” he said. “And it’s not science fiction to project that within five years most economically valuable tasks will be performed by machines at a higher level of quality and lower cost than by humans.”\n\nDalrymple said governments should not assume that advanced systems are reliable. Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.\n\n“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.\n\nDescribing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.\n\n“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”\n\nThis month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nThe institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nDalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.",

    "title": "Micah's takeaways from a dominant week for the Big Ten",
    "description": "Indiana embarrassed Alabama and Oregon shut out Texas Tech. The Big Ten showed it has the best teams in CFB and is guaranteed to play for the title",
    "fullText": "It was a great week for the Big Ten The national championship game is guaranteed to have a team that resides in the Big Ten Conference. The title game won't feature two Big Ten teams, but there is no doubt that the best game in this playoff and the best game this season might be the upcoming semifinal between two Big Ten teams, Indiana and Oregon.\n\nHere are my takeaways from the Big Ten from this Week's bowl games:\n\nFrom wins like Iowa over Vandy, Illinois over Tennessee, a high-powered offense, all the way to Indiana beating Alabama, the Big Ten showcased they are the best conference in the country. The Big Ten lost Ohio State as a representative, but with the matchup between Oregon and Indiana, that could very well be the team that wins it all. Indiana very well looks like the best team remaining by a wide margin. Texas did get the best of Michigan, but everyone is clearly aware of what has been going on in Michigan prior to that bowl game. It is safe to say that the Big Ten runs college football.\n\nAgainst Alabama, Fernando Mendoza was as good as he could possibly be. Mendoza was 14-16, threw for 192 yards through the air, and threw for 3 passing touchdowns. Many of his other counterparts struggled, while Mendoza continues to win and continues to be the reason why Indiana is winning. At this current moment, Mendoza looks like a sure thing quarterback prospect for the next draft class, and he will make one desperate NFL team very happy.\n\nIndiana was the one team that had a bye week in the College Football Playoff that did not lose. Not only did they not lose to Alabama, but they won the game in the first half. Ty Simpson had no chance, and this was a complete football performance by Indiana and Curt Cignetti. The Hoosiers are undefeated this year, and last season they only lost two games, one of which was in last season's College Football Playoff. Cignetti consistently has this team ready to dominate regardless of the opponent. He has a Big Ten title for the first time in program history, and he is looking for much more this season. This two-year run for Cignetti in Indiana places him as the best coach in college football right now, and it is not close, just like the coaching match between him and Kalen DeBoer on Thursday.\n\nIndiana is a team that has not shown any weakness this season. In games that could have resulted in an upset this season, Indiana has a guy who can win them games in the clutch in Fernando Mendoza. This team has an elite quarterback, they have elite weapons as Omar Cooper Jr. returned versus Alabama, and their defense is just as good as any team left. This team is well coached, and their team is full of players at every level who have been in college football for at least 4 years. The steamrolling of Alabama was a surprise to no one. Indiana made their statement on Thursday and proved it is the team to beat.\n\nThe last time these two teams met, Indiana won 30-20. That game was a battle, and both quarterbacks struggled and faced adversity. Mendoza proved to be the quarterback who battled adversity the best. Against Indiana was the first time Dante Moore struggled and did not have his usual success. For Oregon to win, they will need Dante Moore to be the better quarterback. In all the other areas on their team, Oregon matches up very well against Indiana, and their defense showed that by completely shutting out Texas Tech. Once again, these two teams will deliver one of the best games of this season. In my opinion, whoever wins this game will win the whole thing.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Big Ten football teams handled the SEC in New Year's bowl games",

    "title": "Big Tech turned me down. At Walmart, I found a career opportunity, work-life balance, and good food.",
    "description": "This software engineer couldn't land a Big Tech job — but says his Walmart role gave him everything he needed.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kanish Shah, a 26-year-old software engineer at Walmart who lives in Milpitas, California. Business Insider has verified his employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI moved to the US from India in August 2021 to pursue a master's degree in computer science at the University of Southern California. Soon after, I began looking for a summer internship — but things didn't go as planned.\n\nLike many aspiring software engineers, I was excited about the idea of working at a Big Tech company like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, or Netflix. I targeted those tech giants during my internship search, but the competition was intense. I ended up being rejected by all of them, which was disappointing.\n\nIt wasn't just the tech giants that turned me down. I ended up applying to hundreds of internships and received fewer than 15 callbacks — one of which turned into a role at Walmart. I learned that Big Tech isn't the only route to take for a successful tech career.\n\nWhile I struggled to gain traction with tech giants, I eventually secured interviews with several startups and midsize companies.\n\nOne of the internships I applied to early on — without a referral — was a software engineering role at Walmart. A couple of months later, around October 2021, a recruiter reached out about an online assessment followed by two technical interviews. I received an offer soon after the interviews and started the internship in May.\n\nI treated the internship like an extended interview — I asked for weekly feedback, stayed vocal during meetings, and found a mentor. I believe that approach helped me secure a full-time software engineering role with Walmart, which I started in June 2023.\n\nWhen I joined Walmart full-time, the company was in the midst of a major transformation — evolving from a traditional retail giant into a tech-driven, AI-powered organization. It felt like an opportunity to contribute to meaningful technological change while accelerating my own learning. That was a significant reason I decided to stay after my internship.\n\nI'm very happy with my decision. In addition to growing as a software engineer, I've found that the work culture and work-life balance at Walmart are really great. My hours can vary, but I generally work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and have time to spend with family and friends on the weekends.\n\nI live in Milpitas, California, about a 25-minute commute from Walmart's Sunnyvale office. I'm required to go in two days a week, though in-office expectations vary across teams. The office itself is great. It has a lot of amenities, including boxing and pilates classes, a basketball court, a large gym, and good food.\n\nWalmart offers a wide range of cuisine options in its cafeteria. For lunch, I usually opt for the \"make your own salad bowl,\" but there are also options featuring Asian, Indian, Italian, and Mexican dishes. The food isn't free, but it's subsidized, so it's not costly — and drinks like fountain beverages, tea, and coffee are complimentary.\n\nAt a traditional Big Tech company, you may find early exposure to systems operating at a massive global scale — along with access to specialized internal tooling, research teams, and long-established engineering playbooks. There's also the brand recognition, which could make future job mobility feel more straightforward.\n\nThat said, those differences haven't felt like gaps for me. I haven't felt that I'm missing out on meaningful learning or career development where I am. For me, the quality of work, mentorship, and ownership has mattered more than the logo.\n\nMy advice to other young tech professionals is this: aiming for Big Tech is completely valid — those roles can be great aspirations. However, not landing one of these roles shouldn't be too discouraging. High-impact work can be found in many environments, including startups and emerging tech companies. I also believe that strong compensation is possible outside traditional Big Tech — my compensation is in the six figures.\n\nFrom a job security perspective, I believe the entire tech industry has undergone a period of recalibration over the past couple of years. Layoffs have affected companies of all sizes — including Big Tech, midsize firms, and even large enterprises like Walmart. So I try not to view job security as something tied to a single company or sector.\n\nWhat gives me confidence is focusing on the factors I can control: continuously building relevant skills, staying adaptable, and making a meaningful impact in my role. In short, my advice would be not to limit yourself to a narrow set of companies. Stay open to opportunities where you can learn, contribute, and grow — because the tech world is much bigger than just one path.",

    "description": "Ryan Edwards was a drummer for an indie band, worked at VISA Europe, and now runs Audoo, a music tech startup. Here's his advice on career pivots.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ryan Edwards, 40, the founder of Audoo, who is based in London. His employment and Audoo's investors have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity\n\nIn my early 20s, I was the drummer of an indie band. We toured festivals and made the UK's Top 10 Independent Singles Chart.\n\nBut I knew our success wouldn't last forever. Eventually, the time would come for me to grow up and find a real job.\n\nSince leaving the band in 2008, my career has been varied. I've worked in retail, at startups, and eventually became a senior leader at Visa Europe. In 2018, I founded Audoo, a startup that aims to help musicians receive royalties, which has investors including Elton John.\n\nMy career pivots have been unexpected and I tend to fall into my line of work, but they have felt natural because my dreams keep changing. While my job titles have changed, one thing hasn't: a belief in getting my head down and doing the hard work. In my experience, nine times out of ten, that's what pays off.\n\nAs a kid, I dreamed of being a footballer — then I got into music. My dad loves Motown and he wanted me to become a saxophonist. I started learning the clarinet and the sax, and then the drums, because I thought it might get me more girls.\n\nI planned to study jazz at music school, but that never happened. Soon after I finished my high-school exams, the band I was the drummer of was signed by an indie label while gigging locally. When I heard the words \"record deal,\" I got goosebumps.\n\nFrom 2006, we were suddenly getting studio time and supporting major acts on tour. Looking back, touring for a year and a half was probably a better life experience than going to university: I became a better musician and learned how to drink.\n\nBand life was fun, but it wasn't always easy. I remember renting budget hotel rooms and flipping a coin to see who would sleep on the floor. Eventually, it became clear that the label would prioritize better-selling and more well-behaved bands.\n\nPanic set in when I left the band. I didn't know what to do with my life, but I knew I needed an income. I got a job as an assistant store manager at a cell phone retailer chain in 2008, where I ended up working for four years in increasingly senior roles.\n\nWorking in retail was an excellent education: you're trading day in, day out. There were similarities to life in the band, where I'd sell T-shirts and stickers after shows. In both lines of work, I managed stock and convinced people to part with their hard-earned cash.\n\nI was made redundant in 2012, and after a stint as a business development manager at an app development business — whose founder I met at a friend's wedding — I was offered a job at Visa Europe as a senior manager in late 2013.\n\nI learned to always be open to exploring new opportunities. You never know where they might take you.\n\nIt was my first job in a corporate environment. Suddenly, I was sitting in a three-piece suit at a quiet desk, worrying it would be stale, but I ended up being given permission to shake things up.\n\nI hadn't planned to leave Visa — the pay was great and I felt comfortable in my job. But in 2016, after three years, I joined a fintech start-up in sales, after two brilliant guys tried to poach me. They knew of me from working on Visa data feeds, and needed contacts in retail.\n\nThe risk of pivoting felt worth it because the idea for the business was amazing.\n\nThen the idea for Audoo hit me. In 2018, I was in a department store in London when one of my band's singles started playing, and my wife joked about the royalties I'd earn. I said they were more likely to buy her a coffee than the designer bag she was eyeing up.\n\nWeeks later, I got my royalty statement. It listed what I'd been paid but offered no data about how those payments were calculated or the flow of how plays become payment. I became fascinated by how the royalties process worked — and realized the system was a mess.\n\nInspired by Amazon's Alexa and Shazam, I wanted to build a technology that would identify the music played in public and ensure artists get paid fairly for it. I built the first prototype for Audoo on my kitchen table with a Raspberry Pi. It worked — it recognized songs —but, looking back, it was embarrassing. We use barely any of that code anymore.\n\nNow, our Audoo Audio Meter uses a plug-in device to track the music played in commercial premises, like stores and bars, and sends the data to royalty-collection organizations.\n\nI incorporated Audoo in August 2018 at the age of 33. We'd just gotten a puppy and my wife was pregnant, so I needed it to work. I used LinkedIn to reach out to industry leaders and set up coffee dates, which quickly confirmed there was demand to build and scale the product.\n\nIn 2020, Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA saw me on TV promoting Audoo and later invested. He put out a statement that exceeded my expectations: \"Audoo is a solution I believe will change the music industry forever,\" he said.\n\nThrough word of mouth, others in the music industry started to hear about the company and invest, including Elton John.\n\nThe team and the mission we're delivering are incredibly rewarding — but I'm always open to new challenges.\n\nWhen I was a drummer in The Lines, I never thought I'd one day be the CEO of a music tech company. I can't say where the future will take me as I've never been one to stick to a particular plan.\n\nWhile some people have lifelong linear goals, I tend to reset mine every two to three years. For me, it's about continually learning something new, never being boxed in, and being adaptable to change.",

    "description": "Besides having screen time limits for their kids, many tech execs also have philosophies around encouraging curiosity and learning in their children.",
    "fullText": "Much is known about how tech execs manage their companies. But how about how those with families manage their children?\n\nEven the uber-wealthy leaders have to contend with everyday parenting questions, like whether to limit screen time and how to divvy up chores\n\nWe looked through past interviews to find some of tech leaders' most interesting pointers when it comes to parenting and setting kids up for success in today's world.\n\nHere's what some of the biggest names in tech have said about their approach to raising children.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Jimmy Fallon that ChatGPT has helped him raise his baby. He said he \"cannot imagine\" having figured out how to parent a newborn without the technology. He's asked, for example, why his kid wasn't crawling at a certain age.\n\nAltman has also said that his baby \"will never be smarter than AI,\" but will be \"more capable.\" He told the Senate that he doesn't want his kid to form a best-friend-like bond with an AI bot.\n\nAnd when it comes to cribs, Altman has said he has a clear favorite: Cradlewise. It costs nearly $2,000 and gently bounces the baby to get ahead of any fussing. The crib also includes a built-in baby monitor and music features.\n\nAltman also said he's learned the importance of having a lot of burp rags.\n\nWhen asked in 2024 what kids should be studying today, Zuckerberg told Bloomberg that \"the most important thing is learning how to think critically and learning values when you're young.\"\n\n\"This is somewhat of a hiring philosophy that I have, too,\" he said. \"If people have shown that they can go deep and do one thing really well, then they've probably gained experience in the art of learning something and taking it to an excellent level.\"\n\nHe also said in a 2024 interview that, when taking his then-seven-year-old daughter to a Taylor Swift concert, he told her that being like the superstar wasn't \"available\" to her. A therapist in California who has worked with wealthy parents told Business Insider that encouraging her to instead be herself was the right approach.\n\nIn a 2019 interview on CBS This Morning, the Meta CEO said he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, \"don't give them everything.\"\n\n\"They have chores, they have responsibilities,\" Chan added. \"We also take them to work. Mark and I take both of them to the office to see what we do, how we contribute.\"\n\nThat same year, he told Fox News that he generally doesn't want his kids parked in front of a television or computer \"for a long period of time.\" At the time, he said he let his daughters use video calls to talk with relatives across the country but is stricter about other forms of screen time.\n\nNadella says his own parents \"created an environment where they let me set my own pace and pursue what I wanted,\" and that influenced his approach to raising his own children.\n\n\"It's important to focus on what [our kids] need to thrive,\" he previously told Good Housekeeping.\n\nThe Microsoft CEO and his wife, Anu, also \"both think children should have dogs,\" she told Good Housekeeping.\n\n\"There is a different sense of companionship and responsibility that comes with it — that emotional sense that there is a being waiting for you to come back,\" Anu said.\n\nNadella told Good Housekeeping that he gets reports on what their kids do on their computers. The couple limits how many movies and what kinds of video games and websites their kids can view.\n\nNadella has also said that his experience raising a son with cerebral palsy has taught him the importance of empathy, including at work.\n\nPichai still helps his kids with their homework — with some assistance from Google Lens.\n\n\"We use Google Lens for homework. I don't want to get him in trouble, but the class allows you to do that,\" Pichai previously told Bloomberg. \"But sometimes he asks me for help on math. Sometimes I'm lazy and I pretend as if I'm thinking, but I'm also using Google Lens to kind of figure out the answer.\"\n\nThe Google CEO told The New York Times in 2018 that his son, then 11 years old, didn't have a phone, and that he limited his son's TV use.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates has said he parented his kids following a model developed in the 1970s called the \"Love and Logic\" approach.\n\nThe philosophy focuses on exercising control when it comes to emotions, such as by minimizing some reactions as a parent, like shouting or reprimanding. Gates said his dad believed in the same philosophy, and that \"he was never panicked.\"\n\nGates, who for many years was the world's richest man, has also said he tried to keep his kids from being spoiled.\n\n\"We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything, but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing,\" he once said.\n\nAs far as screen time limits go, Gates forbade his kids from using phones at the dinner table, and didn't give them phones until they were 14 years old.\n\nIn a 2025 episode of the podcast \"Raj Shamani's Figuring it Out,\" Gates said he was giving his children less than 1% of his total wealth, \"because I decided it wouldn't be a favor to them.\"\n\n\"I want to give them a chance to have their own earnings and success be significant,\" Gates added.\n\nBezos took an unusual approach to raising his four kids at times. He said in 2017 that he let his kids use \"sharp knives\" from the age of 4 and power tools at 7 or 8 years old.\n\nThe Amazon founder attributed this to his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, who he said would \"much rather have a kid with nine fingers than a resourceless kid.\" Bezos added that this was \"a fantastic attitude about life.\"\n\nReddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian incorporated a fun practice from his upbringing into his approach to parenting.\n\n\"My favorite parenting tip that I inherited from him was his Sunday tradition of making breakfast for our family,\" he said in 2020. \"I love being able to make pancakes with my family when we're all in the same place on a Sunday, and always do my best to put away outside distractions so we can be together.\"\n\nOn a 2025 podcast episode, Ohanian said he \"wholeheartedly\" wanted his then-seven-year-old daughter to use AI every day. He said he's used the technology to enhance her creativity: he had ChatGPT turn some of his childhood pencil sketches into \"full-color illustrations.\" His daughter, Ohanian said, still draws with old-fashioned markers and paper as well.\n\nOhanian told CNBC in 2018 that he and tennis star Serena Williams want their daughter \"to know what it's like to have limits on tech.\"\n\n\"My wife and I both want her to be bored,\" he said. \"I do look forward to playing video games with her when she's older, but it's really important that she gets time to just be with her thoughts and be with her blocks and be with her toys, so we'll be regulating it pretty heavily.\"\n\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel said in 2018 that he and his wife, supermodel Miranda Kerr, limited their then-seven-year-old's screen time to an hour and a half a week. The rule, he said, was partly influenced by not being allowed to watch television until he was almost a teenager.\n\nHe said that parents should lead by example and work to limit their own screen time as well.\n\nSpiegel told People in 2025 that he's glad his kids are growing up with digital tools, and Kerr said they don't let their 14-year-old have phones or computers in his bedroom past 9:30 pm.",

    "fullText": "It's a new year! And at Business Insider, we're already diving in.\n\nWe've always been the place for innovators, and AI's arrival is creating a renaissance for entrepreneurs of all stripes. It's led to whole new industries — from legal AI to chatbot training to vibe coding to the data center boom. Everyone is learning as they go, and we are here to help you generate ideas, trade notes, and get smarter. We'll chronicle highs and lows — there will for sure be both.\n\nAt larger firms, leaders will be sizing up which AI experiments are working, at what costs, and with what benefits. How fast AI helps companies' bottom lines will determine whether we're in bubble times in the markets. We're all over that in our new First Trade newsletter.\n\nAI is a big story line on Wall Street, but it's not the only one. This past year showed dents in basic assumptions about capitalism in the US — principles that have underscored the \"stocks for the long run\" thinking that has proven sound for investors. International markets are getting more of a look, especially with rearmament in Europe and AI as a global tailwind.\n\nBetween Washington's investments in business, Zohran Mamdani's rise in the nation's financial capital, and surveys showing eroding confidence in capitalism, that mindset is no longer the given it once was. We are launching a series this week, \"The Future of Capitalism,\" and what it means for your work and wealth. Take our survey, and watch Monday for our first piece!\n\nMeanwhile, in workplaces, capitalism is alive and well. The \"anti-woke workplace\" is increasingly in fashion, and we will help you navigate an era in which many managers, in a sharp shift, are more focused on employee performance than employee policies.\n\nOur obsession with side hustles is still a full-time job for us, whether your thing is real estate, brand influencing, Uber driving, or renting your clothing. And as our reporting showed this past year, a strong side hustle can not only be fun, but also crucial if white-collar layoffs snag you.\n\nSpeaking about clothing, you've made clear you care about how to show up to succeed at work. We're exploring the cost of that, and whether that cost is sometimes too high — for your wallet or your heart. We've also got you covered on style and status, from show-off golf shirts and luxury handbags to viral hoodies, coveted watches, and Wall Street's favorite $1,100 shoes.\n\nAll of which is to say, we're pumped to cover all that's ahead — in words, video, audio, newsletters, online and IRL events, and every way that works for you! As always, please stay in touch! Email me at eic@businessinsider.com.\n\nThe BI Today team: Jamie Heller, editor in chief, in New York. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York. Grace Lett, editor, in New York. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York.",
