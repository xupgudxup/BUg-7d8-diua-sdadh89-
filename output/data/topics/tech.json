    "description": "Some economists are warning there’s no sign of AI-related job displacement appearing in the labor data. Altman claimed it’s just a matter of time until it does.",
    "fullText": "As debate continues over AI’s true impact on the labor force, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said some companies are engaging in “AI washing” when it comes to layoffs, or falsely attributing workforce reductions to the technology’s impact.\n\n“I don’t know what the exact percentage is, but there’s some AI washing where people are blaming AI for layoffs that they would otherwise do, and then there’s some real displacement by AI of different kinds of jobs,” Altman told CNBC-TV18 at the India AI Impact Summit on Thursday.\n\nAI washing has gained traction as emerging data on the tech’s impact on the labor market tells a muddied, inconclusive story about how the technology is destroying human jobs—or if it has yet to touch them.\n\nA study published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, found that of thousands of surveyed C-suite executives across the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Australia, nearly 90% said AI had no impact on workplace employment over the past three years following the late-2022 release of ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, prominent tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have warned of a white-collar bloodbath, with AI potentially wiping out 50% of entry-level office jobs. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski suggested this week the buy-now, pay-later firm would reduce its 3,000-person workforce by one-third by 2030 in part because of the acceleration of AI. Around 40% of employers expect to follow Siemiatkowski’s lead in culling staff down the line as a result of AI, according to the 2025 World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report.\n\nAltman clarified he anticipates more job displacement as a result of AI, as well as the emergence of new roles complementing the technology.\n\n“We’ll find new kinds of jobs, as we do with every tech revolution,” he said. “But I would expect that the real impact of AI doing jobs in the next few years will begin to be palpable.”\n\nData from a recent Yale Budget Lab report suggests Altman and Amodei’s vision of mass worker displacement from AI is not certain and is not yet here. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Population Survey, the research found no significant differences in the rate of change of occupations mix or length of unemployment for individuals with jobs that have high exposure to AI from the release of ChatGPT through November 2025. The numbers suggested no significant AI-related labor changes at this juncture.\n\n“No matter which way you look at the data, at this exact moment, it just doesn’t seem like there’s major macroeconomic effects here,” Martha Gimbel, executive director and cofounder of the Yale Budget Lab, told Fortune earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "In 2026, it’s a scary time to work for a living.\n\nGone are the days of quiet quitting, the Great Resignation, and the highly visible union-organizing battles that began the decade and signaled that perhaps worker power was on the rise again in the US. Instead, much of that momentum is being crowded out of our minds by anxieties: a worsening affordability crisis, geopolitical instability, and the specter of artificial intelligence looming over the workplace.\n\nFor the tech CEOs leading the AI race and enriching themselves as they jostle for dominance, AI isn’t a phantasm at all, but a glimmering unicorn. When they predict AI is just months away from being able to do everything a software engineer does, or that it will one day take over CEOs’ jobs, their excitement for the future is palpable. For the rest of us, it’s hard to feel confident in their offhand remarks about how “some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs will be created”. A 2025 Pew survey found that “64% of the public thinks AI will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”, which is probably why only 17% of Americans say AI will have a positive effect on the US over the same time period.\n\nUncertain times like these call for scrutiny. Throughout 2026, the Guardian will publish Reworked, a reporting series that centers the human stakes as AI disrupts our workplaces, in ways both thrilling and alarming. Like this essay, the stories in this series will focus on workers’ real-world power and plights as well as the realities and exaggerations of the hype surrounding AI’s transformative possibilities.\n\nSo which version of the future of work awaits us? It is yet to be settled, which means there is still time to shift course.\n\nBlue-collar workers who have long grappled with algorithmic surveillance and optimization at work are now worrying that technological advancements will only make their jobs more dehumanizing. “[For] lower wage workers, there is concern about being replaced by robots. But on the other hand, there’s a lot of concern about being turned into robots,” Lisa Kresge, a senior researcher at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, told me.\n\nAnd white-collar workers are now wondering if their work will begin to resemble blue-collar labor – either because they will be similarly tracked and managed, or because they will need to switch to more manual work that’s resistant to being taken over by AI.\n\nIt may seem that workers haven’t been this vulnerable in a long time. In some ways, that’s true. But this is also a pivotal moment, one in which something unexpected is happening: society’s collective anxiety over AI is catalyzing workers to push back.\n\n“It is creating an opportunity,” Sarita Gupta, the Ford Foundation’s Vice President of US Programs and co-author of The Future We Need: Organizing for a Better Democracy in the Twenty-First Century, told me. “When you have a young Silicon Valley software engineer realize that their performance is tracked or undermined by the same logic as a working class warehouse picker, class divisions dissolve, and larger working-class movements for dignity are possible. That is what we’re starting to see.”\n\nPeople across industries and income brackets are anxious and frustrated, quite like they were when the Covid pandemic placed punishing demands on frontline workers and erased the boundaries between work and life for everyone else. Those struggles prompted power shifts: At the same time that workers led unionization efforts at Amazon warehouses and Starbucks locations around the US, the Great Resignation saw a record number of employees quit their jobs, and the ones who remained in the workforce began negotiating for and gaining better pay and conditions.\n\n“It was not a pretty time for a lot of workers. And so part of the resurgence of labor organizing from that period of time was in response to a lot of fears,” Kresge said.\n\nShe also sees the rise of AI as an opening for the labor movement to regain some of the power it’s lost after decades of attacks from employers. “I’m hopeful about the opportunity for technology to lift up some of the issues that have been under way in our economy for decades … in terms of how workers are treated and how we are distributing the rewards of productivity.”\n\nConditions for workers have been rough for a long while now. “Over time, unions have lost collective bargaining power, and a lot of that is due to the lack of laws that we need and enforcement of laws,” Gupta said. “For four decades, productivity soared while wages stayed flat, and unionization hit historic lows.” In 2025, only 9.9% of US workers were union members – the same percentage as 2024, but still the lowest numbers in almost 40 years.\n\nToday, the advent of AI is drawing the world’s attention to the extreme imbalance of power between employers and their employees – and people are getting worked up. Even if the outcomes are still undetermined, that’s a glimmer of possibility in bleak times.\n\nAI is still a nascent technology. Many of the predictions about what it will be capable of and how it will transform labor and the economy are just that – predictions. The question of worker power in the age of AI hasn’t been decided yet, even if billionaire CEOs with a vested interest in the unregulated dominance of AI keep implying that it has.\n\n“There is a concerted effort among many tech leaders to basically create mystification around AI as a tactic, to a large extent, to disempower workers, policymakers, and anyone who might be critical of the growing concentration of funding and resources in our society toward this goal,” Kresge told me.\n\nIn other words, take what these billionaires say with a grain of salt. The rise of AI is already transforming society, the economy, and our relationship to work, but a lot of these shifts are anticipatory, based on our belief in the potential of a technology that’s still being built.\n\n“We have to always remind ourselves that the direction of technology is a choice, right? We can use AI to build a surveillance economy that squeezes every drop of value out of a worker, or we can use it to build an era of shared prosperity,” Gupta said. “We know if technology were designed and deployed and governed by the people doing the work, AI wouldn’t be such a threat.”",

    "fullText": "In Wednesday’s ACC Action, Virginia clocked Georgia Tech, 94-68, and Wake Forest surprised Clemson, 85-77.\n\nWake Forest basically dominated the entire game. A week or two ago, who would have expected that?\n\nWell, here’s something you may have missed – Clemson has lost three straight, to Virginia Tech, Duke and now Wake Forest. And all three losses were by double figures. Prior to this, the Tigers were 13-1 in their last 14 games. Brad Brownell has work to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Wake Forest, despite not really having anyone inside to speak of, is catching fire late. Too late, probably, but it’s still impressive that the Deacs have won three straight.\n\nSteve Forbes has continued to tinker with his lineup. In this one, he went with Tre’Von Spillers, Cooper Schwieger and Sebastian Akins up front and Juke Harris and Myles Colvin the backcourt. Harris led the way with 20 points.\n\nJake Wahlin paced the Tigers with 17.\n\nAs for Virginia, remember that scene in Braveheart when Longshanks realizes that if Wallace can take York, he can get the rest of England?\n\nVirginia shot up 39-9 in the first half. Obviously, the game was over at that point. Georgia Tech gave up 59 points in the first half, en route to losing their eighth straight game.\n\nThe question isn’t really how bad it was. The question is the fallout. NC State got nuked at Louisville two games ago but bounced back nicely against UNC and is still on target for a tournament bid. Meanwhile, Georgia Tech is on target to miss the ACC Tournament, since the bottom three teams won’t go anymore.\n\nHowever, it could still escape this fate as BC and Pitt also have just two ACC wins. We’ll see.\n\nThe other question is this: was it because the Yellow Jackets are really bad or because Virginia is really good?\n\nVirginia has certainly been winning and has won eight straight road games, which is tremendous. However, the Wahoos beat SMU by 4, lost to UNC by 5, nipped Notre Dame by 3, BC by 13, FSU by 3 and Ohio State by 4. We’re tentatively going with the Yellow Jackets being that bad.\n\nOver at WRAL, Pat Welter and Chris Lea discuss Hubert Davis’s UNC and reach the same conclusion we’ve discussed from time to time: Davis has no idea how to communicate with his team.\n\nThat doesn’t mean they won’t win games of course, but it does go a long way to explaining why guys who transfer from UNC do so well at their new schools. Consider Michigan’s Elliott Cadeau, Minnesota’s Cade Tyson and Vanderbilt’s Tyler Nickel for a few quick examples. Consider also that Caleb Love became a consistent and reliable presence at Arizona in his final two years.\n\nRecap: Big First Half Fuels Wake Past Clemson 85-77\n\nWake Forest answers questions about toughness against Clemson 85-77\n\nClemson Jr. Forward Jake Wahlin postgame following loss to Wake Forest\n\nClemson Tigers Fall Behind Early Again, Lose Third Straight Game to Wake Forest\n\nWake Forest remains hot, extends Clemson’s slide\n\nVirginia overwhelms Georgia Tech with historic first half\n\nAnother bad start sends Georgia Tech to eighth straight loss\n\nUVA Basketball: ‘Hoos dominant in 94-68 blowout win at Georgia Tech\n\nEvaluating UVA basketball’s resumé after 26-point win at Georgia Tech\n\nGo to the DBR Boards to find Blue Healer Auctions | Drop us a line",

    "description": "OpenAI and Meta alum Philip Su said that AI was turning software engineers into managers. The IC role is \"dead,\" he wrote.",
    "fullText": "Use AI at work? You might be a manager and not even know it.\n\nPhilip Su is on the frontline of AI. He worked at OpenAI until 2025, when he left to found his startup, Superphonic. Before that, he worked at Microsoft and Meta.\n\nIn January, Su made a provocative claim on Substack: \"AI Killed the Individual Contributor.\"\n\nSu wrote that software engineers are asked to perform tasks once reserved for managers: set priorities, resolve conflicts, and give feedback. Rather than building, they're spending time \"pondering and tweaking the machine that builds the thing.\"\n\n\"The halcyon days of the IC are over,\" Su wrote. \"Not because AI codes better than you, but because maximizing your productivity necessitates focusing your time on all the things that are, at the end of the day, manager tasks.\"\n\nSu doubled down this week on the podcast \"A Life Engineered.\" He said the IC role was \"probably over\" because engineers were delegating their work to AI.\n\nIf everyone's a manager (of AI), do we need managers (of humans) anymore? Su said yes. There's a \"human coordination problem\" that AI cannot solve, he said.\n\nSu's theory of managerial takeover comes amid the \"great flattening\" in Big Tech. Flat org charts are all the rage: few managers, many ICs. Elon Musk's companies are known for their lack of managers; Amazon and Meta have recently culled management layers as they aim to increase their IC-to-manager ratios.\n\nMeanwhile, tech CEOs are also embracing \"founder mode.\" The reviled opposite of that, according to Paul Graham's 2024 essay, is \"manager mode.\"\n\nBut maybe managers are back en vogue — so long as they're managing AI agents. Vercel COO Jeanne DeWitt Grosser told Business Insider that companies will see a new role: the \"agent manager.\"\n\nThe tools will get better, too. Su already finds that he has to review AI-written code \"less carefully\" than he used to.\n\n\"It might currently feel like managing a team of barely-competent interns,\" he wrote in his essay. \"It'll soon feel like managing a team of very high performers, each better, faster, and smarter than you.\"",

    "description": "From Sam Altman to Demis Hassabis, AI leaders gathered in India to speak about the future of the technology.",
    "fullText": "AI's biggest power players showed up in India on Thursday.\n\nOpenAI's Sam Altman, Anthropic's Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Scale AI's Alexandr Wang, and Mistral's Arthur Mensch spoke in succession at the AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi.\n\nFrom a potential \"AI divide\" to calls for stronger global coordination, here are five of the biggest takeaways from the summit so far.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said the world must not let the digital divide \"become an AI divide.\" He said expanding access to compute infrastructure, connectivity, and training is essential as AI reshapes economies.\n\nPichai said AI represents \"the biggest platform shift of our lifetimes\" and could drive \"hyper progress\" across science, healthcare, and economic development. But its benefits are neither \"guaranteed nor automatic.\"\n\n\"We must be equally bold in tackling problems in regions that have lacked access to technology,\" Pichai said. \"We cannot allow the digital divide to become an AI divide. That means investing in compute infrastructure and connectivity.\"\n\nGovernments must act both as regulators and innovators to ensure AI improves public services and broadens opportunity, he added.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that while AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, there's a gap between those capabilities and real-world impact.\n\n\"There is this duality between the fundamental capabilities of the technology and the time that it takes for those capabilities to diffuse into the world,\" he said.\n\n\"There are just frictions to adopt things through enterprises, and I think even more so in the developing world,\" he added.\n\nThe Google DeepMind CEO said India will be a \"powerhouse for AI\" across the world. He praised summits that bring together scientists, policymakers, and technologists, the latter of whom he said can't be left alone navigating AI.\n\nHassabis said we're in \"one of the most momentous\" times in human history and compared AI to the advent of fire and electricity.\n\n\"It's gonna be something like 10 times the impact of the Industrial Revolution, but happening at 10 times the speed, probably unfolding in a matter of a decade rather than a century,\" he said.\n\nGiven this level of impact, he said we need to use a scientific approach to understand AI's capabilities and build guardrails so that the technology \"serves the purposes that we want.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said rapid advances in AI could require new global governance mechanisms, something akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\"In particular, we expect the world may need something like the IAEA for international coordination of AI,\" Altman said, adding that such a body would need \"the ability to rapidly respond to change in circumstances.\"\n\nAltman said AI's trajectory could create risks that no single company or country can manage alone.\n\n\"We need a society-wide approach about how we're going to defend against this,\" he said, referring to the possibility of highly capable \"bio models\" becoming available.\n\nLong-term AI development is a responsibility to future generations, Altman also said, adding that it is a \"moral imperative\" to ensure future generations can benefit from and build upon technological progress.\n\nMeta's former chief scientist said we're still missing something \"big\" in AI.\n\n\"Why do we have systems that can pass the bar exam and win mathematics olympiads? But we don't have domestic robots. We don't even have self-driving cars,\" LeCun said. \"We certainly do not have several cars that can teach themselves to drive in 20 hours of practice like in 17-year-old.\"\n\nHe said that babies and animals have a much better understanding of the physical world around them than any AI systems today, which is why we don't have \"smart robots\" yet.\n\nHe said what is needed is world models — \"mental models of the world that allow us to think ahead, apprehend new situations, plan, sequence of actions, reason, and predict the consequences of our actions.\"\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company. His new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said we need to make AI effective for the Global South, and that needs conscious planning.\n\n\"We need to make AI as effective in every language as it is in English, and today, it is not,\" he said. \"Performance tests show that's the case.\"\n\n\"One of the good things to come out of this week is new announcements to better data in other languages, to provide better tools and measurement systems for AI that is built in other languages,\" he added.\n\nThe other thing that needs to be done is to work on problems that matter to the Global South. That means focusing on improvements in agriculture for India, and addressing food security in Africa.",

    "description": "Some tech workers are about to get caught \"sleepwalking\" as the culture shifts under their feet.",
    "fullText": "It's a tough time to be just average.\n\nWorkers who are decent at their jobs — but not superstars — are facing a tougher slog in industries like tech, where employers have the upper hand, and AI threatens to automate their roles.\n\nWhat used to be a spectrum of employee performance is hardening into something more binary. Companies are focusing more on two camps: hotshots and underachievers.\n\nThis corporate sorting risks leaving the solid performers who make up the bulk of healthy companies feeling overlooked — and potentially vulnerable, workplace observers told Business Insider.\n\n\"Good-enough, B player is the most dangerous place to be,\" said Jeff Hyman, who has been a recruiter for about 30 years. In part, that's because poor workers don't last long, and midlevel workers might have a false sense of security.\n\n\"They're sleepwalking,\" Hyman said. \"They're spending time polishing their LinkedIn while AI is just starting to, task by task, nibble at their job description.\"\n\nThe split-screen is particularly apparent in tech: Dell is revamping its sales compensation program to boost rewards for its highest performers and trim what goes to those who don't meet their full quota, Business Insider reported this month. In January, Business Insider reported that Meta plans to reward its strongest performers with larger payouts, while Amazon has said it's looking closely at each worker's impact.\n\nIt's an idea long used in marketing — like segmenting a customer base — to reimagine how they manage their workforce, said Richard Smith, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. The thinking goes that leaders should focus on the MVPs who hold \"strategic importance\" for a company in the long term.\n\nLast year, for example, Microsoft gave managers what it described as new and enhanced tools to help them accelerate high performance and \"swiftly address low performance,\" Business Insider reported.\n\nRewarding the stars has \"always been the case, and now it's just more unapologetically so,\" said Alan Stein, a career coach who worked at Facebook, Google, and Salesforce. In part, that's because of a crush of available workers.\n\nWith US companies hiring at one of the lowest rates in over a decade, employers have more leverage and potentially less incentive to invest heavily in developing middle-tier employees, said Smith, who runs the Human Capital Development Lab at Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe tech industry's latest approach, Stein said, marks a departure from what he saw as an \"everybody has potential\" ethos that emerged during the pandemic-era hiring boom.\n\n\"It was a lot of talk,\" said Stein, CEO of Kadima Careers, which offers job seekers coaching on how to get six-figure roles.\n\nIt was little surprise, he said, that Big Tech would ultimately direct a bigger share of payouts to those who get it done — just as pro sports teams reward their standouts.\n\nAt many large organizations, Stein said, about 10% to 20% of employees fall into the \"walks on water camp,\" with a similar share marked as underperformers. The majority sit in the middle — the solid, reliable \"worker bees,\" he said.\n\n\"They can't all be Zuckerberg,\" Stein said, referring to Meta's CEO. \"They need people that get the work done.\"\n\nOne risk for employers that focus heavily on their upper crust is that it can damage morale on the B team and signal to people at other firms — including the rock stars — that a company isn't a great place to work.\n\nBeyond recruiting headaches, a workplace where fear dominates tends to undercut what CEOs often say they want: innovation, creativity, and collaboration.\n\nSmith frames it as a math problem: Is it more valuable to improve the top 5% of your workforce by 20%, or 80% of your workforce by 5%?\n\nFinding ways to create that broad-based improvement creates \"a lot more impact,\" Smith said.\n\nThat risk of middle-child syndrome extends beyond tech to professional services such as law, auditing, engineering, and consulting — all of which are experiencing major shifts, thanks in part to AI, he said.\n\nNot all companies are stepping up efforts to trim their lowest-rated people. After online speculation that it would make a round of performance-based layoffs, Meta told Business Insider this month that it's not planning to cut the bottom 5% of workers this year, as it did in 2025.\n\nThe news isn't necessarily all bad for mid-tier workers either, Stein said. Even in tech, good-enough performers often still receive raises and enviable perks.\n\n\"You still have the free lunch. You still have the equity, and you're still a free agent. You can go somewhere else,\" he said.\n\nHyman, who's CEO of Recruit Rockstars, a recruiting and career management firm, said he advises B players to \"make yourself irreplaceable\" by honing skills AI can't yet do well. That includes showing superior judgment, building relationships with customers, and navigating ambiguity.\n\nIt might also mean learning AI to the point where you can go to your manager and announce that you've created an agent to automate work.\n\n\"That at least buys you time,\" Hyman said.\n\nYet, as soon as AI reaches a tipping point where it can handle a sufficient number of tasks that an average or above-average worker can do, Hyman said, \"that B player is in trouble.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Apple's small but mighty Mac Mini is flying off the shelves.\n\nThe sudden increase in demand is confusing some store workers, who are wondering why now?\n\nIn a TikTok video posted February 9, an employee can be heard telling a customer at Best Buy: \"I don't know what's with the Mac Mini, everyone keeps buying them a lot. Is this some AI thing?\"\n\nYes, it is an AI thing, and it's giving the Mac Mini a moment with tech enthusiasts.\n\n“is this some AI thing??” me trying to explain to Best Buy employees why everyone is coming in to buy the Mac mini #ai #openclaw #clawdbot\n\nOpenClaw is a rapidly evolving, open-source, autonomous AI agent previously known as Clawdbot or Moltbolt. Its creator, Peter Steinberger, recently joined OpenAI after being courted by AI CEOs, including Sam Altman and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg. OpenClaw can organize users' schedules, monitor vibe-coding sessions, and run other AI agents. It can also be locally run on your computer, which can eat up a lot of memory. That's driven a bit of a frenzy for devices with higher memory, like some Mac Minis.\n\nPeople are buying up the 5\"-by-5\" computer at a pace Apple can't seem to keep up with, as the tech giant shows weekslong wait times for the higher-memory Mac Minis. New York-based shoppers, for example, can get the 16-gigabyte Mac Mini by this weekend, while the 24-gigabyte and 32-gigabyte options have shipping and pick-up windows that extend until March 18, as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCustom and higher-memory configurations often take longer to ship, but the online buzz around the Mac Mini and OpenClaw is easy to link.\n\nResellers on eBay are also trying to cash in on the hype. There are dozens of new Mac Mini listings asking for the retail price or more for brand-new and pre-owned computers.\n\nBefore you snap up your M4 chip Mac Mini, you might consider waiting for a new wave of devices to drop. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, known for his inside information on Apple, reported that new Mac computers, including a new mini, are expected in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Nostalgia is everywhere on the internet right now.\n\nWith doomsayers predicting that AI could bring about the apocalypse, this January marking the highest number of layoffs to kick off a year since 2009, and ongoing political unrest, people are harking back to simpler times.\n\nRather than looking forward to the year ahead, many people hailed in 2026 by reminiscing about 2016 — posting throwback pictures and declaring that 2026 will be the new 2016, set to songs released around that time, such as Zara Larsson's \"Lush Life.\"\n\nMany have thrown it back even further — think pieces and experts have dubbed 2026 the \"year of analog.\" This trend is less about trying to live like it's 2016, but more 2006 — or 1996.\n\nThe tech-induced nostalgia is shining through in recent Reddit posts that ask: \"What is a luxury item from 20 years ago that is basically worthless trash today?\"\n\nThis question has been posted on Reddit in several threads over the last few months. These threads have amassed thousands of comments in the past few weeks.\n\nAmong the items people are discussing are portable GPS devices, digital cameras, iPods, and paying for novelty ringtones.\n\n\"I paid $700 for one of those in... 2003?\" one Reddit user says of a portable GPS device. \"Best purchase ever because I'm directionally challenged and relied on MapQuest (!) printouts on the passenger seat.\"\n\n\"Ringtones. Oh you want one of your ringtones to be a 5 seconds snippets from Lose yourself. That'll be 8.50$. People would flex about their ringtones,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nIn another post, a Redditor reminisced about USB storage drives.\n\n\"I remember in 5th grade, a flash drive was on our required supplies list, and I got one that was 512mb. A teacher told me that was more than I would need for the rest of my life,\" they wrote.\n\nThe PalmPilot, BlackBerry, plasma TVs, and SD cards have also gotten repeat mentions.\n\nSome of these pieces of tech — namely the digital camera — have been reborn in recent years as status symbols for a generation craving a time that felt more authentic.\n\nAs part of the push to get offline, many Gen Z and millennials are rejecting new technology by Bricking their phones — blocking certain apps and websites — and leaning into in-person hobbies.\n\nKathryn Jezer-Morton recently wrote for The Cut that 2026 is all about \"friction-maxxing\" — a rejection of the numbing convenience that AI and technology bring us, which Jezer-Morton says is distancing us from life itself.\n\nIt's as if consumers are harking back to a time when it felt as though technology was made to work for us, rather than make our lives more complicated.\n\n\"After a period of intense euphoria and excitement with regards to AI, we are coming down on the other side of the hill,\" Thomas Roulet, a professor of organizational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The tool is democratised and has become normalised, and people realise it hasn't made their work easier or less intense — quite the opposite,\" he added.\n\n\"So it's normal to find GenZ employees — who will have to go through their entire career using those tools — to be disillusioned,\" he said.\n\nWhen the future of AI is being predicted by some tech execs and experts as a white-collar bloodbath with millions of workers laid off, or that those living without AI glasses could be at a \"cognitive disadvantage,\" it's no wonder.\n\nIn an uncertain time, one thing that's sure in 2026: de-digitalizing your life is officially a status symbol.",

In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.\n\nThe DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.\n\nThe judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.\n\nThe reprieve from the California DMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.",

    "description": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat",
    "fullText": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US quietly funded a global effort to keep the internet from splintering into fiefdoms run by authoritarian governments. Now that money is seriously threatened and a large part of it is already gone, putting into jeopardy internet freedoms around the world.\n\nManaged by the US state department and the US Agency for Global Media, the programme – broadly called Internet Freedom – funds small groups all over the world, from Iran to China to the Philippines, who built grassroots technologies to evade internet controls imposed by governments. It has dispensed well over $500m (£370m) in the past decade, according to an analysis by the Guardian, including $94m in 2024.\n\nThen came Doge, Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency, tasked with reducing the size of US government agencies and initiatives. Career employees who staffed Internet Freedom resigned or were sacked in 2025 as part of larger reductions. Many of its programmes were cut permanently; its main granting office issued no money in 2025. The Open Technology Fund (OTF), a nonprofit that works with the government to direct roughly half of this money, won a lawsuit to get some of this funding restored in December; the Trump administration is now appealing against that ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration this January withdrew from the Freedom Online Coalition, a global alliance set up by the US to defend digital rights.\n\nThe cuts risk curtailing technologies that helped Iranians to coordinate during recent anti-government protests, and that allowed videos and images of massacres to reach the outside world. They could have a major impact in other nations too; the efforts of groups in Myanmar to get past the junta’s “digital iron curtain”, and the ability of users in China to avoid surveillance.\n\n“The programme was effectively gutted,” said a former US official. “They didn’t issue any grants this year.”\n\n“I would like to live in a world where a single US programme is not such a linchpin, such a load-bearing programme, but it has been. It’s hard to deny it has been,” said one digital rights expert based in Europe who has worked on a number of projects for Internet Freedom.\n\nTo report this story, the Guardian spoke to 10 people with knowledge of Internet Freedom, including six of its grantees, and reviewed documents related to its operations and budget.\n\nThe US Department of State has been approached for comment. The OTF declined to comment.\n\nThe purpose of the programme was to make it extremely difficult to do what North Korea has accomplished through decades of censorship efforts, and what Iran succeeded in doing this January during a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests: cut an entire population off from the global internet.\n\nThe US aimed to circumvent this by funding groups capable of building and harnessing technologies that evade such restrictions and censorship. These include familiar tools, such as the encrypted messaging service Signal and the Tor browser, which allows users to be anonymous online.\n\nThey also include far more powerful tools. Advanced circumvention technologies can make it possible to get past even extremely powerful censorship regimes – to leap the firewall in China, for example, or to obtain international news in Iran even when mobile phone networks are out, through methods like satellite datacasting, in which data is broadcast in a similar way to television signal.\n\nAnother technology has allowed Iranians to securely communicate during recent anti-government protests, alerting each other to shootings and police presence, even as the rest of the internet has been cut off.\n\nThe soft-power aim behind this was to keep the internet as it is: mostly accessible, mostly a global commons. The groups it funded made censorship costly and difficult. “When you challenge censorship, the long-term effect is that oppressive governments must either open their internet, or to go in the direction of North Korea,” said the former US official.\n\n“But because each of those options is costly for them, they’ll keep trying to censor their networks so as to have the economic benefits of the internet without the drawbacks of freedom of speech and access to information. So the fight continues.”\n\n“Internet Freedom funded the development of many of the censorship-circumvention technologies that millions of people around the world depend on to maintain a link to the outside world,” said Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who works closely with many of these groups.\n\nTheir makers are “often operating on a shoestring and passion. They believe in the cause. There’s no fancy offices, they’re working out of their apartments. It’s not a moneyed industry.”\n\nMost recipients of this money keep it quiet; it’s a dangerous thing, in some places, to take state department funds. But even as the funds run out, more and more organisations – journalists, activists, and civil society – are seeking out these technologies, and the groups that build them. Censorship regimes are getting worse worldwide.\n\n“It’s a massive blow. The need is bigger and other funding is also gone. Organisations that provide these tools are being overwhelmed,” said the digital rights expert. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\nSome of the groups working on these technologies have laid off staff; others are continuing without pay. A few hold out hope that some money can be restored – although they fear that the Trump administration might more overtly politicise its aims. While a recent appropriations bill contains a budget line for Internet Freedom, it names no specific programmes as recipients of this cash.\n\nOthers say they’re existing in a brief grace period as the rest of the funds run out.\n\n“Everybody’s just waiting right now, to be honest. But at the same time, wait at your own risk,” said an Iranian technologist funded through Internet Freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, censorship tech is growing cheaper and easier to access. Chinese companies have exported sophisticated middleboxes – devices that sit on network cables and allow authorities to monitor internet traffic – to countries across Africa and Asia in the past year. These allow regimes such as Iran’s to fine-tune their control over the domestic internet – allowing commerce to continue, for example, while communication is throttled.\n\nSeveral recipients of the US money expressed hope that Europe might fund these technologies in the future; some have already petitioned EU officials for funding.\n\nThe cuts “make it easier to build a ‘digital iron curtain’. It makes it easier for the Kremlin to put Russians in a digital information bubble that reinforces specific narratives about people outside of Russia. This makes it easier for China to do this. For Iran to do this,” one said.",

    "fullText": "China didn't just celebrate Lunar New Year this week. It staged a robotics flex.\n\nAt the annual Spring Festival Gala, the Lunar New Year show in China, humanoid robots from Chinese startup Unitree Robotics flipped, lunged, and swung swords and nunchucks just feet from child performers in a tightly choreographed kung fu routine.\n\nIn one sequence inspired by \"drunken boxing,\" a traditional Chinese martial arts style, the robots staggered, fell backward, then rose again — showcasing advances in control and coordination.\n\nClips circulating online quickly drew comparisons to last year's broadcast, which featured Unitree humanoid robots performing a Chinese folk dance. The choreography then was noticeably simpler.\n\nThe gala, often likened to the US Super Bowl for its massive audience, also featured other Chinese robotics firms, including MagicLab, Galbot, and Noetix, in separate segments throughout the broadcast on Monday evening.\n\nReactions on Chinese social media showed viewers being struck by how quickly the technology has advanced.\n\nOn RedNote, a user who goes by Ma Xiao said in a video posted on Wednesday that during last year's performance, the robots were only \"doing very simple things.\"\n\n\"Now, they're doing kung fu, they're doing flips, they're doing synchronized dancing,\" he said. \"Everybody's shocked.\"\n\n\"Now the rest of the world knows what China's speed is,\" he added.\n\nAnother RedNote user, DKKD, posted a video of friends reacting to the performance on Tuesday, captioning it: \"Three Americans were scared by the Spring Festival robot.\"\n\n\"They were all shocked by the robot's level of evolution (including me),\" the user wrote.\n\nOne viewer in the video can be heard saying: \"It's way more impressive than last year. It's crazy.\"\n\nUnitree CEO Wang Xingxing said in an interview with Chinese media following the gala that the company expects to ship up to 20,000 humanoid robots this year, up from about 5,500 in 2025.\n\nGlobal shipments of humanoid robots could reach \"tens of thousands\" this year, with Unitree potentially contributing between 10,000 and 20,000 units, Wang said on Tuesday.\n\nChinese companies developing humanoid robots and autonomous systems are racing to outdo global rivals.\n\nIn September, Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, unveiled R1, a humanoid robot that drew comparisons to Tesla's Optimus. Two months later, EV and robotics maker XPeng introduced the latest version of its humanoid, Iron, which the company described as \"highly human-like.\"\n\nChina's elite universities are also moving to build talent for the sector. In November, China's Ministry of Education issued a notice stating that top institutions are preparing to launch a new undergraduate major in \"embodied intelligence,\" a field that combines AI with robotics.\n\nStill, China's rapid push into robotics hasn't been seamless.\n\nXPeng's Iron fell face-first during its first public appearance in China earlier this year. Its CEO, He Xiaopeng, later wrote on Chinese social media that the mishap was part of \"learning to walk.\"\n\nLast month, a Unitree humanoid kicked an engineer in the groin during a test. Humanoid robots stumbled and fell while racing against humans in a half-marathon in Beijing in April last year.",

    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a landmark trial about social media addiction. Parents who attended hope the 'tide will turn' against Big Tech.",
    "fullText": "Lori Schott, a mother from rural Colorado, said she stared down Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg as he walked into court in Los Angeles on Wednesday to testify in a landmark trial regarding social media addiction.\n\nSchott lost her 18-year-old daughter, Annalee, to suicide in 2020. She believes the content Annalee saw on social media platforms \"destroyed\" her mental health.\n\n\"I made eye contact with him for quite a long time,\" Schott said of Zuckerberg. \"I was not backing down.\"\n\nSchott is not a plaintiff in the case where Zuckerberg testified on Wednesday, but is among more than 2,000 individuals who have similar personal injury lawsuits pending regarding social media addiction and harm.\n\nThe case underway in Los Angeles centers on a 20-year-old woman, identified by the initials KGM, who says her use of social media throughout her childhood negatively affected her mental health, contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts. It is considered a bellwether trial that could indicate how other similar lawsuits related to social media harm, like Schott's, could play out.\n\nMeta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, was named as a defendant alongside Google-owned YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat. TikTok and Snapchat both settled the lawsuit out of court.\n\nLast month, Meta warned investors that its mounting legal battles over youth safety could \"significantly impact\" its 2026 financial results. Attorneys for more than 100,000 individual arbitration claimants have \"sent mass arbitration demands relating to 'social media addiction'\" since late 2024, the company said in a 2026 10-K, which warned that potential damages in certain cases could reach into the \"high tens of billions of dollars.\"\n\nIn a statement, Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokesperson, said: \"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\" Otway highlighted changes the company has made over the past decade, including Teen Accounts, which give parents tools to manage their teens' accounts.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. A Snapchat spokesperson said in a statement: \"The Parties are pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, parents showed up hours before the courthouse opened in hopes of getting a seat inside. Many of them had personal stories about how they believed social media use harmed their children.\n\n\"We face a lot of stigma from people telling us we're bad parents,\" said Amy Neville, another parent who attended to show her support. She said that once the evidence comes out in the trial, she believes \"the tide will turn, and the general public will be on board with us.\"\n\n\"It is by design that social media is tearing their family apart,\" Neville said.\n\nOn the stand, Zuckerberg said that teens represent less than 1% of Meta's ad revenue and that most teens don't have disposable income, so it's not especially valuable to advertisers to reach them.\n\nZuckerberg said it's in Meta's best interest to create a platform that inspires people and makes them want to stick around for the long term.\n\n\"If people aren't happy with a service, eventually over time they'll stop using it and use something better,\" he said.\n\nSarah Gardner said that regardless of the outcome of the trial, she hopes it raises awareness about how the social media companies, and specifically Zuckerberg, have been operating. Gardner is the CEO of the Heat Initiative, an advocacy group that pressures Big Tech companies to make their platforms safer for kids. She was at the courthouse with the parents who believe they have been affected.\n\nGardner said she's hopeful the trial will empower more people to say, \"I don't want to be on Instagram anymore.\"",

He argued that the era of “static” tools—where businesses must bend their workflows to fit a software's limitations—is rapidly ending.\n\n\"Software is dead because everything's going to be customized to your unique utilization,\" Cuban stated, citing a shift where AI models mold themselves around specific business needs in real time.\n\nThis AI Helps Fortune 1000 Brands Avoid Costly Ad Mistakes — See Why Investors Are Paying Attention\n\nOwn the Characters, Not Just the Content: Inside a Fast-Growing Pre-IPO IP Company\n\nHe noted that even industry titans like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) are recognizing this shift toward “unique usage” over general-purpose platforms.\n\nThe ETFs tracking the software stocks in the U.S. have underperformed so far in 2026. iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV) dropped 19.34%, and State Street SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF (NYSE:XSW) declined 17.56%.\n\nMark Cuban just pronounced software dead, and the implications will destroy industries before most people understand what happened.\n\nCuban: \"Software is dead because everything's going to be customized to your unique utilization.\"\n\nRigid SaaS dies.

    "fullText": "Australia experienced a boom in smart-home technology at the start of the 2020s. Years on, some early adopters are experiencing buyer’s remorse\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nWhen the smart home devices Elly Bailey was expecting in the post never showed up at her Gold Coast home, she was frustrated. As a technology reviewer, these products were crucial for her work.\n\nWhen she eventually found the cause, she had to laugh. It wasn’t a sticky-fingered neighbour or a rogue delivery driver causing her to miss parcels, but her smart doorbell – the very thing she’d hoped would prevent missed deliveries, and part of exactly the range of internet-connected devices she was meant to be reviewing.\n\n“It’s pretty funny,” says Bailey, 33, who goes by the handle @ellyawesome on TikTok, where she has more than 1.1 million followers. She’d been loving her Google Nest doorbell up until then. She could see who was at the front door from upstairs and speak to delivery people through her phone while she was out.\n\nBut it had one obvious flaw: “When someone presses this doorbell, all it does is send a notification to my phone.” She says this feature is “great” when she’s out, but without a telltale chime she was missing deliveries while at home and away from her phone. She complained about this to her followers in a clip that’s been liked more than 1,400 times.\n\n“The crazy irony is the doorbell itself does make a little ding-dong sound when you press the doorbell button, but it’s only loud enough for the person at the door to hear it,” she says.\n\nBailey is far from alone in her scepticism around smart home technology – many adoptees have realised the devices designed to make life easier regularly achieve the opposite. Stories of people being locked out of their homes by faulty smart locks, woken up by pets activating cameras on the driveway, and being left in the dark by broken smart lights are rife on social media and product review websites.\n\n“Technology is brilliant … until it isn’t,” says Georgina Wilson, an architect in Sydney who learned this the hard way when her husband pressure-hosed the front of the house and accidentally watered their smart keypad unit. The incident hasn’t changed her mind on the convenience of a smart lock, but it did result in an expensive emergency locksmith callout – and quickly forced her to put a backup plan in place: keys in a hidden lockbox, with copies distributed to family members and neighbours.\n\nShe says some of her clients have had similar, or worse, experiences. “We’ve seen clients unable to flush toilets, lock front doors, or exit garages during power outages.”\n\nSince smart home technology uptake spiked during Covid lockdowns, Daniel Vasilevski, an electrician in Sydney, says he’s seen many smart tech horror stories. One client in Maroubra got locked out of their house for two days. Others have ended up with no working lights. Subscription complaints are also rife, with even some relatively simple devices like smart doorbells and thermostats requiring monthly fees. Vasilevski estimates 15 to 20% of his callouts these days are for problems with smart tech – some are simple repair jobs, while others want their smart systems demolished altogether.\n\nThere can be a more sinister side, too. Experts say smart homes are prime targets for cybercriminals. More than 120,000 smart home cameras were hacked in South Korea last year and the Australian Signals Directorate recently warned that Chinese hackers are exploiting people’s home routers and smart devices.\n\nWhile cases of spying fridges and doorbells being hacked are still rare, Emily Holyoake, a cyber and home-security expert based in Canberra, says technology facilitated domestic abuse is a significant issue.\n\n“The scariest things I’ve heard are about loss of privacy, where ex-partners have still had access to their partner’s home and made changes either locking them out, letting themselves in or watching their every move,” she says.\n\nRenters, too, have privacy concerns, as smart locks can allow landlords to keep tabs on their every move.\n\nJulie Provenzano, a real estate broker with 83,000 TikTok followers, believes it might be smarter to stick with an analogue home. She recently told fans she was “apped-out”. “Hi-tech doesn’t necessarily mean easier … It leaves people in a hostage situation with IT departments,” she said.\n\nVasilevski’s clients have faced similar issues. When something goes wrong, it’s not just the tech that’s a problem, but finding someone to fix it. Many locksmiths are not trained to work with sophisticated, connected devices. He says electricians will sometimes turn away smart home repair jobs because of how faffy and time-consuming they can be to troubleshoot. “It isn’t worth the hassle, most of the time,” he says. This is particularly true with lower-end smart tech suppliers who offer little in the way of after-sale support.\n\nGaby Albutros, a project manager at Sydney firm RSE Home Automation, says that when brands shut down or devices are discontinued, as was the case with Belkin’s Wemo smart home range in January, customers can be left high and dry.“The only option when they go wrong is to have them ripped out.”\n\nCurtains and blinds seem to be among the few smart-control devices that experts in the industry agree upon. Provenzano says they’re one of the only smart devices she endorses, and Vasilevski agrees, saying he wouldn’t install smart tech in his home because of the issues he sees at work, but that “smart control curtains are pretty reliable because they only get used twice a day”.\n\nWhile Holyoake doesn’t suggest eschewing the Internet of Things entirely, she says the key is to be intentional about the technology you’re putting in your home. In her household, she uses smart security cameras, lighting, a robot vacuum and even a digital whiteboard – all things she says make family life easier, especially with neurodivergent kids.\n\nMindful of the risks, she suggests smart-home adopters make time to check their security settings once a month. “Make sure only the people you know and trust have access, always make sure you change the default password, check for security and software updates, and always ask: who has access to my data and where is it stored? Do I need a subscription to access my own data? Can I still access devices if the internet goes out?”\n\nBailey might be a likely champion for all things smart, but even she prefers a hybrid setup. She’s been offered everything from smart lights to smart washing machines as part of her job, so she could have the world’s most connected home if she wanted to, but aside from the smart doorbell – which she’s kept because she still thinks the benefits outweigh the drawbacks – she’s chosen to keep most parts of her home “consciously dumb”.\n\n“Ultimately I’m an old-school millennial who’s very happy to put my washing on myself,” she says. “I think that keeps me smart, to be honest.”",

    "fullText": "AI's next target? Helping you kick your phone addiction.\n\nAI devices are a top priority for Big Tech companies that view it as the future of how humans and AI interact, writes BI's Amanda Hoover.\n\nYou've likely heard of this hardware before, which acts as a sort of AI sidekick for your life. From the Rabbit R1 and Humane to Friend, the names are different, but the stories are the same: big expectations, difficult execution.\n\nAmanda's story covers how it's not just upstarts looking to shake things up. Tech giants like Apple, Meta, and OpenAI are working on their own solutions.\n\nIt's an uphill battle considering how addicted most of us are to our phones. However, the push for phone-free lifestyles, especially among Gen Z, does create an opening.\n\nThese tech giants also don't have much of a choice.\n\nApple, for example, has largely sat out the AI wars, saving a ton of money on model development. That only works if the iPhone remains a key distribution channel for the AI it's skipping out on developing.\n\nMeta's business is also heavily reliant on smartphone usage. (How often do you check Instagram on your desktop computer? Do you even have a desktop computer?) If user behavior around phones changes in a meaningful way, you can bet Meta wants to be ahead of it.\n\nAI devices also give companies a front-row seat to your life.\n\nYou could argue that's already the case with these AI chatbots. I'd argue the relationship between you and your chatbot of choice is still mostly transactional. You have a question/problem/thought; the chatbot has an answer (hopefully).\n\nThe relationship with AI wearables is more fluid. It's always listening, learning, and collecting. The pitch is that makes it a better copilot. Understanding your habits means it can figure out the best way to serve you.\n\nThat's putting a lot of faith, and your personal data, into an AI device, though\n\nMany executives I've spoken to have said this is the future. Truly leveraging AI is about incorporating it into your daily routine, not treating it as a one-off for specific problems.\n\nThe irony is that strategy has the potential to make AI even more addictive than the smartphones it's trying to replace.",

    "description": "Western militaries often view new technology as precious and valuable. Ukraine shows that they can't afford to view small drones that way.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's large-scale drone war is pushing Western militaries to treat small drones less as high-end equipment and more as expendable ammunition that isn't meant to come back.\n\nUS Army and British Army officials, as well as a NATO veteran who volunteered to fight in Ukraine, told Business Insider that effective drone warfare requires sending large numbers forward — and accepting many will be lost as a routine cost.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the US Army's new drone lethality course, told Business Insider that the conflict shows that \"if you're going to flood the zone with drones,\" especially in a combat situation where electronic warfare is heavy, \"you're going to lose a lot of drones.\"\n\nShe said it's a \"transition from the army of old,\" where a lost drone was \"a significant emotional event\" that was reported to senior leadership. In Ukraine, it's different. \"Drones go down all the time.\" There, losses are typically shrugged off, rather than investigated.\n\nThat shifting mindset is shaping how Western militaries train.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the British Army's 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards, told Business Insider that his battalion has changed its training to allow drones to be damaged or even destroyed to reflect battlefield realities. \"I absolutely think they need to be disposable because otherwise you're not training realistically,\" he said.\n\nJakub Jajcay, a former special forces member from Slovakia who fought in Ukraine, told Business Insider that if NATO militaries want to start using drones for real missions, they \"need to get used to the fact that they're basically expendable material more akin to ammunition or fuel or gasoline, things like that, rather than specialized high-end pieces of equipment that need to be looked after.\"\n\nHe said when he was serving in the military for his home country, \"drones were very specialized pieces of equipment.\"\n\nThe drones were fairly expensive, he shared, \"and there was always a sort of bureaucratic process\" in using them. Sometimes, only designated individuals were allowed to use the drones.\n\nIf something happened to a drone, \"that would've been a big problem in training. If we had lost a drone, somebody would've been in big trouble for that.\" The war in Ukraine shows how poorly that peacetime mindset fits large-scale combat.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has featured drones on an unprecedented scale. Ukraine says roughly 80% of its strikes are carried out using drones rather than other weapons. Many never reach their targets and are lost along the way, though.\n\nCheap drones worth several hundred dollars have destroyed weaponry worth millions. But many of them don't have any effect. A report last year from the UK's Royal United Services Institute said that \"between 60 and 80% of Ukrainian FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators.\"\n\nSome drones are jammed or disrupted by electronic warfare, while others are shot down or get their cables cut. Sometimes they're knocked out by soldiers on their own side.\n\nMany of the drones on the battlefield are single-use, designed to explode when they hit their target, but many of them are destroyed, damaged, or disabled before they even reach that point.\n\nJajcay said that even drones designed to be used again and again \"have a lifespan of maybe a few dozen missions at most.\"\n\nHe also said that drones failed \"all the time,\" and those losses were expected.\n\nThe US Army is recognizing and learning from these dynamics in Ukraine, as are other Western militaries, as they incorporate the idea that drones cannot be treated as overly precious assets into their drone warfare training and doctrine.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider that out of the thousands of drones used daily, only around 30% of them hit their targets, while many others don't have a significant impact on their targets.\n\nThe Army is learning that lots of drones need to be sent forward.\n\nIrwin-Clark told Business Insider that the way the UK sees drones has also shifted. He said \"every time there's an iterative change in technology in the battlefield, everyone gets very excited about it and the ownership of that asset tends to be far too high.\"\n\nHe said that often when a new and powerful technology emerges, senior leaders will try to tightly control it, arguing that because there are only a handful available, only a select few should have the authority to decide when it's used. The assets are carefully protected, at least initially. Later on, trust is imparted to soldiers to handle technology previously in the charge of higher-ups.\n\nThat pattern, Irwin-Clark said, is \"exactly what's happening with drones.\"\n\nHis battalion wrapped the first drones it received years ago in bubble wrap, \"and we didn't fly them very often,\" he said. \"When we did,\" he continued, \"we made sure we flew in the middle of a field with nothing, no obstacles around.\"\n\nNow, his battalion is deliberately crashing its latest drone delivery into targets, while looking at how to make repairs. \"It really doesn't matter if we break them,\" Irwin-Clark said.\n\nThe US is coming at it the same way. Martin, who previously commanded a Gray Eagle drone company, said her course takes into account that \"drones crash. I'll say that to the day I die having owned drones as a commander: drones crash.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last year that the defense department needs to view small drones as consumables rather than \"durable property\" — more like ammunition than valuable equipment. It's a change that Jajcay described as \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nWestern armies were using various drones in warfare before Russia's invasion, often using them as surveillance platforms or tools for launching missile strikes. Small drones weren't used the way they're being used in Ukraine, but the US, UK, and others are learning drone lessons from the war.\n\nMartin said the ongoing conflict in Ukraine shows that even when you lose drones, it's ultimately \"still cheaper than employing missiles on specific targets.\" That's an equation the US Army can't totally ignore.\n\n\"They're cheaper, and you're not putting human lives in danger\" to carry out the mission, she shared. And the Army knows that \"they're going to crash. It's going to happen.\"",

    "fullText": "There's one corner of the tech sector where investors can hide out from AI disruption while still benefiting from the technology's adoption, Wedbush says.\n\nAnalysts led by Dan Ives, a vocal AI mega bull, flagged cybersecurity as a space that will see rising demand driven by AI, while steering clear of the AI worries that have rattled the market so far in 2026.\n\nExperts have called AI a double-edged sword for the cybersecurity industry, as the evolving technology is strengthening the capabilities of both cyber attackers and defenders.\n\n\"AI will be a major tailwind to the cyber security sector over the coming years as protection of use cases, data, and end points expand markedly,\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"As attack frequency, success rates, and blast radius rise with AI deployments, cybersecurity becomes even more mission-critical risk management, reinforcing budget resilience in this new AI driven IT budget world,\" they added.\n\nCybersecurity is among the fastest growing areas of enterprise IT spending. Gartner expects global AI cybersecurity spending to hit $51 billion in 2026, roughly doubling from the year prior.\n\nWedbush highlighted three stocks as the best-positioned in the space: Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler.\n\nWhat Wedbush says: \"We believe that CRWD's position as the gold standard of cybersecurity remains firmly unchanged in the face of this software sell-off with the company's innovative, best-in-class Falcon platform becoming increasingly effective in the modern threat landscape as AI adversaries become an incrementally larger threat for enterprises heading down the AI path.\"\n\nWhat Wedbush says: '\"AI is not displacing PANW's value proposition, but has actually made it more relevant, not less, as it is forcing customers to consolidate vendors, improve visibility, and automate response as threats become more adaptive and effective.\"\n\nWhat Wedbush says: \"AI is amplifying the need to secure access to data, models, and applications everywhere, reinforcing the mission-critical nature of ZS's offering, driving durable subscription growth and high renewal visibility.\"",

    "fullText": "Microsoft says it is on track to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring artificial intelligence to lower-income countries, as concerns mount over the technology’s potential to deepen inequality.\n\nThe announcement was made Wednesday at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where leading tech executives, government officials and AI researchers are debating how to use AI to solve real-world problems.\n\nPolicymakers globally are increasingly worried that the unequal adoption of AI risks widening income and development gaps between rich and poor countries. In December, the United Nations Development Project called for global cooperation on standards and safety to ensure the technology “functions as a shared public good rather than a concentrated advantage.”\n\nAt the summit, Microsoft likewise expressed the need for cross-border partnerships to prevent poorer countries from being left behind.\n\n“We need to act with urgency to address the growing AI divide,” Microsoft president Brad Smith and chief responsible AI officer Natasha Crampton said in a joint statement. “Artificial intelligence is diffusing at an impressive speed, but its adoption around the world remains profoundly uneven.”\n\nThe company’s $50 billion commitment to developing economies by 2030 compares with the roughly $80 billion that Microsoft invested into data centers last year alone, more than half of which was directed to a single economy: the United States.\n\nA recent Microsoft report found that AI usage in the global north, a catch-all term for developed and high-income countries, is roughly twice that of the global south — and growing.\n\n“This disparity impacts not only national and regional economic growth, but whether AI can deliver on its broader promise of expanding opportunity and prosperity around the world,” Smith and Crampton said.\n\nThey warned that, just as unequal access to electricity has exacerbated a growing economic gap between the global north and south, without urgent action, the AI divide could perpetuate that disparity in the century ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, the technology could be used positively to help poor countries leapfrog older development pathways. “If AI is deployed broadly and used well by a young and growing population, it offers a real prospect for catch-up economic growth for the Global South,” said Smith and Crampton.\n\n“It might even provide the biggest such opportunity of the 21st century,” the pair said.\n\nMicrosoft’s $50 billion investment will, among other things, help to build the data centers crucial to providing the computing power needed to run AI models. Extending internet access is another focus.\n\nOnly about 36% of Africa’s population had broadband internet access in 2022, according to the World Bank. That compares with some 90% of US households, official figures show.\n\nThe AI Impact Summit, hosted by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highlights the country’s ambition to position itself as an AI leader in the global south.\n\nHigh-profile attendees include Sam Altman of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai who is due to deliver a keynote address on Friday.",

    "title": "OpenAI, Meta, and Apple's latest battle: Breaking your phone addiction",
    "description": "The tech companies that created our phone addiction are trying to cure us with AI wearables.",
    "fullText": "The average American picks up their phone more than 200 times a day. Teens are pinged with some 250 notifications a day — during school, after school, and overnight. The apps meant to prevent you from checking apps have done little to stop the problem. Now, some of the tech companies that helped create our screen dependence are trying to disrupt it.\n\nLater this year, OpenAI plans to debut a small, screenless device that Sam Altman describes as more \"peaceful\" than a smartphone. Apple, the Oz of screentime, is developing smart glasses, a pin, and AirPods with more AI built in, according to a Tuesday report from Bloomberg, with the rumored pendants featuring microphones and cameras to be the \"eyes and ears\" of the iPhone. Meta has teased its fully augmented reality Orion glasses since 2024. While that device doesn't have a release date, the company last year sold some 7 million pairs of its smart glasses, which is the start of the post-smartphone future Mark Zuckerberg has predicted. Eventual smart specs could be more screen all-the-time than screenless, but they also rely on AI to make the experience much more hands-free than swiping and scrolling on a phone.\n\nCould AI be what finally breaks our phone addiction?\n\nSince 2007, no device out of Silicon Valley has captured universal imagination the way Steve Jobs did when he put your iPod, your phone, and the internet together on a 3.5-inch screen. Competitors have tried for a decade-plus to get people to shift us from the iPhone to smart glasses, and largely failed. The awe around smartphones has turned to derision, as excessive screen time is linked to disrupted sleep, anxiety, and fractured attention. Now, developers are hoping the AI boom can give us the next big thing.\n\nBeating the smartphone would mean replacing a device that 91% of American adults now carry — a device for which millions of apps have been developed and people now depend on in lieu of wallets and cameras and health monitors. New AI devices can't just copy what smartphones do, says Ramon Llamas, a research director at a technology intelligence firm IDC: They have to show they have a solution to an everyday problem. If they don't, Llama says, \"these things are just gonna really end up as solutions looking for a problem to solve.\"\n\nCritiques of screen time can be as blunt and smoothbrained as what the critics say excessive screen time makes you. A seven-hour daily log may seem like a staggering amount of dependence, but what did the person spend those seven hours doing? Doomscrolling late into the night, or FaceTiming with a far-away friend? With AI wearables, there's the risk of becoming dependent on the device for different reasons.\n\n\"The screen may not be there, but what's getting filled in the back is already this problem of AI companionship,\" says Olivia Gambelin, an AI ethicist and author of the book \"Responsible AI.\" An AI device designed to do something very specific — like listen to a meeting and then send follow-up emails or messages related to action points discussed — could save people time and keep them from writing tedious emails and Slack messages from their desk. But that same device listening in to personal conversations with family and friends could compromise a relationship, and erode the positive effects that texting a friend to check-in can have on both people (already, my friends are tiring of AI summaries on the iPhone that summarize our group text and become an intermediary into our threads of gossip and jokes in the name of efficiency). Wearing microphones and cameras to social interactions and into businesses is likely to really weird out some of the people around you. More people are entering into romantic, dependent relationships with AI companions, and a swell of loud dissenters are criticizing the technology for taking jobs and attempting to replicate human relationships.\n\nBut OpenAI is betting that it can package its technology in a device in a way that calms the user. \"When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way,\" Altman said in November. OpenAI's device, he said, would be less Time Square, more \"sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm.\" That's because the AI device would learn \"contextual awareness of your whole life,\" and when best to send you alerts.\n\nOther AI wearables have failed by falling short of that goal. Humane AI sold a wearable pin, priced at $700 plus a monthly fee to connect it, but pulled it from the market a year ago. It failed perhaps because it tried too hard to replace our phones — it didn't interact with them, but provided a shoddy replacement. Novelty wasn't a factor that could outshine usability. The AI Friend pendant, which can't search the internet or help with tasks outside of sending reminders and acts instead as an eavesdropping sycophant around its user's neck, was mocked relentlessly and sold just a few thousand devices after it hit the market last year.\n\nCompanies trying to make AI hardware should focus on \"transformative features,\" Jason Low, research director at Omdia, tells me in an email. AI wearables must be more than \"marginally more convenient,\" should integrate with our existing products, and have a clear, stated value. For example, glasses that provide real-time language translation or devices for fitness and health tracking offer features our smartphones can't do as well. The Oura ring continues to grow in popularity, particularly among women after starting out as a niche tech bro buy, for the novel insights it can offer; the company announced last fall it has sold 5.5 million rings since 2015, with more than 2.5 million sold between June 2024 and September 2025. \"These devices often deliver a more polished user experience compared to general-purpose, do-it-all AI devices,\" Low says.\n\nLlamas tells me that the AI functions of a wearable have to be \"contextual, personalized, and actionable,\" like reminding the wearer to send birthday flowers or responding accurately to being asked to direct the user to the nearest Starbucks. A first attempt device shouldn't try to replace the smartphone, but to integrate with the Apple or Google ecosystems, he says. Apple and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment about their rumored products for this story.\n\nIf anything has hyped Silicon Valley like the iPhone, it's been AI. But three years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, the value generative AI in the white collar workforce has yet to be fully realized. That could make a product for consumers a hard sell, too. \"Some of the overwhelm that's coming with AI that I see in general users is you can use it for everything, or it's promoted that way, which is actually quite stifling,\" Gambelin says.\n\nIn our quest to find a peaceful equilibrium with tech, the screen itself may not be the problem; it's what's summoning us to the screen. Its bright colors, games, and infinite scroll give quick dopamine hits that entice us to stay glued to it. But much of what pings my phone throughout the day are useless notifications trying to get me to reopen one of the dozens of apps — a markdown moment on a clothing thrifting app, a like on the Instagram story I've posted of my dog from my best friend, and ironically, a report of how much time I've already logged. There's a relentless business model at play to keep us on these apps. No screens would mean no infinite scroll through TikTok, no Candy Crush — but app developers and companies may need to find new ways to reach people if wearables caught on, and an always-there AI device and companion might not be as peaceful as Altman describes. Our collective screen time is a problem, but the AI wearable will have to surprise us all with something novel to be useful.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "fullText": "Last year, the bears came out of hibernation.\n\nThere were 166 short-selling campaigns launched in 2025, according to industry tracker Diligent Market Intelligence — a 55% bump compared to 2024. The vast majority were based in the US.\n\nThe most targeted companies were technology stocks that had been boosted by market-wide optimism about artificial intelligence, Josh Black, the author of Diligent's report, told Business Insider. The report identified Applovin, a company that helps iPhone apps monetize users via advertising technology, as an example of a common short. The company's stock is down nearly 40% this year.\n\nThe spike in short-selling campaigns may be a sign of pain to come in 2026. In 2021, one year before a global market plunge brought on in part by concerns over lofty tech valuations, there were 128 campaigns — the most in the last five years until 2025.\n\nOf last year's 166 campaigns, 55 of them were focused on technology companies, by far the most of any sector.\n\nThe slide in software stocks such as Salesforce and Oracle this year has added fuel to short-sellers' questions about the industry's valuations in the age of AI.\n\nNew shortseller BMF Capital, run by Frankie Gerola and based in Arizona, told Diligent that one of the firm's first bets, against defense AI company BigBear.ai, came about in part due to what it viewed as a \"lack of true AI innovation.\" BigBear, which has attracted other short sellers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the short-sellers' critiques.\n\nBMF Capital is also keeping an eye on companies \"that repeatedly change narratives in search of relevance, such as a sports company pivoting into AI dating.\"\n\n\"That kind of identity drift usually precedes capital stress or poor fundamentals,\" BMF Capital said.\n\nLast year, the average short campaign generated returns of 7.2% 30 days after launch, according to Diligent. So far in 2026, the software-stock crash has generated billions for those betting against the stocks, short-seller tracker S3 Partners said.",

    "description": "Investors are drawing their battle lines as AI sorts tech companies into winners and losers.",
    "fullText": "The once relentless rally in AI-fueled stocks has lost momentum, as investors confront the unsettling idea that advances in artificial intelligence could erode the very value propositions that made tech giants dominant in the first place. Yet some executives and market veterans warn against short-term panic, calling the selloff a rare opportunity to buy into the next phase of the AI boom.\n\nThe AI growth story has been tempered by a widespread selloff in software stocks. Call it the software-mageddon or the SaaSpocalypse, but companies who specialize in designing, selling, and maintaining digital software products are getting battered. Earlier this month, JPMorgan analysts wrote that software companies had lost around $2 trillion in value over the past year, calling it “the largest non-recessionary 12-month drawdown in over 30 years.”\n\nThe culprit has been an increasingly widespread feeling among investors that AI is sorting tech players into winners and losers. Under this view, software companies could fall into the latter camp as the capabilities of newer AI models promise to replace expensive digital services, rendering the business models of companies like Salesforce and Atlassian obsolete.\n\nBut not all investors are convinced these companies are destined for irrelevance. Hidden within the chaos could lie an undervalued chance to buy these tech stocks at a discount, a relative rarity in an age of soaring valuations and speculative growth. It all depends on whether bullish buyers consider AI as complementary to existing software services, or capable enough to replace them entirely.\n\n“I think this software selloff will go down as a generational opportunity to own some of the stalwarts,” Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a Yahoo Finance interview Friday. “I feel more emboldened about the bull thesis on tech and AI this year, despite obviously this massive pullback.”\n\nIves named three industry leaders that he sees as being unfairly punished in today’s market, and that could be in for a powerful rebound:\n\nIves called the software stock correction a “structural selloff” that was the largest in scale he’d seen in 25 years. But instead of spelling doom for these companies, he framed the wipeout as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in enterprise technology, arguing that software developers will remain a “core part of the use cases,” even in an AI-powered future.",

    "fullText": "Data analytics firm moves from Denver after about six years and joins host of businesses relocating to south Florida\n\nPalantir announced on Tuesday that it has moved its headquarters to Miami from Denver. The data analytics company, criticized for its role in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, joins a host of other businesses and billionaires that recently moved to Florida in search of a more business-friendly climate.\n\nPalantir’s move across state lines comes after its chair, Peter Thiel, announced on 31 December that he opened a Miami office for his private investment firm. Thiel already has a mansion in Miami Beach. The company, previously headquartered in Palo Alto, announced the move on X but did not provide further details or respond to a request for comment. Palantir’s stay in Colorado lasted about six years; the company exited California in August 2020 – with its CEO, Alex Karp, citing disagreements with the state’s values.\n\nPalantir’s Denver office has frequently been the site of protest, as the company faces heated criticism for its involvement in the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants. Tools and platforms built by Palantir have been used by the federal government in efforts to surveil and detain immigrants. The company has also inked a major contract with the UK’s National Health Service.\n\nColorado’s immigration and tech activists view Palantir’s departure as a result of their sustained organizing. Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee and organizer for AI regulation in Denver, said that a coalition of unions and grassroots organizations, including Denver Anti-War Action, held a few dozen town halls, strikes and protests that mounted pressure on Palantir’s presence in the city. Pinto also said that Palantir may have been dissuaded by Colorado’s state lawmakers taking the lead on AI regulation with proposals to limit surveillance and discrimination.\n\n“Colorado has rejected the values of Palantir – the values of an economy built on exploitation of people’s data, whether it’s for warfare or for immigration enforcement,” Pinto said.\n\nMany of California’s wealthiest billionaires seem to be considering a move to Florida – spooked by the state’s consideration of a billionaire tax. There has also been a concerted effort by the business leaders Ken Griffin and Stephen Ross to convince billionaires to move to south Florida and to bring their businesses with them.\n\nPalantir has tried to distance itself from Trump’s immigration apparatus, but that has not quelled protest. Some of the company’s employees appear to be disturbed, too. Karp recorded a video about Palantir’s involvement with ICE for staff and said they could sign NDAs if they wanted more details, according to Wired.\n\nJames Fishback, a Republican candidate for Florida governor, wrote on X in response to Palantir’s move, saying he would ban Palantir from all government contracts if elected. “You are a threat to our civil liberties,” Fishback wrote. He had voiced the same position last month. Fishback’s commitment comes amid increasing pressure on lawmakers to evaluate their relationship with Palantir. The nationwide campaign Purge Palantir has been documenting politicians who received funds from the company’s executives and pressuring them not to accept their donations. The campaign has had some success so far. The Colorado Sun reported that the Colorado representative Jason Crow and Colorado senator John Hickenlooper planned to donate more than $50,000 each, in campaign contributions from Palantir, to immigrant rights groups.\n\nPalantir blew past Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter of 2025 and reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m. Its stock, however, has sunk 20% since the start of 2026.",

    "fullText": "Prof Michael Wooldridge says scenario such as deadly self-driving car update or AI hack could destroy global interest\n\nThe race to get artificial intelligence to market has raised the risk of a Hindenburg-style disaster that shatters global confidence in the technology, a leading researcher has warned.\n\nMichael Wooldridge, a professor of AI at Oxford University, said the danger arose from the immense commercial pressures that technology firms were under to release new AI tools, with companies desperate to win customers before the products’ capabilities and potential flaws are fully understood.\n\nThe surge in AI chatbots with guardrails that are easily bypassed showed how commercial incentives were prioritised over more cautious development and safety testing, he said.\n\n“It’s the classic technology scenario,” he said. “You’ve got a technology that’s very, very promising, but not as rigorously tested as you would like it to be, and the commercial pressure behind it is unbearable.”\n\nWooldridge, who will deliver the Royal Society’s Michael Faraday prize lecture on Wednesday evening, titled “This is not the AI we were promised”, said a Hindenburg moment was “very plausible” as companies rushed to deploy more advanced AI tools.\n\nThe Hindenburg, a 245-metre airship that made round trips across the Atlantic, was preparing to land in New Jersey in 1937 when it burst into flames, killing 36 crew, passengers and ground staff. The inferno was caused by a spark that ignited the 200,000 cubic metres of hydrogen that kept the airship aloft.\n\n“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Wooldridge said. Because AI is embedded in so many systems, a major incident could strike almost any sector.\n\nThe scenarios Wooldridge imagines include a deadly software update for self-driving cars, an AI-powered hack that grounds global airlines, or a Barings bank-style collapse of a major company, triggered by AI doing something stupid. “These are very, very plausible scenarios,” he said. “There are all sorts of ways AI could very publicly go wrong.”\n\nDespite the concerns, Wooldridge said he did not intend to attack modern AI. His starting point is the gap between what researchers expected and what has emerged. Many experts anticipated AI that computed solutions to problems and provided answers that were sound and complete. “Contemporary AI is neither sound nor complete: it’s very, very approximate,” he said.\n\nThis arises because large language models, which underpin today’s AI chatbots, rattle out answers by predicting the next word, or part of a word, based on probability distributions learned in training. It leads to AIs with jagged capabilities: incredibly effective at some tasks, yet terrible at others.\n\nThe problem, Wooldridge said, was that AI chatbots failed in unpredictable ways and had no idea when they were wrong, but were designed to provide confident answers regardless. When delivered in human-like and sycophantic responses, the answers could easily mislead people, he added. The risk is that people start treating AIs as if they were human. In a 2025 survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology, nearly a third of students reported that they or a friend had had a romantic relationship with an AI.\n\n“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge said. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”\n\nWooldridge sees positives in the kind of AI depicted in the early years of Star Trek. In one 1968 episode, The Day of the Dove, Mr Spock quizzes the Enterprise’s computer only to be told in a distinctly non-human voice that it has insufficient data to answer. “That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he said. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the Star Trek computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”",

    "fullText": "Google, Anthropic and OpenAI bosses to mingle with global south leaders wrestling for control over technology\n\nSilicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.\n\nDuring the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.\n\nAmid a push to speed up AI adoption across the globe, Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, the heads of Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, will all be there. Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.\n\nMeanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioning India as the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.\n\nModi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raised serious concerns about India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”\n\nSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.\n\nIndian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.\n\nIf a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.\n\nIndia’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”\n\nSafety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.\n\n“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”\n\nOne of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”\n\nBut the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.\n\n“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.\n\nCompanies such as Google are focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.\n\n“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”\n\nGoogle’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: ICE more than tripled the amount of data stored in Microsoft’s cloud at the same time that its arsenal of surveillance technology ballooned\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deepened its reliance on Microsoft’s cloud technology last year as the agency ramped up arrest and deportation operations, leaked documents reveal.\n\nICE more than tripled the amount of data it stored in Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform in the six months leading up to January 2026, a period in which the agency’s budget swelled and its workforce rapidly expanded, according to the files.\n\nICE appears to be using a range of Microsoft’s productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyse the data it holds in Azure. Files suggest some of the agency’s own tools and systems may also be running on Microsoft servers.\n\nThe documents – obtained by the Guardian and its partners +972 Magazine and Local Call – raise questions about whether Microsoft technology is facilitating an immigration crackdown by an agency accused of conducting unlawful operations and using excessive force on a large scale.\n\nICE enforcement operations have surged over the past year as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign. The agency is now at the centre of a battle in Congress over its funding, sparked by the deaths of two people in Minneapolis, that has led to a partial shutdown of the US government.\n\nIn July, ICE received a $75bn budget increase, making it the highest-funded US law enforcement body. With this unprecedented increase in funds, the agency has embarked on a spending spree on technology, awarding contracts to large firms such as Palantir alongside lesser-known providers.\n\nICE, which has been likened to a domestic surveillance agency, enjoys access to vast troves of data on people living in the US. It has a growing arsenal of surveillance technology, including facial recognition apps, phone location databases, drones and invasive spyware.\n\nAs the agency expanded through 2025, it boosted spending on cloud computing. Amazon and Microsoft, both longtime providers to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have emerged as beneficiaries of deals worth tens of millions of dollars struck by third-party resellers.\n\nThe leaked documents do not specify the kinds of information stored by ICE on Microsoft servers. However, they indicate the agency has used Azure services including “blob storage” of raw data, as well as AI tools that analyse images and videos, and translate text.\n\nIn January, according to the files, ICE held almost 1,400 terabytes in Azure, which if only comprised of photographs would be equivalent to approximately 490m images. This was up from 400 terabytes in July 2025 after climbing through the second half of last year, files suggest.\n\nICE is also using virtual machines on Azure, according to the documents. These are effectively computers that run in the cloud but that can be accessed remotely. ICE appears to be renting these high-powered computers to run software.\n\nThe agency, which has more than doubled its workforce since January 2025, is also understood to have significantly expanded its access to Microsoft’s suite of productivity apps which provide users with access to document management tools and an AI chatbot.\n\nIt’s unclear from the files whether ICE is using Azure to store or analyse information collected through any of its surveillance or intelligence gathering activities, or whether the cloud platform supports other functions, such as the running of detention centres or deportation flights. ICE did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft said it “provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS and ICE, delivered through our key partners”. They said Microsoft’s policies and terms of service “do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity”.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “There are currently many public issues relating to immigration enforcement, and we believe Congress, the executive branch, and the courts have the opportunity to draw clear legal lines regarding the allowable use of emerging technologies by law enforcement.”\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company later appeared to narrow this position. It acknowledged to employees it had contracts with ICE and DHS, but said it “does not presently maintain AI services contracts tied specifically to enforcement activities”.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in facing disquiet among employees over its business with federal immigration authorities. For large US tech groups, ICE and sister agency Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have long been customers, but have become increasingly controversial for their aggressive tactics and involvement in fatal shootings.\n\nLast week, Amazon workers and activists protested outside the company’s Seattle headquarters, demanding the company cut ties with federal immigration agencies. The company benefits from a series of large cloud deals with DHS to provide cloud infrastructure to ICE and CBP.\n\nAt Google, which provides cloud services to both agencies, more than 1,300 workers have signed a recent petition with a similar set of demands. “DHS is violating civil and national law as well as civil and human rights,” the petition reads. “We must end our complicity in powering them.”\n\nBeyond the headlines: inside stories from the Guardian’s investigations team.

    "title": "I'm an Amazon tech lead who uses AI to write code daily. There's one situation I hesitate to use it in.",
    "description": "Anni Chen says vibe coding is hard to resist. It speeds up her productivity, but she doesn't trust it blindly.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Anni Chen, who has worked at Amazon for about three-and-a-half years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified her employment history.\n\nI'm a tech lead at Amazon responsible for deploying large-scale generative AI and LLM-driven systems. I focus on what we call memory, which powers personalization in generative AI experiences across Amazon.\n\nI vibe code every day. It's definitely a productivity boost.\n\nFor debugging or small tasks, I sometimes treat it like a lottery. Maybe it will produce something amazing. Sometimes, it does.\n\nVibe coding helps me brainstorm what the solution could look like, even if I don't adopt the final solution it proposes. Vibe coding also speeds up the time spent rewriting code when you realize a requirement wasn't covered.\n\nWhen I vibe code, it's always iterative. I give it the basic information it needs, it produces a version, then I check it — similar to a code review with coworkers. I might say, \"You missed this part\" or \"You missed that part.\"\n\nThe AI sometimes fixes issues but introduces something new. You have to keep an eye on it.\n\nFor complex tasks, you need more double-checking. But even with the extra checking, it's still faster.\n\nI was working with a partner team and ran into complex locking issues. Without an LLM, I might have taken a day to research possible solutions, especially since it was relatively new to me.\n\nWithin 15 minutes, I brainstormed with the LLM about possible solutions. I pointed out weaknesses in its suggestions and asked it to improve them. In 15 minutes, I had a proposal to send to the team.\n\nTechnical knowledge helps — you know what's a good solution and what's not. You know what tastes good, but you don't know what dishes are available. The LLM brings up all the dishes, and you choose.\n\nStill, I'm hesitant to use vibe coding directly in production.\n\nLLMs are very good at solving problems, but sometimes they make implicit assumptions you don't realize they're making. If you don't tell it explicitly, for example, that something needs to work for multi-threading, it might just produce the minimum version that works, but when it's large-scale or productionized, it could crash.\n\nNon-technical builders could tell an LLM to build something that handles millions of users. But if you have zero technical knowledge, it's hard to anticipate constraints upfront. If you don't tell the model the implicit assumptions, it won't respect those constraints. Later, you'll run into problems.\n\nNon-technical people might use the LLM to fix issues reactively. But technical people can anticipate constraints proactively and prevent problems in the first place.\n\nTechnical people also understand vibe-coded content better, and they're in a better position to understand what LLMs are good at and not good at. For example, knowing how they're trained and why they're weaker at certain tasks like math. That understanding helps you master them as tools.\n\nWhen you scale to one million or 100 million customers, systems need to be coded differently to handle that scale.\n\nInitially, leadership pushed vibe coding. Our team is a GenAI team, so we were naturally more receptive. In non-GenAI teams, engineers initially reacted like, \"No, I won't let AI do my job. I don't trust AI-generated code.\"\n\nAfter people tried it, attitudes shifted. People realized it's pretty good sometimes. Now it's more widely adopted.\n\nIt's very hard to resist vibe coding nowadays. If you're an employee, leadership sees the productivity boost and will encourage you to use it.\n\nWhen your peers are using it and coding faster, it's hard to resist. If you can't keep up with the speed, it becomes difficult to collaborate.\n\nEven if you resist, you still consume AI passively. AI comments are embedded in code reviews. So even if you don't vibe code directly, you're still interacting with AI outputs.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding? Contact this reporter at cmlee@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "In Europe, there's been a lot of handwringing over why there are very few large, successful tech companies in the region. Peter Steinberger, the creator of the agentic AI hit OpenClaw, has an answer.\n\nSteinberger was recently hired by OpenAI and is moving from Europe to the US. An Austrian by birth, he previously split his time between London and Vienna.\n\nOn X, a professor from a European university asked why Europe couldn't retain this tech talent.\n\nSteinberger replied that most people in the US are enthusiastic, while in Europe, he's scolded about responsibility and regulations.\n\nIf he built a company in Europe, he would struggle with strict labor regulations and similar rules, he added.\n\nAt OpenAI, he said most employees work 6 to 7 days a week and are paid accordingly. In Europe, that would be illegal, he added.\n\nThe most valuable company in Europe is Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML, valued at about $550 billion. In contrast, there are 10 US companies worth more than $1 trillion. Most of these are tech companies.\n\nIn 2024, a landmark EU report found that the region had fallen behind the US, particularly in innovation. It proposed a series of changes to tackle the problem, but by the end of 2025, few of the recommendations had been implemented.\n\nSteinberger said he was hopeful about EU INC, an effort to create a single corporate legal framework to make it simpler to run a business across the region.\n\nBut this seems to be \"fizzling out,\" he wrote on X. \"Watered down, too much egoistic national interest that ultimately hurts everyone.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Why an A.I. Video of Tom Cruise Battling Brad Pitt Spooked Hollywood",
    "description": "A 15-second clip created by an artificial intelligence tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance appears more cinematic than anything so far.",
    "fullText": "It took only a 15-second clip of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt duking it out on a crumbling rooftop at twilight to draw swift outrage, and sizable fear, from Hollywood over the last few days.\n\nThe widely circulated video was created by the Irish director Ruairi Robinson using Seedance 2.0, a powerful artificial intelligence video generation tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance. It had plenty of the bells and whistles of a big-budget Hollywood film: sweeping camera angles, stunt choreography, crisp sound effects and haunting music.\n\nWith a two-sentence prompt and the click of a button, Seedance had produced a stunningly realistic result that was a drastic improvement over previously generated artificial intelligence videos, often shoddy clips known as A.I. slop. This video was so convincing that it drew near immediate condemnation from some of Hollywood’s top organizations and companies.\n\nRhett Reese, a scriptwriter known for his “Deadpool” films, said in an interview that the Cruise-Pitt video had sent a “cold shiver” up his spine.\n\n“For all of us who work in the industry and devoted our careers and lives to it, I just think it’s nothing short of terrifying,” he said. “I could just see it costing jobs all over the place.”\n\nByteDance released Seedance 2.0 last week, nearly two months after a previous version had failed to prompt much anger. A news release from the company praised the updated tool’s “physical accuracy, realism and controllability,” which it said was suitable for the needs of “professional-grade creative scenarios.”\n\n“The creation process,” the release went on, “is more natural and efficient, allowing users to control their creations like a true ‘director.’”\n\nUsers promptly flocked to the platform to spin up their own content. An alternate ending to “Game of Thrones” went viral, as did a video of the notoriously beefing rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake burying the hatchet on “The Tonight Show,” and one of Samara Morgan, the vengeful girl in “The Ring” horror films, emerging from an old television set to pet a cat.\n\nRobinson himself posted additional videos, including of Pitt and Cruise battling a robot, and of Pitt sparring with a sword-wielding “zombie ninja.”\n\nAt the same time, Hollywood was swift to sit up straight. Charles Rivkin, the chairman and chief executive of the Motion Picture Association, called on ByteDance to “immediately cease its infringing activity,” saying in a statement that Seedance 2.0 had engaged in the unauthorized use of copyrighted works on a “massive scale.” Human Artistry Campaign, a global coalition that advocates using A.I. “with respect for the irreplaceable artists, performers and creatives,” said on social media that unauthorized works generated by Seedance 2.0 violated the “most basic aspects of personal autonomy.”\n\nDisney, which in a watershed $1 billion deal last year agreed to allow OpenAI’s Sora users to generate video content with its characters, sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing it of supplying Seedance with a “pirated library” of Disney’s characters — “as if Disney’s coveted intellectual property were free public-domain clip art.”\n\nByteDance, which also owns TikTok and has been valued at $480 billion in the private markets, said in a statement that it respected intellectual property rights and was aware of the concerns about Seedance.\n\n“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” the statement said.\n\nAs last year’s deal between Disney and OpenAI suggests, Hollywood has for years wrestled with how to manage the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence. The concerns outlined by Reese echoed the Writers Guild strike in 2023, when for months thousands of union members demanded that studios institute guardrails protecting them from having their jobs or their intellectual property stolen by A.I. In the end, the group won guarantees that A.I. would not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation.\n\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors and media artists, said its contracts had specific and enforceable rules about digital replication. The kind of material represented by the Cruise-Pitt battle, he said, “could not be produced by any of the signatories to our contracts — the studios, the streamers — without the specific, informed consent of those individuals.”\n\nAccording to Crabtree-Ireland, the real concern is that, even if videos generated by Seedance and other A.I. platforms “are not malicious in intent,” they could “really violate someone’s right to control how their image, their likeness and their voice is used.”\n\nNot everyone is awed by Seedance’s latest technology. Heather Anne Campbell, an executive producer and a writer on the animated series “Rick and Morty,” said her social media accounts last week had been inundated with Seedance-generated clips of anime, sci-fi and unlikely superhero battles. But she is not yet worried, she said, about losing her job to the technology.\n\n“Everybody is, I think, swept up by the circus that came to town and is showing off,” she said. “I haven’t seen anything good yet. Nothing that has taken my breath away, nothing that is poignant, nothing that is provocative even. It’s all just garbage.”\n\nCampbell added that A.I. services like Seedance were at best “averaging machines,” and argued that the greatest art was never made quickly or impersonally.\n\nStill, some people working in Hollywood find it difficult to imagine that studios will not come to see A.I. as a cost-saving shortcut. “It would be cheaper to have A.I. write a screenplay than it would be for me to write a screenplay,” Reese, the “Deadpool” writer, said. “I just know that in the back of my mind, that’s where the terror comes from.”\n\nFor Reese, a long-term answer to the unease that A.I. will reorder Hollywood could not come quickly enough.\n\n“If I could wave my magic wand and make A.I. go away, at least in the creative field,” he said, “I would absolutely wave the wand.”",

    "description": "The United States plans to deploy more high-tech missile systems to the Philippines to help deter aggression in the South China Sea, where the treaty allies on Tuesday condemned what they called China...",
    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States plans to deploy more high-tech missile systems to the Philippines to help deter aggression in the South China Sea, where the treaty allies on Tuesday condemned what they called China’s “illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities.”\n\nBeijing has repeatedly expressed alarm over the installation in the northern Philippines of a U.S. mid-range missile system called the Typhon in 2024 and of an anti-ship missile launcher last year. It said the U.S. weapons were aimed at containing China’s rise and warned that these were a threat to regional stability.\n\nChina has asked the Philippines to withdraw the missile launchers from its territory, but officials led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have rejected the demand.\n\nU.S. and Philippine officials held annual talks Monday in Manila on broadening security, political and economic engagements and boosting collaboration with regional security allies.\n\nThe U.S. and the Philippines outlined in a joint statement Tuesday specific defense and security plans for this year, including joint military exercises, Washington's support to help modernize the Philippine military and efforts “to increase deployments of U.S. cutting-edge missile and unmanned systems to the Philippines.”\n\nThe longtime allies \"underscored their support for preserving freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and other lawful uses of the sea for all nations,” the statement said.\n\n“Both sides condemned China’s illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive activities in the South China Sea, recognizing their adverse effects on regional peace and stability and the economies of the Indo-Pacific and beyond,” it added.\n\nConfrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard forces have spiked in the disputed waters in recent years. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in the territorial standoffs.\n\nNeither side elaborated on the planned missile deployments but Philippine ambassador to Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, who took part in Monday’s talks, said U.S. and Filipino defense officials discussed the possible deployment this year of “upgraded” types of U.S. missile launchers that the Philippines may eventually decide to purchase.\n\n“It’s a kind of system that’s really very sophisticated and will be deployed here in the hope that, down the road, we will be able to get our own,” Romualdez told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Typhon missile system that the U.S. Army deployed to the main northern Philippine region of Luzon in April 2024 and an anti-missile launcher called the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System that was deployed in April last year also to Luzon have remained in the Philippines, Romualdez said.\n\nDuring joint drills, U.S. forces have exhibited the missile systems to batches of Filipino forces to familiarize them with the weapons’ capabilities and usage, military officials said.\n\nRomualdez said the U.S. missile deployments to the Philippines did not aim to antagonize any country.\n\n“It’s purely for deterrence,” he said. “Every time the Chinese show any kind of aggression, it only strengthens our resolve to have these types.”\n\nThe Typhon missile launchers, a land-based weapon, can fire the Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range, from the northern Philippine region of Luzon.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Marines deployed the anti-ship missile launcher, the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System, to Batan island in the northernmost Philippine province of Batanes, which faces the Bashi Channel just south of Taiwan.\n\nThe sea passage is a critical trade and military route that the U.S. and Chinese militaries have tried to gain strategic control of.",

    "fullText": "Industry using ‘diversionary’ tactics, says analyst, as energy-hungry complex functions such as video generation and deep research proliferate\n\nTech companies are conflating traditional artificial intelligence with generative AI when claiming the energy-hungry technology could help avert climate breakdown, according to a report.\n\nMost claims that AI can help avert climate breakdown refer to machine learning and not the energy-hungry chatbots and image generation tools driving the sector’s explosive growth of gas-guzzling datacentres, the analysis of 154 statements found.\n\nThe research, commissioned by nonprofits including Beyond Fossil Fuels and Climate Action Against Disinformation, did not find a single example where popular tools such as Google’s Gemini or Microsoft’s Copilot were leading to a “material, verifiable, and substantial” reduction in planet-heating emissions.\n\nKetan Joshi, an energy analyst and author of the report, said the industry’s tactics were “diversionary” and relied on tried and tested methods that amount to “greenwashing”.\n\nHe likened it to fossil fuel companies advertising their modest investments in solar panels and overstating the potential of carbon capture.\n\n“These technologies only avoid a minuscule fraction of emissions relative to the massive emissions of their core business,” said Joshi. “Big tech took that approach and upgraded and expanded it.”\n\nMost of the claims that were scrutinised came from an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, which was reviewed by leading tech companies, and corporate reports from Google and Microsoft.\n\nThe IEA report – which devoted two chapters to the potential climate benefits of traditional AI – had a roughly even split between claims that rested on academic publications, corporate websites and those that had no evidence, according to the analysis. For Google and Microsoft, most claims lacked evidence.\n\nThe analysis, released during the AI Impact Summit in Delhi this week, argues the tech industry has misleadingly presented climate solutions and carbon pollution as a package deal by “muddling” types of AI.\n\nSasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, an open-source AI platform and community, who was not involved in the report, said it added nuance to a debate that often lumped very different applications together.\n\n“When we talk about AI that’s relatively bad for the planet, it’s mostly generative AI and large language models,” said Luccioni, who has pushed the industry to be more transparent about its carbon footprint.\n\n“When we talk about AI that’s ‘good’ for the planet, it’s often predictive models, extractive models, or old-school AI models.”\n\nGreen claims even for traditional AI tended to rely on weak forms of evidence that had not been independently verified, the analysis found. Only 26% of the green claims that were studied cited published academic research, while 36% did not cite evidence at all.\n\nOne of the earliest examples identified in the report was a widespread claim that AI could help mitigate 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nThe figure, which Google repeated as recently as April last year, came from a report it commissioned from BCG, a consulting firm, which cited a blogpost it wrote in 2021 that attributed the figure to its “experience with clients”.\n\nDatacentres consume just 1% of the world’s electricity but their share of US electricity is projected to more than double to 8.6% by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. The IEA predicts they will account for at least 20% of the rich world’s growth in electricity demand to the end of the decade.\n\nWhile the energy consumption of a simple text query to a large language model such as ChatGPT may be as little as running a lightbulb for a minute, partial industry disclosures suggest, it rises considerably for complex functions such as video generation and deep research, and has troubled some energy researchers with the speed and scale of its growth.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said: “Our estimated emissions reductions are based on a robust substantiation process grounded in the best available science, and we have transparently shared the principles and methodology that guide it.”\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment, while the IEA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJoshi said the discourse around AI’s climate benefits needed to be “brought back to reality”.\n\n“The false coupling of a big problem and a small solution serves as a distraction from the very preventable harms being done through unrestricted datacentre expansion,” he said.",

    "description": "Replacing GBU-57s dropped on Iran highlights issues that come from being locked into a single contractor, which the Pentagon is trying to change.",
    "fullText": "Last year, the U.S. government was able to reverse engineer a critical subcomponent for the 30,000-pound GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bunker buster bomb. Leveraging technology from the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missile saved years of work that would have otherwise been necessary to “eliminate obsolescence issues and meet operational demands.” The reverse-engineering effort also highlights the impacts of being locked into a single vendor, and underscores why the Pentagon is now pushing to make changes to, if not end this practice.\n\nDetails about the reverse-engineered component and other aspects of the MOP program were contained in a recent U.S. Air Force contracting announcement regarding efforts to replenish stocks of those bombs following Operation Midnight Hammer. During that operation, B-2 Spirit stealth bombers dropped 14 GBU-57/Bs on Iranian nuclear facilities. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) had to produce a detailed justification for awarding a sole-source contract to Boeing for the production of new MOPs and the sustainment of the existing inventory. Boeing is the bomb’s current prime contractor. A redacted copy of that document is available online.\n\n“The Government has a follow-on need for additional production of [redacted] MOP Tail Kits with projected delivery starting 10 January 2028 to replace expended units and reach the United States Air Force’s [redacted],” the so-called Justification & Approval (J&A) document explains. “The Government has a need for replenishment production of GBU-57 MOP weapon system components.”\n\nIt is unclear what the total size of the GBU-57/B inventory was before or after Operation Midnight Hammer. As of 2015, prime contractor Boeing had delivered at least 20 of the bombs, according to the Air Force. However, additional orders have been reported over the years. In 2024, a story from Bloomberg had also said that a facility in Oklahoma was being expanded to help triple or even quadruple the annual output of these bombs.\n\nThe MOP’s tail kit, also designated KMU-612/B, contains the bomb’s GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guidance package and other systems. It is combined with a BLU-127/B penetrating “warhead” and other components, including advanced fuzes designed to help produce the maximum destructive effect on a target after burrowing deep down into the ground, to create a complete GBU-57/B bomb, or all-up-round (AUR).\n\n“In August of 2025, the Government successfully reverse engineered a critical subcomponent of the MOP weapon system saving 4-years of design work and enabling the utilization of existing Army ATACMS technology to eliminate obsolescence issues and meet operational demands,” according to the J&A document. “However, the time to reverse engineer all MOP components would result in unacceptable delays in meeting mission requirements.”\n\nThe MOP J&A does not elaborate on the ATACMS technology in question, or what company or companies may now be in line to produce the resulting subcomponent for the bombs. Lockheed Martin is the current prime contractor for ATACMS, a family of short-range ballistic missiles that you can read more about here. It should also be noted that the U.S. military’s reverse-engineering parts of key weapon systems is not entirely uncommon, especially if the original source of the components in question has gone out of business or otherwise no longer exists.\n\nThe J&A document says it would take an estimated 60 months, or five years, to create an entirely new MOP tail kit design and then go through the required processes to certify it for operational use. It also explains why the KMU-612/B tail kit, specifically, is so central to the need to award a new sole-source contract to Boeing.\n\n“With regards to IP [intellectual property] rights, The [Redacted] Company is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MOP weapon system and retains ownership of the intellectual property data associated with the munition’s tail kit,” it explains. “In particular, [redacted] owns the technical data package and manufacturing process methodologies of the tailkit unit entirely. [Redacted] has uniquely acquired expertise over a period of ~18 years of adapting this specialized weapon to meet evolving mission needs as MOP transitioned from proof-of-concept to full operational capability. This expertise pertains, but is not limited to, knowledge of the guidance algorithms, navigation systems, hardware components, specialized test equipment, and software critical to producing and sustaining the MOP weapon system.”\n\n“The other components and sub-components, as noted above, have been proprietary to [redacted] from the inception of this weapon system. The USG [U.S. government] does not own or control, via license or by other IP rights, any computer software, methodologies, or technical drawings,” the document adds. “[Redacted] was queried in August 2025 as to the potential of selling IP rights to the USG for the MOP weapon system and the USG was denied.”\n\nThat being said, “over the course of the ~18 years of MOP development to the AURs acquired today the USG has, at certain junctures, been able to separate from the sole-source environment for this weapon with Boeing,” the J&A notes. “The USG was able to break away the Warhead Cases for the MOP under a weapon design agent effort, thereby giving the USG complete IP control over the Warhead TDP. Based on the IP ownership of this TDP the USG awards contracts competitively.”\n\nThe prospect now of new U.S. strikes against targets in Iran, including deeply buried nuclear sites and other facilities, highlights the continued importance of the depth and readiness of the GBU-57/B inventory. There is clear evidence that Iranian authorities have taken new steps to try to shield key elements of the country’s nuclear program from future attacks, either from the air or on the ground. MOP has been and continues to be the only conventional munition capable of prosecuting many of these targets, and was specifically designed from the outset with sites in Iran top of mind. A conflict with Iran is not the only scenario where the bombs would be relevant. North Korea and China, among others, have also invested heavily in underground and other hardened facilities.\n\nThe huge bunker busters are otherwise the definition of high-value, low-density munitions. At present, they can only be employed operationally by B-2 bombers. Each B-2 can also only carry two of the bombs at once. MOP is expected to be an important part of the arsenal of the future B-21 Raider, which is smaller than the B-2 and is expected to be able to carry a single one of these bunker busters.\n\nThe details in the MOP J&A document also underscore broader issues surrounding IP rights and ‘vendor lock’ in the U.S. defense contracting space that have increasingly been coming to the forefront in recent years. Competition inherently creates opportunities to lower costs and diversify supply chains. A broader supplier base also offers benefits when it comes to scaling up production of key subcomponents and complete systems.\n\nThe continued extent of Lockheed Martin’s control over the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is perhaps the most widely known example of the negative impacts of vendor lock. U.S. officials have been outspoken about the maintenance and sustenance challenges this has created, especially when it comes to the timely sourcing of spare parts, and the operational risks this creates. TWZ previously explored the particular issues surrounding the F-35 in an in-depth feature.\n\nForeign F-35 operators, especially in Europe, are now also facing regular questions about what could happen to the jets if the U.S. were to cut off access to various sustainment pipelines in light of new diplomatic strains with Washington. Just this past weekend, Dutch State Secretary for Defense Gijs Tuinman caused a stir when he asserted it would be possible to “jailbreak an F-35 just like an iPhone” if necessary, as you can read more about here.\n\nBIG: Dutch Defence Minister Gijs Tuinman hints that software independence is possible for F-35 jets. \n\nHe literally said you can “jailbreak” an F-35. \n\nWhen asked if Europe can modify it without US approval: \n\n“That’s not the point… we’ll see whether the Americans will show… pic.twitter.com/f11cGvtYsO\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) February 15, 2026\n\nIn recent years, successive U.S. administrations have made securing greater IP rights and ensuring opportunities for competition key elements in negotiating new defense contractors. As an example, the Air Force previously made clear that avoiding the F-35 program’s vendor lock was a top priority for the acquisition of the F-47 sixth-generation stealth fighter. President Donald Trump’s administration is now pursuing a host of new contracting reforms, in part to further break up the locks that private companies have on programs like the Joint Strike Fighter.\n\n“We will enable third-party integration without prime contractor bottlenecks. Success will be measured by the ability of qualified vendors to independently develop, test and integrate replaceable — excuse me, replacement modules at the component level throughout the system life cycle,” War Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a speech last November. “There’s no more complacency and no more monopolies.”\n\nAt that time, Hegseth had also acknowledged Byzantine processes and other contracting hurdles that the U.S. military had created for itself over the years.\n\nHow “the sole-source environment” surrounding the GBU-57/B continues to evolve now remains to be seen. A successor to that bomb, called the Next Generation Penetrator (NGP), is also now in development, and Boeing is involved in that effort, too. The Pentagon’s experiences with MOP, together with the new contracting reform push, are likely to inform how the replacement weapons are acquired.\n\nIn the meantime, U.S. authorities continue to try to free elements of the MOP program from vendor lock, including now by repurposing technology originally designed for the ATACMS short-range ballistic missile.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "description": "A hierarchy of simplicity for every layer of the stack. Flask over Django, HTML over React, bare server over Kubernetes, small models over the latest GPT. And when each one actually earns its complexity.",
    "fullText": "2026-02-14 · engineering, architecture, opinion, simplicity, ai\n\nThere's a mass delusion in software engineering that more tools equals more capability. That if Netflix uses Kubernetes, you should too. That if Facebook built React, your three-page marketing site needs it. That the \"modern stack\" is modern for a reason, and choosing anything simpler means you're behind.\n\nIt's nonsense. Most of the time, the simplest tool that solves your problem is the right tool. Not the most popular one. Not the one with the best conference talks. The one with the fewest moving parts.\n\nHere's how I think about technology choices, layer by layer.\n\nIf you're building an API, start with FastAPI or Flask. One file. A few routes. You can read the entire application in ten minutes. There's no ORM you didn't ask for, no admin panel you'll never use, no middleware stack you need to understand before you can return JSON.\n\nDjango is a different tool for a different problem. It's an application framework, not a microframework. It makes decisions for you: how your database models work, how authentication works, how your admin interface looks. If you're building a product with user accounts, permissions, a database-backed admin panel, and you have a team of five or more, Django saves you months. It's opinionated in ways that keep large teams from making inconsistent choices.\n\nThe mistake is reaching for Django when you need three endpoints and a database query. You'll spend more time learning what Django wants than building what you want.\n\nSpring is the same idea taken further. Enterprise teams, compliance requirements, complex service meshes. If you're at a bank with 200 engineers and a mandate to use Java, Spring is genuinely good at what it does. If you're two people building a SaaS, it'll bury you.\n\nThe rule: Pick the framework whose complexity matches your problem's complexity. If you can describe your backend in one sentence, you probably need a one-file framework.\n\nThis is where the industry has lost its mind the most.\n\nPlain HTML with some CSS works for an astonishing number of things. This site you're reading is static HTML. No JavaScript framework. No build step. No node_modules folder with 800 packages. I write Markdown, a Python script generates HTML, and Nginx serves it. It loads in under a second on any connection.\n\nWhen you need interactivity, HTMX is a revelation. It lets you add dynamic behavior by writing HTML attributes instead of JavaScript. Need a button that loads content without a page refresh? One attribute. Need a form that submits asynchronously? One attribute. You keep writing HTML and your server keeps rendering HTML. No JSON APIs, no client-side state management, no hydration bugs.\n\nSvelte sits in a similar sweet spot. It compiles to vanilla JavaScript. No virtual DOM. No runtime library. The output is small and fast. If you need more interactivity than HTMX gives you but don't want the overhead of a full SPA framework, Svelte is excellent.\n\nReact makes sense when you're building a genuinely complex, stateful application. Think Figma. Think Google Docs. Think Notion. Applications where the UI has hundreds of independent state changes, where components need to communicate across deep trees, where you need a component ecosystem because you're building something too large for one team to own entirely.\n\nThe problem is that people use React for everything. Landing pages. Blogs. Documentation sites. Marketing pages. I've seen teams spend three sprints setting up Next.js for a site that could have been twenty HTML files. The framework overhead, the build pipeline, the SSR complexity, the hydration issues. All of it unnecessary. All of it actively making the product worse by making it slower and harder to maintain.\n\nI run this site on a Raspberry Pi behind Nginx. The deploy script is 40 lines of bash. rsync copies files, Nginx serves them. If the Pi dies, I buy a new one for $50 and rsync again. Total infrastructure cost: about 5 watts of electricity. Twelve months in, it's still running.\n\nFor most small projects and early-stage products, a single server with systemd services is all you need. You SSH in. You know what's running. You can read the logs. When something breaks, you fix it directly. There's one machine, one set of logs, one reality to debug.\n\nDocker containers make sense when you need reproducible environments. When your app has dependencies that conflict with other things on the same machine. When you need to hand off a project and say \"run docker compose up and it works.\" When you're deploying the same service across staging and production and need them to be identical. Containers solve real problems.\n\nBut Docker adds a layer. Now you're debugging things inside a container that works differently than your local machine. Now your logs are in a different place. Now you need to understand volumes, networks, build caches. Every layer you add is a layer you need to understand when things go wrong.\n\nKubernetes makes sense at scale. When you have dozens of services, when you need automated scaling, when you need rolling deployments with zero downtime across multiple regions. When you have a platform team whose full-time job is managing infrastructure. Google built Kubernetes because Google has Google-sized problems.\n\nIf you're three engineers running a SaaS with a few thousand users, Kubernetes is not solving your problem. It's replacing your problem with a harder problem. You'll spend more time writing YAML manifests and debugging pod scheduling than building your product.\n\nI've watched startups with five engineers spend months setting up Kubernetes clusters. The CTO wanted it on the resume. The engineers wanted to learn it. The product needed a VPS and a Postgres database. They could have shipped in a week and scaled later. Instead they built infrastructure for a million users while they had twelve.\n\nSQLite is the most underrated database in existence. It's a single file. No server process. No connection management. No port configuration. It handles more concurrent reads than most apps will ever need. If your data fits on one machine and you don't need concurrent writes from multiple processes, SQLite is fast, reliable, and effectively zero maintenance.\n\nPostgres is the right choice for most production applications. It's battle-tested, well-documented, and handles basically everything. JSON columns, full-text search, geospatial queries, pub/sub. Before you reach for Redis, Elasticsearch, or any other specialized database, check if Postgres can already do what you need. It usually can.\n\nDistributed databases (CockroachDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) solve problems that 99% of applications don't have. If you need writes across multiple regions with single-digit millisecond latency, sure. If you need to handle millions of writes per second, sure. If you're building a CRUD app with a few thousand users, a single Postgres instance on a $20/month VPS will serve you for years.\n\nThis is the one closest to home because I build tools around this exact principle at NehmeAI Labs.\n\nThe default instinct right now is to throw the biggest frontier model at every problem. Summarization? Frontier model. Classification? Frontier model. Extracting a date from an email? Frontier model. It's the Kubernetes of AI: massively capable, massively overkill for most tasks.\n\nA 4B parameter model trained on a specific task will outperform a 400B general model on that task. Not sometimes. Reliably. FlashCheck is a 4B model that detects hallucinations in RAG pipelines. It scores 91.7% on RAGTruth. It beats Llama 405B on this specific task while using 100x less compute. Not because small models are magic, but because a focused model doesn't waste capacity on things it doesn't need to know.\n\nThe same logic applies to inference costs. Most teams routing everything through their most expensive model are sending simple prompts to a frontier model because they never measured whether a cheaper one could handle it. RightSize exists to answer exactly that question: it evaluates your real prompt traffic and finds where smaller, cheaper models are sufficient. Typical savings are 50-100x. Not because the quality drops. Because most prompts don't need the most powerful model available.\n\nThis maps directly to the philosophy of this entire post. Your inference costs are a design choice, not a fact of life. You don't start with the biggest model and optimize later. You start with the smallest model that works and scale up only where the task demands it.\n\nThe pattern is always the same. Start simple. Measure. Add complexity only where the data tells you to.\n\nI'm not arguing that simple is always right. I'm arguing that it's the right default. You should start simple and add complexity when you feel the pain, not before.\n\nHere's when you genuinely need the heavier tools:\n\nLarge teams. Django's opinions prevent 50 engineers from making 50 different architectural choices. React's component model lets teams work on the same frontend without stepping on each other. Kubernetes lets a platform team provide self-service infrastructure to dozens of product teams. The overhead pays for itself through coordination.\n\nCompliance and enterprise. Banks, healthcare, government. When you need audit trails, role-based access at every layer, and the ability to prove exactly what ran in production six months ago. Spring Boot's security stack and Kubernetes' declarative infrastructure make compliance audits possible at scale.\n\nGenuine scale. When your SQLite file would be terabytes. When your single server can't handle the traffic. When you actually have the users and the load that demand distributed systems. The key word is \"actually.\" Not \"projected.\" Not \"hoped for.\" Actually. And when you do migrate, be honest that it's a rewrite, not a simple upgrade.\n\nComplex client-side applications. If your users spend hours in your app doing complex, stateful work (design tools, collaborative editors, data dashboards), React or similar frameworks earn their complexity budget.\n\nEvery tool you add is a tool you need to:\n\nA three-person startup using Kubernetes, React, GraphQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Terraform has the operational complexity of a 50-person engineering org without the people to manage it. They'll spend 70% of their time on infrastructure and 30% on the product. That ratio should be inverted.\n\nThe best engineers I know aren't the ones who use the most tools. They're the ones who use the fewest tools that solve the problem. They resist the urge to optimize for problems they don't have. They ship with boring technology and save the interesting technology for when it's actually needed.\n\nSimple isn't a limitation. It's a discipline. And the debugging is a lot easier when there are fewer layers to dig through.",

    "title": "NatWest hails progress after £1.2B spent on tech last year, but true AI",
    "description": "Bank described the last 12 months of its tech transformation as ‘the year of [AI] deployment at scale.’",
    "fullText": "NatWest bank invested £1.2bn into its information technology transformation in 2025 and saw huge productivity gains as a result, but this year will see artificial intelligence (AI) become truly transformative for customers and staff.\n\nThe bank said it has already freed up £100m in funds as a result of simplification and the use of the cloud. AI is at the centre of the bank’s plans, with 2025 seeing the technology deployed across the company “at scale”.\n\nHeadline figures for 2025 saw the bank’s software engineers generate 35% of its code through AI software development tools, all 60,000 staff given access to AI productivity software, and thousands of human hours saved. Last year, the bank also embarked on a major collaboration with AI supplier OpenAI.\n\nOther tech achievements in 2025 included the hiring of 1,000 software developers, 100 new features developed on its retail banking app, the appointment of its first chief AI research officer and the establishment of its AI research office.\n\nIn a blog post, NatWest Group CIO Scott Marcar said this year will see the bank take advantage of the AI “building blocks” deployed last year.\n\n“The only certainty is that how customers bank will look very different in the future,” he said. “That’s why being closer to them, with insight and trust, matters more than ever. As technology reshapes how people live, work and bank, we’ve put in place the building blocks to understand, respond to and serve customers’ fast evolving needs,” wrote Marcar.\n\n“Last year brought AI deployment at scale across NatWest, and as we move into 2026, the transformative benefits are becoming more of a reality for our customers and colleagues – delivering growth, greater productivity, and, most importantly, deepening relationships – so that we can be a trusted partner for tomorrow’s banking,” he added.\n\nFrom a staff perspective, all staff now have access to AI tools including Microsoft Copilot Chat and the bank’s internal large language model (LLM), with more than half reported to have taken additional training.\n\nAccording to the bank, more than 70,000 hours were saved through automated AI call summaries in its retail business, while relationship managers in its wealth business were able to spend 30% more time on customer conversations by using AI. According to NatWest, through agentic and voice AI, customers will receive “more intuitive, personalised and seamless interactions” this year.\n\nIn the next few months, 25,000 NatWest customers will have access to its agentic financial assistant within Cora, its customer-facing agentic AI assistant. “Underpinned by OpenAI models, customers will be able to ask natural language questions about their recent spending, in their own words, on their app,” said the bank.\n\nThe bank will then experiment with voice-to-voice AI capability, which aims to provide “human-like empathy, tone and inflection”.\n\nAs part of its wider multi-year digital transformation, NatWest has added around 6,000 tech staff since 2021. In 2025 alone, it recruited 1,000 software engineers through its India Hub in Bengaluru. Its chief AI researcher, Maja Pantic, is working with AI in areas such as audiovisual conversational AI, multi-biometrics and proprietary small language models.\n\nMarcar wrote: “We can’t underestimate the scale of the work we have done to date to rebuild our technology foundations to make us faster, safer and more resilient. A scalable, modular tech stack now underpins how we deliver new products and services, how we integrate with partners, and how we provide the protection and operational resilience customers expect.”\n\nHe said the bank has been moving away from legacy systems in an “inside-out” transformation. It has also created a single, connected view of each customer. “We can anticipate needs faster, remove friction from everyday banking and make onboarding more seamless,” he wrote on his blog post.\n\nMarcar stressed that the proliferation of AI will support human workers, adding: “It’s a future where the expertise of our colleagues is augmented by the intelligence and ease of modern technology.”",

    "description": "An updated Air Force dress code policy strictly prohibits a popular wearable device for troops. Here is why officials say the tech is a security risk.",
    "fullText": "The United States military is among the largest and most technologically sophisticated in the world. Needless to say, it has access to some extraordinary equipment, with the U.S. Air Force operating some of the fastest fighter jets in service today. These are aircraft that most civilians will never ever come close to flying, but by the same token, there is some civilian technology that Air Force personnel are not permitted to use while in uniform.\n\nSmart glasses are becoming increasingly popular, with International Data Corporation noting in July 2025 that the second-generation Meta Ray-Ban glasses captured nearly two-thirds of the market after a successful end to 2024. The broader concept of smart glasses, however, touches on significant fears about privacy and security, meaning that there's a smart reason not to wear models such as Meta's AI glasses. It's also for this reason that the Air Force has prohibited the wearing of such devices. On January 9, 2026, the Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs issued new guidance targeting \"dress and personal appearance.\" The policy noted that, with regard to traditional eyewear, specific shades of frames and lenses for sunglasses and eyeglasses must be adhered to, while \"It is unauthorized to wear mirrored lenses or smart glasses with photo, video or artificial intelligence capabilities while in uniform.\"\n\nElsewhere in this memo, the iconic duty-identifier patches were brought back, powerful symbols of pride in a shared role and expertise. This same collective spirit, however, means that any Air Force member could endanger their fellow members through the use of smart glasses, which is why they were banned.\n\nIf there's one term that's pivotal to U.S. Air Force operations, it's OPSEC: Operations security. There's a wealth of information, from troop movements to the specs of particular vehicles or weapons, that could be potentially disastrous if it leaked. When smart glasses are in the picture, such a leak could occur accidentally, or even without the responsible parties knowing it happened.\n\nThis is the argument put forward by Dana Thayer, the Information Protection Chief of the 104th Fighter Wing, in a statement shared by dvids in response to this prohibition of the devices. Thayer warns that such devices can and will continue to record even when the wearer hasn't specifically set them to do so, which Thayer equates to receiving a plethora of pop-up ads about a specific product that you haven't expressly searched for online but only discussed. Imagine the conversation is about a top-secret new military operation rather than a fast-food craving, and the potential gravity of wearing smart glasses in uniform becomes obvious.\n\nAs is the case essentially anywhere AI and similar technologies are in use, there are significant advantages to be gained. Smart glasses may even serve as a viable alternative to computer monitors, for instance, increasing versatility in work environments. It's vital to be aware of the dangers too. The U.S. Army and Navy have not yet instituted such a blanket measure as an outright ban on in-uniform use of smart glasses, but perhaps they will. It's an evolving technology and an evolving situation, and the devices may find a place where their utility can be deployed, even in the most sensitive situations.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "Tech billionaire Mark Cuban anticipated a huge jobs boom for young people to implement AI at companies. AI gurus say he's right.",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban expects legions of workers will be needed to implement AI at companies, creating a huge opportunity for tech-savvy young people.\n\nThe tech billionaire and former \"Shark Tank\" investor made the prediction during an August interview with TBPN, a tech talk show and podcast.\n\nAI guru Rohan Paul shared a clip of Cuban's comments over the weekend, which was widely reposted; Cuban himself shared three responses from other AI gurus on his X feed.\n\nOne declared it the \"MOST underrated clip on the internet right now.\" Another drew a parallel to Salesforce and the millions of administrative and integration roles it spawned. A third heralded a shift from generic software to customized intelligence.\n\nCuban is calling the IT services boom of the 2000s, but for intelligence instead of infrastructure. Every wave of business technology from PCs to cloud to mobile spawned a massive local services layer. The AI wave needs the same thing, and 33 million companies are waiting. \n\nThe… https://t.co/sgBXH1VJLd\n\nCuban told TBPN that when he was 24, he would walk into companies and executives would point to their secretaries and receptionists and say they didn't need a PC. Cuban recognized that as an opportunity to sell old-school bosses on the benefits of computers and teach them how to use them.\n\nHe said it's a similar situation with the latest tech wave, which some believe will render millions of human workers obsolete and trigger mass unemployment.\n\nCuban said he advises high-school and college students to not just \"learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies.\"\n\nCuban, a minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said that tens of millions of US companies don't have AI budgets or AI experts.\n\n\"This is where kids getting hired coming out of college are really going to have a unique opportunity,\" he said. They should spend their free time learning how to use different AI tools, make AI videos, and customize AI models so they can teach business leaders in any industry how to harness the tech, he added.\n\n\"That is every single job that's going to be available for kids coming out of school because every single company needs that,\" Cuban said. \"There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI and that's what people don't understand.\"\n\nCuban emphasized the opportunity isn't limited to software engineers. Many older workers are \"afraid\" to ask complex questions to AI models, he said, unlike \"kids coming out of school today that are fearless in the questions they ask and the followups and their ability to prompt.\"\n\n\"That's jobs for everybody,\" he added.",

Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.\n\nD-Wave Quantum (NYSE:QBTS) agreed to acquire Quantum Circuit Inc., expanding its quantum computing technology stack.\n\nThe company signed a $10 million Quantum Computing as a Service contract with a Fortune 100 enterprise customer.\n\nD-Wave also announced a $20 million quantum system installation at Florida Atlantic University, supporting commercial scale deployments.\n\nD-Wave Quantum, trading at $19.67, is shifting its center of gravity toward commercial use cases as it layers large contracts on top of its research heritage. The stock has seen very large gains over the past 3 years and 1 year, with a return of 1,991.0% over 3 years and 208.8% over 1 year, even as returns over the past month and year to date show declines of 31.8% and 30.1%. For investors, that mix of strong multi year performance and recent pullback frames today’s news against a backdrop of both enthusiasm and volatility.\n\nThe move into multi million enterprise agreements and the acquisition of Quantum Circuit Inc. suggest D-Wave is aiming to build a broader commercial platform around its quantum services.

The Quantum Circuit Inc. acquisition adds gate-model quantum technology to its established quantum-annealing platform, which could broaden the types of problems D-Wave can tackle, especially for AI and machine-learning workloads. The $10 million, two-year Quantum Computing as a Service agreement with a Fortune 100 customer and the $20 million system installation at Florida Atlantic University give the company multi-year, contract-backed visibility rather than just one-off pilot projects. For you as an investor, the key question is whether these deals become templates that can be reused with other large enterprises and institutions, or remain isolated wins. Competition from players like IonQ, Rigetti, and large tech groups such as IBM or Alphabet means execution quality, speed of product integration after the Quantum Circuit deal, and customer satisfaction on these deployments could be important differentiators.",

    "description": "\"Nobody truly knows who the long-term winners and losers of this extraordinary technology will be,\" Deutsche's Jim Reid wrote this morning.",
    "fullText": "Investors wobbled last week as they worked through the disruption AI is likely to cause across global industries, with further hiccups potentially bubbling through this week. But the reckoning should have been expected, argued Deutsche Bank in a note to clients this morning, because it is a readjustment of perhaps overly optimistic expectations.\n\nSoftware stocks in particular suffered a wipeout amid mounting concerns that large language models may replace current service offerings. Companies in the legal, IT, consulting and logistics sectors were also impacted. JP Morgan wrote last week that some $2 trillion had been wiped off software market caps alone as a result, a reality that prior to a fortnight ago, Deutsche’s Jim Reid argued had been purely academic. \n\nA 13-figure sell-off is something Reid has speculated over for some time, telling clients: “For months, my published view has been that nobody truly knows who the long term winners and losers of this extraordinary technology will be. Yet as recently as October, markets were implicitly pricing in a world where almost every tech company would come out a winner.\n\nWhy did software stocks suffer major selloffs recently?\n\nWhat caused the $2 trillion market cap wipeout?\n\nWhat makes AI disruption different from past cycles?\n\nHow are experts viewing current AI stock valuations?\n\n“Over recent weeks we’ve seen a more realistic differentiation emerge within tech—but that repricing is now rippling into the broader economy with surprising speed.”\n\nReid hasn’t been alone in his suspicion that investors had perhaps been painting over the entire stock market (and indeed wider economy) with the same, optimistic brush. Some speculators have made broad-stroke arguments that the efficiencies offered by AI will result in wins for the vast majority of companies, while others have argued that while AI is not in a bubble, there are pockets of overoptimism that may burst. \n\nJPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon is of such an opinion, explaining at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit last year: “You should be using it,” (speaking to any business that was listening). But he added a caveat, saying that back in 1996, “the internet was real,” and “you could look at the whole thing like it was a bubble.” Then he broke down the real difference that he sees—between AI, on the one hand, and generative AI, on the other. It’s an important distinction, Dimon said, while adding that “some asset prices are high, in some form of bubble territory.”\n\nIndeed, Jeremy Siegel, Emeritus Professor of Finance at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, argued that such shifts demonstrate investors are “asking the right questions.” Writing for WisdomTree a week ago, where he serves as senior economist, Siegel said: “When companies talk about $200 billion in capital expenditures, markets should scrutinize payback periods, competitive dynamics, and whether durable moats can be built in an environment where technology is evolving at breakneck speed. That tension explains why leadership will continue to rotate even as the secular story remains intact.” \n\nThat said, Reid suggested that the market may be repricing overzealously, arguing the disruption in “old economy” sectors feels overdone: “The real challenge is that even by the end of this year, we still won’t have enough evidence to identify the structural winners and losers with confidence. That leaves plenty of room for investors’ imaginations—both optimistic and pessimistic—to run wild. As such big sentiment swings will continue to be the order of the day.”",

    "fullText": "The White House is signaling it may force Big Tech to foot the full bill for America's AI boom.\n\nCompanies building data centers \"need to pay for all of the costs,\" and taxpayers should not shoulder the impact of the AI boom.\n\nThe White House has to \"make sure the American people are not hurt,\" he added.\n\nNavarro's comments come as the AI data-center boom faces mounting scrutiny over rising utility bills.\n\nTech giants are pouring hundreds of billions into infrastructure to power artificial intelligence. In November, Meta pledged $600 billion to expand AI technology, infrastructure, and its workforce. Apple said in August it would boost its US infrastructure plans by adding another $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion.\n\nAt the same time, energy costs are rising. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate hikes from regulators last year, more than twice the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many power providers have cited surging electricity demand from large-scale data centers as a key reason for seeking higher rates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that households should absorb those increases.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote last month in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nNavarro also said on Fox News that the US must keep expanding its data center capacity if it wants to remain \"No.1 on the global stage in terms of AI.\"\n\n\"We have to lead China and others on this,\" Navarro said. \"At the same time, we have to be mindful of the impacts across this nation.\"\n\nThe US must stay ahead \"not just for economic reasons but for national security reasons,\" because AI \"will be one of the most dangerous weapons of war,\" he added.\n\nSome AI companies have moved to reassure policymakers that households won't bear the cost of the industry's rapid expansion.\n\nAnthropic said on Thursday that it will cover 100% of the grid upgrade costs associated with its AI data centers.\n\n\"The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,\" Anthropic said. \"But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.\"\n\nThe pledge follows the company's November announcement that it plans to invest $50 billion in AI infrastructure, starting with facilities in Texas and New York.\n\nMicrosoft has taken a similar approach. Last month, the company said it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the electricity costs tied to its data centers and minimize the burden of data center expansion on surrounding communities.",

    "fullText": "Delivery service Instacart is moving further into new areas, such as advertising and retail tech.\n\nThe company's roughly 600,000 gig workers, who shop and deliver groceries and other retail goods, are its most visible face for many people. But Instacart's business is growing in many directions, CEO Chris Rogers said on a November earnings call.\n\n\"We have the leading online grocery marketplace, a best-in-class suite of enterprise technologies for retailers, and a growing advertising ecosystem,\" Rogers said on the call, his first as CEO after assuming the position in August.\n\nInstacart needs people to make good on its growth plans. The company had about 170 open roles on its careers website as of early February.\n\n\"We're hiring selectively, with priority on roles that support our core marketplace, Instacart Enterprise solutions for retailers globally, and our ads and data platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\n\"We regularly review compensation to ensure it's competitive and aligned with market benchmarks, location, and role,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThat hiring can include some employees from outside the US on H-1B work visas.\n\nBusiness Insider analyzed 157 H-1B visa applications submitted by Instacart and certified by the Department of Labor in the year ending September 30, 2025. These applications provide insight into how much employees in certain roles make. Many of the salaries were for tech roles, including data science, engineering, and product management positions.\n\nThe Trump administration has initiated changes to the H-1B visa system. In September, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new applications. He's also proposed changes to work visa rules that could tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider. However, these changes were largely initiated after this reporting period.\n\nHere's a look at some of the jobs for which Instacart has disclosed salaries in the work visa data.\n\nData Scientist: $125,000 to $210,000\n\nDirector of Engineering, Machine Learning: $320,000 to $380,000\n\nEngineering Manager, Software: $220,000 to $290,000\n\nManager, Machine Learning Engineering: $260,000 to $280,000\n\nPrincipal Software Engineer: $350,000 to $380,000\n\nSenior Computer Vision/AI Engineer: $180,000 to $290,000\n\nSenior Data Scientist: $170,000 to $265,000\n\nSenior Engagement Manager: $235,000 to $285,000\n\nSenior Engineering Manager: $275,000 to $305,000\n\nSenior Engineering Manager, Software: $275,000 to $305,000\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $185,000 to $300,000\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $190,000 to $298,000\n\nSenior Product Manager: $185,000 to $280,000\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $176,000 to $285,000\n\nSoftware Engineer: $165,000 to $215,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $250,000 to $310,000\n\nHave a tip?

As of Feb. 13, Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) was down 9.79% year to date, while the S&P 500 lost 0.14%, as pressure mounted on growth-focused tech stocks.\n\nWood gained a reputation after her Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. Last year, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF gained 35.49%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 17.88% in the same period.\n\nBut Wood's style also brings painful losses in bearish markets, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\n\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term gains. As of Feb. 13, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -14.67%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 13.33% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar.\n\nWood focuses on high-tech companies across artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics. She thinks these businesses have great growth potential, though their volatility often causes fluctuations in the Ark’s funds.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking. The analyst hasn’t updated the 2025 ranking.\n\nIn a letter published on Jan. 15, Wood says the U.S. economy is storing up energy for a sharp rebound in 2026.\n\n\"Despite sustained real gross domestic product growth during the past three years, the underlying US economy has suffered a rolling recession and has evolved into a coiled spring that could bounce back powerfully during the next few years,\" Wood wrote.\n\nWood also rejects the “AI bubble” talk, saying it \"is years away\" and \"the most powerful capital spending cycle in history\" is coming.\n\n\"What once was the cap in spending seems to have become a floor now that the AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and multiomics sequencing platforms are ready for prime time,\" she said.\n\nNot all investors agree with Wood’s optimism. In the 12 months through Feb. 11, the Ark Innovation ETF saw roughly $1.4 billion in net outflows, according to ETF research firm VettaFi.",

    "description": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah, Feb 15 - The U.S.",
    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah, Feb 15 - The U.S. Departments of Energy and Defense on Sunday for the first time transported a small nuclear reactor on a cargo plane from California to Utah to ‌demonstrate the potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe agencies partnered with California-based Valar Atomics to ‌fly one of the company’s Ward microreactors on a C-17 aircraft — without nuclear fuel — to Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Under ​Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Michael Duffey were on the C-17 flight with the reactor and its components, and hailed the event as a breakthrough for U.S. nuclear energy and military logistics.\n\n“This gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration sees small nuclear reactors as one ‌of several ways to expand U.S. energy production. Trump ⁠last May issued four executive orders aimed at boosting domestic nuclear deployment to meet growing demand for energy for national security and competitive AI advancements.\n\nThe Energy Department in December issued two grants to help ⁠accelerate development of small modular reactors.\n\nProponents of microreactors also have touted them as energy sources that can be sent to far-flung and remote places, offering an alternative to diesel generators which require frequent deliveries of fuel. But skeptics have argued that the industry has not proven that small ​nuclear reactors ​can generate power for a reasonable price.\n\n\"There is no business case for ​microreactors, which — even if they work as designed — will ‌produce electricity at a far higher cost than large nuclear reactors, not to mention renewables like wind or solar,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nThe Energy Department plans to have three microreactors reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain itself — by July 4, Wright said.\n\nThe microreactor in Sunday's event, a little larger than a minivan, can generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, according to Valar CEO Isaiah Taylor. It will start operating in July ‌at 100 kilowatts and peak at 250 kilowatts this year before ramping up ​to full capacity, he said.\n\nValar hopes to start selling power on a test ​basis in 2027 and become fully commercial in 2028. ​Although private industry funds its own development of nuclear technology, it also needs the federal government “doing some ‌enabling actions to allow fuel fabrication here and uranium ​enrichment here,” he said.\n\nFuel for Valar's ​reactor will be transported from the Nevada National Security site to the San Rafael facility, Wright told reporters.\n\nHowever, even small generators result in a significant amount of radioactive waste, Lyman said. Other experts have said designers are not compelled to ​consider waste at inception, beyond a plan for ‌how it will be managed.\n\nAlthough disposal of nuclear waste remains an unresolved issue, the Energy Department is in talks ​with a few states, including Utah, to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal, Wright ​said.",

    "description": "Prime minister says outcomes of consultation on social media ban should be implemented quickly as technology minister says Australia-style ban is not inevitable\nIn his Q&A with journalists, Keir Starmer was also asked to respond to a report by the BBC’s James Landale saying he is looking at plans to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP by the end of this parliament. In the past Starmer has just said that he would like to do this at some point in the next parliament.\nIn his reply, Starmer said that at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend he was arguing that the UK, and Europe as a whole, needs to “step up”.\nWe want a just and lasting peace, but that will not extinguish the Russian threat, and we need to be alert to that, because that’s going to affect every single person in this room, every single person in this country, so we need to step up.\nThat means, on defence spending, we need to go faster.",
    "fullText": "At his event this morning Keir Starmer made it clear that the laws on how teens access social media will definitely be tightened. But he said he was “open-minded” about whether this would include a full, Austalian-style ban.\n\nStarmer suggested that one option will be to limit the technology that allows “doomscrolling”. He said:\n\nWe’ve taken the powers to make sure we can act within months, not years.\n\nWe also need to act very quickly, not just of the age concern, but on the devices and applications that make the sort of auto-scrolling, the constant glueing to the machine that you can never stop scrolling.\n\nIn a post on his Substack account, Starmer said out in more details the options that could be implemented as a result of the consultation being carried out. He said:\n\nWe will be going to parliament for new government powers, enabling us to act on the findings of the social media consultation where the evidence suggests we need to. This could include:\n\n-Setting a minimum age limit for social media: unlike the Tories, who took years to pass the Online Safety Act, we will take powers that would allow us to implement a minimum age for social media in a matter of months to prevent kids from accessing harmful social media.\n\n-Restricting specific functionalities: that are detrimental to kids’ wellbeing and keep them hooked to their screens like endless scroll or autoplay\n\n-Limiting VPN access for kids: to make it harder for kids to get around age limits of services or certain functionalities.\n\nThis is all designed to put the wellbeing of children first.",

    "description": "Tech titans pour $50 million into super PAC to elect AI-friendly candidates to Congress",
    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names behind the artificial intelligence boom are looking to stack Congress with allies who support lighter regulation of the emerging technology by drawing on the crypto industry’s 2024 election success.\n\nMarc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman are among tech leaders who’ve poured $50 million into a new super political action committee to help AI-friendly candidates prevail in November’s congressional races. Known as Leading the Future, the super PAC has taken center stage as voters grow increasingly concerned that AI risks driving up energy costs and taking away jobs.\n\nAs it launches operations, Leading the Future is deploying a strategy that worked two years ago for crypto advocates: talk about what’s likely to resonate with voters, not the industry or its interests and controversies. For AI, that means its ads won’t tout the technology but instead discuss core issues including economic opportunity and immigration — even if that means not mentioning AI at all.\n\n“They’re trying to be helpful in a campaign rather than talking about their own issue all the time,” said Craig Murphy, a Republican political consultant in Texas, where Leading the Future has backed Chris Gober, an ally of President Trump, in the state’s hotly contested 10th congressional district.\n\nThis year, the group plans to spend up to $125 million on candidates who favor a single, national approach to AI regulation, regardless of party affiliation. The election comes at a crucial moment for the industry as it invests hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure that will put fresh strains on resources, with new data centers already blamed for driving up utility bills.\n\nLeading the Future faces a growing challenge from AI safety advocates, who’ve started their own super PAC called Public First with a goal of raising $50 million for candidates who favor stricter oversight. On Thursday, Public First landed a $20-million pledge from Anthropic PBC, a rival to OpenAI that has set itself apart from other AI companies by supporting tougher rules.\n\nPolls show deepening public concern over AI’s impact on everything from jobs to education to the environment. Sixty-two percent of US adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week, and 58% are concerned the government will not go far enough in regulating it, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nJesse Hunt, a Leading the Future spokesman, said the group is “committed to supporting policymakers who want a smart national regulatory framework for AI,” one that boosts US employment while winning the race against China. Hunt said the super PAC backs ways to protect consumers “without ceding America’s technological future to extreme ideological gatekeepers.”\n\nThe political and economic stakes are enormous for OpenAI and others behind Leading the Future, including venture capitalists Andreessen and Horowitz. Their firm, a16z, is the richest in Silicon Valley with billions of dollars invested in AI upstarts including coding startup Cursor and AI leaderboard platform LM Arena.\n\nFor now, their super PAC is doing most of the talking for the AI industry in the midterm races. Meta Platforms Inc. has announced plans for AI-related political spending on state-level contests, with $20 million for its California-based super PAC and $45 million for its American Technology Excellence Project, according to Politico.\n\nOther companies with massive AI investment plans — Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — have their own corporate PACs to dole out bipartisan federal campaign donations. Nvidia Corp., the chip giant driving AI policy in Washington, doesn’t have its own PAC.\n\nTo ensure consistent messaging across party lines, Leading the Future has created two affiliated super PACs — one spending on Republicans and another on Democrats. The aim is to build a bipartisan coalition that can be effective in Washington regardless of which party is in power.\n\nTexas, home of OpenAI’s massive Stargate project, is one of the states where Leading the Future has already jumped in. Its Republican arm, American Mission, has spent nearly $750,000 on ads touting Gober, a political lawyer who’s previously worked for Elon Musk’s super PAC and is in a crowded GOP primary field for an open House seat.\n\nThe ads hail Gober as a “MAGA warrior” who “will fight for Texas families, lowering everyday costs.” Gober’s campaign website lists “ensuring America’s AI dominance” as one of his top campaign priorities. Gober’s campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn New York, Leading the Future’s Democratic arm, Think Big, has spent $1.1 million on television ads and messages attacking Alex Bores, a New York state assemblyman who has called for tougher AI safety protocols and is now running for an open congressional seat encompassing much of central Manhattan.\n\nThe ads seize on Democrats’ revulsion over Trump’s immigration crackdown and target Bores for his work at Palantir Technologies Inc., which contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Think Big has circulated mailings and text messages citing Bores’ work with Palantir, urging voters to “Reject Bores’ hypocrisy on ICE.”\n\nIn an interview, Bores called the claims in the ads false, explaining that he left Palantir because of its work with ICE. He pointed out the irony that Joe Lonsdale, a Palantir co-founder who’s backed the administration’s border crackdown, is a donor to Leading the Future.\n\n“They’re not being ideologically consistent,” Bores said. “The fact that they have been so transparent and said, ‘Hey, we’re the AI industry and Alex Bores will regulate AI and that scares us,’ has been nothing but a benefit so far.”\n\nLeading the Future’s Democratic arm also plans to spend seven figures to support Democrats in two Illinois congressional races: former Illinois Representatives Jesse Jackson Jr. and Melissa Bean.\n\nLeading the Future is following the path carved by Fairshake, a pro-cryptocurrency super PAC that joined affiliates in putting $133 million into congressional races in 2024. Fairshake made an early mark by spending $10 million to attack progressive Katie Porter in the California Democratic Senate primary, helping knock her out of the race in favor of Adam Schiff, the eventual winner who’s seen as more friendly to digital currency.\n\nThe group also backed successful primary challengers against House incumbents, including Democrats Cori Bush in Missouri and Jamaal Bowman in New York. Both were rated among the harshest critics of digital assets by the Stand With Crypto Alliance, an industry group.\n\nIn its highest-profile 2024 win, Fairshake spent $40 million to help Republican Bernie Moreno defeat incumbent Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, a crypto skeptic who led the Senate Banking Committee. Overall, it backed winners in 52 of the 61 races where it spent at least $100,000, including victories in three Senate and nine House battlegrounds.\n\nFairshake and Leading the Future share more than a strategy. Josh Vlasto, one of Leading the Future’s political strategists, does communications work for Fairshake. Andreessen and Horowitz are also among Fairshake’s biggest donors, combining to give $23.8 million last year.\n\nBut Leading the Future occasionally conflicts with Fairshake’s past spending. The AI group said Wednesday it plans to spend half a million dollars on an ad campaign for Laurie Buckhout, a former Pentagon official who’s seeking a congressional seat in North Carolina with calls to slash rules “strangling American innovation.” In 2024, during Buckhout’s unsuccessful run for the post, Fairshake spent $2.3 million supporting her opponent and eventual winner, Democratic Rep. Donald Davis.\n\n“The fact that they tried to replay the crypto battle means that we have to engage,” said Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Texas who helped launch Public First. “I’d say Leading the Future was the forcing function.”\n\nUnlike crypto, proponents of stricter AI regulations have backers within the industry. Even before its contribution to Public First, Anthropic had pressed for “responsible AI” with sturdier regulations for the fast-moving technology and opposed efforts to preempt state laws.\n\nAnthropic employees have also contributed to candidates targeted by Leading the Future, including a total of $168,500 for Bores, Federal Election Commission records show. A super PAC Dream NYC, whose only donor in 2025 was an Anthropic machine learning researcher who gave $50,000, is backing Bores as well.\n\nCarson, who’s co-leading the super PAC with former Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah, cites public polling that more than 80% of US adults believe the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, and says voter sentiment is on Public First’s side.\n\nPublic First didn’t disclose receiving any donations last year, according to FEC filings. But one of the group’s affiliated super PACs, Defend our Values PAC, reported receiving $50,000 from Public First Action Inc., the group’s advocacy arm. The PAC hasn’t yet spent any of that money on candidates.\n\nCrypto’s clout looms large in lawmakers’ memory, casting a shadow over any effort to regulate the big tech companies, said Doug Calidas, head of government affairs for AI safety group Americans for Responsible Innovation.\n\n“Fairshake was just so effective,” said Calidas, whose group has called for tougher AI regulations. “Democrats and Republicans are scared they’re going to replicate that model.”\n\nAllison and Birnbaum write for Bloomberg.",

I feel like to be a good recruiter you have to have good communication and relationship skills and he has both of them.”\n\nRivals ranks McMiller as the nation’s No. 15 running back and No. 173 prospect overall. He visited Eugene a few weeks ago.\n\n“The coaching staff of course,” he said of what stood out. “Everybody is cool. They got a good facility.”\n\nMcMiller also highlight the “winning” program.\n\n“The head coach he’s a good leader. He knows how to run a program.”\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 185-pound McMiller has 10.2 speed in the 100m dash and as a junior he used his speed to rush for 943 yards and 17 touchdowns with 186 more yards receiving and three scores.\n\n“I’m a run hard running back,” McMiller said. He can also play in the slot. “I’m not doing all that dancing. I’m straight downhill into somebody’s face.”\n\nOregon signed Rivals No. 4 ranked class in the 2026 cycle and with recruiting wins like McMiller they’ll compete for another top five haul in 2027.",

    "description": "After a weekend of FA Cup action without VAR, BBC Sport ask managers, fans and pundits whether the game needs technology - and what needs to change.",
    "fullText": "Would football be better without the video assistant referee (VAR) system?\n\nPremier League fans, managers and players got a reminder of what life was like without VAR in the FA Cup fourth round - and it is fair to say this weekend was not without its problems.\n\nFor this season and the previous FA Cup campaign, VAR has not been brought in until the fifth round, with many fans looking forward to a return to football without interruptions from technology.\n\nAfter a season full of controversy, delayed decisions and confusion fuelled by VAR, its very existence has been questioned at times, with many claiming the game would be better without it.\n\nIn fact, after a day full of long delays, mixed messages and irate managers in early February, ex-Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Match of the Day: \"For the good of the game, you'd have VAR gone.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there.\n\n\"Do you want more right decisions or do you want a more free-flowing football experience that is genuine and spur of the moment?\"\n\nAfter a couple of offside goals being allowed, a blatant penalty not being awarded plus various other controversial decisions, the weekend certainly brought the subject back into the public eye.\n\nLong delays, irate managers and mixed messages - is VAR bad for game?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nWhy is there no VAR in the FA Cup third and fourth round?\n\nWe have all heard the arguments against VAR.\n\nDecisions taking too long, celebrations being put on hold while deliberations take place, confusion as goals are given - or ruled out - for marginal reasons, denying referees the ability to use their own common sense.\n\nBut Newcastle's controversial 3-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday could hardly have gone better for supporters of VAR - or worse for those who argue football is better without it.\n\nTammy Abraham's opener was clearly offside, Villa's full-back Lucas Digne inexplicably escaped conceding a penalty for handball and the Frenchman could easily have been dismissed for a reckless challenge as well.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said: \"I'm so torn because the game is better without VAR in terms of excitement and the spectacle for the supporters and us when we're living a moment live.\n\n\"But it does give accurate results. It does make the game more precise in terms of decision making. You have to respect those moments. They're worth their weight in gold, especially us today when we were on the wrong side of it.\"\n\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery went further, saying \"VAR is necessary. It's necessary to help the referees\".\n\nThere was also some controversy at Anfield during Liverpool's 3-0 win over Brighton.\n\nSubstitute Rio Ngumoha, 17, had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside for the hosts, while the Seagulls were furious Mohamed Salah was awarded a penalty.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"In general, I enjoy watching football without VAR because if you then score you're like 'it's a goal'.\n\n\"I like VAR only for the clear and obvious things - I'm not meaning a red card yes or no for Marc Guehi on Mo Salah because I thought it was.\n\n\"So let's stay away from that and only go to offside yes or no, ball over the line yes or no and, for the rest, the referee referees the game.\n\n\"I think we're now so used to VAR that I would prefer to have VAR during a game.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola was unsure whether football was better with VAR, despite seeing Omar Marmoush denied a goal for a debatable offside in his side's 3-0 win against Salford.\n\n\"Sometimes before I thought it was better and sometimes I think VAR helps us to have a more fair game,\" he said. \"To be honest I don't know.\"\n\nFor some though, it is simple - rather than VAR being a solution for wrong decisions, they would argue officials just need to get things right.\n\nWhen asked on Match of the Day Live whether the errors at Villa Park put him in favour of VAR, ex-Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, said: \"No. I would like the officials to do their job properly. It is not too much to ask, is it?\n\n\"If you ever needed any evidence of the damage that VAR has done to referees, I think Saturday is a great example of that.\n\n\"These guys look petrified to make a decision because they didn't have a comfort blanket.\n\n\"For me, [referees' decisions] are actually getting worse.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given added on Match of the Day: \"It shows you why we use VAR. A lot of decisions the officials got wrong at Villa Park. VAR is like a comfort blanket for referees.\n\n\"The decision is taken away from the officials. The linesman has been told all season not to put their flag up, so their brain has been trained. I think it shows VAR is a help even though we complain about it most weeks.\"\n\nWhen asked whether football had become too reliant on VAR, Howe had some sympathy with the argument.\n\n\"There is an argument to say yes,\" he said. \"Because when VAR is there, there is a tendency to think 'oh well I won't give that because VAR is there to check it'.\n\n\"Then your decision making isn't as sharp as it would normally have to be. Maybe there is a difference there. I would probably say you are right in that respect.\"\n\nBut former referee Graham Scott feels it is unfair to claim officials hide behind VAR.\n\n\"I really don't think that's fair,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"Obviously I work with them closely and I know these guys and they're not like that. It's not how their minds work, not how their processes work.\n\n\"I spent half my career with VAR and half without it - the other way around of course, without it first.\n\n\"And then when I was in the Premier League I was still dropping into the Championship quite often. So you're in and out, in and out. And your processes essentially stay the same.\n\n\"What has changed though is with VAR you don't have that spell in a game where you know you've made a really big error and you now have to reset and go again.\"\n\nJames: Football without VAR is real football. Having gone to games for the last 30 years, the last few years have been terrible in comparison. I don't bother cheering goals any more as the officials are far more interested in finding ways of disallowing goals than the entertainment of the match-going fan.\n\nVAR will be the thing that makes me turn in my season ticket, and if West Ham do get relegated the lack of VAR will be a blessing.\n\nFrank: I supported the introduction of VAR, but it was great not having it today. It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many VAR ridiculous errors.\n\nAlan: Much, much better [without]. VAR has ruined the game, thankfully I now support non-league football where there are humans, making human mistakes and getting it right.\n\nStephen: Much better without VAR. No waiting for obvious incidents that everyone can see immediately but takes VAR forever to decide. Time for return of refs and linesman to start refereeing the game again.\n\nMike: Better, even though City probably had a goal chalked off incorrectly. Right or wrong, its so much better to just know immediately if its a goal or not. VAR is a moment-killer.\n\nLes: The game is so much better without VAR. It flows without problem like it used to do. The officials are there to make decisions rightly or wrongly. VAR are always making wrong calls so I can't see the point of it. Offside because someone's toes are on the lines drawn is absolutely pathetic.\n\nBonnie: As a Villa and VAR fan, that is exactly the decision that VAR doesn't get credit for. VAR gets it right 100%\n\nRoger: That was so blatantly offside, have linesman lost their natural ability to spot stuff like this since the introduction of VAR? Whenever you see a defence hold their line like Newcastle did, strikers are more often than not offside. Poor decision.\n\nPeter: There's an easy fix for VAR offsides. If you can watch one TV replay and see the on-field decision is clearly wrong, you intervene.\n\nStephen: That's what you all wanted isn't it? More goals regardless of whether they're actually fair or not?\n\nLiga: It's these types of situations and these types of situation only where VAR should and needs to be used for offsides. Not those hairline millimetre is he on or off line drawing nonsense situations.\n\nCallum: This season is proving 2 things. 1) VAR is a must. 2) Brave, high pressure attacking football is dead.\n\nBen: What are linesman for exactly? Having no VAR is a another shambles, who makes these decisions?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going\n\nTech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).\n\nThe phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.\n\nGavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.\n\nRather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.\n\n“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”\n\nUnlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.\n\nRobert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.\n\n“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”\n\nThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.\n\nWhen the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.\n\nSome opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.\n\nThiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.\n\n“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”\n\nTech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.\n\nJust this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.\n\nAdding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”\n\nJoining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.\n\nMcCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.\n\n“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”\n\nMeta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.\n\nThe social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.\n\nThe crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.\n\n“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”\n\nWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.\n\nThe California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.\n\nSingleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.\n\nBut then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.\n\nMahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.\n\nMahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.\n\nGoogle’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nAs political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That’s for sure.”",

    "fullText": "A marginal VAR offside decision caused a fair amount of controversy for Newcastle in midweek. Joe Willock had a goal disallowed at Tottenham when the semi-automated technology said his forehead was offside.\n\nAbraham's goal was the kind of decision the video review was brought in for - the real howlers.\n\nThe Villa striker was clearly ahead of the defence when Douglas Luiz played the free-kick. With VAR, the goal would have been ruled out.\n\nIt would be easy to blame switching between systems as a defence for the assistant, Nick Greenhalgh. But with or without VAR, he would be expected to raise his flag if he's identified an offside.\n\nShould Digne have been sent off?\n\nWould the VAR have stepped in to show a red card to Digne for serious foul play with his late challenge on Jacob Murphy? It is far from certain from what we have seen in the Premier League.\n\nWe often hear the VAR has referenced glancing contact to uphold the decison of a yellow card. See Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby last month.\n\nDigne did come in at some speed and that would have increased the chance of being sent off on review.\n\nYet the Frenchman did not push through on to the shin of the Newcastle player. That his foot came off quickly probably would have saved him.\n\nIt may well have been one of those where the on-field decision would have stood, whether it was yellow or red card.\n\nSerious foul play or denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity (Dogso)?\n\nReally, this incident could have been either. After all, Bizot brought down Murphy with a knee-high challenge - although it was not with studs leading.\n\nWhen the Dutch goalkeeper fouled the Newcastle forward, the Magpies were left with three attackers up against only Luiz, although Dogso could only be applied to the player fouled.\n\nThe VAR would have taken into account the general run of the ball was not towards goal. They would also consider if Luiz would have been able to get across to prevent the shot.\n\nYou can make a case for a degree of doubt for Dogso. But much like the Digne decision it is one which would likely have stayed with the on-field decision.\n\nRead more analysis on the officiating in Aston Villa v Newcastle here",

    "fullText": "Agentic AI apps first interview you and then give you limited matches selected for ‘similarity and reciprocity of personality’\n\nDating apps exploit you, dating profiles lie to you, and sex is basically something old people used to do. You might as well consider it: can AI help you find love?\n\nFor a handful of tech entrepreneurs and a few brave Londoners, the answer is “maybe”.\n\nNo, this is not a story about humans falling in love with sexy computer voices – and strictly speaking, AI dating of some variety has been around for a while. Most big platforms have integrated machine learning and some AI features into their offerings over the past few years.\n\nBut dreams of a robot-powered future – or perhaps just general dating malaise and a mounting loneliness crisis – have fuelled a new crop of startups that aim to use the possibilities of the technology differently.\n\nJasmine, 28, was single for three years when she downloaded the AI-powered dating app Fate. With popular dating apps such as Hinge and Tinder, things were “repetitive”, she said: the same conversations over and over.\n\n“I thought, why not sign up, try something different? It sounded quite cool using, you know, agentic AI, which is where the world is going now, isn’t it?”\n\nFate, a London startup that went live last May, bills itself as the first “agentic AI dating app”. Its core offering is an AI personality named Fate that “onboards” users during an interview, asking them about their hopes and struggles before putting forward five potential matches – no swiping involved.\n\nFate will also coach users through their interactions, if they desire, a functionality Jasmine described as helpful and another user said was “scary” and “a bit like Black Mirror’.\n\nRakesh Naidu, Fate’s founder, demonstrated its coaching ability in an interview with the Guardian. “I just feel a bit hopeless at the moment in regards to my chats. I feel like I’m not being engaging enough or meaningful enough,” he said into his phone. “I just need some kind of meaningful questions I can ask to really uncover the essence of people.”\n\n“I hear you, Rakesh,” said a synthetic female voice. “Here are a few ideas. One, what’s something you’re passionate about that not many people know?”\n\nNaidu, 28, said he started Fate in order to address shortcomings in the world’s biggest dating platforms – apps such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, which monetise the time users spend on them and “are literally profiting off keeping people lonely”.\n\nOther startups, from Sitch to Keeper, have launched across the US, hoping AI features can provide the novelty to win them a share of a crowded market. Sitch leverages the power of AI to manage vasts amounts of information, inviting users to “give us detailed feedback down to the hair colour, where they want to raise a family, and their fav music”; Keeper says it can find “a match with rare and real soulmate potential”.\n\nPart of the issue, Naidu says, are algorithmic approaches to matchmaking: Tinder at one point ranked users’ desirability through an Elo score, an algorithm originally used to rate chess players. On dating platforms, it’s a Hobbesian proposition – high-scoring users are shown to other high-scoring users, low-scoring users to other low-scoring users. “It’s very superficial,” said Naidu.\n\nAI, in theory, can offer a different way. Awkward as it may be to discuss your dating life with a chatbot, Fate does not rank you based on your responses, but instead uses an LLM to try to find other users who, based on their interview, might be similar to you. That approach, along with the AI dating coach, helps users to focus on authentic connection, said Naidu – “similarity and reciprocity of personality”.\n\nAmelia Miller, a consultant for Match Group (which owns Tinder and Hinge), worries about this approach.\n\nA recent study from the group surveyed 5,000 Europeans about their online dating preferences – and found that while many were interested in AI tools to weed out fake profiles and flag toxic users, most, 62%, were skeptical about using AI to guide their conversations. One obvious anxiety might be the dystopian idea of two agentic AIs steering a conversation, with the humans nominally in charge turning into little more than meatspace mouthpieces.\n\nMiller, however, who coaches people on their relationships with AI, says she sees many clients turn to an LLM for advice in the smaller, uncomfortable moments of building their relationships – asking AI how to craft a text, for example, or respond to an intimate question.\n\n“Often I’m trying to make sure that people aren’t turning to machines because turning to humans demands a level of vulnerability that has become uncomfortable now that there is an alternative,” she said.\n\nThe appeal of an AI coach such as Fate is that revealing yourself to it – your judgments, hopes and idiosyncrasies – involves no risk; it does not remember or evaluate. Friends do, and, says Miller, asking advice from them helps hone the skills for successful relationships.\n\n“Advice is really one of the key ways that people practice vulnerability in a more low-stakes environment – they build up to more vulnerable moments in a romantic context.”\n\nJeremias has been using Fate for several months. He said he doesn’t use the AI coach: “I could see it being helpful, but I mean there are obviously some concerns.

He’s not sure if this is because of the AI matching, or because Fate simply serves up only five matches at a time – no infinite swiping – and, excruciatingly, forces its users to write an explanation when they reject a potential match.\n\n“It makes the swiping more thoughtful. If I’m actually saying no to this person, what are the reasons I’m saying no to them?”\n\nHe and Jasmine both have second dates upcoming, both after being single for several years, they say.\n\n“It is exciting because you get like, you know, the butterflies in your stomach again, going on a date with someone, doing yourself up really nicely, wearing dresses, heels. It’s fun,” said Jasmine.",

    "fullText": "As Nike continues its quest to come back as a dominant retail force, the sportswear giant has continued to invest in tech and design jobs.\n\nPublicly available work visa data, which companies are required to disclose to the US Department of Labor, gives an idea of how much Nike's employees bring home and some of the roles it has invested in.\n\nNike had about 755 open positions worldwide listed on its jobs board as of February 13. In January, the company also said it planned to lay off 775 employees at its distribution centers, citing efforts to accelerate the use of \"advanced technology and automation.\"\n\nNike had several leadership shake-ups in 2025, including promoting at least four insiders to senior roles reporting directly to CEO Elliott Hill.\n\nHill, who rejoined the company in October 2024, has told investors that Nike is aligning its employees around five key action areas: culture, product, marketing, marketplace, and connecting with consumers on the ground in their communities.\n\nThat strategy plays into Nike's efforts to focus its marquee brands — Nike, Jordan, and Converse — on key sports such as running and basketball. It's also pushing a new collaboration, NikeSKIMS, an athleisure brand for women.\n\n\"We are in the midst of realignment at Nike,\" Nike said in a July statement to Business Insider. The realignment and sport strategy aim to \"create sharper distinction and dimension\" for its brands, the company said.\n\nHere's what some key Nike roles can earn, based on work visa data for the year ending September 30.\n\nThe salary data includes information from Nike Inc. and some subsidiaries, such as its retail services arm and Air Manufacturing Innovation division. It reflects US-based roles and, given that it's based on H-1 B visa disclosures, tends to skew more tech-focused.\n\nSoftware Engineer: $124,592 to $203,581 a year\n\nSoftware Engineer I: $120,000 to $144,612 a year\n\nSoftware Engineer II: $152,007 to $178,231 a year\n\nSoftware Engineer III: $139,845 to $180,353 a year\n\nSenior Director, Software Engineering: $301,378 a year\n\nData Engineering: $104,500 to $175,000 a year\n\nData Analytics: $114,600 to $118,398 a year\n\nDirector, Supply Chain AI/ML Engineering: $252,535 a year\n\nMaterials Designer: $100,000 a year\n\nSenior Digital Product Designer: $155,810 a year\n\nSenior 3D Designer: $106,605 a year\n\nDirector, NikeSKIMS Apparel Design: $244,466 a year\n\nSenior Manager, Software Engineering: $273,156 a year\n\nDelivery Excellence, Uniform Operations Manager: $164,439 a year\n\nSenior Product Manager: $153,431 to $169,744 a year\n\nManager, Data Engineer: $168,031 to $213,190 a year\n\nSenior Program Manager: $147,434 a year\n\nSupply Chain Intelligence Manager: $158,311 a year\n\nLead Professional, Sports Marketing: $128,434 to $143,251 a year\n\nVP, Global Brand Marketing, Women's: $425,000 a year\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The U.S. already has special visas for workers in sectors like agriculture and tech",
    "fullText": "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to give special visas to construction workers, given that the Trump administration’s deportation campaign is reportedly causing a labor shortage on construction sites in states like Texas.\n\nThe Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act, introduced in September, would offer non-citizens temporary, renewable visas for up to nine years to work in key industries where employers are struggling to hire.\n\n“That would help us protect and get immigrants legally for those in the construction industry,” Rep. Monica De La Cruz (R-TX) told Nexstar.\n\nDe La Cruz was part of a group of South Texas leaders who met with House Speaker Mike Johnson this week to discuss the proposal, as home builders in the state warn of slowing construction times and difficulty hiring over fears of immigration raids.\n\n“They hear Monte Cielo and say, ‘No, no. You can pay me whatever you want, but I’m not going to go work there,’” Alejandro Garcia, a home builder at work on a development in Weslaco, Texas, that has been raided multiple times, told The Wall Street Journal last week.\n\nA concrete supplier in the region, meanwhile, told the paper that concrete use fell 60 percent between May and November, as builders lost workers and projects stalled.\n\n“A project that was taking maybe four to five months on an average, starter-type home is now taking eight, nine, 10 months, just because of the delays,” Efrain Gomez, treasurer of the South Texas Builders Association, told NewsNation. “It’s a huge ripple effect.”\n\nImmigrants, legal and otherwise, make up more than half the construction workforce in states like Texas, California, Florida, and New York, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nThe Trump administration’s immigration campaign has butted up against key industries like agriculture, hospitality, and construction that rely heavily on the labor of immigrants and undocumented people.\n\nThe administration has pushed to expand the H-2A visa for farm workers, and last year, Trump toyed with a pause on raids on hotels, restaurants, and agriculture, only for the administration to insist days later there would be “no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"\n\nThe administration has faced similar tensions over the H-1B specialist visa program, which is heavily in use by the president’s allies in the tech industry but undercuts his emphasis on hiring American workers.",

    "fullText": "LTK, a Softbank-backed startup and creator economy unicorn, let go of some staff on Thursday as part of a reorganization, a company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe cuts were designed to refocus LTK's business around its revamped brand platform and to account for structural changes to internal teams like marketing, according to the company.\n\nThe job reductions, which hit a variety of roles including software engineers and staffers who worked with creators, affected a low single-digit percentage of LTK's overall head count, which numbers over 550 employees, they said.\n\n\"LTK recently completed a targeted organizational restructure to ensure we are aligned around the skills and priorities required for our next phase of growth,\" the spokesperson said. \"This was not a broad-based layoff, but a strategic realignment focused on strengthening performance and positioning the business for long-term success.\"\n\nLTK, previously known as RewardStyle, was founded around 15 years ago by president Amber Venz Box. The company, which says it's profitable and doubled its EBITDA in 2025, has raised a little over $300 million in its lifetime. Most of that capital came in a 2021 round from SoftBank's Vision Fund 2, which valued the startup at $2 billion.\n\nOver the last decade, LTK has established itself as one of the leading players in affiliate marketing, building a network of influencers who promote products on social media in exchange for commissions.\n\nRecently, the company has made a series of moves to establish itself beyond social media affiliate marketing.\n\nThe company relaunched its app for influencer-driven shopping, called LTK, in early 2025, to add more consumer-facing features as it sought to build its own brand identity with consumers.\n\nIn late 2025, the company announced it was revamping its platform for brands, offering features such as creator discovery and performance tracking at no cost. LTK makes money by collecting a commission on sales. The company said that over 1,000 brands have been onboarded onto the platform.\n\nLTK is one of several creator economy startups that have focused their businesses on e-commerce. Other big players in the space include affiliate platform ShopMy and live-selling app Whatnot, which in October raised $225 million at an $11.5 billion valuation.",

    "description": "The red storm was too much for the ‘Cats to stop in Clearwater.",
    "fullText": "Last night brought a test of epic proportions for Northwestern, as it was tasked with taking down No. 1 Texas Tech in its first game of its long weekend in Clearwater, Fla.\n\nThe start seemed promising for NU, but reality struck early, and the hope for an upset slowly faded as the ‘Cats posted zero after zero in the bottom half of each inning.\n\nThat reality check was the nation’s best returning arm in NiJaree Canady, who pitched five innings of relief for the win, only giving up two hits while striking out eight.\n\nAs for the Red Raiders, it took them an inning to figure out Northwestern starter Emma Blea, crossing the plate twice in the second and never looking back. The two that crossed the plate were the only two earned runs for NU pitchers.\n\nIt was smooth sailing for Blea in the top of the first, as she retired .500 hitter Mihyia Davis on a lineout to center before painting the outside corner to log a backwards K at the expense of Mia Williams.\n\nFirst strikeout of the day for Emma Blea, and we are off at the @ClearwaterInv! 🔥\n\nT1 | NU 0, Texas Tech 0 pic.twitter.com/tEduUMGjTj\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nTaylor Pannell reached on an infield single on the very next pitch before Blea retired the side, doing her own dirty work by scooping up a Jackie Lis grounder.\n\nNorthwestern’s first at-bat was nearly a copy-paste of Texas Tech’s: a K, a popout, a single and a flyout all in succession.\n\nA leadoff walk surrendered to Alana Johnson came back to sting Blea and the ‘Cats later in the second. Lauren Allred laced a one-out double into the right-center gap, scoring Johnson to break the ice. Lagi Quiroga followed with one of her own, this one to the opposite gap, as the Red Raiders swiftly snatched an early 2-0 lead.\n\nNU seemed to kickstart some momentum of its own after Blea got back into her groove to end the inning. Kansas Robinson found herself on base after an error from Red Raiders’ starter Samantha Lincoln. Tru Medina then stood in the box to get plunked by a pitch, and after a Bridget Donahey flyout and an Izzy Cunnea sac fly, Kate Renschen drew a walk to load the bases.\n\nTexas Tech head coach Gerry Glasco then emerged from the dugout to bring out Canady, who cleaned up the mess in two pitches to halt the second-inning rally.\n\nBlea continued to settle back down and sent the ’Cats back to the dish after a 1-2-3 inning in the third, highlighted by a smooth play from Medina.\n\nWe see you, Tru Medina! 👀👏\n\nThe rookie making plays in the hot corner!#SCTop10 pic.twitter.com/GOVeIwi886\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nThe heart of the Northwestern order seemed to have Canady scouted, but luck wasn’t on its side in the frame. Kelsey Nader grounded out after a nine-pitch at-bat, Kaylie Avvisato ripped a line drive only to have it gloved by Pannell and Robinson went down on strikes after working a full count.\n\nBad omens continued to haunt Northwestern as it took the field for the fourth. An error by Donahey at short gave way to another double by Allred, setting up two runners in scoring position for Texas Tech. Quiroga’s sac fly did the job to drive in the run, padding the lead once more.\n\nThe ‘Cats seemed to have spiraled themselves out of the contest, as Canady shoved in the next half-frame, striking out Medina and Dohaney before getting a measly pop-up out of Cunnea to finish the fourth still unscathed.\n\nSigne Dohse’s first full inning of relief went quite smoothly, as she bounced back from an early base hit and induced soft contact to get out of the frame. Canady took note and did the same, also getting in and out of the circle after facing four batters.\n\nMedina’s throwing error to start the sixth opened the door of opportunity for Texas Tech, and it walked straight through. Allred got hit by a pitch to advance Logan Halleman, Hailey Toney laid down a bunt to move both runners and Davis came through to bring them both home on Texas Tech’s fourth two-bagger of the night.\n\nThat would be all for the Red Raiders’ scoring, but that was all Canady needed. She sat down five of the next six batters she faced before Chloe Riassetto’s number was called for the final out and the save.\n\nQuite the jarring welcome from the Panhandle for the ‘Cats to process, but there’s no rest for the weary. After Northwestern’s loss to UCF on Friday morning, NU rounds out the trip with contests against Missouri, No. 17 Georgia and No. 8 Texas A&M.",

    "fullText": "The first week of the season has Georgia Tech Softball off to a promising start. Already with a 5-2 record under their belts, the team looks ahead to their upcoming weekend in Gainesville, Florida for the Florida Classic, where they will play University of Florida (7-0; 0-0 SEC), Florida International University (FIU) (6-0; 0-0 C-USA), and Marshall University (4-3; 0-0 SBC) throughout the weekend.\n\nThe first matchup of the season was a home series last week versus Villanova as part of the Buzz Classic. The Jackets took home the win in both the Thursday and Friday games 8-0. Thursday’s game was pitched by sophomore Madalyn Johnson and Friday’s by sophomore Tymber Harris.\n\nUnfortunately, that was immediately met with a series of losses against #16 Alabama, where the Crimson Tide took the Friday and Saturday games from the Jackets, resulting in the two losses on the record. Alabama won 9-0 and 7-2 during those games.\n\nTech  ended the weekend with two wins versus East Carolina University (ECU) 13-6 and 6-2 in their Sunday doubleheader. The Jackets used five different pitchers between the two games with  Johnson seeing both games for a total of seven innings pitched against ECU.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Jackets took on the Kennesaw State Owls, adding to their slew of wins with a 10-2, 6-inning victory. Senior Kenley Hilleary started the game against her former school, pitching over half of the game before sophomore Sydnie Watts finished the game to secure the 10-2 win for the Jackets. Senior outfielder Paige Vukadinovich and sophomore outfielder Alyssa Willer shared the most runs scored for the team at three each, with senior infielder Jayden Gailey, freshman outfielder Abby McKinnis, freshman infielder and utility player Madi Duffel, and senior catcher Reese Hunter scoring one each as well.\n\nThis weekend, the team takes on the Florida Classic in Gainesville to face FIU at 1:00pm and Florida at 6:00pm Friday, FIU at 9:00am and Marshall at 11:30am on Saturday, and Florida at 11:30am on Sunday.",

    "fullText": "Tech titans had a Thursday to forget this week.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, and Michael Dell saw a combined $26 billion wiped off their net worths in one day, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nTheir fortunes shrank because their respective stakes in Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and Dell slid in value. The stock prices of those first four companies fell by around 2% on Thursday, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the immense costs of building out AI infrastructure and whether they'd see a return on their spending.\n\nDell shares tumbled 9% after rival Lenovo warned a memory-chip shortage was driving up costs, raising concerns on Wall Street that other hardware manufacturers would also see their profits contract. The sell-off triggered a $5 billion drop in its founder's personal fortune to $135 billion.\n\nMusk saw an unmatched $8 billion wealth decline on Thursday. But the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is still up about $57 billion at $676 billion this year, thanks to the soaring valuations of SpaceX and another of his companies, xAI.\n\nZuckerberg took an almost $7 billion blow to his net worth, fueling a year-to-date decline for the Meta CEO of a little over $3 billion, to $230 billion.\n\nBezos' fortune fell by $4 billion, extending the Amazon founder's wealth decline this year to around $27 billion.\n\nHuang rounded out the tech quintet with a $2.5 billion reduction in the Nvidia CEO's net worth, according to Bloomberg's rich list.\n\nOther tech bosses also saw some of their wealth erased. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin took roughly $1.5 billion hits to their net worths on Thursday as shares of Google's parent company slipped by less than 1%.\n\nIn contrast, Walmart stock climbed nearly 4% to a record high on Thursday, as fears eased over tariffs and investors rotated out of tech.\n\nThe retailer's stock jump added more than $4 billion to the respective net worths of founder Sam Walton's three surviving children: Jim, Rob, and Alice.\n\nThe trio was worth more than $150 billion each at Thursday's close. They only trail Musk in wealth gain this year after notching increases of more than $20 billion apiece.\n\nThe world's 10 wealthiest people together grew nearly $600 billion richer last year, catapulting their combined fortunes above $2.5 trillion — more than Amazon is worth.",

    "title": "I'm a solo founder with AI agents instead of employees. My 'council' of AI agents saves me 20 hours a week.",
    "description": "A defense-tech founder built an AI \"council\" of 15 agents to help him run his company, using ChatGPT and Nvidia tools to replace traditional roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aaron Sneed, a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started my business, as a solopreneur, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nThe council, which is compiled of all AI agents, helps me save around 20 hours a week, and that's a very conservative estimate. Every kind of general corporate chair, HR, legal, and finance AI agent has a seat on the council.\n\nHere's how I use around 15 custom agents, including a chief of staff agent, to manage my workload.\n\nI've worked on autonomous platforms that make decisions independently for at least 10 years. That made me latch onto commercial large language models and AI tools very quickly when they came out.\n\nI primarily use Nvidia's platform as my underlying hardware for technical prototyping and experimentation. I use their GPUs, and they provide free access to their AI software since I purchased their hardware. Additionally, my council is built on OpenAI's ChatGPT business platform using custom GPTs and projects.\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nMy chief of staff agent is important because it's the voice that sets priority based on parameters like risks, issues, and opportunities.\n\nI told my chief of staff which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback because I've learned that they naturally want to agree with me. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish.\n\nI have a roundtable set up with all my AI agents, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nThe training never really stops, because if I don't continuously train the models, I won't get the outputs I want or need. It takes me about two weeks to train my agents to the level of experience they need to be at for me to feel confident in them. Early on, it took me longer to produce a deliverable than if I'd just done it myself because I hadn't focused properly on training.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nAll of the AI companies have different prompt engineering guides. I recommend taking the time to look at them because there's a lot of user error that causes things to slow down when working with AI.\n\nIt takes time to get the agents to a good place. A lot of companies are going to try to jump into using AI too quickly for too much without understanding how to use it properly, and these companies could hurt themselves in the long run.\n\nI'm ill-equipped to handle a lot of these roles and responsibilities, but I'm also forced to do it because I'm bootstrapped.\n\nWith my legal agent in particular, I've learned the bounds of putting AI tools into real-world practice. I have a lawyer, and I use my legal agent to try to do some upfront work before handing documents off to my lawyer for a patent or dispute case, or anything like that.\n\nWhen I was training my model to help me use facts and data to plot a case, I had a lot of information laid out, and I thought what my legal agent created sounded good to me as a non-lawyer. Then I presented all that information to my lawyer, and he said that it was technically and factually correct, but we don't want to express that information because it shows our cards going in.\n\nHis legal skillset helped me realize that, even though I thought my agent was correct and ideal to use, it still won't replace a lawyer with that human context, experience, and skills.\n\nIdeally, I would have an HR person, a legal person, and so on, and each would have their own chief of staff AI agent who would help them out. That's what I think the future will look like.",

    "fullText": "Lyft is setting itself up for its next stage of growth.\n\nThe service, which relies on about 1 million gig-worker drivers, is breaking into new areas, including launching a service for older riders called Lyft Silver and one for teens. Like rival Uber, Lyft is also experimenting with self-driving cars, a development that CEO David Risher said could be \"transformational.\"\n\n\"A new Lyft is emerging,\" Risher said on the company's August earnings call, after it reported new highs for gross bookings, adjusted earnings, and free cash flow during its second quarter.\n\nThat comeback has hit snags. In February, its stock fell 17% in one day on disappointing fourth-quarter results and a surprise operating loss for 2025.\n\nStill, Risher, who became the company's CEO in 2023, said on a February earnings call that Lyft is on track to meet its 2027 financial goals, which include reaching $25 billion in annual gross bookings as well as targets for free cash flow and EBITDA.\n\nAll of that requires hiring the right people.\n\nAs of mid-February, Lyft had about 150 jobs listed on its website, spanning positions from AI transformation strategist to software engineer.\n\nWork visa data shows that Lyft sought to hire about 140 workers through the H-1B program in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended on September 30, based on filings with the US Department of Labor.\n\nLyft did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nCompanies are required to submit this work visa data, including salary information, to the US Department of Labor for foreign hires. The compensation figures don't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to base pay. However, the salaries in the filings are benchmarked against industry-average pay rates for similar roles and can provide insight into what the company pays for those jobs.\n\nThe process could change if the Trump administration's proposed changes to the H-1B visa system take effect.\n\nOver the last several months, Trump added a $100,000 fee to new applications and proposed changes to work visa rules that could give an edge to the highest-paid applicants. However, these changes were largely initiated after this reporting period.\n\nHere's a look at some of the annual salaries for Lyft jobs included in the disclosures:\n\nData Science Manager: $176,000 to $300,000\n\nData Scientist: $120,000 to $264,000\n\nData Engineer: $130,250 to $222,000\n\nSoftware Engineer: $128,000 to $312,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $181,000 to $300,000\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $144,000 to $207,500\n\nNetwork Engineer: $115,000 to $165,000\n\nEngineering Manager: $148,000 to $264,000\n\nBusiness Systems Engineer: $138,000 to $176,880\n\nData Analyst: $118,000 to $177,000\n\nAnalytics Lead: $114,000 to $150,000\n\nProduct Manager: $148,000 to $264,000\n\nProduct Designer: $124,000 to $155,000\n\nActuarial Analyst: $108,000 to $192,000\n\nSenior Analyst: $123,280 to $207,000\n\nFinancial Data Analyst: $90,000 to $162,000\n\nDo you have a story to share about Lyft?

They also flagged some stocks to watch due to an imbalance between retail and institutional interest.\n\nDuring the software meltdown, retail traders pulled back, with buying hitting a year-to-date low on February 5. From Friday, February 6, to Wednesday, February 11, retail investor flows surged above the daily average seen so far in 2026, largely driven by ETFs, compared to single stocks.\n\nHere is a closer look at some of the themes popular with retail traders following the software-led rout, according to JPMorgan.\n\nAfter the software sector sold off into a bear market, retail investors piled into high-quality AI plays.\n\nJPMorgan highlighted Microsoft as one of the stocks that retail investors bought the dip in, and noted it's one of the bank's \"AI-Resilient\" software stock picks.\n\nPalantir and AppLovin stand out as some of the top software names bought in the retail space in 2026, along with Microsoft. Salesforce, Roper Technologies, and Intuit were some of the most-sold names in the same period.\n\nBeyond the past week, retail traders have broadly preferred buying media and semiconductor stocks while selling software since the start of 2026.\n\nRetail investors shared some of Wall Street's worries about Big Tech's AI spending after earnings, but sentiment was mixed, JPM said, citing Reddit comments.\n\nThe analysts highlighted that retail traders bought the post-earnings dip in Amazon and Alphabet shares, while sitting out on Meta stock's climb.\n\nJPMorgan flagged several stocks popular on social media that saw high retail buying and high hedge fund shorting.\n\nThey noted that this combination of social media interest and conflicting retail and institutional investors signals potential unexpected flows.\n\nIn the last week, stocks with a large imbalance between retail buying and hedge fund shorting include Hims and Hers and Strategy.",

    "title": "More hiring managers want you to prove you're good with AI during interviews",
    "description": "Some major companies are shifting from telling job candidates not to use AI to requiring them to use it to prove their tech fluency.",
    "fullText": "Leaders at the software company Canva used to wonder whether job candidates were secretly using AI during technical interviews.\n\nManagers saw the company's engineers getting more done with the technology, so they needed to ensure new hires could do the same.\n\n\"We just flipped the script and went, 'OK, we're going to invite you to use AI,'\" Brendan Humphreys, Canva's chief technology officer, told Business Insider.\n\nThe result, he said, has been stronger hires better equipped to wield powerful AI tools to help write code and solve problems.\n\nCanva is one of a growing number of companies — including Meta and McKinsey — that are inviting some job candidates to use AI in parts of the hiring process.\n\nBroadly, when ChatGPT emerged in late 2022, many employers worried that job seekers would use AI to help talk their way past interviewers. Yet as the technology becomes more capable and embedded in daily work, a number of companies are moving from policing it to evaluating candidates' AI know-how.\n\nThat's what happened at Arcade, an IT infrastructure startup. The company has always asked technical candidates to complete a take-home exercise. Yet now, it expects them to use AI in the process, Alex Salazar, the company's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the technology's capabilities surged over the past year or so, he realized that candidates would likely turn to AI regardless of whether Arcade sanctioned it. Ultimately, Salazar said, the company wants its workers, including new hires, to use AI.\n\n\"So why are we creating this artificial test that doesn't even really reflect the work they're going to do when they get here?\" he said.\n\nHumphreys came to a similar conclusion at Canva. To factor in AI, he said, the company reworked its technical interview to make the questions \"complex, ambiguous, and problematic.\"\n\n\"If you just dump the question that we're giving you into an AI, you're going to get a substandard answer,\" Humphreys said.\n\nTo land a job at the company, which has about 265 million monthly users of its graphic design software, technical candidates need to know how to thoughtfully question AI, he said.\n\nOne way to avoid concerns that candidates might be leaning too hard on AI is to have job seekers show their work. In Canva's case, the company asks candidates to share their screen during a technical interview.\n\n\"We want to see the interactions with the AI as much as the output of the tool,\" Humphreys said.\n\nArcade tells candidates to use whatever AI tools they want on their exercise, then include a transcript of their conversations with the AI. The idea is to learn who knows how to do the job and to work with an agent. Doing so, Salazar said, comes with a \"very real learning curve.\"\n\nHe said that the shift to allowing AI use in the exercise meant that Arcade placed greater emphasis on a candidate's \"taste.\" That sensibility is important, he said, because AI can kick out answers, yet the best results often come from repeated iteration with these tools, he said.\n\n\"It's going to show their ability to use the AI, but it's also going to show what they think 'good' is,\" Salazar said of candidates' interactions with AI.\n\nOther companies want workers to demonstrate their AI acumen during the hiring process, too.\n\nIn a June post on an internal message board, Meta said it was developing a coding interview in which candidates could use an AI assistant, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat mode of working, Meta wrote, was \"more representative\" of the environment in which future developers would be operating. It also makes \"LLM-based cheating less effective,\" the company said, referring to large language models.\n\nThe consulting firm McKinsey & Company is piloting a change to its graduate recruiting process, asking candidates to use the company's internal AI assistant, Lilli, during case interviews to assess how they work with the technology, several media outlets reported in January.\n\nThe acceptance of, or even the preference for, AI in some parts of hiring doesn't mean companies will welcome job seekers who use the tools to misrepresent their skills. Even if a candidate gets away with it at first, hiring managers are likely to eventually discover that someone doesn't have the goods, Susan Peppercorn, an executive coach, told Business Insider.\n\nThat's because candidates who complete an assessment, for example, \"are going to have to explain how they arrived at their thinking,\" she said.\n\nUnderstanding that thought process is what Canva seeks in its hiring, said Humphreys, who oversees roughly 2,600 technical employees in roles including software engineering, IT, and machine learning.\n\nIt's a way of seeing whether a candidate makes sound technical decisions when it starts producing code, he said.\n\n\"What we're testing for now in our interview process is an ability to harness that power, to control that power — to kind of ride the dragon,\" Humphreys said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Maker of chatbot with coding ability says annualised revenue grew tenfold in each of past three years, to $14bn\n\nAnthropic, the US AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, has raised $30bn (£22bn) in a funding round that more than doubled its valuation to $380bn.\n\nThe company’s previous funding round in September achieved a value of $183bn, with further improvements in the technology since then spurring even greater investor interest.\n\nThe fundraising was announced amid a series of stock market moves against industries that face disruption from the latest models, including software, trucking and logistics, wealth management and commercial property services.\n\nThe funding round, led by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the hedge fund Coatue Management, is among the largest private fundraising deals on record.\n\n“Anthropic is the clear category leader in enterprise AI,” said Choo Yong Cheen, the chief investment officer of private equity at GIC.\n\nAnthropic said its annualised revenue – an estimate of full-year sales based on recent company data – had reached $14bn, having grown more than tenfold in each of the past three years. A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.\n\nAnthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.\n\nThe staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.\n\nAnthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many of the US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.\n\nSome listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.\n\nShares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid out this month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.\n\n“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies. \n\n “Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.\n\nFounded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.\n\nThe funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this article",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: in 2025 briefing to Wes Streeting, officials warned reputation of tech firm behind US ICE operations would hinder rollout of data system in UK\n\nHealth officials fear Palantir’s reputation will hinder the delivery of a “vital” £330m NHS contract, according to briefings seen by the Guardian, sparking fresh calls for the deal to be scrapped.\n\nIn 2023, ministers selected Palantir, a US surveillance technology company that also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation, to build an AI-enabled data platform to connect disparate health information across the NHS.\n\nNow it has emerged that after Keir Starmer demanded faster deployment, Whitehall officials privately warned that the public perception of Palantir would limit its rollout, meaning the contract would not offer value for money.\n\nPalantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.\n\nBefore he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.\n\nMPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.\n\nIn a private briefing for Wes Streeting before a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.\n\n“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”\n\nThe briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.\n\nThe officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”\n\nDonald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.\n\n“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”\n\nThe BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.\n\nThe briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.\n\nStreeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.\n\nNone mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”\n\nNew figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for the NHS as a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.\n\nThe former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.\n\nHe said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.\n\n“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”\n\nJohn Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.\n\n“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.\n\n“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”\n\nNHS England declined to comment.",

    "description": "The sharpest minds in business and tech are responding to a viral essay on AI's impact on jobs with some approval and a lot of skepticism.",
    "fullText": "Scientists and business leaders are responding to a viral essay warning of AI's impact on jobs with a mix of agreement and skepticism.\n\nThe essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" written by cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI, Matt Shumer, has racked up more than 60 million views on X as of Thursday.\n\nIn the 5,000-word post, Shumer said that AI could upend daily life on a scale \"much bigger\" than COVID, a comparison which drew pushback online. He wrote that the changes already unfolding in the tech sector are likely a preview of disruptions that could soon reach other industries as well.\n\n\"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare,\" Shumer told Business Insider's Brent Griffiths in an interview.\n\nHere's what some of the sharpest minds in AI are saying about Shumer's essay.\n\nHaber, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz specializing in technology investments, posted on X that Shumer's essay contains \"great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\"\n\n\"'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days is going to be the most valuable person in the room.' Not eventually. Right now,\" Haber quotes from the essay. \"Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's possible.\"\n\nThe Reddit founder responded to Shumer's initial post on X with a simple comment: \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\nSince 2023, Reddit has introduced a range of AI-driven tools, from search features that summarize user discussions to AI that sharpens its content recommendations and targets ads, but Ohanian recently emphasized that the platform must retain its humanity to stay competitive.\n\nMarkowitz, the author and managing partner and director of research at Nightview Capital, a long-term-oriented investment firm, responded to Schumer with an essay almost as long, which criticized the practice of chasing speed and replacing the value of humanity simply because it could be done.\n\n\"These two worlds — Wall Street and Silicon Valley — have formed a feedback loop of short-termism so tight, so self-reinforcing, that they've confused efficiency with purpose, growth with meaning, and the elimination of people with progress,\" wrote Markowitz.\n\n\"I have two research assistants. Could I replace them with AI? Of course. But their value extends their weekly output,\" Markowitz added. \"They give meaning to my work and I love seeing the excitement in their faces when they make a new discovery that I, alone, could not have found.\"\n\n\"Let me say it again: we are not our tools. We never have been,\" Markowitz wrote in conclusion.\n\nMcLees, the founder of HumanSkills.AI, wrote on X that Shumer is not wrong, but he said that the advice Shumer provided is akin to \"telling someone the floodwaters are rising and handing them a better bucket.\"\n\n\"As AI grows in ability, our role in defining direction, values, and purpose only becomes more essential,\" McLees said.\n\n\"What do you bring when the machine can do the work? That's the only question that matters when intelligence is abundant,\" McLees added. \"Shumer wrote the alarm. It's a good one. But alarms don't tell you where to go. You have to find that within yourself.\"\n\nMarcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU and founder of AI companies Robust.AI, has some harsh words for Schumer in his newsletter.\n\nMarcuz called Shumer's blog post \"weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech,\" and said he did not provide real data to support the claim that the latest AI can write complicated apps without mistakes.\n\n\"Shumer's presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere,\" Marcus added, after discussing various studies that question the accuracy and productivity gain AI tools actually provide.\n\nMisra, Vice Dean of Computing and Artificial Intelligence at Columbia University, responded in a lengthy Substack article that detailed why he doesn't think AI is as scary as it sounds, at least not right now.\n\nMisra wrote that many strange AI behaviors that make them seem sentient, such as perceived resistance and self-preservation, are simply a result of training data.\n\nAs for the possible elimination of jobs, Misra said he understands the anxiety, but history says we may not need to panic.\n\n\"When the camera was invented, portrait painters had every reason to panic. Their livelihood depended on a skill that a machine could now approximate,\" Misra wrote.\n\n\"What happened? Painters didn't disappear. They were freed from the obligation to faithfully reproduce reality and ventured into impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism,\" Misra added. \"The camera didn't kill painting. It liberated it.\"",

    "description": "AI's next phase will shift from Nvidia and cloud leaders to large incumbent companies adopting the technology to boost profits and cut costs.",
    "fullText": "Investors are growing jittery about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence stocks, but the real payoff may be just beginning — and it could extend well beyond Silicon Valley's usual winners, a $19 billion hedge fund investor said.\n\n\"This is a generational platform shift. We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",

    "description": "Ring's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies.",
    "fullText": "Ring is terminating its partnership with police tech provider Flock Safety, the Amazon-owned company announced Thursday.\n\nThe partnership between Flock and Ring came under scrutiny after the Amazon doorbell company ran an ad during the Super Bowl that touted a \"Search Party\" feature that uses AI to help locate lost pets. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the feature a \"surveillance nightmare.\"\n\nFlock, meanwhile, operates a network of automated license plate readers, and sells access to that software to customers that include law enforcement agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.\n\nRing's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies. Earlier this week, Salesforce employees pressed CEO Marc Benioff to cancel \"ICE opportunities,\" CNBC reported. More than 900 Google employees also asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nPrivacy and civil liberties advocates called on Ring to drop its partnership with Flock. A protest calling on the e-commerce company to cut its ties with Flock, ICE and CBP is scheduled for Friday, outside of Amazon's Seattle headquarters.\n\n\"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated,\" Ring wrote in a blog post. \"As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration.\"\n\nFlock representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmazon acquired Ring for $839 million in 2018. The home security company is primarily known for its connected doorbell devices, which can record footage and alert users to activity around their home or business via an app.\n\nRing has long sparked controversy about privacy due to its partnerships with police. In recent years, the company had adopted a softer image, positioning its devices as a tool to capture porch pirates and family-friendly hijinks. After founder Jamie Siminoff returned as CEO last year, the company has re-embraced its original mission of fighting crime.\n\nThe Amazon company announced its partnership with Flock last October, giving owners of its video doorbells the option to share footage with law enforcement agencies that use the startup's software to assist with their \"evidence collection and investigative work.\"\n\nFlock's systems have been adopted by thousands of communities and law enforcement agencies across the country, and both ICE and CBP have increasingly accessed Flock's data as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nRing spokesperson Emma Daniels said in a statement that the Flock partnership was never active, and the companies never announced a date for it to go live.\n\n\"No videos were ever shared between these services,\" Daniels said.\n\nThe news was earlier reported by The Verge.",

    "fullText": "Vybe, the startup cofounded by two repeat Y Combinator entrepreneurs, has raised $10 million to bring vibe coding inside large companies.\n\nThe practice of vibe coding has become more widespread as it allows people to use AI and natural language prompts to build an app, rather than traditional programming. The sector has attracted hundreds of millions in venture funding and is blurring the lines for businesses deciding between buying software or just vibe-coding their own tools.\n\nWhile popular vibe-coding products like Lovable and Replit have made it easy for companies to create prototypes and landing pages, Vybe offers stronger security that cannot be modified by AI and also taps into internal data systems, said cofounder and CEO Quang Hoang.\n\nHoang previously founded the engineering mentorship platform Plato and is building Vybe alongside cofounder and CTO Fabien Devos, founder of the security AI startup Wolfia.\n\nVybe lets teams across an organization collaborate on apps. Engineering teams manage access to internal systems like Salesforce, Snowflake, and Databricks, while business teams can build apps for onboarding, performance reviews, customer service, and more.\n\n\"The new SaaS is going to be more like Legos,\" Hoang said, referring to software-as-a-service. \"You can build it exactly how you want.\"\n\nVybe also offers app templates created by high-profile executives, such as former Airbnb product leader Lenny Rachitsky and Front cofounder Mathilde Collin, that users can \"remix\" to suit their needs, including templates for performance reviews and one-on-one meetings.\n\nFirst Round Capital led Vybe's seed round, which featured participation from Y Combinator, the CEOs of Datadog and Grammarly, and product leaders from OpenAI and Meta.\n\nVybe has six employees and dozens of customers, Hoang said. It plans to use the funding to hire engineers. Vybe charges $12 per user a month, plus usage-based credits for app development.\n\nThe round comes as vibe coding continues to attract major funding — with startups like Emergent pulling in tens of millions from Khosla Ventures and SoftBank — even as Barclays analysts warn the initial boom may be cooling.\n\nAt the same time, investors are also weighing how AI and vibe-coding tools can reshape the software sector. Software stocks have entered one of their sharpest downturns in years, shedding roughly $2 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nHere's a look at the pitch deck Vybe used to raise its $10 million seed round. One slide has been removed, and another redacted so that the deck can be shared publicly.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft's AI CEO is joining a chorus of executives who say they anticipate widespread job automation driven by artificial intelligence.\n\nMustafa Suleyman, the Microsoft AI chief, said in an interview with the Financial Times that he predicts most, if not every, task in white-collar fields will be automated by AI within the next year or year and a half.\n\n\"I think that we're going to have a human-level performance on most, if not all, professional tasks,\" Suleyman said in the interview that was published Wednesday. \"So white-collar work, where you're sitting down at a computer, either being a lawyer or an accountant or a project manager or a marketing person — most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nThe CEO said the trend is already observable in software engineering, in which employees are using \"AI-assisted coding for the vast majority of their code production.\"\n\n\"It's a quite different relationship to the technology, and that's happened in the last six months,\" he said.\n\nAI's rapid advancement over the past half-decade has brought about real, documented shifts in how some white-collar work is performed.\n\nBusiness Insider recently reported that \"AI fatigue\" has hit software engineering: the technology has unlocked productivity but also exhaustion, as workers are expected to take on more work at once.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the leading companies behind the push to introduce AI in the workplace, building products like Copilot and investing in OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nSome leaders and pioneers in AI say that artificial intelligence will advance far enough to replace entire workforces.\n\nStuart Russell, a computer scientist who co-authored one of the world's most authoritative books on AI, said in an interview last year that political leaders are looking at \"80% unemployment\" due to AI, as jobs ranging from surgeons to CEOs are at risk of being replaced.\n\nDario Amodei, CEO and cofounder of Anthropic, previously said AI could wipe out half of entry-level white-collar jobs.\n\n\"We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,\" Amodei told Axios in an interview. \"I don't think this is on people's radar.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "MLB owners crack down on pitch stealing with new rule aimed at first- and third-base coaches",
    "description": "Pitch stealing is allowed as long as players and coaches don't use in-game technology to steal signs.",
    "fullText": "MLB owners want to make it harder for teams to engage in pitch-stealing tactics on the field. Team owners reportedly voted to approve a rule Thursday that would prevent first- and third-base coaches from leaving their coaches' boxes on the field until after a pitcher throws a pitch, according to ESPN's Jesse Rogers.\n\nMLB owners wanted to crack down on the tactic due to concern over first- and third-base coaches moving up and down the foul line to try to get a better view of the pitcher, per ESPN. If those coaches discovered what pitch was coming, they would reportedly relay that information directly to the batter or to a runner on second base, who could signal to the hitter what pitch was coming.\n\nThe league attempted to curb the tactic during the 2025 World Series, when it told both the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays to make sure their first- and third-base coaches stayed in their designated coaches' boxes on the field.\n\nWith the creation of PitchCom, the art of stealing catcher signs is essentially extinct around the league. Because MLB teams will try to exploit any advantage possible, teams and coaches have turned to extensive film study ahead of games, trying to find tells from the pitcher or catcher to determine what pitch is coming next. Unlike the pitch-stealing scandal the Houston Astros engaged in during the 2017 MLB season, this version of pitch-stealing is completely legal since it doesn't rely on the in-game use of technology.\n\nIn 2017, the Astros were accused of using cameras and video monitors to steal signs from their opponents. After MLB conducted an investigation into those claims, commissioner Rob Manfred announced one-year suspensions for then-Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and then-manager A.J. Hinch. Shortly after those suspensions were announced, the Astros fired both men.\n\nBoston Red Sox manager Alex Cora was later suspended for a year for his involvement in the scandal. Cora previously coached with the Astros before being hired by the Red Sox in 2018. The Red Sox fired Cora ahead of the 2020 season, but brought him back for the 2021 MLB season.\n\nPlayers and coaches are allowed to steal signs from pitchers or catchers during games without the use of technology, but MLB reportedly felt first- and third-base coaches were getting too brazen with their tactics, per ESPN.\n\nThe MLB rulebook states the first- and third-base coaches must remain in their coaches' box from the time the pitcher steps on the pitching rubber to the time the ball is caught by the catcher or put in play. Coaches, however, are allowed to leave the coaches' box for safety reasons.\n\nUnder the new rule, first- and third-base coaches will receive a warning for their first violation. After that, coaches could be ejected from games for leaving the coaches' box too early, per ESPN.",

    "description": "Valuations in the tech sector could rise too high and trigger a double-digit correction in the S&P 500, Capital Economics said.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 will rally for the next year before facing a double-digit correction, Capital Economics says.\n\nThe research firm said it saw the index rising as high as 8,000 before falling back to 7,000.\n\nThat's because investors will realize tech valuations have gone too far, the firm said.\n\nStocks are headed for one last hurrah in the coming year before the AI-fueled rally unravels, according to one research firm.\n\nIn recent client notes, Capital Economics said it believed the S&P 500 would likely rally over the next year before running into a steep correction. It sees the benchmark index rising as high as 8,000 in 2026, before falling to 7,000 next year in a drop of about 13% to a \"more normal level,\" the firm wrote on Monday.\n\n\"A more plausible scenario is that the stock market 'collapses under its own weight' as investors reassess stretched valuations for major tech firms while still believing in AI's long-term benefits for the real economy,\" Jennifer McKeown and William Jackson, two economists at the firm, wrote, adding that as much of a 30% correction was possible in the worst-case scenario.\n\nThere are a few reasons the firm sees a double-digit drop brewing:\n\nValuations are high but not excessive, given how strong corporate earnings are. Yet, tech stocks are pricey and could keep rising, Thomas Mathews, the head of markets at the firm, wrote on Monday.\n\nMathews pointed to the price-to-forward 12-month earnings ratio of the US tech sector, one measure of how highly stocks are valued. That ratio briefly rose to its highest level since the dot-com bubble last year, before easing, per Capital Economics' analysis.\n\n\"We suspect that as the rally progresses, a rise in valuations is more likely than not. Indeed, even though they are, in our view, not yet excessive, it wouldn't be surprising if investors' enthusiasm for AI tech were to push valuations to a level perhaps above what might be sustainable in the long run,\" Mathews said.\n\nWhile the backdrop for earnings is still positive, earnings growth in the S&P 500 has largely been concentrated in the tech sector, a key vulnerability to valuations.\n\n\"Admittedly, it is, perhaps, possible that a 'bubble' could emerge in expectations for earnings, rather than valuations,\" Mathews speculated.\n\n\"It's possible that rapid earnings growth at tech companies will, also, eventually come back to earth, even if that doesn't seem set to happen this year,\" he added.",

    "description": "Wall Street is gearing up for an update on the Fed's favored inflation gauge after the jobs report bolstered the case against cutting rates.",
    "fullText": "US stocks turned sharply lower Thursday, as investors revived a rotation out of megacap tech stocks as they looked ahead Friday's inflation reading to guide rate-cut bets, already dampened by a strong January jobs report.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell roughly 1%, or over 500 points, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell nearly 2%.\n\nThe mixed picture comes as investors scrutinize incoming earnings closely for clues to the sectors vulnerable to AI disruption, which spurred the recent meltdown in software stocks. Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 11% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout.\n\nBig Tech stocks followed suit. Nvidia and Microsoft both fell over 1%, while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steeper losses.\n\nMeanwhile, attention is starting to turn to Friday’s Consumer Price Index report. A softer reading will build hopes that price pressures are easing while economic growth remains intact.\n\nBefore then, the weekly reading on jobless claims — which showed a smaller decline than expected — came in focus after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January. The strength in hiring complicates expectations for Fed policy. A resilient labor market, paired with sticky inflation, is seen as reducing the likelihood of near-term interest-rate cuts — a key driver of recent equity gains.\n\nElsewhere on the earnings front, McDonald’s (MCD) shares nudged higher after the burger giant's earnings beat. Looking ahead, Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are highlights on Thursday's docket, all due after the market close.\n\nApple (AAPL) stock was the worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock on Thursday afternoon, dropping around 5% as part of a broad sell-off across tech.\n\nReports on Wednesday that Apple's highly anticipated upgrade to its Siri voice assistant could be delayed also weighed on shares, which are off by 4% year to date. The new Siri was intended to be launched as part of an operating system update in March, but certain features could be postponed due to issues in testing, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nThe rollout of the revamped Siri, first announced in June 2024, has been riddled with delays, putting investors on edge about Apple's artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nSeparately, US Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson said Wednesday he sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, raising concerns about allegations that Apple News has been censoring content from conservative publications.\n\nMeta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) were also down more than 2% as tech got hit. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) was the lone Magnificent Seven name in the green, up 0.4%.\n\nInflation in electricity prices has more than doubled headline PCE inflation as the AI infrastructure and data center build-out have sent power demand soaring through the US, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client note on Wednesday.\n\nElectricity prices rose by 6.9% year over year through December 2025, the bank wrote, while PCE inflation rose 2.9% over the same period. On an annualized average basis, electricity prices rose by 6.8% since January 2022, while headline PCE inflation rose by 3.4%.\n\nThe rapid inflation in electricity prices is primarily driven by two key factors: the rapid construction of data centers, which demand enormous amounts of energy to operate, and the boom in capital investment by utility companies as they attempt to increase energy supply to meet demand, \"which will raise utility costs and therefore electricity prices.\"\n\nThe analysts also noted several bottlenecks that will prevent energy supply from catching up with demand, including strict regulations and shortages of critical hardware such as transformers and natural gas turbines.\n\n\"The combination of strong demand and sluggish supply will likely increase power prices in regional wholesale markets — where most utilities and other market participants procure electricity before delivering it to final customers,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThough they note that the pressure will likely be \"much more acute in a few markets than the US as a whole because data centers are highly geographically concentrated,\" with \"about 1% of all US counties account[ing] for about 70% of data center capacity.\"\n\nThe largest jumps in electricity inflation are likely to be seen in \"tighter power markets\" in the Midwest, California, and Texas, the analysts wrote.\n\nThe US stock market turned into the red through late morning trading on Thursday, marking a sharp reversal from earlier gains on the major indexes.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down, shedding roughly 1.5%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which snapped a three-day streak of gains on Wednesday, both lost roughly 1%.\n\nThe downturn comes as investors look for any signs of weakness in the earnings reports of companies vulnerable to AI disruption, which has triggered the meltdown in software stocks over the past week-and-a-half. Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 11% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout.\n\nThe tech sector's largest names also dragged the sector down, as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) both fell over 1% while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steeper losses.\n\nWhile investors got a bullish read on the labor market in Wednesday's nonfarm payrolls report, showing that January added twice as many jobs as expected, data published Thursday on initial jobless claims dimmed some of that optimism, showing a smaller decline than expected.\n\nOil prices fell on Thursday as investors weighed a new demand forecast from the International Energy Agency, which predicted a slowdown, and unclear progress in talks between the US and Iran.\n\nFutures on international pricing benchmark Brent crude (BZ=F) and US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) shed roughly 1.8% to trade below $68.20 and $63.50 a barrel, respectively.\n\nIn a new publication on Thursday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said world oil demand would rise by 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, 80,000 bpd lower than the agency's January forecast. The figure is also much lower than that published by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Wednesday, which said demand would rise by 1.38 million bpd this year.\n\nThe IEA also maintained its call that the market will spend 2026 in a deep oversupply glut, which the agency pegged at 3.73 million bpd of excess oil.\n\nWhile market watchers had broadly coalesced around the likelihood of a supply glut through 2026, with prices expected to drop, oil prices have instead gained roughly 10% since the start of the year, following a series of geopolitical events, including the US takeover of Venezuela's oil industry, widespread protests in Iran, and damage to key export terminals on the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn public comments on Thursday, the CEO of commodities trading house Vitol, Russell Hardy, said the global oil market is tightening instead of loosening, especially as the US ratchets up pressure on Russia and Iran, pushing buyers to find barrels in other markets.\n\nVitol is the world's largest independent trader of oil.\n\nThe key swing factor for oil prices right now remains ongoing negotiations between the US and Iran over the Iranian regime's uranium enrichment technology. President Trump on Wednesday deployed more military craft to the region, and analysts say any military action could result in retaliation from Iran, which controls the Strait of Hormuz, a critically important global chokepoint for oil flows.\n\nAs worries around the electricity and water demand of AI data centers have taken root, federal and state lawmakers have begun pushing back, introducing bills to regulate or halt development entirely.\n\nThis week, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced the first bipartisan bill in Congress designed to prevent data center power usage from affecting consumers' electric bills.\n\nA week earlier, on Feb. 6, New York became at least the sixth state to have its legislators propose a bill to pause data center construction within state lines. This legislation would effectively shut out New York as a potential site for new data centers if it passes.\n\nIn doing so, New York's legislators join federal and state congressional leaders across the country in attempting to legislate an industry that has boomed and threatens an already overtaxed power grid.\n\n\"The regulatory framework was not designed for single-sector load shocks, so policymakers are attempting to adjust in real time to the scale and speed at which the load forecasts are changing,\" Didi Caldwell, founder and CEO of site selection advisory firm Global Location Strategies, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"The system is ill-equipped to address the dramatic increase in demand created by AI data centers,\" she said.\n\nAnd lawmakers are trying to catch up.\n\nWednesday's unexpectedly bullish jobs report has all but shuttered the odds of rate cuts under current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and narrowed the path to cuts under a Kevin Warsh-led Fed, Bank of America economists wrote in a client note on Thursday, calling the report \"a feast for the hawks.\"\n\nData released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday showed that the US added 130,000 jobs in January, doubling economists' expectations of 65,000. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.3% from 4.4%, beating expectations that the rate would remain flat.\n\nThe data gave lift to the argument that even as inflation has stayed elevated, the labor market is remaining resilient. These conditions are seen as reducing the odds of rate cuts in the near future.\n\n\"Payrolls surged above all expectations, the downward revisions were minimal, and wages and hours were up as well,\" the analysts wrote. \"The broad-based strength in the Jan jobs report vindicates our view that the Fed won't cut under Powell.\"\n\nFor now, the economists wrote, BofA is maintaining its prediction of two rate cuts under a Warsh-led Fed. But the swing metric for potential rate cuts under Warsh, they wrote, will be the unemployment rate.\n\n\"The key risk to his call for significant cuts is a decline in the u-rate. Therefore, the path to cuts under Warsh (which we don't think the economy needs) now looks narrower,\" the BofA economists wrote.\n\n\"If the u-rate is stable or down even further by June, Warsh might be stuck on hold for the rest of the year.\"\n\nUS stocks rose in the first minutes of trading on Thursday as investors digested the latest string of earnings reports and looked ahead to Friday's inflation reading as the next major signpost for rate-cut bets.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) picked up roughly 0.5% as trading began, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both rose around 0.3%.\n\nThursday's weekly reading on jobless claims — which showed a smaller decline than expected — offered another picture of the labor market after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January.\n\nOn the corporate calendar, earnings from Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are due after Thursday's closing bell.\n\nThe US saw 227,000 initial jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 7, exceeding expectations and marking a decrease from the previous week's 232,000 initial claims, according to data released Thursday by the Department of Labor.\n\nEconomists had expected 223,000 claims for unemployment benefits, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nContinuing claims for the week came in at 1.86 million, also exceeding economists' estimates of 1.85 million and marking an increase over the previous week's 1.84 million continuing claims.\n\nThe Labor Department data comes after investors received a stronger-than-expected read on payroll additions in January.\n\nData released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed 130,000 jobs added in January, compared to estimates of 65,000 jobs. However, 2025 revisions knocked 400,000 job additions off the year's total, bringing the monthly average of payroll additions to roughly 15,000 per month.\n\nEuropean stocks broadly gained on Thursday as earnings results from Siemens, EssilorLuxxotica, and others lifted sentiment.\n\nGermany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 1.3%. The index was lifted by a 6% increase in Siemens stock (SIE.DE) after the industrial company raised its 2026 earnings guidance due to strong artificial intelligence demand.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) advanced another 0.3% after hitting a record high on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 1%. Shares of component EssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA), the maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses, jumped more than 6% after the company sounded bullish on revenue growth from smart glasses in its earnings report. EssilorLuxxotica expanded its partnership with Meta (META) to produce the AI glasses.\n\nUS healthcare company Baxter's (BAX) stock sank 14% before the bell on Thursday following the release of its fourth quarter earnings, forecasting annual profit below Wall Street estimates. The company cited persistent problems from hurricane-related issues at one of its manufacturing plants.\n\nMagnum Ice Cream's (MICC) stock fell 12% during premarket hours on Thursday. The group, which was recently spun off from Unilever (UL) and makes popular ice creams such as Ben & Jerry's and Cornetto, reported a 3% decline in sales for its fourth quarter earnings.\n\nSanofi (SNY) stock fell 6% before the bell on Thursday after the French pharmaceutical company ousted its CEO, Paul Hudson, thanking him Thursday for \"valuable contributions\" but without giving any reason for his surprise exit.\n\nMicron (MU) stock rose 3% during premarket hours on Thursday after its CEO, brushed off concerns on Wednesday about competition growing in the memory chip space. Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) also claimed an early lead in the race to supply AI chips to Nvidia (NVDA). Samsung Electronics is a key competitor of Micron.\n\nAppLovin (APP) shares fell 5% before the bell today following the group's fourth-quarter earnings release on Wednesday, which beat Wall Street estimates. The advertising company's shares have fallen almost 30% over the past month.\n\nSome smaller pharmaceutical companies not targeted by President Trump for deals to lower their US drug pricing are looking to craft their own agreements with his administration, industry sources told Reuters. The moves are a bid to avoid potentially onerous tariffs and new price-setting schemes.\n\nCisco (CSCO) stock fell 7% during premarket hours on Thursday after the networking company issued guidance below Wall Street forecasts.\n\nFor the full year, Cisco raised its guidance for earnings per share to $3.00 to $3.08 on revenue of $61.2 billion to $61.7 billion. However, the Street was looking for earnings guidance of $3.12 on revenue of $62.1 billion.\n\nIn Cisco's second quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $0.80, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates of $0.74 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue rose 10% year over year to $15.3 billion, compared to estimates of $15.1 billion.\n\n\"We see strong, broad-based demand for our technology solutions and remain focused on capturing the significant opportunities we see ahead,\" Cisco CFO Mark Patterson said.",

    "fullText": "It's shaping up to be another tough week for the tech sector.\n\nUS stocks slid lower on Thursday, with the S&P 500 on track to notch its third straight day of losses as investors continued to dump tech and software holdings and rotate into other areas of the market.\n\nMajor indexes were up earlier in the day, but tumbled more than 1% around noon. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which recently entered a bear market and endured brutal selling last week, dropped another 3%.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around 12:30 pm ET on Thursday:\n\nThe market's steepest losses were concentrated in the tech sector, particularly among software and memory stocks. Here were some of the notable moves:\n\nThe continued selling pressure is a sign that investors' concerns about AI haven't ebbed despite a relief rally in tech at the start of this week. Software stocks took a beating last week as traders assessed the threat posed by AI and remained cognizant of high valuations in the broader tech landscape.\n\nA trio of AI-exposed sectors tumbled this week, with shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms dropping on fresh worries about AI disruption.\n\nInvestors are also likely reacting to recent softness in the economic data, according to Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers. He pointed to how most sectors in the economy were losing jobs, despite the US overall adding more payrolls than expected in January.\n\nInvestors are also keyed into the earnings potential of AI and are beginning to be more selective about the companies they invest in, he added.\n\n\"You have dwindling AI hopes coinciding with lackluster economic reports,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Software/services are being repriced as agentic AI pressures pricing power,\" Rosenberg Research wrote in a client note on Thursday, pointing to uncertainty around future cash flows among large tech firms. \"The sustainability of the accelerating investment cycle and the ultimate beneficiaries of the growth story remain highly uncertain,\" the firm added.",

    "title": "Software engineers are facing a reality the rest of us have dealt with for years: Your job getting disrupted by tech.",
    "description": "A software veteran predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers.",
    "fullText": "Software engineers are getting crushed by AI, and they think you're next.\n\nAI's ability to automate code is simultaneously making developers productive and overworked. One technologist said his job is harder than ever, lamenting that \"AI fatigue\" is real.\n\nThe good news is it won't last forever. The bad news is that's because most of them will be out of a job.\n\nSoftware veteran Steve Yegge predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers. (He wasn't a total drag. Yegge offered advice to software engineers for avoiding the 'vampiric effect' of AI.)\n\n\"Ok, but I don't work in tech. Why do I care?\" you callously ask. (So cold!)\n\nWell, according to the people in the thick of it, AI isn't stopping with them.\n\nMatt Shumer, the CEO of an AI startup, warned AI's disruption will be \"much bigger\" than COVID. The post has racked up more than 69 million views on X, gaining traction outside traditional tech circles. Shumer spoke to BI's Brent D. Griffiths about the post and the fact that he (surprise!) used AI to help him write it.\n\nIt's worth noting Shumer's company specializes in AI personal assistants. He certainly benefits from getting people on board with AI. But that doesn't invalidate a lot of his points about workers needing to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.\n\nThere's a counterargument to the doomsday prophecy.\n\nMaybe engineering jobs are especially ripe for AI disruption?\n\nThe job, after all, is highly digital and requires hard skills, two factors that make it a strong candidate for AI automation.\n\nSoftware engineers have also been somewhat insulated from the tech-based disruptions the rest of us have endured and adapted to during the pre-AI times. A new tool here. A new app there. At some point, many of us have gotten numb to tech disrupting what we do. You just figure out how to adapt.\n\nMeanwhile, software engineers were living on easy street. You don't have to worry about the tools when you're the ones building them. For years, software developers enjoyed healthy salaries, good work-life balance, and fantastic job security.\n\nNow the tables are turned, and suddenly it's everyone's problem?\n\nI'm not suggesting AI won't impact the rest of us. For starters, entry-level jobs across the board appear to be on the chopping block thanks to AI. Consultants also seem ripe for some shakeups. And the legal industry is certainly feeling the heat.\n\n(I could mention journalism, but we were on the extinction list long before AI. When I started college in 2007, my professors all told me the industry was dying. Almost two decades later, we're still here. If anything, it looks like AI has created some high-paying jobs for writers.)\n\nAI might end up being massively disruptive for all of us, but at this point, we're all used to it.\n\nWhere do you stand on the AI doomsday prophecy?

    "description": "Steve Yegge worked at Amazon an Google. Now, he predicts Big Tech companies will cut half their engineers to help pay for the others to have AI.",
    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

    "description": "Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that people in tech \"aren't making predictions. We're telling you what already occurred in our jobs.\"",
    "fullText": "It's never a good sign when a CEO warns something more disruptive than COVID is heading our way.\n\nIn an essay titled \"Something Big Is Happening,\" Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer said AI can now do all of his technical work — and he thinks your job could be next.\n\n\"I'm writing this for the people in my life who don't... my family, my friends, the people I care about who keep asking me 'so what's the deal with AI?' and getting an answer that doesn't do justice to what's actually happening,\" Shumer wrote in his nearly 5,000-word post published Tuesday on X.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, his post had 40 million views and 18,000 retweets. Shumer is a cofounder of OthersideAI, which features Hyperwrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\nShumer said that the reason people in tech \"are sounding the alarm\" is that they have already experienced what's coming for everyone else.\n\n\"We're not making predictions,\" he wrote. \"We're telling you what already occurred in our own jobs, and warning you that you're next.\"\n\nShumer said that many people outside tech wrote off AI years ago after a clunky experience with an early edition of ChatGPT.\n\n\"The models available today are unrecognizable from what existed even six months ago,\" he wrote. \"The debate about whether AI is 'really getting better' or 'hitting a wall' — which has been going on for over a year — is over.\"\n\nIt's not the time to panic, Shumer said. Instead, the best thing to do is to become deeply familiar with AI. \"This might be the most important year of your career,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I don't say that to stress you out. I say it because right now, there is a brief window where most people at most companies are still ignoring this,\" he wrote. \"The person who walks into a meeting and says 'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days' is going to be the most valuable person in the room.\"\n\nHe's far from alone in sounding the alarm. Despite disagreement from other tech leaders, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei remains adamant that AI could wipe out up to half of white collar, entry-level jobs in the next one to five years.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk and others have warned that if your job doesn't involve physical labor, it's likely to be replaced by AI much more quickly, a view that dovetails with a growing base of economic research.\n\nShumer's essay struck a chord, especially with those in tech. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian replied, \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\n\"Great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now,\" A16z general partner David Haber wrote.\n\nGreat advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\n\n“I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days\" is going to be the most valuable person in the room. Not eventually. Right now. Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's… https://t.co/cBq5s1AH4Y\n\nWhile the response to the post has been overwhelmingly positive, some X users pointed out the limitations still present in many current AI products, like hallucinations and general inaccuracies.\n\nShumer said that this moment feels like February 2020, when in a short span of time, news of a spreading pandemic gave way to a worldwide upheaval unseen in modern times that continues to reverberate to this day.\n\nThe potential of what AI will change, he wrote, is \"much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nFor Shumer, this moment of realization came with the recent dueling releases of Anthropic's Opus 4.6 and OpenAI's GPT-5.3 Codex. Both models are primarily aimed at software engineering. OpenAI said in its release notes that GPT-5.3 Codex \"is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\n\n\"It wasn't just executing my instructions,\" Shumer wrote of his experience with OpenAI's latest Codex model. \"It was making intelligent decisions. It had something that felt, for the first time, like judgment. Like taste. The inexplicable sense of knowing what the right call is that people always said AI would never have.\"\n\nAI is now so intelligent, Shumer said, that he can tell the agent what he wants and \"walk away from my computer for four hours, and come back to find the work done. Done well.\"\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn Wednesday morning, Shumer addressed his viral X post.\n\n\"Every time someone asks me what's going on with AI, I give them the safe answer,\" he wrote on Wednesday. \"Because the real one sounds insane. I'm done doing that.\"",

    "title": "Death isn't the end: Meta patented an AI that lets you keep posting from beyond the grave",
    "description": "Meta was recently granted a patent for tech to keep your social media accounts running using AI if you take a break or die.",
    "fullText": "Does Meta want to make our social media accounts immortal?\n\nThe company was granted a patent in late December that outlines how a large language model can \"simulate\" a person's social media activity, such as responding to content posted by real people.\n\n\"The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased,\" the patent says.\n\nAndrew Bosworth, Meta's CTO, is listed as the primary author of the patent, which was first filed in 2023.\n\n\"We have no plans to move forward with this example,\" a spokesperson for Meta told Business Insider.\n\nIn the patent, Meta lays out why it thinks people might need this.\n\nIf you're no longer posting online — whether that's because you need a break from social media or … you … die — your followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.\n\n\"The impact on the users is much more severe and permanent if that user is deceased and can never return to the social networking platform,\" the document says.\n\nTo fill that void, Meta would essentially create a digital clone of your social media presence, training a model on \"user-specific\" data — including historical platform activity, such as comments, likes, or content — to understand how you would (or rather, did) behave.\n\nThat clone can then respond to other people's content by liking and commenting, or responding to DMs. For influencers or creators who make their livelihoods on Meta's platforms and need to take a break from social media, such a tool could be useful.\n\nMeta's patent also references tech that would allow the LLM to simulate video or audio calls with users.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said that while it files patents to disclose concepts, a granted patent does not always mean the company will pursue, develop, or implement that tech.\n\nStill, it opens up many questions about the nature of tech — and grief. An AI bot that acts as your understudy while you're on a digital detox is one thing, but imitating people who've died?\n\nEdina Harbinja, a UK-based professor at the University of Birmingham's Law School, has concerns.\n\n\"It does affect not just legal issues, but a lot of very important social, ethical, and deeply philosophical issues as well,\" Harbinja, who specializes in digital rights and post-mortem privacy, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta has thought about managing digital legacies for years.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Facebook launched tools that let people designate a \"legacy contact\" to manage their accounts if they died. And back in the company's metaverse days, in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Mark Zuckerberg discussed virtual avatars for deceased people.\n\n\"If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful,\" Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\nThere are a lot of names for this broader category of tech — death bots, ghost bots, grief tech — that are aiming to help people face the loss of loved ones with eternally memorialized digital versions of them.\n\nSeveral startups have launched around this premise, and many have emerged from founders' own experiences with grief. Replika, an AI chatbot startup, was founded in 2015 by Eugenia Kuyda after the loss of her friend. Then there's You, Only Virtual (YOV), which was founded in 2020 by Justin Harrison when his mother was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"Everybody in the tech world has been thinking about this for a while, as soon as we started having breaks in generative AI,\" Harrison said.\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft patented an AI chatbot that could simulate a deceased person (as well as fictional characters or celebrities).\n\nMeta's patent signals that the technology category is moving more into the mainstream, Harbinja said.\n\nHarrison isn't surprised to see bigger tech companies dipping their toes in the space, and sees it as a sign that people are beginning to \"feel more comfortable with doing this.\"\n\n\"We can only improve on what we offer people,\" Harrison said, adding that the resources for grieving are \"horrible\" to begin with.\n\n\"I think we have a moral obligation, if we have the potential, to do more for those folks than we should be,\" he said.\n\nAI, death, and grief are not easy topics to digest, however. The intersection of all three is a potent brew of taboos ripe for a philosophical debate on ethics, digital rights, and privacy for any dinner table.\n\nMeta has more than helping people process grief as an incentive to pursue the tech it lays out in its patent, especially for accounts taking a break.\n\n\"It's more engagement, more content, more data — more data for the current and the future AI,\" Harbinja said. \"I can see the business incentive for that. I'm just curious to see how they would, when, and if they will implement this innovation.\"\n\nDepending on how a product like this is rolled out, different questions could come up.\n\nFor instance, would this apply across all of Meta's apps? Would it understand the nuance of your WhatsApp presence vs. the candor you have in the Instagram comment section?\n\nJoseph Davis, a sociology professor at the University of Virginia, said he was concerned with the impact that tools like a Meta bot could have on how humans experience grief.\n\n\"One of the tasks of grief is to face the actual loss,\" Davis said.\n\n\"Let the dead be dead,\" Davis added. \"The idea of bringing them back, but you're not really doing that, but in fact, it looks like that. That's the confusion.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at sbradley@businessinsider.com or Signal at sydneykbradley.123.

    "description": "Valuations in the tech sector could rise too high and trigger a double-digit correction in the S&P 500, Capital Economics said.",
    "fullText": "Stocks are headed for one last hurrah in the coming year before the AI-fueled rally unravels, according to one research firm.\n\nIn recent client notes, Capital Economics said it believed the S&P 500 would likely rally over the next year before running into a steep correction. It sees the benchmark index rising as high as 8,000 in 2026, before falling to 7,000 next year in a drop of about 13% to a \"more normal level,\" the firm wrote on Monday.\n\n\"A more plausible scenario is that the stock market 'collapses under its own weight' as investors reassess stretched valuations for major tech firms while still believing in AI's long-term benefits for the real economy,\" Jennifer McKeown and William Jackson, two economists at the firm, wrote, adding that as much of a 30% correction was possible in the worst-case scenario.\n\nThere are a few reasons the firm sees a double-digit drop brewing:\n\nValuations are high but not excessive, given how strong corporate earnings are. Yet, tech stocks are pricey and could keep rising, Thomas Mathews, the head of markets at the firm, wrote on Monday.\n\nMathews pointed to the price-to-forward 12-month earnings ratio of the US tech sector, one measure of how highly stocks are valued. That ratio briefly rose to its highest level since the dot-com bubble last year, before easing, per Capital Economics' analysis.\n\n\"We suspect that as the rally progresses, a rise in valuations is more likely than not. Indeed, even though they are, in our view, not yet excessive, it wouldn't be surprising if investors' enthusiasm for AI tech were to push valuations to a level perhaps above what might be sustainable in the long run,\" Mathews said.\n\nWhile the backdrop for earnings is still positive, earnings growth in the S&P 500 has largely been concentrated in the tech sector, a key vulnerability to valuations.\n\n\"Admittedly, it is, perhaps, possible that a 'bubble' could emerge in expectations for earnings, rather than valuations,\" Mathews speculated.\n\n\"It's possible that rapid earnings growth at tech companies will, also, eventually come back to earth, even if that doesn't seem set to happen this year,\" he added.\n\nThe AI rally could also be jeopardized if the US economy starts to meaningfully slow, Mathews said, though he noted that economic growth looked healthy at the moment and the risk of a recession looked \"remote.\"\n\nThere's also the risk that AI doesn't deliver as much as investors originally anticipated, or that China could start to edge ahead of the US on the technology frontier.\n\nMathews pointed to lingering concern about AI capex, a key issue that has hung over the market and triggered multiple sell-offs in the past year.\n\nConcerns about China's AI innovations, like DeepSeek, also sparked a steep sell-off in early 2025.\n\n\"That, at face value, poses a big threat to the big US tech companies,\" Mathews said of the threat from China, though he pointed to factors like US companies having a \"hardware edge\" that could protect the tech sector.\n\nMarkets have already gotten a taste this year of how geopolitical tensions can dent the market's enthusiasm for AI. The firm pointed to recent market volatility stemming from President Donald Trump's threats on Greenland.\n\nGeopolitical conflict could have a more significant impact on AI trade down the line, considering that Europe is a major market for the US tech sector, it added. The US's allies and partners in Europe make up around 40% of revenue among tech firms, per Capital Economics' analysis.\n\n\"But our sense is that for those to have a lasting effect on the AI rally, they'd have to either have a sizeable effect on the US economy or on tech companies' earnings through some other channel,\" Mathew added of the risk.",

    "description": "The tech giant's internal policy promotes an in-house tool called Kiro over Anthropic's Claude Code. Some Amazon engineers are unhappy about this.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing the startup's AI models and products to customers.\n\nInside Amazon, however, employees aren't allowed to use Anthropic's Claude Code for production work or for live products without formal approval.\n\nThat disconnect became more visible late last year, when Amazon rolled out internal guidance steering teams toward Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant, according to internal messages seen by Business Insider. The guidance encourages using Kiro over non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, for production code.\n\nThe policy prompted criticism across internal Amazon forums. In one discussion thread, roughly 1,500 Amazon employees endorsed the formal adoption of Claude Code, according to the messages.\n\nThe restrictions have been particularly awkward for engineers who help sell AWS Bedrock, Amazon's platform that offers customers access to third-party AI services, including Claude Code. Some questioned how they could credibly promote a product they are not permitted to use themselves in official work.\n\n\"Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,\" one employee wrote.\n\nThe episode highlights the complexity of Amazon's relationship with Anthropic. While Amazon is racing to build and promote its own AI tools, it is also marketing a partner's competing technology. Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors, with a stake valued at more than $60 billion. Anthropic, in turn, is a major AWS customer, committing to use Amazon's cloud services and at least one million of Amazon's Trainium chips.\n\n\"We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.\"\n\nAmazon maintains \"a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,\" and while there's no explicit ban on Claude Code, the company applies \"stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.\n\nAn Anthropic spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one of the internal forums, an Amazon sales engineer flagged the irony of being asked to sell Claude Code even though it isn't formally supported inside the company. The employee wrote that they need to be able to \"use, demo, and build\" with Claude Code to support Amazon's directive to get more customers to use it through AWS Bedrock.\n\nOther Amazon engineers also debated whether the emphasis on Kiro was hindering productivity. Some argued that Claude Code outperformed Amazon's in-house tool and warned that forcing adoption of a weaker product could slow development.\n\n\"A tool that can't keep pace with rivals offers no real innovation,\" one of the Amazon employees wrote. \"And without competitive strength, Kiro's only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.\"\n\nClaude Code has become one of the most widely used AI coding services, and it underpins many other similar offerings from other providers. An Amazon spokesperson said about 70% of the company's software engineers used Kiro at least once in January.\n\nIn one forum thread, a manager overseeing Amazon's internal developer tools said he understood the \"frustration\" and \"significant\" interest in Claude Code, citing about 1,500 internal endorsements calling for its formal adoption.\n\nSome employees said frustration deepened after Amazon had previously indicated that Claude Code had cleared security and legal review for production use, according to an internal guideline and messages reviewed by Business Insider. That language was later edited and removed, employees said.\n\nOthers criticized the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally adopt Claude Code, asking what data informed the decision.\n\n\"The trend is clear,\" one employee wrote internally. \"More and more people would like to start using Claude Code and be officially supported by Amazon.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A new command-and-control system is expected to make planning and decision-making faster and easier.",
    "fullText": "New US Army warfighting software is speeding up and simplifying the command job, a commander said recently, sharing that it lets him scrap the \"hourlong staff meetings\" to make decisions.\n\nThe Army, like other services, believes that future wars will be determined by the speed of decision-making. That's where the new Next Generation Command and Control, or NGC2, program is expected to make a substantial impact and modernize how the service fights.\n\nAt Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army's 4th Infantry Division has been testing NGC2 in a series of exercises. The most recent one, Ivy Sting 4, added more components to the system, with different types of sensors and weapons on the battlefield feeding into one system that everyone can access.\n\n\"So it's all in one place, and it's there very, very quickly, so that the staff can see it across their functional systems,\" said Maj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, commander of the 4th ID, at a recent media roundtable, explaining that \"the fires person can see what the logistician sees, can see what the intel person sees.\"\n\n\"I don't have to have the hourlong staff meeting anymore,\" the general said.\n\n\"If we're actually using the technology as the tool that we're prepping on and that we're also fighting on,\" he said, \"I could sit there, I can look at it, I can make decisions, I can say, 'Hey, here are my priorities for this or that.' We all agree on it, we click save, and that's done.\"\n\nThe Army has facilitated the development of NGC2 with both the 4th ID and 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii and industry teams, including Anduril and Lockheed Martin, pursuing a Silicon Valley-style approach aimed at moving faster and rapidly integrating soldier feedback, delivering fixes immediately rather than months or years later.\n\nOn the heels of Ivy Sting 4, more than two weeks of field testing that involved live-fire exercises and an electronic warfare jamming scenario, Ellis and others said that NGC2 was making planning and executing battlefield missions more effective.\n\n\"We are no longer fighting with the network; we are now fighting using the network,\" Ellis said.\n\nDuring the Ivy Sting 4 testing event, 20 different types of sensors, such as drones, electronic warfare systems, artillery, and Stryker vehicles, were linked together.\n\nData and artificial intelligence capabilities provide real-time information on the sensors. Soldiers can see how much ammunition they've got left or whether a Stryker will need maintenance or fuel soon. Simulations can predict what resources will be needed for certain tactics or actions, including different ways an enemy might attack.\n\nAs different platforms are brought onto NGC2, broadening what the platform can do, Army command and soldiers can see and communicate using the same data. The system is breaking down the silos that have previously hindered information flow.\n\n\"I'm feeling empowered as a commander to make more, better, and faster decisions because I've got access to all that data,\" Ellis explained.\n\nMany NGC2 components are being built with off-the-shelf technology and standard commercial software practices, and the vendor teams involved are working on the ground with soldiers. The closer working relationship means soldier feedback is being incorporated more quickly.\n\n\"We work through these obstacles, and we learn how to do something, and once we run into a roadblock, we figure out a way to solve that problem, and then that problem is now solved for the Army,\" he said. \"We're not relearning these lessons over and over again.\"",

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration has refused to accept an application from Moderna to review its first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine, the company said Tuesday, in another setback for the technology that’s been a target of some Trump administration health officials.\n\nThe agency told Moderna that its application didn’t contain an “adequate and well-controlled” trial because the control arm didn’t reflect the “best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study,” according to a letter dated February 3 that Moderna posted online. It didn’t identify any safety or efficacy concerns, the company said.\n\nModerna said that the refusal was inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency and that it had requested a meeting with FDA officials to understand how to proceed.\n\n“The complete stunner here is at no point in any of this did anybody say that it was not adequate” to run its clinical trial the way it had discussed with the agency, Moderna’s president, Dr. Stephen Hoge, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said “the FDA generally does not comment on regulatory communications to individual sponsors.” It’s rare for the FDA to issue a “refuse-to-file” letter; a 2021 study of almost 2,500 applications submitted to the agency found that only 4% received such letters.\n\nModerna used a standard-dose seasonal flu vaccine called Fluarix as a comparator in a 40,700-person clinical trial to demonstrate the experimental mRNA vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The company said the FDA had agreed with that plan in April 2024 but suggested it also include data comparing its vaccine with an approved high-dose flu vaccine for people over 65, which the company said it did.\n\nModerna added that as recently as August, in a meeting before it submitted its application for approval of the vaccine, the FDA suggested that it would review the filing and assess issues with the comparator during that process. The agency did note that there could be a “significant issue” with the data “during review” of the application, according to written feedback that Moderna shared.\n\nBut last week, the agency refused to do the review at all, according to the letter. It was signed by Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine regulation.\n\nPrasad was an outspoken critic of the government’s response to Covid-19 before he was appointed to the FDA under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He claimed late last year without providing details that Covid-19 vaccines resulted in deaths of 10 children and has said the agency will change its vaccine approval process.\n\nModerna is one of three manufacturers in the US of approved Covid-19 vaccines, along with Pfizer and Novavax. Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines use mRNA technology. Pfizer also has mRNA-based flu vaccines in development.\n\nAlthough the record-speed development of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic was a chief accomplishment of Trump’s first term, his second administration has withdrawn support for mRNA technology in infectious diseases. HHS canceled 22 projects worth about $500 million focused on mRNA vaccine development in August, claiming against evidence that “these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved millions of lives. The hope behind applying mRNA technology to seasonal flu vaccines is that it could improve how well they work, enable tailoring for geographic regions where different strains are circulating and lead to combinations with Covid-19 vaccines so people would need only one shot for protection against both viruses.\n\nWith currently approved technology, experts select flu strains for each fall’s seasonal vaccines during the preceding February. Hoge pointed out that mRNA vaccines can be manufactured much faster; for Covid-19 vaccines, he said, the design is decided in May or June, for shipping by August.\n\nChoosing the strains closer to the start of flu season could potentially lead to a better match with circulating viruses, “and better matching equals, usually, better protection,” Hoge said.\n\nModerna’s phase 3 study showed in results reported in June that the mRNA-based flu shot produced efficacy that was about 27% higher than Fluarix in adults 50 and older. A separate trial that assessed safety and immune response included the comparison with a high-dose flu vaccine for people 65 and older and showed superiority, Moderna said.\n\nImmune response is assessed in the laboratory by analyzing blood samples of people who’ve been vaccinated, while efficacy assessments typically involve seeing how well a vaccine protects against cases of the disease.\n\nModerna had been awaiting the start of the review of its flu shot before it moved its experimental combination flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine into the FDA review process, Hoge said. That’s now on hold as the company awaits a meeting and further guidance from the agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the combination vaccine is moving forward in other countries.\n\n“We do expect that our first approval will be … probably in Europe, and this year,” Hoge said. “So that’ll be a milestone event.”",
