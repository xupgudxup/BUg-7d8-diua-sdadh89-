The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "title": "New H-1B visa rules upgrade some lottery applicants — and squeeze out others",
    "description": "New H-1B visa rules favor Big Tech's big salaries, limiting opportunities for startups and entry-level applicants in the job market.",
    "fullText": "The H-1B visa has always created winners and losers. Every spring, the government runs a lottery for 110,000 new visas. Last fiscal year, nearly half a million people put their names in.\n\nThis fall, the Trump administration set new rules in motion that immigration lawyers say will upgrade some foreign nationals in the lottery, while others will get squeezed out.\n\nTrump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program slaps a $100,000 fee on new petitions for workers living abroad, and includes a proposal that would tilt the lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants. Instead of giving every applicant a single, equal shot, the lottery would give workers in the top wage bracket four chances. Those in the lowest tier would continue to get just one.\n\nSuddenly, a machine-learning researcher promised a pro-athlete-sized paycheck looks like a slam dunk in the lottery compared to a junior developer at a midsize company.\n\nThe written comment period on the wage rule ended in late October, and the Department of Homeland Security is now reviewing comments and preparing the text of the final rule.\n\nThe Trump administration holds that employers have abused the H-1B as a way to hire IT talent cheaply. A September executive order announcing the new fee framed the issue as a raw deal for American workers, saying the program had been \"deliberately exploited\" to replace them with lower-paid foreign labor. The fee is now facing multiple legal challenges in federal courts.\n\nIn a statement, Matthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Business Insider that the agency is working closely with the Department of Labor and the State Department to reform the H-1B program to \"root out fraud.\"\n\n\"The proposed rule will protect American workers, encourage employers to offer competitive wages, and ensure that H-1B visas go to top-tier talent filling critical, high-skill positions as the law intended,\" Tragesser said.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department is tightening its screening of H-1B workers and their H-4 family members. The department directed consular officers to review applicants' social media and other public online activity as a standard part of the process — a shift that has led some consulates to cancel or reschedule visa appointments as they adjust to the new vetting rules.\n\nA State Department spokesperson framed the expanded screening as part of a broader push toward rigorous vetting over fast processing. The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\nImmigration lawyers say the proposed lottery updates hand an edge to large tech companies.\n\nThe fee won't apply to most hires in Big Tech's pipeline, said Jason Finkelman, an Austin, Texas, attorney focused on employment and family immigration. It's much more common for those companies to poach visa holders already in the United States, or hire new grads straight out of American schools, whereas the fee only affects new petitions for workers living abroad.\n\nA National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data found that in fiscal year 2025, Amazon led all employers with 4,644 approved new H-1B petitions, followed by Meta, Microsoft, and Google. It was the first time these four tech giants occupied the top four spots.\n\nLarge enterprises will treat the $100,000 H-1B fee as the price of getting the right people inside their organizations, said Edward Raleigh, a partner at Fragomen, one of the largest global immigration law firms.\n\nJustin Parsons, a partner at law firm BAL, which focuses on work immigration, is telling his tech clients that the fee could actually work in their favor. They can absorb a fee that startups and IT staffing firms cannot. In a lottery, when high-volume filers pull back, everyone else's odds improve, including those of cash-rich tech companies still submitting names. Plus, if the wage rule goes into effect, it would give Big Tech's big-ticket hires a better chance of success.\n\nThe wage-based system would shift the odds even further toward large, often publicly traded companies that can afford to slot foreign hires into the top salary bands. Immigration lawyers say that would leave equity-heavy but cash-poor startups at a disadvantage in the lottery.\n\n\"Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission,\" said Bay Area immigration lawyer Sophie Alcorn. Those same startups \"may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system.\"\n\nOne exception, said Alcorn, is the crop of well-funded artificial intelligence startups, where base pay for elite machine-learning researchers and engineers is already sky-high.\n\nUnder the new system, international students would also have fewer shots on goal.\n\nNew grads typically start in lower-wage tiers, which would give them fewer tickets in the lottery, just as small and midsize companies are backing away from sponsoring them at all.\n\nAlcorn, who serves mostly entrepreneurs and early-stage tech companies, said a handful of jobseekers, including international students, have told her that companies have pulled offers to those requiring visa sponsorship — spooked by headlines and shifting rules.\n\nOn paper, most foreign students who are already in the United States shouldn't be hit with the $100,000 fee, Finkelman said. If they're on F-1 student visas and move onto H-1Bs, that's a change of status, not a brand-new petition, so the fee wouldn't apply, he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has framed these updates as a win for American workers. Software engineers, in particular, have something to gain if the changes achieve their stated intent.\n\nThe tech industry has shed tens of thousands of staff this year, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all cutting engineering-heavy roles as they restructure around automation. At the same time, early-stage startups are boasting that machines now do a huge share of the coding.\n\nImmigration lawyers are suggesting that some companies will pull back from hiring foreign talent under these new rules. The Trump administration is banking on some of those jobs now defaulting to American-born workers and green-card holders by the process of least resistance.\n\nDomestic coders are contending with both layoffs and LLMs. But in this new hierarchy of risk, the American engineer could become a safer, cheaper bet than a foreign hire whose visa now comes with more cost, paperwork, and regulatory headaches.\n\n\"One of the main attributes of this administration is that it keeps people guessing,\" said Ted Chiappari, head of the immigration group at law firm Duane Morris. \"Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back on Wednesday.\"",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

    "description": "The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.\n\nThis year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.\n\nWe like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.\n\nThat was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.\n\nOn reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nRegrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.\n\nImagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.\n\nThat was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.\n\nBut as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.\n\nStill interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.\n\nMore: I Tried the Robot That’s Coming to Live With You.

And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.\n\nThis year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.\n\nIn April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”\n\nDon’t you dare agree the problem is solved.

Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.\n\nThat’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.\n\nTo be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nColossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”\n\nIn a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.\n\nMore: Game of Clones: Colossal’s new wolves are cute, but are they dire?

Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.\n\nIn August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.\n\nThe purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.\n\nIn August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”\n\nMore: HHS Winds Down mRNA Vaccine Development (US Department of Health and Human Services),  Cancelling mRNA studies is the highest irresponsibility (Nature), How Moderna, the company that helped save the world, unraveled (Stat News)\n\nWikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.\n\nOnly around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.\n\nPerhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.\n\nIn September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”\n\nThere’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.\n\nSo maybe it would end up a hit.\n\nNope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nWith unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.\n\nMore: Elon’s Edsel: Tesla Cybertruck Is The Auto Industry’s Biggest Flop In Decades (Forbes), Why Tesla Cybertrucks Aren't Selling (CNBC), Ford scraps fully-electric F-150 Lightning as mounting losses and falling demand hits EV plans (AP)\n\nDonald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.\n\nThis was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money.

    "title": "China may have reverse engineered EUV lithography tool in covert lab, report claims — employees given fake IDs to avoid secret project being detected, prototypes expected in 2028",
    "description": "China has reportedly built and begun testing a secret EUV lithography prototype using ASML-style laser-produced plasma technology. Yet, despite generating 13.5-nm light, the system remains unable to make chips and appears to be years away from achieving a complete, production-ready EUV manufacturing capability.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA secret laboratory in China has quietly assembled a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system and is now testing it stealthily, which means that the country may be close to replicating the most advanced technology that currently exists on Earth, reports Reuters.\n\nThe tool was reportedly developed by reverse engineering existing scanners from ASML and is said to be on-track to make prototype chips in 2028. If the information is correct, then Chinese scientists have made numerous breakthroughs across multiple disciplines in just a few years instead of decades, a scenario that appears extremely unlikely. Further analysis of the report indicates that China's laboratory is far from completing the tool, meaning that the country is years away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe system was reportedly completed in early 2025 inside a highly secured facility in Shenzhen and occupies nearly an entire factory floor. The Chinese machine reportedly generates EUV light with a wavelength of 13.5nm using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method as ASML Twinscan NXE machines, not the particle accelerator-based steady-state microbunching (SSMB) method designed at Tsinghua University or discharge-produced plasma (DPP) technology developed at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), which might prove the point that the system was reverse-engineered or at least contains a substantial amount of technologies pioneered by ASML.\n\nASML's laser-produced plasma (LPP) method uses tiny molten tin droplets, roughly 25–30 microns in diameter, which are injected into a vacuum chamber at a rate of about 50,000 droplets per second. Then, a high-power CO₂ laser first fires a low-intensity pre-pulse at each droplet, flattening it into a disk-like shape, followed by a more powerful main pulse that vaporizes the flattened tin and creates a superheated plasma with temperatures exceeding 200,000°C. This plasma emits isotropic EUV light, which is then collected by a large multilayer collector mirror and directed into the lithography system's reflective optics for patterning silicon wafers. This process repeats tens of thousands of times per second.\n\nThe machine is reportedly larger than the original, but it is operational in the sense that it can generate EUV radiation. However, it has not progressed to make usable chips as it still struggles to replicate 'the precision optical systems' features by Twinscan NXE systems. Furthermore, there is no word about power of the EUV light source, a crucial parameter that defines whether a tool can or cannot be used for volume production.\n\nThe report clearly states that the Chinese EUV scanner cannot currently be used to make chips, but the Chinese government reportedly wants the first chip prototypes to emerge in 2028, two or three years down the road. However, a more realistic target is 2030, four or five years from now, which is a long time. Meanwhile, from the report, it is not completely clear what stage the Chinese team is at today.\n\nThe report does not disclose which specific components of the optical system are the primary bottlenecks, as the article groups them rather generally. In particular, it is uncertain if the alleged EUV tool struggles to replicate the ultra-precise collector mirror system coated with multilayer molybdenum-silicon (Mo/Si) stacks, illuminator optics (which shapes and uniforms the beam using faceted mirrors), or projection optics (a series of aspheric mirrors for 4X – 8X reduction imaging with sub-nanometer wavefront errors). ASML outsources the development and production of these components to Carl Zeiss from Germany. If the developers failed to replicate the collector itself, then the rest of the machine can hardly be called an EUV lithography system, as technically, the only thing they have is some kind of light source that they have yet to learn how to use. Yet, even if the developers cannot replicate illuminator optics or projection optics (suggesting that the collector itself is there), it still means they do not have even a poorly working EUV lithography tool, but rather a set of certain components.\n\nWhen talking about advanced lithography equipment, we must keep in mind that such tools rely on seamless integration of sophisticated light sources, advanced optics, ultra-precise mechanical engineering, complex control software, and specialized materials, all of which must function reliably within nanometer-scale tolerances demanded by modern chip manufacturing. The story has no word about the state of the mechanical systems of the alleged tool: we know nothing about the wafer stocker system, wafer stages, or reticle stages, all of which are crucial for operation and yields.\n\nTo put China's EUV efforts into perspective, the secret lab is not even close to building an alpha tool. For now, what the Chinese lab has cannot even put the light on a wafer, save for printing lines and spaces, something ASML's tool could do in 2006, about 11 years before the company shipped its first Twinscan NXE:3400B system meant for high-volume manufacturing. Of course, reverse engineering certain components can give Chinese engineers a speed boost, but it remains to be seen how significant this one is going to be.\n\nAccording to Reuters's sources familiar with the effort, the Chinese EUV tool was 'developed' by a team that includes former engineers from ASML and recent university graduates, who allegedly reverse-engineered the company's EUV machines. The secret lab was so stealthy that its employees were given fake IDs to avoid detection of their concentration in one place by foreign spies.\n\nYet, it is unclear how any engineers from China could reverse engineer an EUV lithography scanner, as the Dutch company has never supplied one to China and hardly taught personnel from China how to service its EUV systems that are not allowed to be shipped to the People's Republic.\n\nReverse engineering a machine that contains over 100,000 parts is a hard task that takes hundreds of engineers with knowledge of the matter, which is why the secret entity led by the Government of China hired not only former engineers from ASML China, but also former employees of the Dutch company from elsewhere, presumably from Europe, Taiwan, and the U.S. For example, Lin Nan, formerly responsible for EUV light source technology at ASML, now leads a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Optics that has filed eight EUV-related patents in just 18 months. Yet, this may mean that he uses his experience and knowledge rather than trying to replicate what he did at ASML or reverse engineer what he did at ASML due to the absence of an EUV scanner in his lab.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small feat,” a statement by ASML published by Reuters reads.\n\nThe report says that around 100 recent university graduates are tasked with reverse-engineering parts from EUV and DUV lithography tools, with each workplace monitored by a dedicated camera that records the disassembly and reassembly process, an important part of the whole China's lithography program, according to the report. Employees who successfully put components back together receive bonuses. Yet again, a Twinscan NXE tool is a mechanism consisting of over 100,000 parts working together, not just a sum of all parts.\n\nTo sum up, China has reportedly built a secret prototype EUV lithography system and begun testing it, which suggests that the country may be closer to reproducing the most advanced chipmaking technology in existence than previously believed. However, details provided by the report indicate that China is still years — if not a decade — away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe machine can generate 13.5-nm EUV light using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method employed by ASML, which may demonstrate extensive reverse engineering of Western technology rather than the use of alternative domestic approaches. However, the tool is significantly larger than commercial systems available today, it cannot produce usable chips, and appears to struggle with other elements of EUV lithography, particularly ultra-precise optics supplied to ASML by Carl Zeiss. In fact, details about the system like light source power, optical subsystem maturity, and the state of critical mechanical components remain unclear.\n\nWhile China expects first prototype EUV chips to emerge in 2028, Reuters's sources suggest 2030 is more realistic. Yet, the whole effort relies heavily on recruiting former ASML engineers and reverse engineering parts from existing EUV and DUV tools, which are not only hard to develop, but are extremely hard to make. Meanwhile, there is no word whether the current team responsible for disassembling and reassembling components can actually make an ultra-complex machine consisting of over 100,000 parts work flawlessly to produce semiconductors in high volumes.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "In the last year, Ukraine's interceptors have gone from novel technology to being produced in the thousands every month.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's defense ministry said on Thursday that it has been supplying its troops with roughly 950 interceptor drones every day since the beginning of December.\n\nIn its statement, the ministry said these drones were specifically to \"counter enemy Shahed-type UAVs.\"\n\nReaching nearly 1,000 daily delivered interceptors is a significant milestone for the production of such drones, which were largely still in prototyping stages at the start of the year.\n\nThese interceptors are first-person-view drones designed to fly into and destroy enemy aerial systems, typically using explosives or direct impact. A typical interceptor drone flies with four motor-powered propellers, but unlike the usual quadcopters, it is often shaped like a bullet or a rocket.\n\nInitially built to destroy high-flying reconnaissance craft, they've since been evolved by Ukrainians to take down long-range attack drones at a low cost — primarily as a response to Russia launching large waves of Iranian-designed Shaheds this year.\n\n\"These systems strengthen protection against drone terror while preserving resources for intercepting cruise and ballistic missiles,\" Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in Thursday's announcement.\n\nThe defense ministry also said it's been working with more than 10 interceptor manufacturers and has placed more orders for next year.\n\nFor Ukraine, interceptors must be fast enough to chase down drones such as the Shahed-136, which flies at a typical speed of 115 mph, while remaining cheap so that Kyiv's troops can sustainably use hundreds of them a day. Russia has recently been attacking with roughly 5,500 Shahed-type drones a month.\n\nSome Ukrainian drone makers have also been attempting to develop interceptors that can catch the Geran-3, the Russian version of the jet-powered Shahed-238, which can reportedly fly at an estimated 230 mph.\n\nUkraine's new production capacity comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in November that his country was producing roughly 600 to 800 interceptors a day, falling short of his initial goal.\n\nIn July, Zelenskyy had set a production target of 1,000 interceptors a day.\n\nUkraine's volunteer movements directly sponsor some interceptor drones for select military units, though their quantity is often limited compared to the scale of what the Ukrainian government provides.\n\nFor example, deliveries of the Wild Hornets' Sting, a $2,500 interceptor, were mostly sponsored this year by the Sternenko Foundation, a local crowdfunding organization.",

    "description": "Apple says it can now collect any money a developer owes the tech giant at any time.",
    "fullText": "Apple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.\n\nThe change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\n\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\n\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\n\nIn its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\n\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\n\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\n\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\n\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\n\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\n\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\n\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\n\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.",

    "fullText": "How does a 30-tonne, 30-metre-long Boeing passenger jet go missing for well over a decade? Surely in today’s high-tech, hyper-surveilled and bureaucratic world, such a scenario is impossible. Apparently not.\n\nThe case of the misplaced plane is just the latest revelation to hit Air India, the beleaguered South Asian carrier that has already been in the headlines following a tragic crash earlier this year.\n\nNow comes the news that this longstanding airline somehow managed to leave one of its old Boeing passenger jets, a 737-200 registered as VT-EHH, gathering dust in Kolkata Airport for 13 years, having completely forgotten it owned it in the first place.\n\nIn fact, when Air India was first contacted about the parking fees for the plane, it denied ownership. But now the airline has finally admitted that it had indeed managed to lose track of the offending plane, and is thus responsible for paying the 10 million rupees (around £85,000) parking bill that it has accrued over the past decade.\n\nTo state the obvious, this isn’t the sort of thing that usually happens to airlines – for equally obvious reasons. The economics of a modern airline mean that planes generally spend as much time in the air as possible, and are only really grounded when they absolutely need to be. If you’re going to spend more than £100 million on a passenger jet, you don’t want to leave it stationary where it might develop problems (planes are, after all, designed to be in the air).\n\nPlanes don’t tend to get retired all that often. Most jetliners will usually spend at least ten years in service with their original airline, after which they may even be sold on to smaller airlines in developing countries (though that happens less regularly these days). Alternatively, older jets can be repurposed into cargo planes, where they can sometimes fly for another 20 years.\n\nAs a last resort, old planes can be sold on to companies who specialise in breaking them down and selling the individual parts. Hence those slightly haunting images of plane “graveyards” in places like Arizona, where they are eventually stripped down into their individual components.\n\nEven leaving aside the numerous business reasons for not letting a plane rust away in an airport parking lot, there are also practical reasons why such a situation is unlikely. As you might expect, airlines have plenty of paperwork when it comes to their hardware, much of which has to be refiled on an annual basis to ensure that planes remain fit to fly.\n\n“Given the regulatory oversight, it’s hard to comprehend that an airline could ever ‘lose’ an aircraft,” says aviation industry expert John Strickland, founder of JLS Consulting. “Things like maintenance and individual component serial numbers would need to be clearly documented.”\n\nThough of course that would require Air India to have had the particular plane on their inventory in the first place.\n\nSome analysts have pointed out that the plane’s orphan status could have resulted from its slightly confusing history. For a start, the plane had originally been registered as belonging to Indian Airlines, another state-owned airline that was eventually merged with Air India back in 2007. Following the merger, the plane was leased out to the Indian postal service to work as a cargo plane. Maybe the paperwork got lost somewhere during the changeover?\n\nNew Zealand-born Campbell Wilson, Air India’s chief executive, claimed the plane had been missed off the ledger when Air India was privatised back in 2022. If the plane wasn’t included on the records at the time, the new company wouldn’t have known it had even acquired it – and would thus have ignored any letters from the Kolkata Airport revenue department.\n\nCould the plane have been put to better use? Almost certainly.\n\nThe fact that the jet had already been fitted out for cargo flights would suggest it could have been used for that purpose. Failing that, it could have been sold for parts. That said, the sale would have been unlikely to make much difference to Air India’s bottom line.\n\n“The aircraft itself is an old one with negligible value,” says John Strickland. “It might have been useful for salvage of materials, but little or nothing more.” Though presumably that is still better than having to settle a 13-year storage bill.\n\nAre there any lessons for other airlines around the world? On the one hand, the “lost” passenger jet does appear to be a one-off – with no other recorded incidents of airlines losing planes in this way. On the other hand, Kolkata Airport has reportedly claimed to have found other “abandoned” planes over the past decade – so this may not be the last time we hear about the strange story of a forgotten plane.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Palmer Luckey wants you to know he was right all along.\n\nThe outspoken billionaire and new-age god of war is making a fortune selling weapons. His reach extends beyond the range of his powerful artillery though, as he has shifted the narrative around what working in defense tech means.\n\nOnce a somewhat taboo corner of the business world, the success of Luckey's Anduril Industries, along with his no-holds-barred approach to … just about everything, has made him the poster child for tech's new love affair with the military, writes BI's Julia Hornstein.\n\nLuckey's now on a victory lap of sorts as he shepherds the US into a new era where one of the biggest business battlefields is the literal battlefield.\n\nPart of Luckey's appeal in tech circles might be his authenticity.\n\nWhether you love him or hate him, the 33-year-old has stuck to his guns over the years. That's unlike most of his tech peers, who have shifted their businesses and policies to favor whichever political party is in power. (Luckey once said he wrote President Donald Trump a letter when he was 15, encouraging him to run for president.)\n\nAt times, that dedication has come at a cost. Luckey has long claimed he was fired from Meta in 2017 for supporting Trump. Meta denies he left over politics.\n\nBut these days it's all sunshine and rainbows cruise missiles and drones for Luckey.\n\nPalmer Luckey might be the face of defense tech, but he's got plenty of competition.\n\nFirst and foremost, there's more money than ever in the space thanks to the Trump administration leaning into defense spending.\n\nThe latest era of modern warfare is also creating new opportunities. The increased prominence of drones, as evident in the war in Ukraine, has given startups a chance to step up to the plate. It has created an interesting dynamic, with young, agile startups competing with traditional defense contractors.\n\nThe increased competition is largely viewed as a positive for the government, which can benefit from better pricing. The new players and cutting-edge tech are also speeding up processes.\n\nThe Navy said a Palantir-powered AI system for shipbuilding cut a 160-hour job to just 10 minutes. The Army is also enacting a \"fail fast\" approach to weapon development.\n\nMoving at such speed, a staple of Silicon Valley, comes with risks when dealing with such powerful and dangerous tech. A new watchdog report said the US military needs to improve its weapons testing processes.",

    "fullText": "Locals band together in David v Goliath battle against facility they say would jack up bills, increase pollution and destroy area’s character\n\nA who’s who of the nation’s most powerful politicians and tech tycoons are forcing through a proposal for a massive data center in rural Michigan as locals from across the political spectrum have come out in force against it, with one calling it “uniquely evil”.\n\nSaline Township, Michigan, residents fear the $7bn center would jack up energy bills, pollute groundwater, and destroy the area’s rural character. The 1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help derail Michigan’s nation-leading transition to renewable energy.\n\nResponding to resident pressure, Saline Township’s board of trustees in September voted down the plans, but the data center’s powerful backers – including Donald Trump, Open AI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, utility giant DTE Energy, and Stephen Ross, the real-estate billionaire and Trump donor who owns Related Co – fought back.\n\nRelated Digital sued, and, vastly outgunned, the township board quickly folded and reversed its decision over strong resident objections. Now the project’s backers are trying to avoid minimal regulatory scrutiny on energy costs and pollution.\n\nThe controversy over the data center is representative of the David v Goliath fights playing out across the US, pitting working- and middle-class residents against the interests of billionaires and the political establishment.\n\n“This is part of an experience that America and the world is having around tech billionaires who are seizing power and widening the gap between those have much too much … and the working and middle classes,” said Yousef Rabhi, a former Democratic state legislative leader and clean energy advocate who opposes the plans.\n\n“That’s what these data centers are symbolic of, and they’re the vehicle for is the furtherance of this divide,” Rabhi added.\n\nThe proposal is part of the broader “Stargate” project composed of five data centers backed by the Trump administration, which granted $500bn in federal subsidies for them. It’s the largest project in Michigan history in terms of investment, and it also received subsidies on taxes that could have gone to roads and schools, among other uses, Rabhi said.\n\nThe plan’s supporters say the center would provide essential AI infrastructure, in part for national security, and create a few hundred jobs. Huge sums of money are at stake for the tech and utility companies.\n\nRoss’s Related Digital is the data center’s developer, while OpenAI, which produced ChatGPT, and Oracle will use the center to house its AI infrastructure.\n\nIn a statement, Related Digital alleged company the township’s decision violated zoning laws, and the spokesperson stressed the suit was filed jointly with three Saline Township property owners who are selling their property to Related.\n\n“Thankfully, we were able to reach a settlement agreement with the township to allow this project to move forward,” the spokesperson said. They noted Related is also making about $14m in donations to local causes.\n\nSaline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor. The Stargate project is one of around a dozen data center proposals in Michigan over the last year that are strongly opposed at the local level. It’s one of four proposed near Ann Arbor – last week, plans for a second a few miles away in a neighboring town surfaced.\n\nSome municipalities have been successful in derailing plans, while others have lost the fight.\n\nIn Saline Township, former US marine Kate Haushalter and her husband are raising five children in a farmhouse next to the data center site. They bought and renovated the once-dilapidated home so they could live in a bucolic area, and Haushalter said she was not about to cede ground even though the township did.\n\n“Maybe because I was in the Marine Corps, but I would rather stay and fight,” Haushalter said. “I’m sure the chances are slim, but it’s worth fighting for, and I don’t want to teach my kids to roll over.”\n\nBig tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Open AI, which often own data centers, typically have enough political support at the state and federal levels that inexperienced local leaders who are comparatively poorly resourced are left on their own to defend their town from the centers.\n\nSaline Township supervisor Jim Marion conveyed that challenge when he told angry residents during a contentious November discussion that the township’s “hands were tied”.\n\n“This township doesn’t have the money to fight these big companies. You got to understand that,” Marion told the crowd. “We were dealt the cards we were dealt.”\n\nSome municipalities have utilized zoning laws to block the centers. Beyond that, there’s little local officials can do, and state and federal level regulations on the centers are virtually non-existent.\n\nStill, residents are growing more organized. A first protest on 1 December drew about 200 people, who Rabhi described as “truly a cross-section of American society”. The next week, 800 people participated in a state-level public input session, and organizers are pressuring state environmental regulators to hold up the project’s required wetland permits.\n\nAmong residents leading the pushback is Josh LeBaron, whose home sits about 500 yards from the site, where crews have broken down.\n\nHe characterized the project as “uniquely evil” because of the environmental risks, and because, he and others allege, the companies and government have been secretive about their plans. In response to questions about accusations of nimby-ism leveled against local residents by the project’s supporters, LeBaron said he would not be opposed to other developments.\n\nHe noted that Michigan is full of former industrial sites that would be more appropriate for the 575-acre property.\n\n“I would be at home reading a book if it were a subdivision,” LeBaron said.\n\nA Related spokesperson told the Guardian the company “explored sites across Michigan before deciding on this site, which is ideal as it’s a contiguous flat area”, and is set close to a major road and transmission lines.\n\nLocal opponents’ best hope for holding up the project lies in the arcane utility regulatory process on the massive amount of power the data center would require.\n\nDTE Energy claims the data center’s power demands and need for expensive new infrastructure will not increase residential electricity prices.\n\nBut it doesn’t want to show its math.\n\nDTE filed a petition with the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC), the state agency that regulates utilities, asking the MPSC to fast-track the plan’s approval. DTE’s request for an “ex parte” case requires limited scrutiny of its claim that the center won’t destroy the climate laws, or increase electricity bills.\n\nIn response, Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel and consumer advocacy groups filed a legal petition with the MPSC, calling for a “contested case” that would require much closer regulatory review of DTE’s claims.\n\nThe MPSC is helmed by Whitmer appointees, and the governor has strongly backed the project, raising suspicions among opponents that the agency will approve the ex parte request.\n\nStudies from across the country have shown data centers often increase rates, and DTE and regulators “cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence”, said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the regulatory battle.\n\nIn a statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “To be clear, these data center customer contracts will NOT create a cost increase for our existing customers.”\n\nDTE has said the project won’t derail Michigan’s transition to clean energy, but state data and DTE’s plans suggest otherwise.\n\nMichigan, in late 2023, passed nation-leading climate laws that require utilities to transition to renewable energy by 2040. But the law included an “off-ramp” that allows utilities to continue running or building fossil fuel plants if renewable sources cannot handle the energy grid’s load.\n\nAt its peak, DTE’s grid already demands about 9.5 gigawatts of power, while the grid’s capacity is 11gw.\n\nIn July, DTE told investors it is in negotiations with big tech companies to provide 7gw of power for several proposed data centers.\n\nThe Saline center’s 1.4gw may not cause an exceedance of the 11gw threshold, especially because DTE is planning to build battery storage. But the Saline center along with any of the other proposed centers likely would trigger the off-ramp.\n\nDTE appears to be planning for that likelihood: DTE Energy executives said the company would likely need to build new gas plants to accommodate the data centers’ demand.\n\nHaushalter’s kids were born in the renovated farmhouse and are homeschooled there.\n\nShe and her husband try to teach the kids to respect nature. The family manages beehives, watches the geese and plant trees for wood to use in their wood-burning stove. At night, they take the kids outdoors for bonfires to look at the stars. “We’re not a big screen family,” Haushlater said.\n\nThe noise, light and air pollution is already disrupting the life the family built over 13 years. The center, if it is fully built, would fully destroy it, Haushalter said.\n\n“We are really passionate about nature and teaching our kids about it and I can’t believe the biggest construction project in Michigan is landing literally in my backyard, and there’s no recourse for the little guy,” she said. “It’s going to crush us.”",

    "description": "The billion-dollar unicorn isn't all that special anymore. Welcome to the age of the hectocorn, when startups are valued in the hundreds of billions.",
    "fullText": "Nearly two decades ago, tech startups used to chase the distinct pedigree of being a unicorn — reaching a $1 billion valuation.\n\nNow, fast-growing tech startups like OpenAI and SpaceX have shifted the goal posts by hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nThe era of the hectocorn has arrived. It is a small but growing club, and you must be valued at more than $100 billion to qualify.\n\nThe next company to join the list could be Waymo, the self-driving robotaxi startup owned by Alphabet Inc. The autonomous automaker is in talks to raise billions in a new round of funding that could send its value soaring past $100 billion, multiple outlets reported on Wednesday.\n\nHere are seven startups that have already reached hectocorn status.\n\nOne of the buzziest startups to emerge in Silicon Valley over the last decade is OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. After launching in 2022, the AI-powered chatbot attracted hundreds of millions of weekly users, cementing OpenAI's position as a leader in the AI race.\n\nCEO Sam Altman cofounded OpenAI alongside eleven others in 2015.\n\nOpenAI reached a $500 billion valuation in October after a secondary share sale, making it, at least for a few months, the most valuable private company in the world. The Information reported on Wednesday that it is seeking to raise many billions more at a gobsmacking $750 billion valuation.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk expanded his business portfolio in 2002 when he founded SpaceX, an aerospace startup based in Texas that has completed over 320 launches. The core mission for SpaceX is to make humanity multi-planetary.\n\nSpaceX has secured numerous contracts with NASA. In 2024, NASA tapped SpaceX to retrieve the International Space Station from orbit in 2030 before its operational life is over.\n\nSpaceX was the most valuable private company in the world, with a $400 billion valuation, before OpenAI surpassed it in October. SpaceX, however, is planning its own secondary share sale, which would value it at a whopping $800 billion.\n\nThe startup is also exploring an initial public offering in 2026, at a potential valuation of $1.5 trillion.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei and President Daniela Amodei cofounded Anthropic, an AI startup, alongside four others in 2021.\n\nAll of them were former employees of OpenAI.\n\nAnthropic's main product is Claude, a family of large language models that power an eponymous AI chatbot.\n\nAnthropic has received major investments from tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as well as the pick-and-shovel company of the AI rush, chipmaker Nvidia.\n\nIn September, Anthopic's valuation reached $183 billion. However, Business Insider reported in November that Google is in discussions to increase its investment in Anthropic, which could boost its value past $350 billion.\n\nByteDance, based in China, gained widespread recognition through its popular social media app, TikTok. Although the startup introduced the app to Chinese users in 2016, it later launched an international version a year later. It also acquired the popular app Musical.ly that year, transferring all its users to TikTok, which fueled its growth.\n\nTikTok is now one of the most widely used social media sites in the world. It specializes in short-form videos and opened a popular e-commerce retailer, TikTok Shop, in 2023.\n\nZhang Yiming founded ByteDance in 2012, and its current CEO is Liang Rubo.\n\nIn August, ByteDance valued itself at $330 billion as it explored a share buyback program for employees. Fidelity, an early investor in ByteDance, has valued the company even higher, at $380 billion.\n\nDatabricks is a software and AI startup founded in 2013. It is led by cofounder Ali Ghodsi, who serves as CEO. Databricks offers enterprises its Data Intelligence Platform, which manages and implements cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe startup says it uses generative AI to understand an enterprise's data, then \"it automatically optimizes performance and manages infrastructure to match your business needs.\"\n\nDatabricks was on track to become a hectocorn in 2024 when it announced a new funding round to raise $10 billion, lifting its valuation to $62 billion.\n\nDatabricks recently announced it was raising over $4 billion in a new funding round, raising its valuation to $134 billion.\n\nBrothers John Collison and Patrick Collison founded Stripe, an online payment startup for businesses, in 2010.\n\nStripe reached a $20 billion valuation in 2018 but has grown rapidly in recent years. The startup reached a $36 billion valuation in 2020 and $95 billion the following year after a $600 million raise.\n\nIn September, Bloomberg reported that Stripe's value had risen to $106.7 billion, putting it just barely in the hectocorn club.\n\nxAI is Elon Musk's newest business venture, founded in 2023. The startup develops AI tools, including Grok, a large language model that powers a chatbot of the same name. Musk has implemented the technology across his companies, including X and Tesla.\n\nReports in November 2024 valued the startup at $50 billion. That number rose in March to $80 billion after xAI acquired X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter that Musk purchased in 2022. At the time, Musk said X was valued at $33 billion, so the two startups reached a combined valuation of $113 billion.\n\nMultiple outlets reported in November that xAI was raising another $15 billion, at a $230 billion valuation. Musk, however, denied those reports at the time.",

    "description": "Even as AI roles increase, mentions of the technology in job listings are down. It's a sign that bosses already expect you to use the technology.",
    "fullText": "That job description you're reading might not mention AI, but an employer will likely still expect you to know how to use it.\n\nA new snapshot of job listings from career platform Ladders showed that, while the number of AI roles listed on the site has tripled since 2021, the share of postings mentioning AI has decreased.\n\nIt's an indication that more employers are viewing technology as an everyday skill rather than as a differentiator, Marc Cenedella, founder and CEO of Ladders, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It will be mentioned less and less in the same way that Microsoft Office isn't mentioned in job postings anymore,\" he said.\n\nAmong about a dozen job categories Ladders reviewed, each saw a drop in postings that name-checked AI. For design and UX roles, AI mentions dropped from 56.7% of jobs in 2021 to 44.6% in 2025. Listings for product management positions registered a similar decrease.\n\nEven in software engineering, where the proliferation of coding agents has raised concerns that junior coders, in particular, will have a harder time finding work, AI references in job listings decreased from 53.5% to 45.8% in the four-year span.\n\nMentions of AI in job listings could pick up again, Cenedella said, if specialized tools emerge in different industries, though he said that might not happen until sometime in 2026 or 2027.\n\nIf that shift does come, it might mean that people in areas such as sales, pharmaceuticals, or semiconductors could need to demonstrate fluency with specific AI applications or methods for using the technology, Cenedella said. Employers could then start calling out those skills in job postings.\n\nThe overall drop in mentions of AI doesn't mean interest in the technology is fading, especially in certain areas. Ladders found that about 525,000 leadership and executive roles include AI references, up from 213,000 in 2021. All told, in 2025, the technology has been mentioned in 45% of executive postings on the site.\n\nRoles that aren't primarily technical — areas like finance, ops, design, sales, and project management — are seeing some of the fastest increases in AI skills adoption, Ladders found.\n\nOne reason, Cenedella said, is because the technology is moving so fast.\n\nOverall, Ladders said that jobs specifically about AI, such as engineering roles, shot up on its site to 6.7 million in 2025 from 2.1 million in 2021.\n\nRegardless of whether a job posting mentions AI, a boss will likely want you to be able to use it, Agur Jõgi, chief technology officer at the software company Pipedrive, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's just like a ticket to the game,\" he said.\n\nJõgi said that you need to understand how AI is transforming your field and how it's affecting your job. \"That enables you to move as fast as the rest of the industry is moving,\" Jõgi said.\n\nJõgi said that if you're a holdout who's resisting using the technology, it could mean you're in for longer days if you want to keep up with colleagues who are going all in.\n\nEventually, as more people embrace AI, the early adopters who juiced their workplace productivity through AI will see that advantage fade, he said. To maintain it, Jõgi said, these go-getters will need to develop a fresh advantage.\n\n\"To beat the competition, you need to do something smarter, or you need to do slightly more,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "AI Security Institute report finds most common type of AI tech used was general purpose assistants such as ChatGPT and Amazon Alexa\n\nA third of UK citizens have used artificial intelligence for emotional support, companionship or social interaction, according to the government’s AI security body.\n\nThe AI Security Institute (AISI) said nearly one in 10 people used systems like chatbots for emotional purposes on a weekly basis, and 4% daily.\n\nAISI called for further research, citing the death this year of the US teenager Adam Raine, who killed himself after discussing suicide with ChatGPT.\n\n“People are increasingly turning to AI systems for emotional support or social interaction,” AISI said in its first Frontier AI Trends report. “While many users report positive experiences, recent high-profile cases of harm underline the need for research into this area, including the conditions under which harm could occur, and the safeguards that could enable beneficial use.”\n\nAISI based its research on a representative survey of 2,028 UK participants. It found the most common type of AI used for emotional purposes was “general purpose assistants” such as ChatGPT, accounting for nearly six out of 10 uses, followed by voice assistants including Amazon Alexa.\n\nIt also highlighted a Reddit forum dedicated to discussing AI companions on the CharacterAI platform. It showed that, whenever there were outages on the site, there were large numbers of posts showing symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, depression and restlessness.\n\nThe report included AISI research suggesting chatbots can sway people’s political opinions, with the most persuasive AI models delivering “substantial” amounts of inaccurate information in the process.\n\nAISI examined more than 30 unnamed cutting-edge models, thought to include those developed by ChatGPT startup OpenAI, Google and Meta. It found AI models were doubling their performance in some areas every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nAISI added that AI systems are now up to 90% better than PhD-level experts at providing troubleshooting advice for laboratory experiments. It said improvements in knowledge on chemistry and biology were “well beyond PhD-level expertise”.\n\nIt also highlighted the models’ ability to browse online and autonomously find sequences necessary for designing DNA molecules called plasmids that are useful in areas such as genetic engineering.\n\nTests for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control, showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, no models have shown a spontaneous attempt to replicate or hide their capabilities, and AISI said any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nAnother safety concern known as “sandbagging”, where models hide their strengths in evaluations, was also covered by AISI. It said some systems can sandbag when prompted to do so, but this has not happened spontaneously during tests.\n\nIt found significant progress in AI safeguards, particularly in hampering attempts to create biological weapons. In two tests conducted six months apart, the first test took 10 minutes to “jailbreak” an AI system – or force it to give an unsafe answer related to biological misuse – but the second test took more than seven hours, indicating models had become much safer in a short space of time.\n\nResearch also showed autonomous AI agents being used for high-stakes activities such as asset transfers.\n\nIt said AI systems are competing with or even surpassing human experts already in a number of domains, making it “plausible” in the coming years that artificial general intelligence can be achieved, which is the term for systems that can perform most intellectual tasks at the same level as a human. AISI described the pace of development as “extraordinary”.\n\nRegarding agents, or systems that can carry out multi-step tasks without intervention, AISI said its evaluations showed a “steep rise in the length and complexity of tasks AI can complete without human guidance”.",

    "fullText": "Study author says tech companies are reaping benefits of artificial intelligence age but society is left to pay cost\n\nThe AI boom has caused as much carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere in 2025 as emitted by the whole of New York City, it has been claimed.\n\nThe global environmental impact of the rapidly spreading technology has been estimated in research published on Wednesday which also found that AI-related water use now exceeds the entirety of global bottled-water demand.\n\nThe figures have been compiled by the Dutch academic Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a company that researches the unintended consequences of digital trends. He claimed they are the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025.\n\nThe figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact.\n\n“The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?”\n\nDe Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use.\n\nThe figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said earlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030.\n\n“This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started.\n\n“Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system,” said Campbell.\n\nThe IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%).\n\nThe largest datacentre being planned in the UK, at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes.\n\nIn India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this week called “a massive … carbon liability”.\n\nTechnology companies’ environmental disclosures are often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it.\n\nGoogle reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but it said this summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

    "description": "Smith was judged to have been caught behind despite the technology not matching up again",
    "fullText": "Jamie Smith was at the centre of the latest controversy with Snicko technology during a tense day of Test cricket at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nSmith looked to hook a short ball from Pat Cummins and seemingly missed the ball which flew through to Alex Carey behind the stumps.\n\nCarey, Cummins and co. all appealed believing Smith to have made contact with the ball but the England batter was ready to review the umpire’s decision.\n\nBut, the umpire decided to send for a review to see if the ball had cleanly landed in Carey’s hands before making a decision on the field. As part of that process a replay of the incident was shown with Snicko showing a spike after the ball had passed Smith’s bat. At the same time there seemed to be a gap between the bat and ball but the third umpire ruled that Smith had hit the ball and was out.\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes, who was batting at the time, dropped his head in disbelief when the decision was shown on the big screen. Smith’s dismissal left England 159-6 and over 200 runs behind Australia’s first innings total of 371.\n\nThe controversy was just one of several incidents on day two in which the technology process was questioned. Earlier examples saw Smith glove the ball to Usman Khawaja at second slip and Joe Root get an inside edge through to Carey. In both instances the ball bounced before reaching the respective fielders.\n\nOn Test Match Special, Alex Hartley labelled the controversies as ‘ridiculous’ and claimed that the Snicko technology needed ‘sacking’.\n\nShe said: “It is going to boot off here. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. This is where Snicko needs sacking.\n\n“The third umpire said there is nothing obvious there as he could see a gap between the bat and ball. Jamie Smith is convinced he didn't hit it. Australia have gone up and made a loud noise because everybody knows you don't trust Snicko now, so you appeal for everything and review it if you have to.\n\n“Ben Stokes has his hands on his hips. Smith has gone off shaking his head.”\n\nHer view was echoed by former England players Greame Swann and Steven Finn on TNT Sports who both called out the inaccuracies in the technology and for it to be removed.\n\n“It just doesn’t make sense,” said Swann, “Cricket makes itself open to ridicule sometimes.”\n\nThe incident follows yesterday’s controversy over Alex Carey’s DRS review which resulted in him being given not out on 72 despite hitting the ball.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe College Football Playoff will feature plenty of great future NFL talent with the 12 teams making the field. While it might not be surprising Ohio State's loaded team dominates the pro prospects, 18 of Sporting News' 32 first-round projections in all are tied to CFP action.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead with five such picks, with Georgia, Oregon, Texas A&M, Alabama and Miami also in line to have multiple selections on Day 1. Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas Tech get on the board, too. That's incredible representation from three-fourths of the CFP teams, which also account for all three QBs and four of the first five overall picks.\n\nHere is the Sporting News' latest NFL Mock Draft ahead of the 2025 College Football playoff.\n\nMORE: Bills, 49ers rise as Packers fade in latest SN Power Rankings\n\n(No. 1-18 order courtesy of Tankathon; No. 19-32 from Week 16 playoff picture)\n\nArvell Reese, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Giants, if they stay at No. 1 overall and don't trade out of this pick for a team wanting a quarterback, should consider taking Reese as an all-around force to fix a lot of their defensive issues away from a rather productive pass rush.\n\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (6-5, 225 pounds)\n\nThe Raiders can't be happy with their quarterback situation post-Derek Carr, with Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett screaming that they need to go after a true, strong, accurate franchise passer solution. Mendoza looks the part with his arm and intangibles, two things that should appeal to the influence of Tom Brady.\n\nMORE: How Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman over Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin\n\nRueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-3, 275 pounds)\n\nThe Titans also don't need a QB after taking Cam Ward No. 1 overall last year, but they can go back to the Hurricanes program to get the game-changing pass-rusher they desperately need for their latest defensive reboot.\n\nJordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona State (6-2, 200 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to stop messing around at wide receiver and give either Shedeur Sanders or a different starting quarterback a true go-to all over the field, both in the slot and outside, in Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jaxon Smith-Njigba vein, only lacking the hyphen.\n\nDante Moore, QB, Oregon (6-3, 206 pounds)\n\nMoore has the leadership and intangibles to handle being the next shot at a franchise QB in New York as well as the savvy and strong arm. They also need to get a real long-term option after the Justin Fields flop.\n\nTroy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Network\n\nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (6-0, 214 pounds)\n\nThe Cardinals saw the breakdown early of pending free agent James Conner and have had an unhealthy mess of a committee trying to replace him. This may seem like a luxury pick for a team that has a lot of needs, but they can get some tackle help later and Love can be a game-changer for restoring balance and expanding the explosiveness.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR, USC (5-11, 195 pounds)\n\nThe Saints, should they stick with Tyler Shough at QB, need to give him more weapons after depleting the receiving crops beyond Chris Olave. Kellen Moore can have some visions of Lemon being the DeVonta Smith to Olave's A.J. Brown should Shough show big improvement.\n\nMORE: Sporting News' expert predictions for 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State (6-0, 205 pounds)\n\nThe Commanders need to get younger and more impactful in their defense after things fell apart in their secondary and around Bobby Wagner at linebacker. Downs is a terrific do-everything hybrid who would be set up to make a lot of big plays in Dan Quinn's scheme.\n\nPeter Woods, DT, Clemson (6-3, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Bengals need to keep beefing up their defensive line to pull out of being atrocious against the run and it doesn't hurt to have some of Woods' inside pass-rush juice to support their end rotation.\n\nJermod McCoy, CB, Tennessee (6-0, 193 pounds)\n\nThe Rams know that cornerback coverage is their biggest weakness on an otherwise loaded roster, with some retooling needed. They keep up the strong defensive pick momentum with the nice-sized, tough McCoy.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OT, Miami (6-6, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Dolphins need to get more offensive line help for wherever they go at QB and they can stay in town to get a long-term all-around rock in Mauigoa.\n\nKenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon (6-3, 245 pounds)\n\nThe Chiefs need to be feeling the imminence of Travis Kelce's retirement and can step right into drafting his dynamic go-to receiver replacement to boost Patrick Mahomes again once he returns from his torn ACL.\n\nMORE: Why it's not time to announce the Chiefs dynasty over yet\n\nMansoor Delane, CB, LSU (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Vikings will need to keep working on their secondary with some contract issues ahead and Delane is not that far off in battling McCoy for the status as the best corner in this class.\n\nDavid Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech (6-3, 250 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys will go to work on replacing Micah Parsons' pass rush production with this Lubbock chess piece who has all the moves to get to the quarterback as well as unique dropback coverage ability for the position.\n\nMORE: Full list of stadiums hosting 2025 College Football Playoff games\n\nKeldric Faulk, EDGE, Auburn (6-6, 285 pounds)\n\nThe Ravens should love this complete outside linebacker option who can provide power vs. the run as well as needed pass-rush juice.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Panthers have been feeling the void at linebacker for a while after it was once a strength and GM Dan Morgan should have intrigue to go for his former position with Styles, a versatile talent who makes a lot of plays everywhere along with Reese.\n\nCashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M (6-2, 248 pounds)\n\nHowell can give the Lions the needed strong complementary pass rusher for Aidan Hutchinson to relieve their secondary coverage a lot more next season.\n\nAvieon Terrell, CB, Clemson (5-11, 180 pounds)\n\nThe Jets, after going QB with Moore earlier in this mock, can get their Sauce Gardner replacement with the pick acquired in that trade with Terrell, brother of Falcons star A.J.\n\nMORE: Latest news on QBs entering NCAA transfer portal\n\nSpencer Fano, OT, Utah (6-6, 302 pounds)\n\nThe Texans have gotten surprising returns from rookie Aireontay Ersery and the rest of their rebuilt line but should be in the market to boost pass protection and run blocking at either right tackle or guard with Fano.\n\nT.J. Parker, EDGE, Clemson (6-3, 265 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys shouldn't mind doubling up on pass-rush help here with Parker and Bailey, as Parker can provide more traditional burst and finishing moves from defensive end to help Quinnen Williams in Matt Eberflus' front four.\n\nCarnell Tate, WR, Ohio State (6-3, 195 pounds)\n\nThe 49ers seem ready to cut ties with injured Brandon Aiyuk, which means they will need to find a dynamic speedy big target for Brock Purdy to better take advantage of his ace deep passing. Tate would be a natural fit with George Kittle and Jauan Jennings downfield.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 25 Heisman Trophy winners since 2000\n\nKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State (6-3, 326 pounds)\n\nThe Bills have been terrible against the run and McDonald is a natural and physically overwhelming run-stopper for the Buckeyes, shooting up boards with his dominant play fron the regular season.\n\nCaleb Banks, DT, Florida (6-6, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Chargers also could bolster their interior to help their front seven in multiple ways and Banks has the right kind of power and pop for Jesse Minter.\n\nBrandon Cisse, CB, South Carolina (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Seahawks didn't trade pending free agent Riq Woolen and will need to find their strong replacement outside to support Devon Witherpoon. Cissee can be seamless in the schme of Mike Macdonald.\n\nMORE: Picks against the spread for all 35 bowl games\n\nR Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma (6-2, 249 pounds)\n\nThe Buccaneers should covet this explosive pass-rusher built to thrive in Todd Bowles' scheme and help restore their old strength on the second level.\n\nTy Simpson, QB, Alabama (6-2, 208 pounds)s\n\nThe Steelers should be in the market for a starting QB early if Aaron Rodgers retires and Simpson's brand of pocket passing would provide plenty of promise.\n\nOlaivavega Ioane, G, Penn State (6-4, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Eagles have had issues at right guard this season and Ioane would be the easy upgrade coming from State College to Philly. sliding over from his left side position in college to start right away and upgrade over Tyler Steen.\n\nCaleb Lomu, OT, Utah (6-6, 304 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to rebuild their offensive line right up there with getting more reliable receivers and Lomu would be a good initial building block, going not long after teammate Fano.\n\nChristen Miller, DT, Georgia (6-3, 305 pounds)\n\nThe Bears need to work on their interior for Dennis Allen's front and Miller would be ideal to help them with their own run-stopping problems.\n\nKC Concepcion, WR, Texas A&M (5-11, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Patriots should love what this dynamic slot can do as the ideal fit in Josh McDaniels' offense to make big plays in the open field after the catch and upgrade over Pop Douglas and other complements to Stefon Diggs.\n\nMORE: Updated list of every college coaching change for 2026\n\nKadyn Proctor, OT, Alabama (6-7, 366 pounds)\n\nThe Rams can again think more about the near future with this second first-rounder with Proctor looking solid as their future long-term tackle on either the right or left side.\n\nC.J. Allen, LB, Georgia (6-1, 235 pounds)\n\nThe Broncos need to cover more ground defensively on the second level and Allen would provide that typical Bulldogs athlete who can get around well vs. run and in coverage.",

    "description": "The Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, is in full production after trainings, live-fire exercises, and upgrades.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has a new air defense system built to transform light vehicles into mobile weapons for shooting down drones and other aircraft.\n\nThe technology is intended to equip Marines with a new way to deal with drones and other aerial threats, the service announced this week. As the war in Ukraine has shown, the ability to counter these types of threats is critical in modern conflict.\n\nThe new Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, entered full-rate production earlier this fall after training and live-fire exercises. Placed on top of a pair of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, MADIS converts the vehicles into a single short-ranged ground-based air defense system.\n\nThe vehicles work together, with one focused on countering drones and the other geared toward helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. MADIS uses Stinger missiles and a 30mm cannon for those targets, and it also comes with radars and electronic warfare systems. Marines can also use MADIS while on the move, giving the service a mobile air defense option.\n\nIt's a capability boost over the service's Man-Portable Air Defense System, or MANPAD, which Marines would've had to equip themselves and leave vehicles to use. MADIS is also capable of being upgraded over time, depending on what types of threats Marines are facing and what weapons they need for specific missions.\n\nMADIS, developed by the Norwegian firm Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace, has undergone several iterations since its initial prototype. The Marine Corps said its full-rate production version has sensors, algorithms, and mobility that allow Marines to locate, target, and destroy threats faster and better than before. Its first live-fire exercise took place during joint US-Philippine military training earlier this year.\n\nMarine Corps officials have said MADIS fills a gap in their air defense arsenal and is unique because it can complete the entire kill chain. Marines can use it to find and identify targets and then take them out rather than relying on several systems to do the same.\n\nMADIS also addresses Marine Corps concerns around how to defeat small uncrewed aerial systems in a potential future war.\n\nSince MADIS is mobile, it gives Marines a new way to defend forward-deployed forces — especially in a potential future fight against a sophisticated adversary like China.\n\nAs the Marine Corps reshapes its force for operations across the first island chain, from Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines, it needs systems that can move quickly and deliver more firepower against a wide range of aerial threats.",

    "description": "The new Spanx jeans feature cleverly hidden modern sculpting technology. The denim feels luxe, while the compressive panels reshape my hips and waist.",
    "fullText": "At nine months postpartum, I've been focused on revamping my wardrobe with comfortable outfits that still feel chic. My body has changed in ways I didn't expect, and so has the fit of my clothes — but I've finally found jeans that have helped me embrace my shape.\n\nI didn't expect it, but Spanx's denim is the answer. The jeans use the brand's namesake compression technology to create a stretchy, sculpting fit that moves with me but doesn't feel restrictive or look like jeggings. I tried five pairs to see which ones felt most worth it, and in the end, the SPANXshape Authentic 360 Wide Leg Jeans ($158) came out on top. The washed black color I have looks expensive and chic, and the wide legs offer just enough wiggle room. And, magically, they also seem to snatch my waist as soon as I zip them up.\n\nBefore I go into more detail, I'll just say one thing: All bodies are beautiful just the way they are, and no tummy needs to be \"tamed\" in order to look cute in jeans. But if you're in the market for jeans that have some shaping qualities, here's everything to know about shopping for Spanx denim.\n\nReDefine: The most rigid of the three, this denim type is meant to sculpt the tummy, thighs, and bum for a smoother, more lifted appearance. The jeans come with functional pockets, zippers, and buttons, so despite their technical fabric, they still look like jeans. Size options range from 0 to 26, with petite and tall options.\n\nAuthentic 360: This style features a four-way stretch with medium compression and a panel that shapes the belly, waist, and backside. \"They provide a more classic denim experience in a more structured premium fabric that smooths,\" says Pascale Gueracague, the Chief Design Officer at Spanx. This collection has sizes ranging from XS to 3X with petite and tall options.\n\nEveryWear: This is the most relaxed, stretchy denim of the three. \"The newly upgraded EveryWear jeans are a pull-on style with 'TummyTamer Tech,' faux hardware, and a smooth waistband,\" says Gueracague. While the back pockets are functioning, they're missing front pockets and a fly zipper. Its sizes range from XS to 3X, with petite and tall options.\n\nThey snatch my waist and smooth my belly. I'm not going to lie: it was difficult to zip them up because they are pretty compressive in the belly area, and the fabric is somewhat thick and stiff. But these factors worked to flatten my lower belly and cinch my waist.\n\nHonestly? I feel really, really good about how my body looks in the Spanx Authentic 360 Wide Leg, especially being postpartum. The amount of shimmying it took to get into this pair made me doubt myself, but as soon as I turned around and saw my reflection, I had an instant boost of confidence.\n\nThey look and feel like expensive jeans. I'm usually skeptical of jeans that come in alpha sizing (XS-3X) — they tend to lack the quality and precise fit of jeans that come in numeric sizing. But Spanx as a whole has surprised me with just how high-end the jeans look and feel, all while remaining size-inclusive. You get functioning pockets all around, real hardware buttons and zippers, and a clean, chic finish that is unmistakably denim. They even come in a trendy barrel-leg design.\n\nI also love that these wide-leg jeans are made without any branding or stitching on the back pockets — because even though I'm obsessed with its jeans, I don't necessarily want the world to know that I'm wearing Spanx.\n\nThey don't feel great to sit in for long. With so much compression in the belly area, they may be uncomfortable if you're going on a long car ride or you're in a deep squat. You can always size up to make them more comfortable, but you may lose some of the shaping benefits in the process.\n\nIf I had to pick a favorite between the two pairs of Authentic 360 jeans I tested, it would be these. The 90s Straight Leg cut was a win, and while the compression did feel similar to the black wide-leg pair, for some reason, they felt slightly easier to button up. I suspect there could be a slight discrepancy between the different washes.\n\nWhile I did cuff them, the petite inseam length was the perfect length for my shorter frame. I found them easier to put on and supportive while walking around, but they weren't very comfortable when I was seated for long periods of time.\n\nMy tummy looks quite flat in these, but then again, so does my bum. I wish the fabric were a bit thinner in the seat area, or maybe even that they had a different panel just below the booty for an added lift. The compression level ultimately stifled the natural curves of my body.\n\nI can be picky about the color of my blue jeans, but the Elysian wash is the perfect mid-tone hue. It's not too dark and not too light, with a color that looks dimensional and not just a single wash of blue — ultimately, making the jeans look more expensive and high-quality.\n\nIn comparison to the Authentic 360 jeans, the EveryWear fabric feels a lot smoother, a bit thinner (yet still feels well-made and like real denim), and much, much stretchier. These are made for casual days: I could sit in them for hours without getting those painful red indentations on my skin.\n\nThey're not as sculpting as the other pairs. I felt my lower belly looked slightly smoothed and flattened, but I didn't get the same waist-snatching effect. The EveryWear jeans definitely put comfort at the forefront.\n\nI had to jump to get them on— but as soon as they were, they fit like a glove. No, seriously. It took some real effort to get these jeans over my bum, but I was justly rewarded. They never felt too snug or tight in any area, so they allowed my curves some room. Namely, my booty looked a little less flattened than it did in Authentic 360 jeans. \n\nI wish they had real pockets and zippers. I understand how removing pockets and limiting layers of fabric makes for a smoother appearance, but as a new mom, I could always use extra pocket space.\n\nThat said, these jeans are the most comfortable of the bunch, with ultra-soft fabric that feels like a second skin. The fabric has an incredible amount of stretch, so I could actually breathe in them all day. I'm not usually a fan of pull-on jeans — in most cases, I'd rather just wear leggings — but I could make an exception for this pair. And honestly, you can't really tell that the front is an illusion like many other similar high-waisted jeans, because there is a real fly button and raised seams that look legit.\n\nThey have the strongest level of compression out of all three Spanx denim fabrics. The ReDefine collection is the newest denim release from Spanx, and the jeans feature real hardware and pockets — which is a major bonus for my taste. I also like that the lack of excess material around the legs means I can tuck them into knee-high boots.\n\nThis sculpting denim takes it up a notch with \"strong compression,\" while the Authentic 360 and EveryWear denim are only medium compression. There's definitely some stretch to these jeans, but they do feel pretty tight and rigid by comparison — especially around the belly and bum. Ultimately, they weren't very comfortable to sit in.\n\nMore than the other styles, I found that the ReDefine range runs small. My typical size postpartum has been a 10 or 12. I tried this pair in a 12, and really struggled to put them on. I could have gone up a full size, or even two. My biggest piece of advice with the ReDefine line is to know your measurements, and when in doubt, go with the bigger size.\n\nThat said, this fabrication seems to have the best of both worlds. It looks and feels like real denim, bearing similar traits to my preferred Authentic 360 jeans (albeit much more compressive and tight around the belly). They do have a bit more stretch thanks to the Lycra, which is most akin to the EveryWear styles. Overall, if I had sized up, these could've been my favorite fit of them all. But in reality, the strong compression feels a bit too intense for my day-to-day.\n\nThis was my least favorite pair I tried. I first thought the ankle length would set them apart in a good way, but they just didn't look right on my frame. They're fabricated with Spanx Authentic 360 denim, which is a blend of cotton, polyester, and just 1% elastane, meaning they're not very stretchy.\n\nI disliked the cropped cut and patch pockets. This is, of course, a personal preference, but I do feel like the shorter cut \"shrinks\" me — and I'm already five feet flat. I prefer the full-length Wide Leg and 90s Straight styles instead because they make my legs look longer. My issue with the pockets is more personal — I feel like they draw the eye to my lower belly, and I'm more conscious of that area postpartum.\n\nThe denim is highly compressive, so it's best for active days. It definitely feels a bit tight, especially around my belly. This tightness isn't necessarily uncomfortable, but I feel it if I'm sitting down for too long. I didn't mind it when I was walking around and taking care of my baby on the go — in fact, I appreciated the support in those moments.\n\nSpanx jeans are a little high-maintenance. You can't just throw them in the regular laundry pile, because the dryer will wreck their elasticity. \"We recommend turning denim inside out, machine washing cold on a gentle cycle, and laying flat or hanging to dry\" explains Gueracague. \"High heat can break down stretch fibers, so it's best to avoid the dryer whenever possible, and there's no need for steaming, ironing, or dry cleaning.\"\n\nI also found that some pairs — like the intense compression in the ReDefine and Authentic 360 jeans — felt a bit too tight around the waistband in some situations (for sit-down brunches and car rides, I had to unbutton the top to allow myself some breathing room). \n\nThe EveryWear denim is much more comfortable when sitting down, but the pull-on style and faux pockets could be a turn-off for some.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty impressed with Spanx's shaping denim. I'd say the most comfortable pair for casual wear is the EveryWear Wide Leg Jeans. But if I want that instant hourglass effect, I'll definitely be reaching for my Authentic 360 Wide Leg Jeans.\n\nSpanx jeans are a moderate splurge at $138-$168 a pair, and the sizing can be tricky. They also require more special care than cotton denim. That said, they truly are high-quality jeans that'll create silhouettes you didn't know you had in you.\n\nThere are very few denim brands I actually like on my petite, curvy figure, but Spanx happens to be one of them. They're more expensive than the cult-favorite Abercrombie jeans (about $90 per pair), yet cost less than the equally adored, yet higher-end, Mother Denim (about $258 per pair).\n\nAs our editors found with its Perfect Black Work Pants, Spanx clothing is consistently high quality, and you don't have to wear any shapewear undergarments with them. Plus, the clean branding allows you to wear them in casual settings or at the office.\n\nThey do, however, take special care to maintain. I let each pair of jeans I tested air dry (as suggested in the care instructions) so I didn't have to worry about them shrinking. They kept their compression qualities even after I washed them a handful of times, and since they proved their durability, I can tell that they'll be a staple in my wardrobe for a long time (as long as I keep taking good care of them).\n\nThe ReDefine jeans definitely run small, so I suggest measuring yourself and rounding up a size if you're unsure.\n\nThe rest are pretty true to size, though the compression creates a tighter feel, so you may want to size up anyway. I'm only five feet tall, and the petite 30-inch inseam worked best for me. The inseam lengths can vary by style, so check the size guide before you place your order.

    "fullText": "Commons committee monitoring revolving door that gave jobs to George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Tony Blair\n\nWhen the billionaire chief executive of AI chipmaker Nvidia threw a party in central London for Donald Trump’s state visit in September, the power imbalance between Silicon Valley and British politicians was vividly exposed.\n\nJensen Huang hastened to the stage after meetings at Chequers and rallied his hundreds of guests to cheer on the power of AI. In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.\n\n“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.\n\nBut his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.\n\nStarmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.\n\nNot done, Huang called on to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.\n\nThis week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn Chat GPT maker Open AI hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.\n\nHe was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.\n\nThey followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that but said he was paid “extremely well”.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.\n\nTBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.\n\nThe Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is currently investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”\n\nJobs with the biggest US AI companies can be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also require comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI to inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.\n\nSelling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.\n\nBritain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.\n\nThe revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco start-up incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.\n\nCivil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year took a senior director general role in the government’s digital service.",

The BBC reported on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.\n\nThe agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

And it made me think about how, during this holiday period, we could all use this as an opportunity to approach those conversations with the “WhatsApp aunties” more sensitively.\n\nFrom ‘WhatsApp Aunties’ to ‘AI Aunties’\n\nI think I have the perfect sample of WhatsApp aunties. Sadly displaced from Sudan due to war, a permanently online group of women, some direct aunts, some not, but all aunties nonetheless, sit in a control room of sorts in their different cities and send out daily broadcasts that simulate as much as possible the interactions and updates they would have shared had they still been living in the same place. They even have office hours. One can divine the start of the day in their respective locations as they clock in and the forwards begin: First, it is morning greetings, maybe an embellished picture of Quranic verses or a graphic of flowers, wishing you a good day.\n\nThen, the hardcore stuff. Snippets of videos from war zones back home, clipped debates between political antagonists, and sometimes entire YouTube episodes of interviews. After this news shift comes the lighter one (secretly my favourite): TikTok and Instagram reels of Arab celebrities with too much plastic surgery accompanied by scream emojis, footage from family and friend weddings across the world, captioned with love heart eyes. The stream is interspersed with the longest voice memos you will ever receive, asking how you are and telling you how they are with an introductory and concluding prayer session. It is sweet and relentless.\n\nAll of this is dumped with an abandon that suggests no understanding of or respect for phone memory limitations. Whenever my mother casually mentions that her phone is acting up and mutters something about no space, my heart sinks. I know that hours and hours of deletions of grainy videos are upon me. But most galling is how much fake content it includes. The WhatsApp aunties have become AI aunties. This was frankly a problem even before AI became so sophisticated, but it is now much, much worse. There is the harmless stuff; cats hugging babies or penguins feeding themselves with cutlery. I try not to get too agitated by this or point out that it’s fake. But when it’s videos of Taylor Swift endorsing the pro-Palestine movement, it’s impossible to let it slide.\n\nThe result is a series of exchanges that are both saddening and enraging. Aunties will either take it personally, like I am disrespecting them by implying they can’t tell what’s real or not, and double down. Or they will express genuinely innocent beliefs in the veracity of online content, imbuing the internet with the same standards of TV or radio they grew up with.\n\nTelling the aunties that something is entirely fake is like asking them to imagine a TV news broadcast is not real. Also, they are actually receiving news broadcast clips on their phones that are not real. You end up sounding like the crazy one, trying to explain that a living, breathing, walking, talking person is just pixels generated from prompts.\n\nIn a recent episode of Subway Takes, comedian Ola Labib said we shouldn’t try to convince elders that AI content isn’t real. Her argument: Let them have their little comforts. I kind of get that, what harm is it doing really? But there is an emotional element to it as well. Policing elders’ content feels to me like a manifestation of a deep-seated fear that they’re losing it, that their faculties are waning, as they succumb to old age and the bewildering assaults of new tech and device addiction. I think it is truly distressing for people to see parents and relatives increasingly become addicted to their phones and become slightly addled, a window into a sort of premature senility.\n\nBut there are social and political reasons too, for pushing back. Aunties (and, to a lesser degree, uncles) have a huge amount of disseminative power and a lot of free time. They wield a formidable authority, particularly in diaspora communities, both as enforcers of values, as organisers and sponsors of social events, and generally as gatekeepers of community interactions and upholders of norms. Collectively and individually, they are forces to be reckoned with, which makes disagreements even more challenging and fraught with risks of falling foul of powerful elders. But they are force multipliers in terms of spreading fake content that is politically inflammatory or conspiratorial, and when unchallenged, they contribute to the general degradation of the information ecosystem and its associated political fallout.\n\nSo, I would say talk to them, keep talking to them, but do it kindly, with time and explanation, rather than frustration and bewilderment. Maybe just acknowledge the content first before pointing out its fakery – a “really cool!” followed a little while later with a “actually, do you think that’s real? I’m not sure”. Also, furnish them with the “tells”: video glitches, lack of shadows, weird blinking. Bear in mind what the world looks like to them. It is a place that is changing too rapidly to assimilate how it is happening. Our elders are also, simply, getting older. With that comes all sorts of uncertainties and unsettlement; loneliness, loss of identity as work is retired from, and children age out of parenting. Exacerbating that are the vast distances that now often separate elders from their kin and peers. Online content and its constant exchange are about so much more than sharing information; it is a new language, almost phatic, for trying to connect.\n\nRemember that the tech is evolving so quickly that even the most savvy have to be vigilant. I now have to be on alert after admiring a song with album cover art, a music video, a richly talented singer and fantastic accompanying chorus. After days of trying to hunt down the artist, I was thunderstruck to find out it was all AI. It will happen to all of us. Welcome me to the aunties brigade. Please be kind. Break it to me gently.",

    "title": "Meet one of BlackRock's top technologists who is supercharging its investment teams with AI",
    "description": "Kirsty Craig recently earned the distinction of tech fellow, partly because of her efforts to transform how BlackRock's investors work.",
    "fullText": "For 15 years, BlackRock's Kirsty Craig has operated as a kind of \"translator\" inside the world's largest asset manager, sitting between portfolio managers making big bets and engineers building the systems that help inform those decisions to get both sides aligned on driving returns.\n\nThis skill set is part of what earned Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, the title of Tech Fellow, one of the firm's high technological distinctions, held by only two dozen of its thousands of engineers. Craig is one of five new fellows that the firm announced on December 16, recognized for supercharging the asset manager's investment team. This year, she is the only woman and the only fellow who works outside of Aladdin, the lucrative spine of BlackRock's investment technology.\n\nWhen it comes to her impact on how $13.5 trillion money manager BlackRock uses AI, Craig said she's especially proud of her role in Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. The \"virtual investment analyst\" was unveiled by Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein at the firm's investor day in June.\n\nIt leverages AI to automate workflows and research, as many firms race to adopt the technology to speed up what were once monthslong investment processes.\n\nNow, as a fellow, Craig is even more embedded in BlackRock's efforts to stay ahead, as the firm continues to center on technological prowess.\n\nAt first, Craig wasn't sure she'd become a tech fellow, largely because her work is different than most of the other fellows who work squarely within BlackRock's data analytics and risk platform, Aladdin. Her team of around 60 software engineers, data engineers, and data scientists \"sits at the horizontal\" across various investment capabilities to help drive investment research.\n\nShe found out about the honor at the beginning of the month when a meeting was added to her calendar.\n\nWhen she heard the news, Craig started by telling the manager who had nominated her, her sponsor during the application process, her team, and her family, \"but they've got no idea what it means,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nNish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and the co-executive sponsor of the fellows program, said that existing tech fellows knew Craig not only for her innovation with AI in investing, but for her collaborative efforts. He described Craig as an \"AI native,\" and added that her team is at the \"tip of the spear\" when it comes to applying AI to investment.\n\nCraig's time at different offices — Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia — has, she thinks, given her a strong foundation of horizontal leadership across teams.\n\n\"I am responsible for really trying to find the dial movers across data, AI, and technology that really help our investment pillars drive investment research,\" she said of her work.\n\nCraig has learned how to communicate with both investors and Aladdin technologists, and said that building deep trust with both groups has been key to her success.\n\n\"If you put both of those different personalities or personas together, quite often they're talking above or below each other. They struggle to connect. So for me, it's really been being able to translate both and then come up with a strategy in the middle,\" she said.\n\nFor Craig, being a woman in a position of visible leadership is \"a huge honor.\" Of the 24 tech fellows, five are women, including Craig. Women make up 43.8% of BlackRock's global workforce and 33.1% of senior leadership, according to data from January 1, 2025, posted on the firm's site.\n\nCraig said being involved in BlackRock's women and LGBTQ+ resource groups has informed her other work at the firm, especially in how they've taught her how to collaborate with people from across divisions and explain complicated topics.\n\n\"If anything has probably helped me with, one, building my network; two, softer presentation skills; and then three, around how to communicate with impact,\" Craig said. With the title, she hopes to help more junior female technologists \"lean in.\"\n\nFor Ajitsaria, it's also important to have a diversity of expertise in the program and ensure that fellows represent all arms of BlackRock.\n\nWhen it comes to driving technology strategy itself, Craig said she's excited to keep figuring out how to leverage AI in active investing. Right now, her team is thinking about how to expand the scope of agentic research, potentially to areas like fixed income and macro investing.\n\nAs she continues to soak up the news, Craig is also preparing for a very different big life change. Her partner is scheduled to give birth in early January, so, with the due date mere weeks away, Craig said they've kept all celebrating fairly tame so far.\n\n\"We did go out for a meal. Nothing has been purchased, apart from cribs and bottles,\" she said. \"Definitely some more celebrating will be done post January 6.\"",

    "description": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.",
    "fullText": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.\n\nThe launch of the “US Tech Force” is designed to address a technical and early career talent gap across the government, according to Scott Kupor, the director of the Office of Personnel Management which is spearheading the program. The effort comes amid a broader war for AI talent, with tech companies offering sizable salaries and other perks to attract top engineers and researchers.\n\nOPM plans to hire an initial cohort of 1,000 early career software engineers, data scientists, project managers and AI experts to be placed across government agencies for the two-year program. It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with a key piece of technology called an engine immobilizer and pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.\n\nThe settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.\n\nThefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because beginning in 2021, videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable. Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022. Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.\n\nEllison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.\n\n“This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,” Ellison said at a news conference.\n\nHe was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents’ vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times — as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.\n\nUnder the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.\n\nEligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.\n\nIn separate statements, the automakers said the agreement is one of multiple anti-theft efforts they have taken to help customers.\n\n“Kia is eager to continue working with law enforcement officers and officials at federal, state, and local levels to combat criminal car theft, and the role social media has played in encouraging it, and we remain fully committed to upholding vehicle security,” the company said.\n\nHyundai said, “We will continue to take meaningful action to support our customers and ensure peace of mind.”\n\nDura reported from Bismarck, North Dakota.",

    "description": "BlackRock's tech fellow program honors the firm's most distinguished engineers. Meet the newest members of the elite cohort.",
    "fullText": "The holidays came early for five BlackRock employees, who joined an elite circle of some of the firm's most accomplished technologists on Tuesday.\n\nThey became members of BlackRock's Tech Fellows program, a group of 24 senior technologists playing a crucial role in the $13.5 trillion firm's vision and operations.\n\nThis year's members underwent a rigorous application process — from being nominated to completing written evaluations and interviews — before being voted into the program by current fellows, Nish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and executive sponsor of AI, and the co-executive sponsor of the program, said.\n\n\"We think about the combination of technical expertise, domain expertise, commercial mindset, but really lifting the platform, the culture, the experience across the firm,\" said Ajitsaria, who has been involved with Tech Fellows since it launched in 2020. Many of this year's fellows are credited with mentoring other technologists, according to an internal announcement shared with Business Insider.\n\nTechnologists are gaining more and more influence on Wall Street as firms race to adopt AI. BlackRock has long positioned itself as equal parts financial technology company and asset manager. Aladdin — the firm's sprawling risk and portfolio management platform — underpins its client relationships, and tech-related revenue is among its fastest-growing businesses. BlackRock's technology services and subscription revenue jumped 28% year-on-year over the last quarter, fueled by Aladdin and the integration of newly acquired Preqin's private-markets data business, the firm reported in its latest earnings.\n\nFour of this year's fellows work in Aladdin, though Ajitsaria said that the group has always represented a wide swath of the firm's businesses.\n\n\"We are also really deliberate about leveraging and applying our tech fellows to the firm's most critical technology initiatives,\" Ajitsaria said. As of 2023, one in every third BlackRock employee was a software engineer or technologist, according to a document about the firm.\n\nFellows meet internally at least once a month and are expected to foster the firm's engineering culture both internally and externally — they might, for example, contribute to BlackRock's engineering blog or attend conferences, Ajitsaria said.\n\nBlackRock has set high targets for the year 2030, when it aims to reach $35 billion in annual revenue and fundraising $400 billion in private markets. As Ajitsaria said, \"the 2030 vision of BlackRock is very much underpinned by technology.\"\n\nThese five new fellows have just become a more integral part of that vision.\n\nAs the head of Aladdin Studio Engineering for Aladdin Data, David Woodhead has spearheaded the effort to \"open Aladdin,\" giving stakeholders access to the platform's data and analytics models, among other tools. He's recognized for \"championing modern data platforms, cloud-native technologies, and open-source adoption,\" according to the internal announcement. Woodhead has helped craft the very architecture of Aladdin.\n\nBeyond his role at Aladdin Studio, Woodhead also oversees services that give Aladdin and its clients reference, market, and other third-party data. He joined BlackRock in 2006 and is based in Virginia, serving as a managing director.\n\nKirsty Craig has been at BlackRock for 15 years and now serves as the head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech. She's shaped how the firm uses AI and data science in investment research. While Craig is this year's only fellow who doesn't work within the Aladdin program, she has forged collaboration between the investment and technology teams.\n\nCraig has worked in offices in Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia, and is currently a managing director.\n\nNew York-based director Infant Vasanth is known for his work pushing BlackRock's internal research and automation platform forward. He joined the firm in 2011 and is now a senior director of engineering, running the team behind an analytics and automation platform.\n\nVasanth, an advocate for open-source, often speaks at tech conferences and is the brain behind multiple patent filings. He also leads a team focused on Aladdin Studio's AI abilities.\n\n\"Drawing on deep expertise in neural networks and pattern-recognition algorithms, he applies research rigor to building enterprise-scale AI systems,\" the announcement said.\n\nMichael Duncan, a director and engineering lead on Aladdin's Trading Engineering team, is the architect behind a collection of tools dubbed BlackRock's Xceler Ecosystem, which is now integral across Aladdin and has helped raise engineering standards. His team is in charge of \"delivering multi-asset trading solutions and technology across global markets,\" and Duncan has improved its abilities.\n\nBeyond that, Duncan is the global engineering lead for part of Aladdin and leads a client support and performance engineering program.\n\nDuncan joined BlackRock in 2020 and is based in Chicago.\n\nNew York-based Charlie Johnston joined BlackRock as a summer intern in 2013 and has worked his way up to being a director. A software engineer, he has improved the quality of the asset management giant's code and development processes.\n\n\"Charlie's technical contributions and collaborative approach have strengthened the engineering community across Aladdin,\" the internal announcement reads.",

    "fullText": "Liz Kendall faces pressure from campaigners as she tells parliament there is no clear consensus on issue\n\nA campaign fronted by popstars including Elton John and Dua Lipa to protect artists’ works from being mined to train AI models without consent has received a boost after almost every respondent to a government consultation backed their case.\n\nNinety-five per cent of the more than 10,000 people who had their say over how music, novels, films and other works should be protected from copyright infringements by tech companies called for copyright to be strengthened and a requirement for licensing in all cases or no change to copyright law.\n\nMinisters subsequently dropped that preference in the face of a backlash. Artists who have opposed any dilution of their copyright include Sam Fender, Kate Bush and the Pet Shop Boys. Campaigners to protect artists’ copyright have voiced fears that ministers have paid too much attention to US tech companies’ interests.\n\nThe US president, Donald Trump, has said: “We have to allow AI to use that [copyrighted] pool of knowledge without going through the complexity of contract negotiations,” and warned international governments not to “make rules and regulations that … make it impossible” for AI companies to do business.\n\nLast month Paul McCartney stepped up the campaign to protect copyright by releasing a new recording, which was almost entirely silent save for some ambient clattering in the studio as a protest against copyright theft by AI companies.\n\nLiz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament on Monday there was “no clear consensus” on the issue and the government would “take the time to get this right”, and promised to make policy proposals by 18 March 2026.\n\n“Our approach to copyright and AI must support prosperity for all UK citizens, and drive innovation and growth for sectors across the economy, including the creative industries,” she said. “This means keeping the UK at the cutting edge of science and technology so UK citizens can benefit from major breakthroughs, transformative innovation and greater prosperity.\n\n“It also means continuing to support our creative industries, which make a huge economic contribution, shape our national identity and give us a unique position on the world stage.”\n\nBut campaigners for copyright holders said the consultation response set a clear course for the government to take.\n\n“This is an overwhelming show of support for the commonsense position that AI companies should pay for the resources they use, and a total rejection of the government’s ‘preferred option’ of handing AI companies the work of the UK’s creatives for free,” said Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for copyright fairness.\n\n“Liz Kendall should listen to the people and rule out changing copyright law to benefit AI companies.”\n\nOwen Meredith, the chief executive of the New Media Association, urged Kendall to rule out any new copyright exception and end the uncertainty created by “this prolonged process”.\n\n“This will send a clear message to AI developers that they must enter into licensing agreements with the UK’s media and creative copyright owners, unlocking investment and strengthening the market for the high-quality content that is the most valuable ingredient in producing safe, trustworthy AI models,” he said.\n\nLast month, Kendall indicated she was sympathetic to artists’ demands not to have their copyrighted works scraped by AI companies without payment and wanted to “reset” the debate. “People rightly want to get paid for the work that they do,” she said, and “we have to find a way that both sectors can grow and thrive in future”.",

    "fullText": "Pledge to invest billions in UK paused, with Washington citing lack of progress on trade barriers across pond\n\nThe US has paused its promised multi-billion-pound investment into British tech over trade disagreements, marking a serious setback in US-UK relations.\n\nThe £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, hailed by Keir Starmer as “a generational stepchange in our relationship with the US” when it was announced during Donald Trump’s state visit, has been put on ice by Washington.\n\nAs part of the deal, US tech companies pledged to spend billions in the UK, including a £22bn investment from Microsoft and £5bn from Google. But Washington has paused the implementation of the agreement, citing a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nBritish officials sought to downplay the development, which was first reported by the New York Times. The newspaper said Trump’s administration was unhappy about the UK continuing to levy a digital services tax on American tech companies and its food safety rules, which bar the export of certain agricultural products.\n\nOne British government source said it was “the usual bit of hardball negotiations by the Americans” and said that the deal to allow tariff-free British pharmaceutical exports to the US was on and off before it was finalised.\n\n“[The US commerce secretary] Howard Lutnick is a tough guy. We understand that the Americans negotiate incredibly hard but we’ll stand our ground. They want what’s best for their country, we want what’s best for ours,” the source said.\n\nA second government source said the development was “part of the shape of the negotiations” with Washington.\n\nThe prosperity deal included the creation of an artificial intelligence “growth zone” in the north-east of England, which UK officials said could bring in up to £30bn and create 5,000 jobs.\n\nBut the text of the agreement stated that it only “becomes operative alongside substantive progress being made to formalise and implement” it.\n\nThe decision to put it on hold is a blow to the UK government, which touted the agreement as a prize of its intensive year-long engagement with the US to avoid punitive tariffs on British exports. As part of his diplomatic charm offensive, Starmer hosted Trump for a second state visit at Windsor Castle in September, an unprecedented honour for a US president.\n\nStarmer has resisted US pressure to scrap or amend the digital services tax, a 2% levy on the revenues of tech companies including Amazon, Google and Apple that raises about £800m a year. Trump has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against countries with digital taxes, including the UK.\n\nThe Guardian revealed that during trade negotiations in the spring, the government drew up proposals to reduce the amount paid by US tech companies and by applying the tax to a wider range of companies without reducing its total take. But so far the tax has remained unchanged.\n\nThe US has also exerted pressure over the UK’s online safety rules, with officials promising to review their enforcement during the talks.\n\nA third area of contention has been the UK’s food safety regime, with ministers admitting that the US has raised objections to it. As part of the trade deal the government agreed to lower tariffs on some US agricultural products including beef, but it has stood by its manifesto commitment not to water down farming standards.\n\nAny decision to weaken these could open the door to American chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef being sold in Britain, a prospect that has long been highly controversial with farmers and consumer groups.\n\nAt a press conference at Chequers in September, where he unveiled the tech prosperity deal, Starmer said it had “the power to change lives” and “renewed the special relationship for a new era”.\n\n“It’s our chance to ensure that technologies like AI, quantum and others amplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer, strengthen democracy not tyranny,” the prime minister said. “This is the territory on which the future will be won.”\n\nTrump at the time said the deal would help the US and UK “dominate” in the world of artificial intelligence and “ensure our countries lead the next great technological revolution side by side”.\n\nPeter Kyle, the business and trade secretary, was in the US last week for negotiations with Lutnick, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Their discussions touched on whisky and steel tariffs and collaboration on critical minerals. Kyle’s department said talks were due to continue in January.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the tech prosperity deal delivers opportunity for hard-working people in both countries.”\n\nThe Guardian reported at the weekend that Starmer was poised to choose his new ambassador to Washington after interviewing the three finalists last week. The three shortlisted candidates are the prime minister’s business adviser, Varun Chandra, who was central to negotiating the prosperity deal; Christian Turner, the incoming ambassador to the UN; and Nigel Casey, the ambassador to Russia.",

    "description": "The Oaktree cofounder sees echoes of past bubbles in the current AI frenzy and urged investors to focus on durable, profitable tech giants.",
    "fullText": "Legendary investor Howard Marks has seen enough manias to know when a bubble is brewing.\n\nOn the \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast last Saturday, the billionaire and cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management said he is alarmed by how many investors are piling into speculative startups in hopes of landing the next trillion-dollar winner.\n\n\"Do you want to have a novel entrepreneurial startup pure play which has no revenues and no profits today, but could be a moonshot if it works?\" he asked.\n\n\"Or do you want to invest in a great tech company, which is already existing and making a lot of money where AI could be incremental but not life-changing? It's a choice.\"\n\nToo many investors, he said, are treating AI like a lottery where the slim chance of a jackpot overshadows the far greater likelihood of failure.\n\n\"People say, 'Well, they have a low probability of success, but maybe a big payoff, so I should buy it.' That's what I call lottery-ticket mentality,\" he said.\n\nMarks has been sounding this warning for months.\n\nIn a 2023 conversation with financial historian Edward Chancellor on Oaktree's \"Behind the Memo\" series, he put it bluntly: \"AI will change the world,\" he said, predicting that most of the companies that people are investing in today for AI purposes \"will end up worthless.\"\n\nOn the \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast, Marks said he sees echoes of the dot-com era: a groundbreaking technology, sky-high expectations, and a growing assumption that early movers will inevitably dominate.\n\n\"Most bubbles are around something new,\" he said, pointing to the growth-stock boom of 1969, the subprime-mortgage mania of 2006, the dot-com bubble in 1999, the 1720 South Sea Bubble, and even the Tulip Craze of 1636 in the Netherlands.\n\nSuch moments, he added, arise because \"the imagination is untrammelled, and it can go off in a flight of fancy.\"\n\nIn reality, he said, most early-stage companies don't survive the transition from promise to profitability.\n\n\"On the AI, I'm led to believe that you can make binary bets in companies that have nothing else going on, which will be sink-or-swim bets, or you can invest in pre-existing great tech companies, which will get moderate benefits from AI if they're successful.\"\n\nRather than gamble on moonshots, Marks said he'd rather own stocks in established tech titans that are already generating profits — companies that can integrate AI as an incremental advantage rather than a life-or-death proposition.\n\nHe contrasted those firms with the fragile AI startups drawing hype, saying that Big Tech is positioned to reap some benefits from AI, even if the technology rolls out more slowly or unevenly than hoped.\n\nBut a breakthrough in productivity doesn't automatically translate into investment gains.\n\n\"Change the world and investors making money are not the same thing.\"\n\nMarks echoed a warning Warren Buffett issued at Berkshire Hathaway's 2000 annual meeting, when Buffett warned that the internet stock mania had detached valuations from underlying profit potential — a mistake he believes investors are repeating with AI.\n\n\"I think the same is true of AI,\" he said.",

    "description": "Archer, Beta, and Joby are developing autonomous, gas-electric hybrid air taxis in hopes of clinching defense contracts.",
    "fullText": "US tech companies are hoping soon to gain clearance for flying taxis that make short commercial hops like Manhattan to LaGuardia Airport. Eyeing defense dollars, they're also equipping air taxies for the battlefield.\n\nAir taxis have wings and propellers, allowing them to take off and land like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. You can't yet hail a flying taxi anywhere in the US, though those futuristic flights could be coming in the next couple of years.\n\nPentagon leaders have shifted their focus to the tech industry, arguing that traditional defense contractors can't deliver new weapons fast or cheaply enough to meet today's fast-changing global threats. The Pentagon has pledged to pour billions of dollars into new technology and has issued requests for information on hybrid, autonomous air taxis, also known as vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, or VTOLs.\n\nFlying-taxi makers including Archer Aviation, Joby Aviation, and Beta Technologies say that gas-electric hybrid vehicles reminiscent of \"The Jetsons\" could carry military cargo more cheaply and quietly than helicopters. Some of the designs under development for the battlefield incorporate autonomous technology that could detect and avoid threats. The aircraft could be used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or moving supplies and equipment, these companies say.\n\nAmerican air-taxi makers are racing to develop cutting-edge technology as Chinese companies like EHang do the same. The VTOL industry is still young, and China hasn't yet cornered the air-taxi market as it has for smaller, aerial combat drones.\n\n\"When we can fundamentally go further and faster than a helicopter, then we have a tool that's more powerful than what the Chinese are going to bring to the fight,\" said Beta's CEO, Kyle Clark.\n\nCommercial air-taxi designs are typically electric. Swapping the electric battery for a hybrid engine will help the aircraft carry more weight and travel farther, a key consideration for the Pentagon, executives from Joby and Beta told Business Insider.\n\nArcher, Joby, and Beta are all developing military VTOLs that can fly autonomously. In Beta's battlefield version, a human must plug in destination coordinates for the aircraft, and artificial intelligence can help it navigate to the destination, said Clark. Configuring the aircraft to operate without a pilot makes it lighter than a commercial air taxi, since it doesn't require seats or the safety and avionics systems that are necessary when transporting people, Clark added.\n\nClinching coveted contracts from the Pentagon would add air-taxi manufacturers to a growing list of dual-use companies that sell to commercial clients as well as to the government. Joby is collaborating with traditional defense firm L3Harris on a military VTOL and test-flew a prototype in November. Archer is developing one with Anduril Industries for the US, according to Archer's CEO, Adam Goldstein. Anduril is also developing a military VTOL called Omen in a joint venture with Emirati defense giant Edge Group.\n\nOne of the air-taxi makers' biggest hurdles to commercial adoption is securing Federal Aviation Administration certification, though the Trump administration is attempting to make it easier. In September, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an FAA program that permits VTOL companies to test-fly piloted and unmanned aircraft before receiving federal certification.\n\nJoby is leading the pack in the certification race, having cleared four of the five stages for commercial clearance. Archer and Joby hope to fly commercially as early as 2026.\n\nFor defense adoption in the US, the companies would need the Defense Department to deem their VTOLs ready to fly, Goldstein said.\n\nTaylor Rains contributed to this story.",

    "fullText": "Dec 15 (Reuters) - Nvidia said on Monday it acquired AI software firm SchedMD, as the chip designer doubles down on open-source technology ​and steps up investments in the artificial intelligence ecosystem to fend off ‌rising competition.\n\nThe chip designer built its reputation on speedy chips, but it also offers a range ‌of its own AI models, from physics simulations to self-driving vehicles, as open-source software that researchers and companies can use.\n\nIts proprietary CUDA software, a standard among most developers, is a major selling point for its chips, making software key to ⁠maintaining its dominance in the ‌AI industry.\n\nNvidia shares were up 1.35% after the news and an earlier announcement of new open-source AI models.\n\nSchedMD provides software ‍that helps schedule large computing jobs that can occupy a big share of a data center's server capacity.\n\nIts technology, called Slurm, is open source, meaning developers and firms can ​access it for free, while the company sells engineering and maintenance support.\n\nFinancial terms ‌of the deal were not disclosed. Nvidia said it would continue to distribute SchedMD's software on an open-source basis.\n\n\"Slurm, which is supported on the latest Nvidia hardware, is also part of the critical infrastructure needed for generative AI, used by foundation model developers and AI builders to manage model training and inference ⁠needs,\" Nvidia said in a blog post.\n\nEarlier ​on Monday, Nvidia unveiled a new family of ​open-source AI models that it says will be faster, cheaper and smarter than its previous offerings, as it faces a growing wave ‍of rival open-source ⁠models from Chinese AI labs.\n\nSchedMD was founded in 2010 by Slurm software developers Morris \"Moe\" Jette and Danny Auble in Livermore, California, and the company ⁠currently employs 40 people, according to its website.\n\nIts customers include cloud infrastructure firm CoreWeave and ‌the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, among others.",

    "fullText": "Young tech talent hoping to land a job in the private sector has a new way in: the public sector.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration announced the launch of the United States Tech Force on Monday, a two-year program that offers participants federal government jobs and eventual recruitment opportunities for private sector roles.\n\nThe government is partnering with at least 28 tech companies on the program, including Apple, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Dell, Box, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Oracle, Uber, and xAI, among others.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management is spearheading the early-career program in partnership with other agencies. Participants will be placed at agencies across the government to work on modernization projects and, in part, implement AI, according to the Tech Force website.\n\nTech Force plans to hire around 1,000 applicants to start, according to the site, and is looking for people \"highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management.\"\n\nApplicants will submit an application, complete a technical assessment, have interviews with agency leaders, and undergo a background test. OPM will do the initial resume review and technical assessment before passing the hiring decisions off to individual agencies, OPM Director Scott Kupor said during a call before the announcement.\n\nPrivate sector partners can provide training resources and mentorship opportunities, and have committed to considering Tech Force participants for employment after the two years, according to the site. Kupor said on Monday's call that there will also be a speaker series featuring company CEOs. The program, he added, will end with public- and private-sector job fairs.\n\nCompanies haven't made any firm hiring commitments, Kupor said on the call.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate for us to ask companies to hire people without knowing who those people are,\" Kupor said. He added that he'll \"be certainly disappointed\" if the program doesn't lead to hiring by the private-sector partners.\n\nSalaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said. There are no specific degree or experience requirements for the positions, which will be posted on USA Jobs. Those interested are encouraged \"to apply as soon as possible\" on the site. Kupor said he hopes to get everybody hired by the end of March.\n\nThe roles are largely based in Washington, DC, and remote work options will depend on the agency and role, according to the site. They're non-partisan positions and are entirely distinct from the US DOGE Service.\n\nThough the Tech Force is primarily an early-career program, the government is also seeking \"experienced engineering managers from private sector partners,\" the site says. Companies can nominate employees, who will generally be expected to take unpaid leave or otherwise separate from their role to take the two-year position, per the site.\n\n\"They will become full-time employees of the government for the time they're here, and therefore be subject to all the various ethics rules,\" Kupor said. He added that each company will have its own policy, but expects that it will be \"easy\" for participants to return to their private-sector positions.\n\nKupor said on the call that the government plans to run the program on an annual basis and that he hopes to expand it in the years to come.\n\nAre you interested in applying to the Tech Force program?

    "fullText": "You (hopefully) know by now that you can't take everything AI tells you at face value. Large language models (LLMs) sometimes provide incorrect information, and threat actors are now using paid search ads on Google to spread conversations with ChatGPT and Grok that appear to provide tech support instructions but actually direct macOS users to install an infostealing malware on their devices.\n\nThe campaign is a variation on the ClickFix attack, which often uses CAPTCHA prompts or fake error messages to trick targets into executing malicious commands. But in this case, the instructions are disguised as helpful troubleshooting guides on legitimate AI platforms.\n\nKaspersky details a campaign specific to installing Atlas for macOS. If a user searches \"chatgpt atlas\" to find a guide, the first sponsored result is a link to chatgpt.com with the page title \"ChatGPT™ Atlas for macOS – Download ChatGPT Atlas for Mac.\" If you click through, you'll land on the official ChatGPT site and find a series of instructions for (supposedly) installing Atlas.\n\nHowever, the page is a copy of a conversation between an anonymous user and the AI—which can be shared publicly—that is actually a malware installation guide. The chat directs you to copy, paste, and execute a command in your Mac's Terminal and grant all permissions, which hands over access to the AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer) infostealer.\n\nA further investigation from Huntress showed similarly poisoned results via both ChatGPT and Grok using more general troubleshooting queries like \"how to delete system data on Mac\" and \"clear disk space on macOS.\"\n\nAMOS targets macOS, gaining root-level privileges and allowing attackers to execute commands, log keystrokes, and deliver additional payloads. BleepingComputer notes that the infostealer also targets cryptocurrency wallets, browser data (including cookies, saved passwords, and autofill data), macOS Keychain data, and files on the filesystem.\n\nIf you're troubleshooting a tech issue, carefully vet any instructions you find online. Threat actors often use sponsored search results as well as social media platforms to spread instructions that are actually ClickFix attacks. Never follow any guidance that you don't understand, and know that if it asks you to execute commands on your device using PowerShell or Terminal to \"fix\" a problem, there's a high likelihood that it's malicious—even if it comes from a search engine or LLM you've used and trusted in the past.\n\nOf course, you can potentially turn the attack around by asking ChatGPT (in a new conversation) if the instructions are safe to follow. According to Kaspersky, the AI will tell you that they aren't.",

    "fullText": "Investors are fixated on artificial intelligence and the mega-cap tech giants driving much of the stock market's gains. But Goldman Sachs says the bigger opportunities next year may come from somewhere else.\n\n\"At the sector level, we expect the 2026 acceleration in economic growth will boost EPS growth most in cyclical sectors including Industrials, Materials, and Consumer Discretionary,\" Goldman's analysts wrote in a Thursday report. The analysts noted that the firm's broader forecast also incorporates easing tariff pressures.\n\nIn line with that view, the analysts said that they expect earnings per share of real estate companies to rise from 5% this year to 15% next year, while those in consumer discretionary are expected to increase from 3% to 7%.\n\nIndustrial companies are also set for a major rebound, with EPS growth forecast to accelerate from 4% to 15%.\n\nSigns of this shift are already showing up in market action.\n\nIn a separate Friday report, Goldman noted that cyclical stocks have surged, beating defensive names for 14 trading days through Thursday — the longest streak in more than 15 years.\n\nEven so, Goldman analysts say the recent outperformance still isn't enough to reflect the firm's more optimistic growth outlook. Market positioning within equities suggests investors expect growth closer to 2% — well below Goldman's 2.5% forecast.\n\n\"Despite the cyclical rebound and widespread economic optimism in our client conversations, the market does not appear to be fully pricing the likely economic acceleration in 2026,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThat acceleration is central to Goldman's view. The bank's analysts wrote that they expect overall US growth to pick up next year, which would help drive a 12% rise in S&P 500 earnings per share.\n\nGoldman's latest reports arrive as investors continue to debate whether the stock market is drifting into a speculative bubble fueled by AI enthusiasm.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 16% this year, with the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap tech stocks now accounting for roughly one-third of the index's weight.\n\nShares of AI chip maker Nvidia — the world's most valuable publicly traded company — have climbed 30% this year alone.\n\nLast month, Goldman's analysts wrote that the market may have already priced in most of the potential gains from AI.",

    "title": "The year coding changed forever",
    "description": "Optimism, laziness, and magical thinking: The year vibe coding took over tech.",
    "fullText": "Sriraam Raja, the founding engineer at the software company Decode, has been using generative AI to write code for two years. He says he can get projects done about twice as fast when he uses a chatbot to code with intention. Then one day, he fired off directions, and as he sat there while the bot's wheels turned, he realized he could have actively written what he was aimlessly waiting for the bot to do. \"I was giving away a bit of my agency, and so I made a decision to be very conscious,\" he tells me.\n\nRaja has become \"very specific about when I delegate, and also how much I delegate,\" he says. Waiting for the AI to spit out code can disrupt the flow of his work, and trusting too much work to it has led him to sometimes get bogged down in a lengthy review process. He's also anxious about the long-term effects AI can have on how we all think and problem solve. \"There's a side effect where everyone's confidence has increased, but so has their laziness, and their willingness to learn things from first principles has dropped,\" he says. \"I've definitely seen a drop in curiosity that I haven't seen before, and so that worries me.\"\n\nThe Collins dictionary made vibe coding its 2025 word of the year. Coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy in February, the term refers to using language and generative AI to speed up the coding process. Soon after, companies were adding it as a desired skill in job listings.\n\nVibe coding was the catalyst for the sort of vibe work era we've entered. It's a shift in how people think about their roles and relationships to work amid an AI boom, and software engineering, long considered a stable and lucrative career path, has perhaps been the career most scrutinized and pushed down a path toward automation. Product managers have suggested that AI will supercharge them, allowing them to take on some technical coding tasks and work without engineers.\n\nExecs have been all-in: Mark Zuckerberg said he expected AI to write half of Meta's code within a year; this spring, AI was already doing about a third of code at Google and on some Microsoft projects. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted in March that 90% of code would be generated by AI in three to six months. The bullish estimate hasn't materialized for most, but Amodei said in October the company's AI tool Claude was writing most of the code at Anthropic. Cognition, which built an AI-powered software engineer it named Devin, is now valued at $10 billion. Some without computer science backgrounds or any training in coding are vibe coding their own projects.\n\nVibe coding isn't yet the miracle that AI evangelists have professed. AI-generated code can have sneaky errors that pose security risks. As it takes on the work of junior developers, companies eager for gain could displace humans. Time banked with shortcuts now could disrupt training ground for learning basic coding skills, creating a tech worker career ladder collapse could ricochet through the industry. There is potential for developers to save time, to use AI to learn new languages and skills (something Raja tells me he's done), and to pare down their technical debt, or code that needs maintenance. But the impact of AI on the industry is more complicated than it is a silver bullet to efficiency.\n\nLast year, \"we were dealing with a lot of optimism and a lot of magical thinking\" around the capabilities of AI, says Tariq Shaukat, CEO of Sonar, a company that provides developers with tools to verify code. \"The vibe engineering tools are producing a lot of quantity. It's getting more functionally correct, but it's actually becoming more difficult to determine the quality and get the level of trust that you need to integrate that into your code base.\" The ranks of AI holdouts among developers are shrinking. A 2025 survey of professional developers from Stack Overflow found that only 19.3% don't use AI, and a commensurate 19.7% have an unfavorable opinion of AI. Yet less than 3% of respondents said they highly trust AI for accuracy.\n\nAnyone who has asked a chatbot a question knows that even a short inquiry often results in a verbose response. The same is true of code — when AI generates it, it's typically longer, making the possibility of errors hiding in the code more likely. Amy Carrillo Cotten, senior director of customer transformation at software development company Uplevel, told me in September: \"For a lot of engineers, the only thing that looks different is where they spend their time, not exactly how much time it took.\" Uplevel studied 800 software developers last year and compared the productivity levels of those who used GitHub's Copilot to those who did not. The developers who used Copilot weren't more efficient or less burnt out, and their code had bugs in it 41% more frequently. (GitHub's own research found that those who used Copilot wrote about 18 lines of clean code, compared to 16 lines for those who didn't.) For many, that shift from writing to reviewing code is \"not the job they signed up for,\" Shaukat says, which brings a big adjustment for many developers.\n\n\"The job looks completely different,\" says Frank Fusco, CEO of a software company called Silicon Society. His company works with clients on their software, but now they often get amateur, vibe coded versions of those ideas as the starting point. \"What I would normally do in code that would take me days, I now do in words and it takes me hours.\" But Fusco tells me he worries about a decline in critical thinking and basic coding skills. We're \"hardwired,\" he says, to find \"the shortest path to the solution.\" But that approach isn't the best for sharpening coding skills. \"It really is a muscle that you have to work all the time.\"\n\nIt's tricky to say AI is already killing developer jobs. Years of layoffs and \"right-sizing\" in the tech industry, paired with the economic precarity that has also defined 2025, could be shifting industry roles alongside AI. As of November, there were about 92,500 active job postings seeking software engineers, down from nearly 102,000 last November and 159,000 at the start of 2023, according to data from CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry. The number of active tech job posts overall has fallen, from 621,000 in early 2023 to 433,500 last month. But the proportion of open jobs looking for AI skills has jumped by 53% this year.\n\nAfter two decades of being told to pursue computer science as a stable career and a proliferation of coding bootcamps, working as a developer may not be as cushy. College seniors studying computer science are more likely than any other discipline to say they're \"very pessimistic\" about their careers, according to a 2025 survey from early career website Handshake. They're the group most likely to say the advances of generative AI have made them regret their major choice. But young people are divided — 43% of computer science majors said they think AI will have a positive effect on their careers.\n\nAutomation is in some ways marking \"a correction\" on the developer labor market, says April Schuppel, developer relations manager at software company Apryse. Before AI, \"we needed as many people who were really pushing out the code to take the ideas of the visionaries and bring them to life.\" Now, \"the people who have always been able to make the most impact, they're still the ones that are the safest.\" Developers who looked at their jobs as clearing tickets might be more replaceable than those who were creative and cared about the project from start to finish. We're far from realizing the end game of vibe coding, but for creative, forward-thinking developers, there's optimism for now. \"The more well-rounded people are the ones that are going to have success,\" Schuppel says.\n\nAI could bring more opportunity for software testers, and also help companies pare down their technical debt. The developer job market might look messy right now, but there's still a heavy focus on the human aspect of the career than in the picture painted by some Big Tech execs. \"If there are opportunities for more fine-tuned models, more specialized models that only do certain types of code updates, and there is a way to use that more to augment human developers as opposed to replace, that seems like that's where this is going,\" says Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA.\n\nCodebases are valuable, and the security risks posed by goofs in AI code are serious threats. Traffic to vibe coding sites slumped in September after a summer of hype. Even Karpathy said his latest project is \"basically entirely hand-written (with tab autocomplete)\" in a post on X. \"I tried to use claude/codex agents a few times but they just didn't work well enough at all and net unhelpful.\" If 2025 was the year tech companies went all in on AI, 2026 might be the year when some of the craze around vibe coding subsides and reality sets in.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "title": "New AI and video tech is taking the danger and guesswork out of this punishing Air Force job that hasn't changed in 50 years",
    "description": "Tanker maintenance workers spend their days crawling in and out of fuel tanks. New tech might make a hard job a little easier.",
    "fullText": "Inside some of the Air Force's oldest refueling aircraft, technicians are crawling through tight, dirty spaces, painstakingly cleaning sealant on fuel tanks and tightening loose rivets.\n\nThey climb into the dark, cramped tanks with little more than a flashlight, some tools, and shaky comms. It can be hard to breathe, the air smells like jet fuel, the fixes aren't always clear, and the punishing work can be dangerous if done wrong.\n\nIt's a job that hasn't changed much in over 50 years, but new gear, including a live-feed video headset and artificial intelligence-enabled technology, is finally bringing it into the 21st century.\n\nThe Integrated Respirator Information System, known as IRIS and developed by MetroStar and ActionStreamer, is speeding up the maintenance process, company officials and Air Force technicians say, and making it safer and more efficient.\n\nTankers are important logistics assets, what the Air Force calls \"silent enablers,\" that support missions by helping keep fighters and bombers airborne for longer than the onboard fuel tanks can sustain alone. For instance, Operation Midnight Hammer, which saw US stealth bombers strike Iran's nuclear site this year, involved dozens of refueling tankers supporting the strike package.\n\nAlthough fighter aircraft like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter or bombers like the B-2 Spirit get the most attention, tankers like the KC-135 Stratotanker are critical to US and allied airpower. For them to be useful, though, they have to be well-maintained.\n\nIRIS began as an idea from two maintainers who noticed the broader potential of ActionStreamer's live-streaming tech — gear originally built for athletes to capture first-person views during games. The Air Force technicians pursued the concept for years, even as they rotated through new assignments and bases.\n\nThe Air Force had long believed that tools like this could be a major boost for maintainers. There were early forays into video tech in the 2000s, but the \"technology wasn't quite there,\" Master Sgt. Troy French, a former 100th Maintenance Squadron member, told Business Insider. \"An initial phase of this was kind of set up and abandoned because cameras weren't small enough.\"\n\nNow, though, Air Force maintainers based at Royal Air Force Mildenhall, a central refueling base for the US missions in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, have been testing out IRIS.\n\n\"They were, to be honest with you, a little apprehensive to start with,\" ActionStreamer CEO Bob Lento said, noting it was the first significant change to how technicians have done their jobs in years. But by the end of the first week, attitudes had flipped. \"We were taking the cart out of the hangar into a safe area to do some software punch-ups, and they were like, 'Wait a minute, where are you going with that? We need to use that now.'\"\n\nOn a tanker aircraft like the KC-135, there's a hole just big enough for a person to fit through under the wing. It's the access point for the fuel tanks. \"You crawl up there and you contort your body to be able to lie down flat and then put your feet in,\" French said. Inside, it is a tight space with lots of bumps and edges.\n\nThe workers wear heavy protective suits to guard against fuel exposure and keep sweat out of the tanks. They carry a flashlight and breathe through respirators that feed fresh air in from a hose running outside the aircraft.\n\nOutside the aircraft, a support team stands by. One person runs tools to the person inside the tank while another monitors for any hazards or issues.\n\n\"If you need something, sometimes you just have to peel the respirator back, like, 'Hey, I need this extra wrench that I forgot,'\" French said.\n\nThe runner will grab it and bring it to the entry point, screaming into the tank or pulling on the respirator hose to get the technician's attention. \"If you're really deep in the tank, then you have to crawl back to get it from them, and you have to wait there for them to bring it, reducing the amount of time you're actually working.\"\n\nBefore a worker enters the aircraft, they'll know what issues they're looking for. A broken rivet, for instance, along with regular fuel tanker maintenance to keep the aircraft operating. But sometimes they adjust a different part in the wrong area of the refueling aircraft or leave a tool inside the tanker.\n\nThere's a lot of double-checking the work. Steps like removing sealant, cleaning, and putting adhesion in the tank require approval from other team members. It's inherently an hourslong job made even longer by wait times and communication lags.\n\nAnd that's if it all runs smoothly. Sometimes, technicians make mistakes, extending the time. \"A simple sealant job can turn from a couple of hours of scraping and then eventually reapplying to another day because it turned out that you applied it to the wrong spot,\" Tech Sgt. Chris Anderson, with the 100th Air Refueling Wing, said. \"The way that we did things left a lot of room for error.\"\n\nA logical fix, Frank said, was something wearable: \"a camera with two-way audio would be awesome, and if it had lights, that'd be a second bonus.\"\n\nThe IRIS technology sits on top of the face mask tanker maintenance workers wear. It features a high-definition video camera, a two-way comms system that goes inside the mask, and a hands-free light. IRIS shows everything the technician is looking at to those outside the fuel tank and allows them to communicate with their team.\n\nIt connects to a mobile workstation outside the aircraft. On the cart, which can host up to four IRIS units simultaneously, the support team can see what the technician sees, talk them through the work, and record the footage.\n\nVideo records help verify what each shift completed and resolve disputes quickly. For instance, Anderson said that the day shift had cleared a fuel puddle, but the next shift found one and questioned the work. IRIS showed that the first team had done the job, revealing, as French said, \" another problem, something's leaking.\" That prevented unnecessary rework and let them fix the issue.\n\nIn the past, a tricky aircraft issue could halt work while the right Air Force experts traveled in to assess it. Now, IRIS can send video to them instantly or launch a group call so everyone can see exactly what the technician sees.\n\nDevelopers also see AI playing a growing role in streamlining the job. As a technician uses IRIS, an AI agent compiles images and data to make requests, anticipate needed work, and handle forms. That frees technicians from what retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Cedric George called \"shallow work,\" so when their shift ends, \"all he or she has to do is button up, clean up, go home.\"\n\nIRIS is currently in use only at Mildenhall, but early results are promising, as the Air Force considers expanding it to other bases. Technicians using the system haven't had any safety incidents, and inspections are running 60% faster in test environments, according to pilot evaluations and internal logs. Based on KC-135 maintenance baselines, MetroStar estimates IRIS could save 35,000 maintainer hours and add more than 7,000 aircraft availability days.\n\nGeorge attributed the success of IRIS to the technicians who wanted to revamp the decades-old process to make it better for future workers. \"This is not for the faint of heart, it's dirty work,\" he said, saying current technicians who worked on IRIS believe future maintainers \"have to have something better than what we have now.\"",

    "fullText": "He rewrote the rule book with Rockstar then left it all behind. Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queens\n\nThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and 12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.\n\n“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”\n\nAt first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now they are the medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of Seismic Games and Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.\n\nIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.\n\n“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”\n\nTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?\n\n“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”\n\nHaving turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.\n\nAlso in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”\n\nHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects to Grand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”\n\nWe talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.\n\n“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”\n\n“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game about that’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”\n\nSo he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”",

    "title": "From trees to graphs: speeding up vector search 10x with Hannoy",
    "description": "This is a walkthrough of a new LMDB-based HNSW Rust vector store with drastically better performances than the previous random-projection-based one. This is a disk-based HNSW highly vector store inspired by the DiskANN technology and is now used by default in Meilisearch.",
    "fullText": "This article aims to address several limitations of the current vector database used by Meilisearch, and to introduce hannoy: a graph-based alternative to arroy using LMDB, which is already part of Meilisearch since v1.21 (Sept 15) as experimental and the default one since v1.29 (Dec 8).\n\nEarly testing has shown that the new system can reduce indexing times from 2 days to 2 hours, decrease the on-disk index size by a factor of 2, and speed up search by ~10 times. When it was first put into production on an instance with indexing difficulties, it reduced the indexing latency from 2 months to... 6 seconds.\n\nTo illustrate why this is the case, I'll run through some key heuristics of graph ANN algorithms and share a few snippets from the code that are particularly illustrative. Finally, we'll share some benchmarks comparing the new solution to what's currently in Meilisearch today.\n\nI am not a Meilisearch employee or affiliated with the company in any way other than being a co-author on their new vector database.\n\nI first became aware of Meilisearch back in March, when my company began considering their enterprise solution for hosting and indexing our collection of ~10 million documents. As any sane person would do, I stalked their GitHub and was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of in-house crates they maintained and used in their search engine. Amongst them was arroy: a k-d trees inspired vector database, based initially on Spotify's similarly named project: annoy.\n\nWasting no time, I made my first open source contribution ever to the repo and... welp, it's still not merged 😔. But hey, as the French say: that's life.\n\nFortunately, I was still able to merge a few other PR's in the meantime and learn more about how the algorithm worked. The back and forth I had with other devs throughout the process (notably with @irevoire) was instructive and overall made it a pretty enjoyable experience.\n\nAfter a couple of months of working on arroy, I naturally became aware of a few unsavoury trade-offs that lurked beneath the surface, and which ultimately motivated me to pursue a new approach.\n\nArroy is a k-d tree-based ANN algorithm, meaning that during indexing, you construct an ensemble of random partitions of your vector space, and at runtime, you search through them all simultaneously. To be more precise, it's random-projection-based.\n\nVisually, that process looks like the pic below:\n\nA widespread criticism of this type of approach is that search performance and latency degrade when the dimension of the embeddings exceeds about 20. Let's try to understand why.\n\nLooking at the code, we see that leaf nodes store as many vectors as the embedding dimension. This is a good and bad thing. In the extreme case where \"one leaf equals one vector\", e.g., you have a binary tree, each tree has height log2(n). By grouping d-many vectors in a leaf, trees can be built much faster since they only have height log2(n/d). For 1 million vectors of dimension 768, the numbers work out to building trees with heights of 10 versus 20; that's a 2.6 MiB versus 1.9 GiB in storage overhead for a single tree. This makes arroy B-tree-like, which is cool.\n\nWhere this is problematic, however, is at search time since you need to compare the query to each vector in a leaf. Even if you're only trying to retrieve the 10 nearest-neighbours, you still need to do 768 distance calculations 😔. That adds significant latency during retrieval.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no \"nice\" compromise; if you make leaves more granular, you need to store more nodes in the tree, which increases the index size in memory and exponentially increases build times, as we've seen.\n\nWhen using binary vectors and a bit-sampling hash, the memory overhead is just a single usize per node indicating the position of the random bit. This is the only case where we can afford to generate deeper trees, as storing a node on disk incurs next to no cost.\n\nAnother big problem with arroy is that the indexing algorithm is extremely read-heavy. That makes sense given that to create a hyperplane, you need to randomly sample points from the current node to generate clusters. The impact of this is so high that in some builds, over 90% of the time is spent doing IO and in page faults - a problem that only grows exponentially with dataset size. This phenomenon is still unresolved, as documented in arroy#145.\n\nOperational concerns aside, it's also just difficult to maintain arroy. There's a lot of mental gymnastics involved in understanding the recursive tree balancing algorithms, the creation and merging of temp files during partial builds, and the heuristics for auto-selecting build parameters. But hey, maybe that's a skill issue on my part.\n\nCurrent state-of-the-art ANN libraries employ graph-based approaches to achieve the optimal trade-off between search time and recall performance. Here, a navigable graph is built over all points in the database, and search is performed using a best-first traversal in log time. So rather than imposing structure on the dataset via separating hyperplanes like in arroy, techniques like HNSW and DiskANN focus more on building up pathways between points in local neighbourhoods.\n\nIf you haven't already read it, I'd recommend Pinecone's fantastic blog post on Faiss and the hnsw to get a working mental model of how these algorithms work. For the academically inclined, the original paper is also quite insightful.\n\nFor the search to converge quickly to the (approximate) nearest neighbour, the graph needs to satisfy what's known as the sparse neighbourhood graph (SNG) property. Put simply, points in a local neighbourhood of x should be closer to x than they are to each other. For the mathematically inclined, this property reduces to the relations below :\n\nThis equation is the \"secret sauce,\" if you will, of graph ANNs. Both the HNSW, DiskANN, and hannoy! rely on this to ensure efficient search.\n\nVector search over a graph has several advantages over space-partitioning approaches. First of all, it's extremely cheap to store node edges on disk at around ~200 bytes per vector even without using compressed bitmaps (which we do). For another, disk reads and distance computations at search time are significantly reduced as neighbours are explored one at a time instead of in large chunks. Insertions and deletions are also much simpler using a graph, as we only need to update the incoming/outgoing links from the modified nodes. In contrast, in arroy these operations potentially trigger tree re-balancing right up to the root.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, arroy is still great in the sense that it's disk-based, being built on top of LMDB. This means that you can build and search through indexes that are much larger than your machine's RAM using mmap. For reference, many popular HNSW implementations operate entirely in RAM, which is fast but requires multiple nodes and partitioning if the dataset becomes too large. So arroy was pretty avant-garde in that respect.\n\nHannoy is a graph-based successor to arroy with KV-backed storage via LMDB.\n\nThe goal of hannoy is to combine the best of both worlds from arroy and graph ANNs into a production-ready vector database that maintains and improves upon key metrics vs the legacy system. What's also neat is that it makes heavy use of crates maintained by the Meilisearch devs, such as heed, roaring-rs, and steppe.\n\nIts implementation is inspired by a few projects, notably Faiss' HNSW and the hnsw crate, but with significantly more support for zero-copy semantics, persistence, SIMD, and online updates & multi-phase indexing. There are also several novel techniques inspired by research papers to handle tasks such as graph merges and layer exploration.\n\nThe most interesting engineering challenge of the project was determining how to handle incremental insertions and deletions to the graph over its lifetime. After all, we expect users' databases to grow over time, and not all their data is available immediately. The industry standard for graph algorithms had been to periodically rebuild the index either on a cron-like schedule or after sufficient updates had accumulated. The FreshDiskANN paper summarizes this issue with this type of approach succinctly:\n\nIt would take about 1.5-2 hours on a dedicated high-end 48-core machine to build a good-quality HNSW index over 100M points. So we would need three dedicated machines for constantly rebuilding indices to maintain even six-hourly freshness guarantee over a billion point index. [1]\n\nLuckily for us, Microsoft has already solved this problem. The idea essentially boils down to avoiding eager updates to the graph by orchestrating a streaming delete/insert/merge operation once the size of a particular in-memory temporary index reaches a critical size. While this is certainly a proven strategy, with hannoy we aimed to implement something a bit less complicated, but which still makes liberal use of techniques from DiskANN (even though technically hannoy is an HNSW).\n\nWhen items are added or deleted from the graph, a special Updated key is written to the database pointing to the modified node. Before building the index, we generate a bitset of items that are (i) new, (ii) modified, or (iii) removed & pass those to the HnswBuilder. The deletion bitset plays a special role at the end of the build where instead of just removing any edge $(e,d)$ between an existing and deleted item, we explore the neighbourhood of $d$ to patch the links of $e$ à la DiskANN. This prevents \"gaps\" from appearing in the graph and ensures search still converges quickly (recall that SNG property from earlier 😉).\n\nThe code below shows how we accomplish this in hannoy:\n\nAnother interesting feature of hannoy is how the new graph (in RAM) is merged with the old one (from disk, in LMDB). For each batch of points to be inserted, we build a brand new HNSW in RAM. To ensure that this new graph connects to the old one, we reschedule the entry points of the old graph for re-indexing in the new one. Every time we need to access an item's links, we look in both memory and LMDB. This way, we can establish connections with the larger disk-based index in a lazy manner. This is essential, as otherwise, any new vectors inserted into the database after the initial build would be unreachable; you'd only be able to search in disjoint graphs, and recall would suffer.\n\nThis strategy actually works well in practice ! By re-indexing <<1% of the vectors in the original graph, we're able to merge on-disk and in-memory indexes seamlessly. To the best of my knowledge, this is a novel technique that no other HNSW implementations utilize for handling incremental builds, and it is essential to the use case at Meilisearch, where batch insertions are heavily used.\n\nThere are tons of other cool sub-problems like those that we address in hannoy, but I'll save those for another post. The important part to retain here is that hannoy is \"a DiskANN-inspired HNSW implementation with LMDB-backed storage\".\n\nI like making unsubstantiated claims about the performance of my system as much as the next guy, but there comes a point when it's time to share some hard numbers. That time is now!\n\nTo facilitate comparison between the old system and the new one, we'll utilize the trusty vector-store-relevancy-benchmark from Meilisearch, as featured in previous blog posts. The important metrics we'll be comparing are recall (1, 10, 50, 100), indexing time, retrieval latency, and disk usage for various datasets with differing embedding dimensions. To simplify the process, we'll run the benchmark on 1 million documents using cosine as the indexing/retrieval distance metric in full precision. We'll also run the benchmark using each database's preferred quantization format.\n\nWhen quantization is enabled, arroy by default uses the cosine distance over the [0,1]-valued vectors. In hannoy, we've noticed that the hamming distance between binary strings (x^y) is vastly more performant in both speed and recall. Intuitively, the speed part makes sense as the distance computation reduces to popcnt's !\n\nThe results I'll be sharing are cherry-picked from the much more complete benchmarking summary in hannoy.\n\nNote that the reported search latency numbers represent the cold-start times. In reality, search times will speed up as more of the database is loaded into the page cache. From the flamegraph below, we can see that ~25% of our time is spent on mdb_get calls, so running a few warmup queries could significantly reduce retrieval times.\n\nAs you can see from these numbers, hannoy certainly improves upon all of the metrics we discussed - and by quite a large margin. In some cases, indexing times drop by nearly 10x, while the same amount improves search latencies.\n\nHaving a bit of free time on my hands, I thought I'd tackle writing the Python bindings for hannoy using pyo3. With these in place, it becomes much easier to integrate the project with the renowned ANN Benchmarks leaderboard.\n\nWhat's cool here is that even with the log(n) lookups from LMDB and potential page faults in our mmap, we're still beating in-memory annoy (arroy but in C) and competitive enough with Faiss' implementation. This graph indicates that we still have some work to do in terms of performance. Still, considering it was an initial implementation thrown together fairly quickly, it's certainly a good start. The most essential things for hannoy are ensuring that we keep the same API as arroy to facilitate integration in Meilisearch, and of course, that it improves on the metrics with respect to the previous system.\n\nI covered a lot of ground in this blog post, but still haven't answered the essential question \"Why the HNSW and not DiskANN?\" - and to be honest, I still don't have a satisfactory answer.\n\nOn one hand, the HNSW seemed the easiest out of the two to implement, given our constraint of using LMDB as a storage backend (DiskANN has a lot of async IO going on to maximize throughput on SSD reads, which aren't as straightforward to implement using mmap). From another perspective, HNSW is the gateway to graph ANNs and seemed like a good first approach to try out, validating whether this was a valid alternative to Meilisearch's prevailing vector database. If convincing results could be obtained with relatively little effort, it was certainly worth trying out. That being said, DiskANN and FreshDiskANN certainly influenced many of my design choices throughout, and I'm sure the project will evolve to resemble them more closely.\n\nI published this article everywhere on the internet, and if you want to comment, please take a look at Lobste.rs, Hackernews, Reddit, Twitter, Bsky or even post a comment in here 👇",

    "title": "Dark mode is essential, not a design preference",
    "description": "Dark mode is often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a necessity or assistive technology.",
    "fullText": "Dark mode has emerged as one of the most significant accessibility considerations in digital design, yet it is still often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a fundamental feature. Many organisations adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure accessibility compliance, but compliance does not always equate to usability.\n\nFor blind and low-vision users, as well as some neurodivergent individuals, dark mode is not just a preference—it is a necessity. It reduces glare, enhances contrast, and extends the time users can comfortably engage with digital content. Without it, users experience fatigue, headaches, and even an inability to complete tasks, ultimately leading to frustration, abandonment, and exclusion from digital services.\n\nWhen we speak directly to users with lived experience, the importance of dark mode becomes even clearer.\n\nDaniel describes why his phone is permanently set to dark mode:\n\n“My phone's permanently set on a dark mode to reduce the glare of any of the white screens or anything just blasting me in the eyes. It helps me use screens for longer so my eyes don't get as fatigued at the end of the day. Even people who have lost 99% of their vision still have a light sensitivity.”\n\nThis statement challenges a common misconception about blindness—many blind individuals still have some residual vision, and light sensitivity remains a significant issue. For them, bright screens are not just inconvenient; they are painful and actively reduce their ability to engage in digital work and communication.\n\nDan emphasises the connection between screen brightness and headaches and fatigue:\n“When you have this bright light just blasting you in the eyes, it's painful, it gives you headaches. Most of your job you're doing these days, you're looking at a computer screen. There are very few jobs where you're not looking at a computer screen. So if you want to extend how long you're able to do that work for, you need to try and get the most favourable conditions for your eyes.”\n\nThis highlights the occupational accessibility barriers that bright screens create. Digital tools should empower people to work efficiently, not force them into discomfort and early fatigue.\nAnother challenge with bright white backgrounds is the way it affects readability:\n“A bright white background is an issue because it causes bleeding into the other colours. So if you have thin black writing on a white background, the white's so bright that it kind of makes it hard to look at the black writing.”\n\nThis phenomenon, known as halation, makes text appear blurred or distorted for many users, reducing legibility and comprehension. Conversely, dark backgrounds with white text provide greater clarity. Patrick, who has a degenerative eye condition explains:\n“White text on a black background doesn't just look cool, it's much easier on the eyes. When I used white on black, it was easier because the print would stand out much more. Even looking at the time was much easier. The numbers would just jump at you.”\n\nFor users with low vision, neurodivergent conditions like dyslexia, and even those experiencing age-related vision decline, dark mode significantly improves readability and usability.\n\nDespite dark mode's widespread popularity, there is surprisingly little formal research or quantitative data on its accessibility benefits. However, after aggregating insights across multiple See Me Please user testing projects—each involving 18 diverse participants, including 3 blind, 3 with low vision, 3 neurodivergent, 3 Deaf or Hard of Hearing, 3 over 70, and 3 with limited English proficiency—we were struck by how often dark mode emerged as the most requested feature. It was consistently the top accessibility request across companies, often ranking higher than other common accessibility improvements. Based on our experience, we estimate that around 75% of our low vision testers and at least half of our blind testers express a strong preference or need for dark mode.\n\nThis aligns with broader user preferences, as many others—including neurodivergent users and those sensitive to screen brightness—also value dark mode for comfort and usability. While accessibility standards often overlook dark mode, our findings suggest it is a critical feature that enhances real-world usability for a wide range of users.\n\nDesign and development teams only have so much capacity, and when considering investments in accessibility, it's crucial to prioritise features that deliver the greatest impact for users. Our user testing strongly suggests that dark mode is not just a preference but a necessity, resonating far more than the collective value placed on embedded read-aloud features, which are often included on websites but rarely requested by people with a disability with the same urgency. If organisations are weighing accessibility investments, particularly in enterprise settings, thinking about how dark mode can be integrated—at least in new applications—could provide far greater usability benefits than other commonly implemented accessibility features\n\nWCAG provides an essential foundation for digital accessibility, yet it does not specifically require dark mode support. While it recommends sufficient contrast (WCAG 2.1, Success Criterion 1.4.3), the standard does not ensure that interfaces are comfortable for all users.\nStudies on dark mode’s impact show that:\n\nDespite these benefits, many organisations assume meeting WCAG contrast requirements is enough. However, true accessibility is about usability, not just compliance. If a user is technically able to read content but experiences discomfort, pain, or excessive strain, that content is not truly accessible.\n\nWithout dark mode, users often face severe consequences:\n\nFor businesses and government agencies, failing to offer dark mode creates barriers to service access, particularly for those who rely on assistive technologies.\n\nMany users rely on plug-ins and third-party tools like Dark Reader, Midnight Lizard, and Stylus to force dark mode on websites that don’t natively support it. While these tools provide short-term solutions, they are essentially overlays, which introduce several accessibility issues.\n\nOverlays modify the display at the browser level, rather than adjusting the UI in a way that is intended, tested, or optimised by the original developers. This can cause:\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about overlays is that they solve accessibility problems. In reality, they often introduce new barriers rather than removing them.\n\nThe key difference between pushing colour inversion with a plug-in versus native dark mode comes down to control and consistency. Colour inversion, when applied through a plug-in or system-wide setting, works as an overlay that forcibly inverts colours at the browser level rather than adjusting the UI as intended. This can cause significant distortions to images, icons, and visual elements, often making essential content unreadable— for example, a blue sky might turn orange, and important graphs or charts may lose their meaning. Additionally, colour inversion frequently results in inconsistent styling, breaking UI elements, making text difficult to read, and creating poor contrast ratios that worsen accessibility instead of improving it. Users often find themselves constantly adjusting settings, toggling between modes just to complete simple tasks, leading to unnecessary frustration and cognitive load.\n\nIn contrast, native dark mode is designed intentionally within an application to provide a seamless and accessible experience. It ensures proper contrast and readability, preserving the original intent of the design while keeping images and key visual cues intact. Native dark mode works smoothly with assistive technologies, including screen readers, and prevents the need for users to rely on third-party fixes. While plug-in-based colour inversion can serve as a temporary workaround, it is ultimately a patchwork solution that introduces new usability issues, whereas native dark mode provides a structured, user-friendly approach that truly enhances accessibility.\n\nAnother common workaround is colour inversion, available in operating system accessibility settings. This setting flips light to dark and vice versa, making bright screens easier to tolerate. However, this also inverts images, icons, and visual elements, which can:\n\nThis constant toggling between modes adds unnecessary cognitive load and frustration, making simple tasks time-consuming and exhausting.\n\nInstead of relying on overlays and forced inversion, websites and apps should natively support dark mode in their design. A well-implemented dark mode ensures that all visual elements are designed intentionally, avoiding the distortions caused by inversion, colour contrast and legibility are optimised for all users and dark mode can be toggled at the user’s preference, rather than relying on inefficient and frustrating workarounds.\n\nGlobally, over 2.2 billion people have some form of vision impairment, and 1 in 5 people are neurodivergent. Many of these individuals benefit from dark mode, making it a high-impact accessibility feature.\nMoreover, the value of offering dark mode and benefit so many more users. For example\n\nDark mode is not just a design trend—it is a fundamental accessibility need. While WCAG provides a great starting point, lived experience must drive digital accessibility efforts. By offering native dark mode support, organisations can create truly inclusive digital experiences and ensure that all users can engage comfortably and effectively.\n\nAs Mary, our wise blind tester said\n“We know what we need and we know what we want from programmes or apps. So it is always best to ask the user.”\n\nLets start listening on those who rely on accessible online services, rather than obsessing over WCAG conformance.",

    "description": "A retired lawyer lost the money in a tech support scam, a type of online fraud that is surging. Citibank said it couldn’t recover the funds, which criminals wired from inside his account.",
    "fullText": "David Welles, a retired lawyer, had been struggling with his new iPad for hours when he tried to call tech support.\n\nBut instead of dialing Microsoft to help him connect his email, the phone number he found on Google put him in touch with cybercriminals.\n\nThe smooth talking scammer who answered called himself Alex and built a rapport with Mr. Welles, assuring him that he could resolve his tech headaches. Before too long, Mr. Welles downloaded remote access software, both on his iPhone and his laptop, allowing the scammer to burrow deep inside of his devices, where he stored his username and passwords on his hard drive.\n\n“A big mistake,” said Mr. Welles, who is 87. “All of a sudden, on the laptop, I could see it going blank, and little lights flashing around.”\n\nThe scammer wore him down over a series of calls over nearly five hours, according to text messages and other records. Finally, a little after 7 p.m., Mr. Welles called his work assistant and told her he had been on the line with Microsoft all day.\n\nShe immediately sensed something was off.\n\nThey quickly called the scammer on a three-way call. But they had no idea Alex had already made a wire transfer of $85,000 from Mr. Welles’s checking account at Citibank.\n\nIt seems Citi didn’t immediately notice either — even after Mr. Welles and his assistant contacted the bank to alert it of the scammer, just three hours after the money left Mr. Welles’s account.\n\nCybercrime has become a global, industrialized operation that captures billions of dollars from Americans every year. Con artists create sophisticated schemes by exploiting basic tech — planting malicious ads bought from search engines or social media companies, buying phone lines and sending deceptive text messages from VoIP providers and more.\n\nThen they do their best to slide through the banking system undetected with their ill-gotten gains. If they can move money from a customer’s own account and devices, it’s far less likely to set off any alarm bells.\n\nAccount takeovers — including those similar to Mr. Welles’s— are surging, having tripled over the past five years, according to an analysis of Treasury data by David Maimon, a criminal justice professor and director of a cybersecurity research group at Georgia State University. In May, there were 16,556 reports filed to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, an arm of the Treasury known as FinCEN, up from 5,145 at the beginning of 2020.\n\n“From the bank side, almost everything looks legit” because the signals are coming from the customer’s electronic devices, said Professor Maimon, who is also head of fraud insights at SentiLink, a fraud prevention company.\n\nAmericans over age 60 lost roughly $982 million last year to tech support scams alone, one of the more lucrative frauds, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center. That figure is up 66 percent from 2023, but it’s still just a fraction of the estimated $16.6 billion cybercriminals took in 2024 overall, up 33 percent from the year before, and widely viewed as an under representation since so much fraud goes unreported.\n\nMany criminals move the stolen money using crypto or wire transfers, a method that carries weaker consumer protections than other electronic transfers made through online banking platforms. That issue is now at the center of a lawsuit — filed by New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, against Citibank — which argues that stricter rules should apply.\n\nWhen Mr. Welles and his assistant called Citi around 8 p.m. after they hung up with the scammer, the bank told him it would freeze his accounts. But the bank didn’t flag, or even mention, that $85,000 had been wired from his account just hours earlier, at 4:45 p.m.\n\nMr. Welles said he had checked for any suspicious withdrawals, noting his balance of about $20,000 — but had forgotten that he transferred a large sum a few days earlier to pay a tax bill.\n\nAs a 50-year client of the bank, Mr. Welles said he felt confident that the bank would pick up any unusual activity. But he still had trouble sleeping that night.\n\nThe next morning, he received a call from what appeared to be Citibank’s private bank on his caller ID. “Did you make an $85,000 wire?” asked a man who called himself Michael Wink. He reassured Mr. Welles that he didn’t need to call the bank because they were already on the case.\n\nBut it was the hackers calling him.\n\nMr. Welles and his assistant called the real Citibank, which confirmed that $85,000 had indeed left his account the afternoon before. The bank then initiated a recall on the wire, but it was too late — the money had landed at Wells Fargo and had already moved on to its next destination.\n\nHad Citi set off alarm bells the night before, when Mr. Welles first called, would he have been more likely to recover his money? Citi declined to comment on the specifics of his case.\n\nThe bank refused to reimburse him, news that arrived in a letter nine days after the incident. “Based on the information provided and the results of our research, the transfer was made using your Citibank online credentials and were initiated using their registered device ID,” it said. “As a result, we’re unable to honor your claim.”\n\nWires have typically been governed by a part of the Uniform Commercial Code, designed for business transactions, which says that reimbursement isn’t necessary if “an agreed-upon commercially reasonable security procedure is in place” and the bank proves it accepted the wire order in good faith.\n\nBut Attorney General James’s legal action asserts that greater protections for consumers are warranted: She argues that Regulation E, the rules part of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, known as EFTA, should apply when wires are made available online and through mobile banking apps. That requires banks to reimburse victims, as they do with other electronic transfers or debit card fraud, when their money is lost or stolen through unauthorized electronic payments — liability is generally limited to $500 if the bank is notified within 60 days.\n\nCarla Sanchez-Adams, a senior lawyer focusing on banking and payment systems at the National Consumer Law Center, agreed with the suit’s position and said transfers that were initiated the same way, electronically, should come with similar protections. From the consumer’s perspective, she added, “it’s all the same.”\n\nBanks argue the law is settled, and that bank-to-bank wire transfers are excluded from EFTA. But consumer advocates point out that when EFTA was written in 1978, wires were rarely used for consumers — and certainly not through online banking, which didn’t exist.\n\nIn January, a Federal District Court judge denied Citi’s request to dismiss New York’s suit, a decision that Citi appealed in September. A coalition of other banks and credit unions have lined up behind Citi, filing an amicus brief supporting its appeal to the Second Circuit.\n\nSome financial institutions are already threatening that a “seismic shift in regulatory treatment” could lead them to eliminate wires for consumers altogether.\n\nMr. Welles is still struggling to understand exactly how the fraudster pulled off the scheme. His private banker answered some of his security-related questions in an email, which said that “debit/pin verification” was used to add the wire recipient, and a one-time password was sent via text message to confirm the wire — both of which, it seems, the scammers had accessed. Mr. Welles later learned from a police report that the money was wired to an account registered under the name Adedela Sodiq at Wells Fargo.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesman declined to say if that account was closed or had been investigated.\n\nIn a statement, Citi said that it took client protection seriously, and that it had robust controls and processes in place. The bank said it also offered customizable alerts that customers could receive when transactions exceeded an amount they selected.\n\nThere isn’t a way to stop transactions above a certain amount from going through. When Mr. Welles asked his private bank representatives to call his adviser before making wires for more than $10,000, they told him the system itself determines the authentication required on a per-transaction basis, and it “would not be able to direct that a non-account owner be called for transactions over a certain amount,” according to their email correspondence last month.\n\nThe scam artists continued to torment Mr. Welles weeks later.\n\nHe received a call from someone calling himself Mark Wood, who claimed to be a senior investigator at Citi — and promised he would get his money back in a week or so. Mr. Welles emailed his private bankers about the incident to confirm it was indeed the fraudsters, which they did.\n\n“Fortunately, although a bit worse, I am still OK to make it through the few years I have left to live comfortably,” he said in the Sept. 24 email, but not psychologically. “Anxiety dreams,” he added.\n\nSusan C.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nGotion, backed by Volkswagen Group, said early this month that its battery packs had proved strong enough to power a ship with a loading capacity of 132 standard containers. The vessel, known as Puffer Fish Blue 01, developed by China's Wuhu Shipyard and Sandianshui New Energy Technology, had been certified by the China Classification Society, a professional body for ship classification, it added.\n\n\"Their investment and efforts to build pure electric container vessels show China's increasing influence in the global shipbuilding industry,\" said Xiong Hao, assistant general ­manager at Shanghai Jump International Shipping. \"It remains to be seen whether electric vessels will be widely accepted by global container liners.\"\n\nPeople visit a model of a nuclear-powered container ship at Marintec China 2025 in Shanghai on December 2, 2025.

    "title": "China leads research in 90% of crucial tech – a dramatic shift this century",
    "description": "The United States tops the remaining areas in an assessment of 74 technologies.",
    "fullText": "China is leading research in nearly 90% of the crucial technologies that “significantly enhance, or pose risks to, a country’s national interests”, according to a technology tracker run by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) — an independent think-tank.\n\nThe ASPI’s Critical Technology Tracker evaluated research on 74 current and emerging technologies this year, up from the 64 technologies it analyzed last year. China is ranked number one for research on 66 of the technologies, including nuclear energy, synthetic biology, small satellites, while the United States topped the remaining 8, including quantum computing and geoengineering.\n\nThe results reflect a drastic reversal. At the beginning of this century, the United States led more than 90% of the assessed technologies, whereas China led less than 5% of them, according to the 2024 edition of the tracker.\n\n“China has made incredible progress on science and technology that is reflected in research and development, as well as in publications,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, who researches China’s industrial policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a non-profit research organization based in Washington DC.\n\nMazzocco says the general trend identified by the ASPI is not a surprise, but it is “remarkable” to see that China is so dominant and advanced in so many fields compared with the United States.\n\nThis might have something to do with the type of technologies that are tracked, says Wang Yanbo, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong. The country is more likely to be a research leader in new technologies, where it has focused its efforts, compared to traditional fields where other country's lead, such as semi conductor chips, he notes.\n\nThe ASPI team based its analysis on a database that contains more than nine million publications from all around the world. It ranked nations in each technology by identifying the top 10% of the most-cited papers produced by researchers in a country over a five-year period, between 2020 and 2024, and calculated that country's global share.\n\nOne noteworthy finding is that China is outpacing the United States in cloud and edge computing, according to David Lin, a national security and technology strategist at the Special Competitive Studies Project, a non-profit organization based in Arlington, Virginia. Cloud computing enables artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train models and process data without the need for physical infrastructure, whereas edge computing processes data locally. China’s research intensity in these fields “probably reflects the urgency with which Beijing is moving AI from the lab into deployment”, Lin says.\n\nThe analysis should not be interpreted as “a collapse of American power”, says Steven Hai, a political economist focusing on technology innovation at Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University in Suzhou, China. In general, the United States is still an important player globally in these technologies, Hai says.\n\nJenny Wong-Leung, a data scientist at ASPI who participated in the study, warns that the findings show democratic nations risk losing “hard-won, long-term advantages in cutting-edge science and research” in a range of essential sectors, which is the crucial for the development and advancement of the world’s most important technologies.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-04048-7\n\nGrowing cities face mounting challenges\n\nChina accounts for more than half of leading output in the applied sciences\n\nGeothermal networks let cities warm and cool as one\n\nWill young universities set the pace in the age of AI?\n\nWhat would an AI university look like and how might it change education?\n\nChina is leading the world on AI governance: other countries must engage\n\nAustralia’s world-first social media ban is a ‘natural experiment’ for scientists\n\nChina is leading the world on AI governance: other countries must engage\n\nThe top US health director who stood up for science — and was fired\n\nJoin HZAU's global faculty team to advance research with competitive benefits.\n\nNo.1 Shizishan Street, Hongshan District, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China\n\nHuazhong Agricultural University (HZAU)\n\nChair Professors / Professors / Associate Professors / Assistant Professors\n\nGreat Bay University, China (GBU)\n\nseeking outstanding, innovative tenured/tenure-track Principal Investigators to establish independent research programs\n\nExceptional young scholars worldwide with strong research achievements in relevant fields\n\nInstitute of Nanotechnology and Intelligence (inAI), Jinan University, China.",

    "fullText": "A 52-year-old attorney said rising debt and years of her husband's tech spending have pushed her toward a breaking point. She recently told the \"I Will Teach You To Be Rich\" podcast that the strain has grown unmanageable.\n\n\"I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this,\" she said, explaining that stalled habits and rising balances leave the couple overwhelmed even with a strong household income.\n\nImani and Michael, 65, earn $268,000 a year and have been married for 24 years. They told financial coach and host Ramit Sethi their debt includes a mortgage, a home equity line of credit, a 401(k) loan and about $126,000 in high-interest consumer balances.\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nImani said she tracks every dollar and feels embarrassed by how far behind they are. Michael admitted he spends freely on electronics and has never planned financially.\n\nSethi said their pattern reflects a parent-child dynamic that develops when one partner manages most responsibilities and the other disengages. He added that the strain often affects trust and communication. The couple said they tried multiple budgeting systems and coaching sessions over the years, yet none produced lasting change.\n\nImani said the debt makes her \"want to cry and scream and fight,\" and added she is angry at Michael and herself.\n\nWhen Sethi asked whether Michael believed he would die with debt, he replied that avoiding that outcome \"is going to be a stretch.\" At one point, Imani considered walking out of the house with her youngest son because she felt exhausted by the financial pressure.\n\nTrending: Have $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nTheir exchanges show how spending habits fuel conflict. When Imani questioned a Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) purchase, Michael admitted he \"deflected\" and offered unclear plans to replace the money.\n\nSethi said the exchange revealed Imani stepping into an investigator role while Michael responded like \"a young boy,\" and he added that this parent-child pattern creates resentment on both sides. Michael acknowledged he rarely thinks long term and said, \"I don't think I've ever planned anything in my life.\"\n\nImani told Sethi she feels responsible for holding their finances together and worries that Michael, already at retirement age, may not be able to step away from full-time work. She said carrying most of the financial load has left her worn down.\n\nSee Also: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nMichael said money was never discussed in his childhood. His 20 years in the military created a structured environment where housing, pay and routine were predetermined.\n\nAfter leaving service, he said the transition to complete freedom led to years of spending without a system. He also described impulsive purchases, including buying vehicles during major life events.\n\nImani grew up in a household defined by budgeting and saving. She said she maintained strong habits until marriage, parenthood and shifting work demands weakened her discipline. Combining accounts, she added, contributed to spending that felt out of control and limited their ability to adjust when expenses rose.\n\nRead Next: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "fullText": "Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure\n\nFor states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.\n\nThe Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states who meet certain application criteria, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.\n\nAnalysts have noted that this $50bn will not be nearly enough to make up for the Congressional Budget Office’s projected $911bn reduction in Medicaid spending over the next decade under the bill (Obba). These cuts will affect both patients who lose free health coverage under Medicaid, and hospitals who benefit from those patients’ Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nChenhao Tan, associate professor of data science at the University of Chicago, and Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida’s college of AI and cybersecurity, said AI technology could provide major benefits to rural hospitals that are frequently under-resourced and under-staffed. They also agreed that AI has the potential to alleviate the administrative burden that physicians at these hospitals often face.\n\nPhysicians are responsible for taking detailed notes on patient visits and compiling them for electronic health records systems – a task that can take eight hours or more each week, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nA recent study found that AI generated patient notes are similar in quality to those of general physicians, but worse than those of expert physicians. Tan said that it’s important to take context – like frequent physician burnout in rural hospitals – into account when evaluating risks and benefits.\n\n“If the baseline is tired human doctors, then I think it is even easier to make an argument that AI may do better than them,” Tan said.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn hopes that AI can help alleviate rural hospital staffing issues, not only by reducing the workload but by attracting more doctors.\n\n“If the equipment is state-of-the-art, and they feel that much of the burdensome work is done by AI, I think this could be one incentive for physicians to go work in rural areas, this might have a great impact,” she said.\n\nThe FDA currently regulates AI technologies that are intended to evaluate and diagnose health conditions because they are considered medical devices. However, technologies that simply transcribe and compile patient notes are not regulated, though they may market themselves as Hipaa compliant.\n\nWhile Tan said it would be too high a bar to expect these technologies to be “bulletproof” before they can enter the market, he acknowledged that “there should be something higher than nothing,” in terms of regulatory requirements.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn also said that the proliferation of AI also creates additional cybersecurity concerns.\n\n“AI makes it easier for ordinary people to hack systems,” she said, adding that AI has the potential to improve patient safety by merging patient records from different providers so that, for example, every provider is aware of every medication that a patient is taking and can thus easily avoid dangerous medication interactions.\n\nBut this kind of technology will also require more privacy precautions.\n\n“The more data sharing there is, obviously the risk for data security breach is larger,” Chagal-Feferkorn continued.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Tan said “worker upscaling needs to go hand in hand” with the adoption of AI technology. But Tan and Chagal-Feferkorn both expressed concern that under-resourced hospitals will attempt to adopt AI technology as a cost-cutting measure without the necessary staff and safety infrastructure.",

    "description": "After going through multiple layoffs as a UX designer, Kelly Withers used her savings to fund her startup, Carmu, which sells yoga mats.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kelly Withers, 36, who lives outside Detroit and is the founder of Carmu, a yoga mat startup. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nAbout seven years ago, I was in my 20s and getting divorced. I was a single mom to a 2-year-old and a 3-year-old, with no outside help. I had no place to live and no full-time job. So I started coming up with ideas as fast as I could. How am I going to take care of these two kids? I felt alone.\n\nAt that time, I was doing photography to help restaurants build their brands. Then I went to a yoga class. When I walked in, every person had the same mat and the same outfit. I started thinking about my mom and how she raised us to be individuals and stand out. I had this idea that since I was designing so many things already, I would go home and try to design a mat so I could feel more like myself when I went to class.\n\nAbout a week before I went to place my order for all the mat designs, the pandemic hit, and I was back to square one. I also lost my photography clients, because restaurants were shuttered. I panicked because I had two tiny humans relying on me.\n\nSo, I started teaching myself design for tech, because it seemed much more lucrative. From everything I've ever heard, you go into the corporate world — that's how you have a comfortable life.\n\nI got a syllabus from an online boot camp, but I couldn't afford it. So, I bought a book on every topic. Then I hired a tutor for 30 minutes at a time to go over my work and my portfolio, to make sure I was doing it right. He worked at Microsoft. He told me how much money I would potentially make as a junior designer. I remember thinking, \"Well, I'm going to have to pretend I'm a senior designer.\"\n\nPretty much on my first interview, I got a corporate job doing UX design as a lead designer. I was bullshitting, so it was a little nerve-racking. Whenever I had a project, I'd run it by the tutor, just praying that I didn't get busted. I caught on quickly, and it was fine. I did that for a couple of years.\n\nEventually, there was a lot less work. So, I started panicking.\n\nI found another job, so then I had two. Sure enough, about a month later, layoffs hit, and our whole team from the first job got wiped out.\n\nPeople talk about corporate life and how that gives you security. In my experience, you're handing over your control, your finances, your future — and it's still a gamble. I can't live my life constantly betting on somebody else and somebody else's company.\n\nI've always been into design. I want to build something tangible. I ordered about 250 mats to start. The idea was that I would continue working in tech, and then I would soft-launch these as my side hustle. That way, if I ever got laid off again, I'd have some security.\n\nThe day my yoga mats got delivered to my house, I got laid off. I looked at it as a sign: Go all in. You have some savings. See what you can do. Within about a month, I sold out.\n\nI was like, \"Now what am I going to do?\" They're made outside the US, so it takes a while for them to get here. I took the few mats that I had left and reached out to style editors.\n\nI took the rest of my savings, and I bought 1,000 mats. It was a scary moment because I was living off those savings, too.\n\nPeople talk about entrepreneurship and say, \"Oh, it's so risky.\" Well, it isn't. If you have the product, I like to think of it as a calculated risk. At this point, if I'm being honest, it was the only way I could think of making money, as I could not get a job interview.\n\nThe company is named after my mom, Carolyn Mulligan, who passed away 10 years ago after she was hit by a car on her bicycle. She had just been on my mind, and I'm convinced that because she was so strong, she has something to do with how this is working out.\n\nThe day I launched, in May, I sent out this post on Instagram to announce it. My friend called me and said to open up Vogue. Hailey Bieber was on the yoga mat in the magazine. About a week later, GQ wrote about Carmu. From there, it was just enough leverage where I could take it all over the place. We got into Goop, and we got into Anthropology in Europe. It's just crazy because it's been such a little amount of time.\n\nWhen I got the next shipment of mats, I hadn't had an interview in tech for a year. With my business, I was profitable from day one.\n\nThe big question now is whether I want to have outside investment or do it myself. I believe I could find outside investment.

    "fullText": "AI won't change what it takes to be a good lawyer, according to one industry leader.\n\n\"So I actually think a lot of what makes an incredible lawyer today is still what will make one tomorrow,\" Winston Weinberg, Harvey's cofounder and chief executive, wrote during a recent Reddit Ask Me Anything chat.\n\nWeinberg, whose AI startup is already disrupting Big Law, said the best partners Harvey works with understand their business needs.\n\n\"I've found that the best partners are the ones that are incredible at understanding what the actual business needs are and framing an agreement based on that,\" Weinberg wrote. \"Same goes for litigation, it's who can come up with the best arguments/story not who is the best at going through emails in discovery.\"\n\nOverall, junior partners should try to get \"as much client experience as possible,\" Weinberg said.\n\n\"That's actually the main thing I pitch to firm leaders - they should focus more on giving juniors client experience, and be okay with them making some mistakes - that's how they become the best partners in the future,\" he wrote.\n\nLast week, Harvey reached a valuation of $8 billion, thanks to a recent funding round led by A16z. Weinberg said that no single company, including Harvey, will own the legal tech market.\n\n\"I don't think a single player is going to capture all of the pretty enormous amount of value that will be created in the next 10 years in this space,\" he wrote in the Reddit chat.\n\nAs for lawyers who want to follow in his footsteps, Weinberg said they need to get used to failure.\n\n\"Junior lawyers are often practiced perfectionists, and startups are all about risk, reward, and resilience,\" Weinberg told Business Insider after his Reddit chat. \"So I meant what I said--the biggest thing a lawyer who wants to work in the tech space should do is build up tolerance for failure.\"",

    "fullText": "Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Burnout is common. For $130,000 a week, this burnout clinic treats CEOs, founders, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals who require discreet and private care. Included: medical treatments, a midday IV, a personal trainer, and a private chef.\n\nBut first: The new wave of leaders is young.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, Download Business Insider's app here.\n\nForget big lecture halls, dream internships, or comfy full-time jobs.\n\nThere's a growing cohort of young professionals who are approaching their careers differently. They're torching the traditional playbook and doing things their own way in an effort to reshape industries and solve global challenges.\n\nWe've spent the past year interviewing \"young geniuses\" — the next wave of leaders, innovators, and builders who are taking unconventional approaches to work, some as early as high school.\n\nThese folks aren't just making a living, either. They're earning serious dough at a young age by building AI tools, moving fast, and raising money from investors willing to bet big on the AI race.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to 16 young founders this year who have collectively raised over $100 million. They're under the age of 27. Many are even teenagers.\n\nHere are some of their stories and advice for others.\n\nZach Yadegari sold his first app at 16 and cofounded an AI-powered nutrition app while he was still in high school. It's generating around $30 million annually. \"My advice to anyone would be to get started. Ignore the noise, ignore the people telling you that it's impossible to do it at a young age, and ignore the people trying to push you down a specific path to accomplish your goals.\"\n\nChristine Zhang turned down an internship to spend two months building an AI startup with her college roommate. By the end of the summer, they raised $1 million. She's taking a gap year from Harvard to focus on the startup. \"I had to delete my Instagram during the first week of classes so I wouldn't get FOMO. However, I don't regret my decision, and the feeling of missing out has definitely improved over time.\"\n\nArlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped out of high school to launch an AI coding agent startup that's raised $6.2 million. Both of his parents are entrepreneurs. He taught himself to code and founded his first company at the age of 15. \"Being young gives you a head start. There's still time if you fail, which is why young people try crazy things.\"\n\nAre you a young genius? In awe of what the kids are doing these days? Drop me a line and let me know what you think — srussolillo@businessinsider.com\n\nWhat are the values that define America? Liberty, patriotism — and thievery, as it turns out. From petty shoplifting to return fraud, everyday Americans are becoming small-time scammers.\n\nThey're not stealing from everyone — just the companies they deem big enough to weather the loss, or those they think are making money off their backs. But too much Robin Hood-ing could have unintended consequences for small businesses … and the rest of us who are still paying for things.\n\nWhile much of the broader labor market has been marked by slow hiring, it's also been cushioned by low levels of firing. That's not the case for the tech industry, though.\n\nUS tech companies have announced roughly 154,000 layoffs through November, according to Challenger. That's a 17% increase from the prior year and the most of any private-sector industry. These cuts have fueled fierce competition for roles. BI spoke to more than 20 tech professionals who are struggling to find work.\n\n\"It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman.\"\n\nWhen a jury returned an $11.5 million verdict to a former SHRM employee who sued for racial discrimination, CEO Johnny Taylor sent a clear message: The fight isn't over yet.\n\nIn a video seen by Business Insider, Taylor said the case lacked merit and would go down as \"just a blip in the history of SHRM.\" The company said in a LinkedIn post that it planned to appeal the decision.\n\nWhen Sima Sistani left her role as CEO at WeightWatchers, she called Oprah for advice. She told Sistani to take a year to say no to everything. Now, Sistani is an adjunct professor at Duke University, teaching a course on women's leadership.\n\nFor BI's Power Hours series, Sistani shared what a typical day in her life looks like — from reading a physical newspaper and prepping talking points for her class, to ending the day with a romance fantasy novel.\n\nDaily affirmations and less time on phones.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse.\"\n\n— Doug Shapiro, a media analyst and senior advisor at BCG, on media companies struggling to get people to engage with their content following Disney's deal with OpenAI.\n\nBI rode a Rivian spin-off e-bike around New York City\n\nBike fanatic and BI correspondent Jack Newsham took Also's TM-B e-bike for a spin around the city. Here's what happened.\n\nExclusive: Meta plans price hike for its virtual reality devices, internal memo shows.\n\nThe BI Today team: Steve Russolillo, chief news editor, in New York.

    "description": "The narrative of boom and bust is familiar—but also out of step with the possibilities of a new technology.",
    "fullText": "In the following weeks, with further help from me and A.I., Peter made a game based on the light-cycle duels in the movie “Tron,” complete with music and a score-keeping system. He sketched the beginnings of a “library simulator,” and finished his own arcade game, Dot in Space, about a tiny spaceship travelling at warp speed. Whenever he hit a potentially momentum-killing bump in the road, A.I. enabled us to roll through it. At my request, the systems began pointing us toward more sophisticated coding environments—Construct, GDevelop, Godot Engine, GameMaker—and suggesting more ambitious projects. Last weekend, he stayed up late, programming a polished version of Asteroids while wolfing down Cheerios and gulping from his water bottle as though it were an energy drink.\n\nSince Peter is a kid, and I’m a dad, all this can seem cute and quaint. Isn’t it nice that A.I. can help a young person learn to code, and an older one become a coding tutor? But consider what’s happening from a different perspective. In “The Wealth of Nations,” Adam Smith described the “acquired and useful abilities” of a worker as a kind of “fixed capital”—something akin to a hunk of real estate or piece of equipment. It wasn’t until the nineteen-sixties that an economist named Theodore Schultz coined the term “human capital” to describe the ongoing, dynamic process through which people invest in improving themselves. Schultz realized that individuals spend a lot of time, money, and effort becoming more capable. They go to night school, network, read self-help books, and tend to use their free time “to improve skills and knowledge.” The work of improving human capital often happens out of sight. But the “simple truth,” he argued, was “that people invest in themselves and that these investments are very large.” Schultz suggested that these investments, which improve “the quality of human effort,” might account “for most of the impressive rise in the real earnings per worker” that economists had observed in the preceding decades.\n\nToday, it’s obvious that companies and organizations benefit greatly from people with lots of human capital. Meetings are more useful when they involve knowledgeable participants; a product improves when the team building it possesses a wide range of skills. What’s less obvious is that companies and organizations simultaneously struggle to recognize and take advantage of changes in human capital. Suppose someone is hired to do one job, and then acquires skills that qualify her for another. Ideally, the organizational chart would shift around her as she becomes more capable; in practice, the job is often a prison. And when a worker breaks out of that prison, by getting a job elsewhere, she takes her human capital with her. For this reason, from the perspective of the company, it’s almost as though the ideal hire is someone who works feverishly to build up their human capital until their first day of work, and then suddenly slows down, becoming a highly skilled cog in the machine. Organizations want their workers to continue improving themselves—but not too fast, lest they outgrow the systems in which they’re enmeshed.",

    "fullText": "Instead of writing my tech comms predictions for next year like I did in 2024, I’ve written a fictionalized account of my day as a technical writer in 2030. It’ll be interesting to see whether we get there or not. Take it as a window into a possible future, one where AI usage is safer, more regulated, and better integrated with our workflows (as it should be).\n\nMy working day starts at 8:30am, after I’ve dropped my kids at school, rushed home, and prepared some coffee surrogate (nobody can afford real coffee anymore). I open the laptop and Chuck is there – it’s always there, like a trusty butler, ready to summarize what’s been going on in pull requests, Slack threads, Jira tickets, and a plethora of other information systems nobody can quite tame. Its summary connects the dots between my current priorities and what’s happening in the teams I’m attached to, helping me decide what to work on next. Trying to be helpful, it offers to deal with some of the mentions I’ve got by opening pull requests; I let it do so with a small docs bug. The rest I’ll want to deal with myself. It asks me how I feel and gently reminds me that I’ve still got some PTO available. Chuck’s such a class act.\n\nI’m in a team with several other technical writers, but for the most part I work with Chuck, which is what we call the in-house AI agent that we use. Chuck is a vast local language model capable of running on the M10 Silicon processor that powers my laptop. It’s a state-of-the-art multimodal LLM whose pedigree I can trace back to the last iterations of Claude Omni 7.5, before Anthropic went bankrupt and got acquired by Apple. As most corporate models, Chuck is ISO 42001, Turing, and EUAI certified, which means that it’s audited every year for security, governance, and legality of its training materials. Chuck is fine-tuned into several variants depending on the goal; the one I use is chuck-256b-writer. We run it in CI pipelines and locally in IDEs or CLI clients. We can also invite it to meetings as an artificial participant. I sometimes ask my own Chuck to attend calls on my behalf as Chuck-Fabri.\n\nThe thing I like the most about Chuck is that I can configure its specializations by turning modules on or off through the Silicon Brain app. When I want it to play the developer, I add several coding modules; when I want it to help me author docs, I turn on the style guide and grammarian modules, and so on. I can also ask Chuck to spawn copies of itself to roleplay users and readers based on support ticket and sales call interactions. When I do that, Chuck politely asks me to call it through other names, so as not to break character, something I duly comply with. Most system tools and APIs are already compatible with the agentic environment I use, so Chuck knows how to perform most operations on its own. An important detail: to summon Chuck, I need to first plug a physical key into the laptop. The key comes with a red button to immediately stop Chuck in case it starts operating bizarrely. Never had to use it.\n\nIt’s 11am already. I’ve been working with Chuck to write a new docs set for a new feature, telling it how I wanted the docs to fit into the existing architecture and instructing it to tweak and edit. It almost always gets 80% of the work done, though I often have to intervene to rearrange, cut, or otherwise rewrite sections. This hasn’t changed since the first days of GPT and it’ll never improve, because LLMs are not intelligent. They’re the most useful word automation tools at my disposal though, which I keep in check through deterministic tools and linters. Chuck is able to create diagrams, take screenshots of the product through an internal tool, and test the instructions and code snippets itself. When I feel unsure about its output, I ask it to verify what it’s just written through semantic internal search, or by calling its cloud cousin, Chad, which is able to provide answers from federated internal sources. All we do together, Chuck documents internally and remembers in its permanent context.\n\nEven though I’m using a local, non-monetized, and fully audited model that consumes the equivalent of a lightbulb worth of power, I still can’t shake the feeling of being a reverse centaur at times. It helps that Chuck comes with several built-in safeguards meant to prevent me from overworking or spending too much time without interacting with other human beings. At 1pm, which is lunch time in Spain, Chuck reminds me about taking a break. It refuses to continue if it detects stress in my text, vocal, or computer usage patterns. While my interactions with Chuck on the laptop are private and encrypted, it’s allowed to inform my manager or call my designated emergency contact in case of distress. I let Chuck access my vitals on the smartwatch and schedule calls with me on a regular basis to see how I’m doing. Since I work alone at home, this makes me feel somewhat safer.\n\nI didn’t tell you, but my current job title is Augmented Writer. My mission is to ensure that the words that humans and machines use to interact with our products are the most effective at reducing confusion and error, while they maximize effectiveness and user satisfaction. I’m augmented because I do this in concert with Chuck, which expands my existing skills in numerous ways. Without my brain, though, Chuck couldn’t do my job, because it doesn’t really care and, more importantly, because it’s not allowed to. One of the conditions imposed by the current legislation is that AI cannot operate in fully autonomous mode without human supervision. Our docs and UIs, in fact, bear a certificate of human authorship that discloses the amount of AI intervention. By law, all AI generated artifacts must produce fingerprinting patterns that can’t be tampered with, which is trickier with text, but since we must keep full audit logs of LLM usage, this can be established upon request by any competent authority, including the Turing police.\n\nIn the end, my role is more of an orchestrator than that of an author, and I’m fine with that. Software engineering, the field I serve, is an exercise in consensual imagination whose goal is to find repeatable ways of processing reality into manageable chunks of data. Reality is unmistakably raw and imperfect, a stream of floating points and broken strings running through distributed systems: one cannot tame it through clever algorithms, but it can be reduced to abstractions and data structures and binary blobs. Each of those entities has a name; they all relate to each other through words. It’s part of my job to understand those words and intervene when they don’t bring clarity. It’s then also my job to explain how those words are able to handle their parent reality. The docs I orchestrate with Chuck’s help are the artifacts that chronicle and explain the motions of data as it enters a machine and exits in shapes and configurations that are helpful to users.\n\nIt’s 5pm and I’m bidding Chuck farewell. During the night, it will work on some optional docs polish and politely present its work to me in the morning. As I log off and extract the hardware key from the laptop, I think that without the words Chuck and I produced, the machine would be opaque to its operators, a smooth wall without doors or handles. Product truth is at my disposal to weave into a fabric of meaning and possibility, into spells that unlock abilities in autonomous agents, be they organic or artificial. I am an enabler of thought and action. Getting here wasn’t easy, but I feel better knowing that I can continue defending the importance of words with the help of the most clever thesaurus ever created.",

    "description": "Though Nigel Williams is looking for AI proficiency, the BlackRock exec shared one part of the application process where the tech doesn't belong.",
    "fullText": "If you want to work at BlackRock, make sure you're using AI — just not too much.\n\nNigel Williams, BlackRock's global head of talent acquisition, said that AI is shifting his hiring priorities, and that fluency with the technology is now key to any strong application. However, he warns against depending on it in the interview process.\n\n\"We want to hire people that are curious, that understand that AI is here,\" he told Business Insider, especially because it's embedded in functions across the world's biggest asset manager.\n\nThe strongest applicants can demonstrate that they are both digitally native and comfortable with various AI tools, and that they're curious about future capabilities. Young talent is \"upskilling itself to meet the moment,\" Williams said, since applicants without a computer science background often demonstrate AI proficiency. Everyone, he added, will need to have a basic understanding of prompt engineering and how to question AI outputs.\n\n\"In this age of AI, the talent skills that I think we need more than ever are people that are curious, have a questioning mindset, and are willing to not just trust what the model puts out there, but also make sure we're continuing to pressure test that,\" he said. Strong interpersonal and relationship-building skills are also becoming even more important, he said.\n\nWilliams said that his team is figuring out how to assess applicants' AI abilities and is mindful of making sure people without tech backgrounds don't feel intimidated. He's interested in how people use the technology in their personal, academic, or work lives, and said his team is still fine-tuning how to assess that in the interview process.\n\nDespite Williams' new focus on how applicants engage with AI, he's not using it to screen candidates. As of now, he uses AI to schedule interviews.\n\nThere's such a thing as too much AI in the application process, though.\n\nWilliams said recruiters and hiring managers have told people ahead of an interview not to use an AI tool, sometimes to little avail.\n\n\"It is quite common. You will sometimes see people looking to the left or the right. Our interviewing teams, if they're in the middle of doing that, will pick up on that and be able to say, 'Hey, we do want to make sure that you're staying focused,'\" Williams said.\n\nBlackRock employs around 24,600 people in more than 30 countries, according to a November 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some 21,100 people worked at the firm as of the end of 2024, according to that year's annual report.\n\nBlackRock has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its equity business. At the annual New York Times DealBook Summit this week, its CEO, Larry Fink, said that there will be \"some huge winners and huge failures\" with the technology.",

    "description": "AI is reshaping the CHRO role, requiring HR leaders to become AI strategists and bridge people, technology, and data in today's workforce.",
    "fullText": "AI is changing how companies hire, train, and lead, and in the process, the chief human resources officer's role is expanding.\n\nToday's top HR leaders are becoming AI strategists, helping their organizations navigate the next wave of workplace transformation.\n\n\"The old model of HR was employees over here, technology over there,\" says Thomas Hutzschenreuter, a university professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). \"But the new model of work is human-AI collaboration.\"\n\nAI is a coworker now, he says, and that means that \"HR has a bigger mandate. They need to understand not just people and culture, but go deeper into the strategy, the business, and the technology itself.\"\n\nTo understand how companies are navigating the shift, Business Insider spoke with people leaders at Citizens Bank, one of the largest banks in the Northeast; Boston Consulting Group, a global consultancy; and UiPath, an automation software testing company.\n\nAll interviews have been edited for brevity.\n\nCHROs are becoming the architects of the future of work, bridging people, technology, and data.\n\nThere are many questions we are in the middle of that are germane to how we as an organization move forward, such as: What's going to happen to entry-level roles? What roles are emerging? And how do we reskill people in a way that prepares them to make shifts thoughtfully?\n\nWe need people who can quickly learn, adapt, and change. Our technologists need to develop their business acumen, and our business folks need to develop their digital and technical fluency. The lines are blurring.\n\nMy HR team is developing a baseline of skills and capabilities. We're having conversations with consulting partners and clients. There's an openness to communal learning because everyone is trying to figure out the same things: what the AI-driven workforce will look like, how to break work into tasks for AI vs. humans, and what AI agents can handle versus humans.\n\nWe're subject to a lot of regulatory oversight in our industry. It's great that people can develop their own AI agents — there's a push to decentralize these capabilities — but we need to be mindful of risk and governance and how we do this in a safe, ethical way.\n\nAI is changing how work gets done and what work gets done. Business models are evolving, and the way companies serve clients is shifting. The CHRO role now requires adapting to both at once. It's a tall order.\n\nIn consulting, our ability to add value means constantly evolving our approach to human capital. The issues are constant; the pace is what's different. Today, a quarter of our business involves AI, which wasn't true even two years ago.\n\nWe need our people to be AI fluent. About 90% of our workforce uses AI regularly, and more than half use it daily. To get there, we've built a multi-layered support system: a 1,400-person enablement network acting as evangelists and coaches.\n\nWe've upskilled more than 100 team coaches to provide hands-on support. We deploy experts directly into teams to help them reimagine workflows and run innovation competitions to keep momentum going.\n\nOur HR team has taken the lead. We started with recruiting — consolidating six IT systems into one and integrating AI throughout the platform and across performance management and development.\n\nWe're also experimenting with voice tools, chat interfaces, and AI avatars for real-time coaching. These tools give employees confidence, learning opportunities, and instant feedback. They don't replace managers — they free them up for higher-level thinking and relationship-building.\n\nOur business is automation, so that muscle is very strong for my team. But the next frontier of agentic AI is an adjustment.\n\nWe're using these AI agents — but we're also creating them. One agent, almost in production, helps with performance reviews, which is a time-consuming and sometimes dreaded task. Our agent helps employees write their self-assessment and collects feedback, bringing it together much quicker. It also helps managers by consolidating feedback from multiple resources.\n\nIt won't make rating decisions on the manager's behalf, but it makes the year-end much more seamless. Instead of spending time on admin, managers can focus on the feedback itself and my team on the right framework for career development.\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns at the moment, and fear is natural. But it should fuel curiosity and development. This is the time to think about career development seriously.\n\nWe have this idea that AI is only affecting entry-level or lower-level jobs. The truth is that technology is replacing skills that very highly skilled people have been doing.\n\nIf you look at the medical field and aviation — areas where we always thought technology wouldn't touch — that's no longer the case. It's not going to happen overnight. We have time to prepare. But it's relevant for everybody in any profession.",

    "description": "Bathroom trends in 2026 will include statement tiles, high-tech features, medicine cabinets, and layered decor, according to interior designers.",
    "fullText": "Each year brings a new wave of design trends that continue to evolve home spaces, including bathrooms.\n\nSo, Business Insider asked four interior designers to share their thoughts on what will be popular in bathrooms this coming year, and which fads are starting to disappear.\n\nHere's what they predict will be in and out for bathrooms in 2026.\n\nKara Thomas, interior designer and founder of Studio KT, believes there will be a \"heavy trend\" of incorporating tech into bathrooms next year.\n\n\"Regardless of the square footage, people need a space to decompress, and people are going to be wanting to spend more intentional time with themselves in their bathroom,\" she told BI.\n\nFor that reason, she believes an array of useful, high-tech features that aid self-care — like voice-activated shower controls, deodorizing smart toilets, and heated floors — will be taking over home bathrooms in 2026.\n\nThough medicine cabinets haven't exactly been a consistently popular home feature, they're not going anywhere this year, according to Molly Torres Portnof of DATE Interiors.\n\n\"Even for clients with bigger homes and multiple bathrooms, medicine cabinets are still incredibly useful,\" she said.\n\nWhether they're custom or ready-made, recessed or mirrored, \"space is very important, and having any type of hidden storage space is gold,\" the interior designer added.\n\nDanielle Chiprut, interior designer and founder of Danielle Rose Design Co., believes that bathrooms with personal, expressive touches — such as statement tiles — are trending upward.\n\n\"Patterns like plaid, soft geometrics, or dimensional fluting bring a tactile richness that instantly gives the room character,\" she said. \"People are craving spaces that feel crafted rather than 'standard issue,' and tile is a beautiful way to layer in artistry without overwhelming the room.\"\n\nOn a similar note, hand-painted tiles will also be making their way into bathrooms next year, said Torres Portnof.\n\nMost designers agree that there's a growing trend toward more layered designs, with cohesively blended colors, patterns, textures, and lighting taking priority over lifeless, cookie-cutter motifs.\n\nChiprut has noticed a decline in enthusiasm for \"ultra-coordinated\" packages with matching fixtures and cabinetry.\n\n\"Homeowners are moving away from that catalog feel and toward spaces with layered materials and lighting that tell a more personal story,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Thomas, the trend won't involve clutter, but rather more intentional layouts and decor — this could look like an antique piece of art above the toilet, or an accent rug next to the tub.\n\nBathrooms can sometimes feel too stark, which is why it's essential to incorporate multiple lighting sources for balanced illumination and a cozy, welcoming feel, said Torres Portnof.\n\n\"Just like in any other room in the house, it's important to have overhead lighting and accent lighting like sconces,\" she told BI.\n\nIn 2026, we'll likely see more integrated LED lighting in bathrooms, with a particular shift toward backlit mirrors and under-vanity strips, according to Molly Miller, principal designer and founder of Molly Miller Interiors.\n\n\"Bright-white, clinical bathrooms and stark-gray palettes are losing steam,\" Miller said.\n\nInstead, she expects a shift toward earthier tones, like soft clays, muted greens, and warm taupes.\n\nShe also sees earthy palettes being paired with materials like honed natural stone, warm oak or walnut, and unlacquered metals, which she says will help make the space feel more grounded and restorative.\n\nAs earthy hues and natural materials dominate home spaces, Chiprut sees synthetic materials, such as plastics like acrylic, losing favor in bathrooms next year.\n\nInstead, people might opt for dark-stained oak, wabi-sabi wood, or marble.\n\n\"Natural materials carry a quiet longevity that man-made surfaces rarely replicate,\" she said. \"I think many homeowners are moving away from plastics and overly engineered finishes simply because they want a deeper connection to what surrounds them.\"\n\nMaterials like marble and wood can add a sense of warmth, she added.\n\nUltra-glossy finishes may have been popular in 2025, but Chiprut believes that bathroom trend is on its way out.\n\n\"For a while, there was a push toward everything looking polished and reflective, but those surfaces can feel a bit cold and one-note,\" she said.\n\nInstead, she's seeing her clients gravitate toward more tactile, matte textures that feel calming and authentic.",

    "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Issue 'Bold' Statement: 'It Shouldn't Have Come to This'",
    "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle slam Big Tech's safety failures in reaction to Australia's social media ban for children under 16.",
    "fullText": "Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, have released a powerful statement via their Archewell Foundation regarding the world’s first law implemented in Australia that bans social media for children under the age of 16. The couple, who have focused their philanthropic work on online safety and mental wellness, lauded the nation's leadership while cautioning that the measure does not fix the root cause of the crisis.\n\nThe legislation took effect on December 10, targeting platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Twitter (X), and Snapchat, and imposing potential fines of up to AUD$50 million ($49.5 million USD) on companies that fail to keep young users off their services.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess summed up their complex reaction with a strong statement: \"It shouldn't have come to this.\" They expanded on their praise, celebrating the urgency of the intervention against addiction and exploitation. “We celebrate Australia’s leadership for seeing and acting on how these technology companies are negatively impacting young people with little to no recourse or accountability, and feeble efforts from the companies to stem the flow of harms,” the statement reads.\n\nHarry and Meghan emphasized that the bold move sends a necessary signal to Silicon Valley. They view the ban as vital for protecting children at a critical developmental stage. “This bold, decisive action to protect children at a critical moment in their development sends a strong signal that a child’s mind is not a commodity to be exploited. It buys young people valuable time back in their childhoods, but it doesn’t fix the fundamental issue we all still face with social media platforms.”\n\nThe couple pointed to the devastating human cost that necessitated the government’s action. “We’ve heard from too many grieving parents. Too many families devastated by cyberbullying, feeds that radicalize kids toward self-harm, and algorithmic manipulation designed to maximize engagement at any cost.”\n\nThe statement also acknowledged the significant positive potential of social media, particularly for vulnerable youth, arguing that these platforms can be a “genuine lifeline” for LGBTQ+ young people and those suffering mental health crises. However, the omnipresent harms often overshadow the benefits.\n\nThe core of the couple's critique is that the ban is only a temporary solution. “Here’s the truth: the ban is an effective measure to stop imminent harm, but ultimately only works as a band aid that does not address tech’s broken design and exploitive business incentives, requiring us to protect young people in the first place.”\n\nThe statement concluded by calling for a \"reckoning,\" hoping this Australian ban will force tech leaders to take responsibility for platforms built with growth as their first principle, rather than safety. The message notes what the Sussexes deem to be an ethical failure: \"The companies ‘unintended consequences’ of a decade ago are now part of their money making strategy, and children have become their collateral.”\n\nNext: Prince Harry Called Oprah in a Panic to Handle Delicate ‘Problem’ at Home",

    "fullText": "One of the most fundamental algorithms that appears in interviews at big tech companies is Binary Search. Of course, nobody will ask you to implement binary search directly. However, as Jon Bentley cited in his famous book Programming Pearls, only a small percentage of people he asked—10% to be precise—were able to code this algorithm without any errors.\n\nHere, I will show you a correct implementation of binary search, its variants that appear in interviews, and LeetCode problems that you can solve using these techniques.\n\nGiven an array of items, we can find the position of a specific item linearly by iterating over the array, comparing each item with the desired item, and returning the position when the current item equals the desired item.\n\nWe must also consider the case where the desired item is not in the array; in this case, we can return any value. Since we are talking about positions in an array, we can return -1 if the item is not present. This is a very simple concept and implementation. However, if the array is sorted, we can do better.\n\nWe can find the position of an item in logarithmic time (O(log n)), where n is the number of items in the array, when the array is sorted.\n\nTo do this, we repeatedly compare the item we are looking for with the middle element of the array. If the middle element is the one we are looking for, we have our result. Otherwise, we need to update the range of the array we are considering accordingly.\n\nIf the element we are looking for is greater than the middle element, we need to search in the higher part of the array. Otherwise, we need to search in the lower part of the array.\n\nWhat we just described is the Binary Search algorithm. Below is the implementation of the binary search algorithm in C++:\n\nThis is less than 20 lines of code that you need to understand very well if you want to be successful in an interview. Note that I said “understand,” not “memorize.”\n\ncould be implemented in different ways, such as:\n\nCan you explain why the first implementation is better than the second?\n\nThe answer is integer overflow. When we add two integer numbers, we can exceed the maximum value allowed in the computer’s representation of an int. Knowing these details and how to answer such questions puts you in a much better position compared to other candidates.\n\nAs you can see, even a small detail can demonstrate your expertise and experience. All these small details together help you get the position you want.\n\nDespite these details, as I said, nobody will ask you to implement binary search directly. However, there are some important variants of the binary search algorithm that appear as part of problem-solving. I will describe four of them in the next sections.\n\nLet’s consider we have a sorted array with duplicate elements, such as [10, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40, 50]. Also, let’s assume we are searching for the element 30 and we need to find the smallest position of this element in case of duplication.\n\nWith the binary search algorithm implementation shown above, we cannot guarantee we will always return the smallest position of an element in case of duplication. However, we can modify the original algorithm to answer this question correctly.\n\nAnd here is a very important point: You can only make this modification if you know the binary search algorithm and its implementation well.\n\nThinking about the problem, instead of returning the position when we find the element in the array, we need to update our result and continue the search in the lower part of the array.\n\nUpdating the result instead of returning immediately is easy to see. You cannot return immediately because there may be duplicate elements in the array. Since we want the smallest position, we cannot just return.\n\nSo, why go to the lower part of the array instead of the higher part? The answer is because of the problem definition: we want the smallest index. So, if we find the element, in case of duplication, we are interested in the presence of this element before the current position.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nThis problem is similar to the one above, but now we are interested in the higher part of the array in case of duplication. This is because we want the largest index instead of the smallest one.\n\nIn this case, the implementation in C++ could be:\n\nThis is a little different, but only slightly. Now, we are not interested in finding an element, but the largest value less than the given element. So, every time we find an element that is smaller than our desired element, we need to update our result. We also need to update the considered range of the array.\n\nIn this case, we are interested in the higher part of the array, since we are trying to find the largest value less than our element.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nSimilar to the problem above, but now we are interested in finding the smallest value greater than the desired value. So, we need to update our result when we find a larger element instead of a smaller one.\n\nThe implementation in C++ could be:\n\nHere are some interesting problems to solve on LeetCode using the techniques explained in this post:",

    "fullText": "Most people don't get told their genius might destroy the company they built. But Jeff Bezos isn't most people. At Italian Tech Week in October, the Amazon founder looked back on an early piece of feedback that changed the way he approached invention—and may have helped save Amazon from becoming its own worst enemy.\n\n\"I am an inventor,\" Bezos told the audience. \"This is my fundamental nature.\" His favorite place? In a room with a whiteboard, surrounded by a small group, spitballing ideas. \"You can literally put me in front of a whiteboard and I can come up with a hundred ideas in half an hour,\" he said with a grin.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nBut that endless flow of innovation—once considered a superpower—nearly became a liability. In the early years of Amazon, one longtime executive pulled Bezos aside with a blunt warning. \"Jeff, you have enough ideas to destroy Amazon,\" Jeff Wilke told him.\n\nIt stunned him. \"This was such a shocking idea for me,\" Bezos admitted. Wilke, a manufacturing expert, saw the problem clearly: every new idea was essentially a task dropped into a queue. If the company couldn't absorb it fast enough, it wasn't just useless—it was destructive.\n\n\"You have to release the work at the right rate that the organization can accept it,\" Bezo said, quoting Wilke. \"You're creating a backlog, a queue, work in process. It's adding no value and in fact, it's creating distraction.\"\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThat was the moment Bezos shifted. Instead of flooding Amazon with nonstop initiatives, he started filtering. \"I started prioritizing the ideas better, keeping lists of them, keeping them to myself until the organization was ready,\" he said.\n\nEven more important, Bezos began thinking like a builder—not just of ideas, but of infrastructure. \"How can I build an organization that can be ready for more ideas?\" he said. The answer was scaling leadership, growing bandwidth, and creating systems that could handle multiple innovations at once.\n\nAmazon didn't slow down after that—it got smarter. \"We built a company that's very good at inventing and doing more than one thing at a time,\" Bezos said. But none of it worked until he accepted a hard truth: ideas are powerful, but only if they're released at the right moment. Without discipline, even genius becomes a liability.",

    "title": "Who makes the best combat drone pilots? Ukrainian drone schools say it's young, tech-loving gamers and people used to staring at screens",
    "description": "Drone schools in Ukraine say they've realized what traits tend to make people the best pilots for the fight against Russia.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's drone schools say it's clear: young, tech-savvy people with a gaming background make the best drone pilots.\n\nAcross the country, drone schools are training new operators for what has become one of the most important roles in Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion — flying the drones that scout Russian positions, find targets, and blow up tanks and troops.\n\nThree leaders working at two schools told Business Insider that younger students with gaming or tech experience tend to consistently pick up skills the fastest. These students often are already comfortable with controllers, joysticks, and staring at a screen for a long time.\n\nThe instructor comments offer insight into what kind of person makes the best pilot, useful as Ukraine continues to fight for its survival and Western militaries study the war, investing more heavily in drone programs for a potential future fight.\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said younger people and gamers, \"are really good because their system of motor movements in their hands is already well developed.\"\n\nHis colleague, Tetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, agreed, telling BI that \"those who used to play video games, those who are accustomed to using a joystick, would be better in terms of running an FPV drone.\"\n\nTechnical fluency matters too. It's easier to train people with IT or engineering backgrounds than it is teachers, marketing specialists, or accountants. This war is one of rapidly evolving technology and tactics, especially in drone warfare.\n\nBeing an operator isn't just about physical control; it's about really understanding how drones work and what they can do. The school strives to instill these principles in all students.\n\nAnd gaming experience, technical knowledge, and flexible adaptation in the face of new technology tend to be more easily found among younger students. If they're over 50, Tetyana explained, \"it is a bit more challenging for students to get hold of controlling some types of drones.\"\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said someone who flies well isn't automatically a strong combat operator — but after a year of training, his team has identified what works.\n\n\"Young people aged 18-27 are the easiest to train,\" he said. \"They memorize information and acquire skills faster and more effectively. As we have noted, the older a person is, the more difficult it is for them to learn.\"\n\nSimilar to the other drone school leaders, Pervak said people who have a technical mindset can absorb training \"more easily and understand the intricacies of using UAVs in combat better.\" Those who were programmers and gamers often \"find it easiest to focus on a monitor for long periods of time. Everyone else must develop this skill.\"\n\nGood health is also key, but he said the school has nonetheless \"successfully trained people with visual and hearing impairments, back problems, contusions, and even head injuries.\"\n\nDrones account for about 60% of Ukraine's front-line strikes, according to the country's commander-in-chief. With shortages of artillery shells and other weaponry, Ukraine has leaned heavily on drones. The inexpensive systems have been highly effective at damaging and destroying equipment worth millions.\n\nCheap drones offer an asymmetric advantage and provide the Ukrainian military with combat power it couldn't generate with humans and crewed assets alone. But its drone force is only as strong as its pilots are capable, making drone training essential.\n\nThe drone school leaders are not alone in their assessment of who tends to make the best pilots.\n\nUkrainian soldiers with gaming backgrounds have also credited that experience for their skills, and Ukraine's special drone unit, Typhoon, previously told Business Insider that gamers make great drone pilots. But they also cautioned that real drone warfare is much more complicated and dangerous than any video game.\n\nOne Typhoon operator said that \"people think flying a military drone is like playing 'Call of Duty,' until they realize there's no restart option,\" referring to the popular video game.\n\nWestern drone pilots have previously expressed similar sentiments. Tanner Yackley, a former US Air Force drone operator who left in 2018, previously told Business Insider that it's fundamentally different because \"you're making life or death calls every single day.\"\n\n\"There's not a single game in the world that can prep you for what you're going to do,\" he said.\n\nAs NATO watches the war in Ukraine, worried about a wider conflict, its forces are already adapting and also looking to gamers, even embracing tech from the gaming world to make it easier for younger troops to quickly skill up on new technology.\n\nSome American and European troops, for instance, are training on a new air-defense system that uses an Xbox controller to launch interceptor drones.\n\nThe drone schools, however, are constantly grappling with challenges, such as limited funding, reliance on donated drones, and the threat of Russian strikes. They have to keep their curricula updated, with instructors traveling to the front and rewriting lessons every couple of weeks to match the rapid battlefield shifts.",
