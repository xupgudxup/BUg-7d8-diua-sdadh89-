    "description": "Threat actors love to imitate well-known tech and social media companies.",
    "fullText": "Impersonation scams are everywhere: bad actors are constantly trying to convince you that they represent organizations like LinkedIn, PayPal, your bank, the FBI, the FTC, and the IRS as they look to steal your money and information. When it comes to phishing schemes, which typically try to trick you into handing over sensitive data or account credentials via malicious links, tech brands are (perhaps not surprisingly) among the most commonly spoofed.\n\nA recent report from Check Point Research found that Microsoft was imitated in nearly a quarter of all branded phishing attempts in Q4 of last year—nearly double the next most-impersonated company.\n\nAccording to researchers, tech companies and social networks are consistently among the most popular brands for impersonators running phishing scams, with the following share in the final quarter of last year:\n\nWhile you should always be on guard for common phishing tactics, it's wise to be especially wary of unsolicited communication from any of the companies listed—especially if that communication is related to account security and/or urges you to click a link. We've covered at least one campaign involving nearly every brand here, all of which are known and largely trusted among users, making them prime targets for these types of scams. Check Point notes that stolen Microsoft and Google credentials are particularly valuable because they're widely used in day-to-day workflows.\n\nBroadly speaking, a phishing scam starts with an email, text, or social media message that appears to be from a legitimate source. It likely asks you to update or verify personal information—often related to a payment or account security—with a link to what appears to be the company's website or login page. Of course, this link leads instead to a spoofed version of that site designed to harvest your credentials, credit card number, bank details, or other personal data, which scammers can then use for identity theft, account takeover, or purchase fraud.\n\nNote that while the above methods are among the most common, phishing can also happen via phone call, voicemail, and malicious browser pop-ups.\n\nAs we mentioned, just because you generally trust a company doesn't mean you should blindly trust all communication from it. If you receive a message that is unprompted, sounds urgent, and is unrelated to any recent action on your part (such as a login attempt or bill payment), do not engage with it. Don't click any links, open any attachments, or respond directly. Look out for typos and other errors, including the original sender—though as scammers have found ways to appear verified, this isn't always an obvious red flag.\n\nIf you're unsure about the contents of the message, go directly to the website or app and log in to see any legitimate alerts. A password manager offers an extra layer of security here, as it'll protect you from entering credentials on a spoofed page.\n\nFinally, enable a strong, phishing-resistant form of multi-factor authentication everywhere you can, and especially for high-use and high-value accounts like Microsoft and Google. If your credentials are compromised, threat actors won't have that additional factor to utilize them.",

    "title": "Finland is trying to poach top tech and AI talent from the US with 2-week visas and better work-life balance",
    "description": "Finland wants to lure American engineers and researchers with fast-track visas and good work-life balance as part of the global AI talent wars.",
    "fullText": "Finland is stepping into the tech talent wars.\n\nThe Nordic country is making a push for tech workers from abroad, with a particular focus on the US. The goal is to attract engineers and researchers working in deep tech, especially in the fields of quantum computing, AI, and health innovation.\n\nThe effort comes as competition for AI talent intensifies worldwide and tech workers in the US grapple with layoffs, burnout, and visa complications. KPMG's annual survey of global CEOs found that 70% were concerned about competition for AI talent. According to BCG's 2024 talent tracker report, the US remained dominant in attracting AI talent worldwide.\n\nAlready known for its tech scene, Finland, with a population of around 5.6 million, is positioning itself as a place where American tech workers can find a better work-life balance without sacrificing their careers — a notable contrast to the famous grindset of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"Of course, there might be long days once in a while, but it's such a high value, and it's also protected by law that you can't work more than an average of 40 hours per week,\" Laura Lindeman, head of the Work in Finland program, told Business Insider.\n\nShe said that even in the tech sector, when people leave work for the day, they really do leave. \"Offices are silent,\" she said. Employers in Finland, often ranked the happiest country in the world, also see the benefit of workers having lives outside work, she said, adding that the general sentiment is \"it narrows your thinking if you only work.\"\n\nFinland is working with more than 30 Finnish tech companies and universities to promote open roles to foreign workers. A preview of the job openings being promoted under the program includes roles with Oura Health (the company behind the Oura Ring), quantum computing firm QMill, and Aalto University.\n\nLindeman said Americans interested in working in Finland should consider reaching out to companies or universities, even if no open roles are listed, as some employers are open to creating positions for the right candidate. While the campaign emphasizes the US, it also targets talent from India, Brazil, and other parts of Europe.\n\nOnce candidates receive a job offer, they can apply for a specialist visa through Finland's Fast Track program. Approved applicants can receive a work-residence permit in as little as two weeks, with processing times averaging about 10 days, Lindeman said. Finland also offers integration programs to help newcomers settle in, and spouses of workers on specialist visas are eligible for work permits, she added.\n\nGovernment data suggests interest from Americans is already rising. Finland granted 60 specialist residence permits to US citizens in 2024 and 85 in 2025, according to Finnish immigration statistics. The number of residence permits granted to US researchers also increased, from 35 in 2024 to 46 in 2025.\n\nJordan Blake Banks, an American who moved to Finland in 2019 to pursue a master's degree through the Fulbright program, said the country offers plenty of benefits, from its forests to its emphasis on work-life balance. After finishing her degree, Banks stayed in Finland and eventually landed a job as a sustainability consultant at Deloitte in Helsinki.\n\n\"The general idea is that the company and the colleagues respect you as a person, and that you can have your free and personal time,\" she said, adding parents regularly leave work during the day for family obligations without stigma. Many Finns also take about a month of vacation during the summer, along with time off in the winter.\n\nBanks said salaries in Finland tend to be lower than in comparable roles in the US, but she thinks the gap is offset by more affordable essential services, including healthcare, education, and childcare.\n\nWhile learning Finnish isn't necessary for working in the country — Lindeman said English is widely used in the tech industry, and about 80% of Finns speak fluent English — Banks said not knowing the language can feel isolating in everyday life.\n\nShe enrolled in a four-month integration program run by the city, where she learned the language and eventually passed the national exam required to become a Finnish citizen. Banks also met her now-wife while living in Finland.\n\nOne cultural adjustment of living in Finland, she said, has been that the people tend to be more reserved than Americans. \"If you're coming from a very friendly culture or a very warm culture, I think that could be a shock,\" she said, adding she'd been able to use that to her advantage.\n\nBanks said speaking up helped her land a paid research position at her university. \"I was willing to make contact and be the brave American willing to ask for things,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Investors are gearing up for a packed week of potentially market-moving updates from Big Tech and the Fed.\n\nThe Fed's coming decision on interest rates and Big Tech earnings could spark fresh volatility in markets, depending on what they tell investors about the path of the economy in 2026 and the state of the AI trade.\n\nInvestors are coming out of a rocky few trading weeks amid weeks of geopolitical tensions and a return of the \"Sell America\" trade. Most recently, President Trump did a U-turn, ramping up his rhetoric about acquiring Greenland before announcing that a framework deal was being hammered out between the US and NATO. The about-face led stocks to rally after plunging earlier in the week.\n\n\"With the Greenland crisis sidelined for now, investors can look forward,\" Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, wrote in a note, pointing to coming tech earnings in particular.\n\nHere's everything on investors' radar this week.\n\nFour of the Magnificent Seven tech titans will report their fourth-quarter results this week.\n\nMega-cap tech earnings have come under greater scrutiny each quarter as investors worry about bloated valuations and returns amid soaring capex spending by AI hyperscalers. The AI trade has remained strong so far in 2026, but concerns are rising about high levels of debt-fueled capex.\n\nEarning season broadly kicks into high gear this week. The companies reporting results during the week make up nearly a third of the S&P 500 and 37% of the technology sector.\n\nThe Fed's January policy meeting kicks off on Tuesday. FOMC members are widely expected to pause rate cuts, with markets pricing in a 97% probability that the committee will opt to keep rates unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nThis week's meeting is coming into sharper focus amid the latest political drama swirling around Powell and the central bank.\n\nMost recently, the Department of Justice kicked off a criminal investigation into Powell for his testimony on the Fed's building renovations last year. While President Trump has said he had no knowledge of the probe, the move is being read as another attempt from the Trump administration to pressure the Fed to cut rates.\n\nTrump is also zeroing in on his next pick for Fed Chair, and markets are still waiting on a ruling from the Supreme Court about whether Trump has the power to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\n\nEnrique Diaz Alvarez, the chief economist at Ebury, said investors seemed preoccupied with \"policy chaos\" and worries about \"institutional degradation,\" referring to concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"We expect Powell to emphasise that the US economy remains in a decent place, while indicating to markets that the FOMC is in no rush to cut rates again,\" Alvarez wrote on Monday.\n\n\"The Fed is unlikely to take any action this week. Inaction is politically the safest strategy, but also the most prudent given mixed economic signals,\" Emily Bowersock Hill, the CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, wrote in a note.\n\nAlso on deck are a handful of economic data updates, including December wholesale inflation and the latest consumer confidence reading.",

    "fullText": "Synthesia makes digital presenters for clients to use in corporate videos and counts 70% of FTSE 100 as customers\n\nA British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.\n\nSynthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.\n\nOn Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.\n\nSynthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.\n\nThe company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nThe startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.\n\nSynthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”\n\nLast year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.\n\n“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.\n\nSynthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.\n\nThe $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.\n\nSynthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.\n\nLast year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, in a speech this month Khan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.\n\nTjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.",

    "fullText": "Molly Russell was just 14 when she took her own life in 2017, and an inquest later found negative online content was a significant factor. With many people now pushing for teenagers to be kept off tech platforms, her father explains why he backs a different approach\n\nIan Russell describes his life as being split into two parts: before and after 20 November 2017, the day his youngest daughter, Molly, took her own life as a result of depression and negative social media content. “Our life before Molly’s death was very ordinary. Unremarkable,” he says. He was a television producer and director, married with three daughters. “We lived in an ordinary London suburb, in an ordinary semi-detached house, the children went to ordinary schools.” The weekend before Molly’s death, they had a celebration for all three girls’ birthdays, which are in November. One was turning 21, another 18 and Molly was soon to be 15. “And I remember being in the kitchen of a house full of friends and family and thinking, ‘This is so good. I’ve never been so happy,’” he says. “That was on a Saturday night and the following Tuesday morning, everything was different.”\n\nThe second part of Russell’s life has been not only grief and trauma, but also a commitment to discovering and exposing the truth about the online content that contributed to Molly’s death, and campaigning to prevent others falling prey to the same harms. Both elements lasted far longer than he anticipated. It took nearly five years to get enough information out of social media companies for an inquest to conclude that Molly died “from an act of self-harm while suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content”. As for the campaigning, the Molly Rose Foundation provides support, conducts research and raises awareness of online harms, and Russell has been an omnipresent spokesperson on these issues.\n\nHe has been busier than ever lately. We meet at a London hotel, a few hours before the House of Lords vote on an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that would ban access to social media for under-16s. The amendment was expected to pass – and it did, by 261 votes to 150. Keir Starmer’s government is in favour of a consultation, and a pause to see how Australia’s trailblazing unfolds. But a UK ban has had widespread support, from Conservatives, including Kemi Badenoch, as well as more than 60 Labour MPs, bereaved relatives of children whose deaths were social media-related, celebrities, campaign groups and, it seems, the public – a YouGov poll in December found that 74% of British adults were in favour.\n\nRussell, however, is not in favour of such a ban. Last Sunday he co-signed a joint statement, alongside the NSPCC, Full Fact, the 5 Rights Foundation and others, arguing that “blanket bans on social media would fail to deliver the improvement in children’s safety and wellbeing that they so urgently need”.\n\nAn inconvenient split seems to have opened up, at a time when online harms and social media companies are finally in the spotlight. But if anyone has spent time weighing up this issue, it’s Russell, and he doesn’t seem like someone looking for controversy. “As a person, I need to gather information and process it before I can come to a conclusion,” he says. “I often find myself at meetings hearing what’s being said, and it can be difficult to contribute because I haven’t formed my opinions yet.” But on this issue he’s firm in his conviction, even if others find it difficult to understand. “We’re in danger of trying to move too fast and trying to find quick-fix solutions,” he says. “If there were quick-fix solutions, honestly, we would have found them.”\n\nThe core arguments laid out by Russell and other opponents of a ban will be familiar to followers of this debate: that children will seek more dangerous alternatives; that they will find ways to circumvent age limits; that they will face a “cliff edge” when they turn 16 and are thrown into the “high-risk” world of social media; that some groups, such as LGBTQ+ and neurodiverse children, will be deprived of valuable online sources of support and connection.\n\nBut Russell’s position also hinges on the Online Safety Act, which is just starting to do what it’s supposed to, he argues. The legislation, passed in 2023, obliges online platforms to conduct robust age verification and prevent harmful content reaching children. It also gives the government and Ofcom, the independent media regulator, powers to fine or even take down platforms not playing by the rules. Molly’s death, and Russell’s campaigning, helped push the act through.\n\nRussell admits progress has been slow. “It took five years of parliamentary debate to put the Online Safety Act on the books. It’s taken Ofcom more than two years, but they are now implementing and enforcing that act. It’s too long, but we have literally just arrived at a place, after all that time, when the platforms, in order to operate in the UK, if their services are likely to be used by children, have to take steps to ensure the safety of those children.”\n\nThe recent furore over Elon Musk’s X and Grok is a good illustration, he says. The integration of Grok AI tools that could manipulate images of women, and even children, to remove their clothing, into X – effectively making a tool for creating deepfake child sexual abuse images widely available – horrified pretty much everyone, Russell included. “I don’t understand how X and Elon Musk can even begin to think that that was acceptable,” he says. “Hideous, wrong, disgraceful. But what was the reaction in the UK to that?” After the issue became known, Ofcom opened a formal investigation into X, acting under the powers of the Online Safety Act. Starmer and technology secretary Liz Kendall said they would support Ofcom if it chose to fine or block ​X. Within days, Musk made a U-turn and removed the software from his platform.\n\nThe Online Safety Act did what a social media ban couldn’t, Russell argues. “If a platform is behaving in an appalling, unsatisfactory, abysmally unsafe manner, it shouldn’t be in this country … A ban [for under-16s] removes the impetus to do that. In fact, what it’s likely to do is have a really chilling effect on the Online Safety Act.”\n\nHe’s not arguing that the legislation is perfect – X was still allowing some users to post sexualised images generated by Grok after Musk’s U-turn, it took weeks for Ofcom to act, and X escaped censure for what many still consider an egregious offence – “but it’s there to be built on. You don’t get anything right the first time … You also have to accept that the development of tech moves so fast, you’re going to constantly have to be amending it and looking at it and updating it. We have to be thinking ahead of the tech crowd.”\n\nA common argument in favour of a social media ban for under-16s is the alcohol analogy. We don’t sanction selling alcohol to minors because it is potentially harmful. Sure, some kids might find a way around it, like getting a fake driving licence, but as a society we’ve put down a marker that you have to be a certain age to drink. Shouldn’t it be the same with social media?\n\nRussell is in favour of regulation, but says it should be sensible and proportionate. He counters with another offline analogy: cars and road traffic. “There will be casualties. It’s sad and tragic when it happens, and we accept that. We don’t say: children under 16 shouldn’t ride in cars to protect them. We say children under 12 should always be in a car seat. We say that everyone in a car, however old, should wear a seatbelt. The industry is compelled to comply with safety measures … We don’t blanket ban 16-year-olds from road travel.”\n\nWe do ban them from driving though, I point out. “I’m not saying we should let 16-year-olds on platforms that encourage irresponsible behaviour. I’m saying we should let 16-year-olds on platforms that are safe for 16-year-olds.”\n\nAge classification should be on a platform-by-platform basis, in Russell’s view: “If there was a platform that was really safe, really good, and connected people and did all the good things that social media could do, we could say 13 is fine.” Some other platforms might be rated 16 or 18, say. “If you were to differentiate like that, you would then drive platforms who wanted to attract younger people [to] start inventing safer things.”\n\nSome might say social media companies have had every chance to do this already. Instead, despite having been repeatedly confronted with evidence of the harms they have caused, they have routinely denied and evaded accountability, and even scaled down their internal checks and balances. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, apologised to parents of social media victims at a Senate hearing in January 2024, but a year later, following Donald Trump’s re-election, he announced that Instagram, Facebook and Threads would be getting rid of factcheckers, even if, he admitted, “it means we’re gonna catch less bad stuff”.\n\n“I don’t trust the platforms at all,” Russell agrees. “You certainly can’t judge a social media platform by what it says; you can only judge by what it does.” And again, he argues, the Online Safety Act is a better weapon to keep them in line. “If you’ve got an effective regulator and strong regulation, then you could go, ‘You’re not doing what you’re telling us you’re doing. You’re not living up to your risk assessment. You’ve got three months to fix it, or you’re out.’ That’s the sort of thing that will make a difference.”\n\nRussell has good reason not to trust the platforms, especially Meta. After Molly’s death, Russell and his family were shocked and confused, until they began to look into her online activity. “We discovered, in a really painful way, because we could see it in her social media accounts, the content that had been fed to her by the platforms.” The feedback loop of the algorithm had served her more and more disturbing content: graphic images and videos relating to suicide, self-harm and depression, often set to music, flashing slogans like “Fat. Ugly. Worthless. Suicidal.” Even a consultant psychiatrist at the inquest into Molly’s death said that they’d had trouble sleeping after viewing it. “That discovery of this awful, nihilistic world in which she was drip-fed largely black-and-white, depressive content, that led her to the place where she thought that the only way forward was to end her life, was horrifying,” Russell says.\n\nInitially, they reported their findings to Instagram, he recalls. “We thought that they’d say, ‘Thank you for reporting this horrible content. We’ll take it down.’” Instead they received replies along the lines of “this doesn’t infringe our community guidelines”.\n\nGetting a complete picture of Molly’s online activity was a long, difficult, painful process. Cooperation from the tech companies was minimal, but Andrew Walker, the senior coroner at the inquest, was tenacious. Pinterest, which had algorithmically sent harmful content to Molly, complied. Twitter (now X) allowed Russell to download the data from Molly’s account, which wasn’t that helpful without the background context. Meta initially supplied tens of thousands of pages of data, which was all but unsearchable. After more demands, delays and ultimatums, eventually, five years after Molly’s death, Meta found an additional 50 lever-arch files of evidence. “Within that evidence was some of the most harmful content that Molly had seen, which completed the picture.” In her final six months, Molly had been exposed to 2,100 pieces of harmful content on Instagram alone. There were only 12 days in that period when she doesn’t seem to have interacted with harmful content on the platform.\n\nA new documentary premiering next month, Molly vs The Machines, combines verbatim reconstructions of moments from the inquest (such as when one Meta executive disputed whether the content Molly was consuming was really harmful at all) and interviews with Russell and Molly’s schoolfriends with a broader critique of big tech and surveillance capitalism: infinite scrolling, engagement-seeking algorithms, misinformation, polarisation – this is not just a problem for teenagers, Russell points out. “There’s an online harm working at the global level, and there’s an online harm working at the personal level that Molly experienced. The two are so interconnected, and we need to collectively work to pull that together.”\n\nThe fact that this debate has become polarised is, if not a direct consequence, then at least a reflection of how social media tends to drag every subject to its extremes. The politicisation of the issue is equally unhelpful in this regard: the Lords amendment (which now returns to the House of Commons for consideration) was led by the Tories, and is being seen as a defeat for Starmer’s government. Lady Kidron described Starmer’s stance as “the very epitome of party before country”.\n\nBut Russell is all for finding middle ground. “I know it will suit many people to divide the cake and say there’s pro-ban and there’s anti-ban. And they can try to set us against each other if they want, and that might work in some cases. In my case, I’ll never be against anyone; I always want to hear their arguments. The division shouldn’t be there; the division should be: people who want the world to be safer for children; and technology companies who are absolutely uncaring of that and caring of their profits – that’s where the dividing line is.”\n\nOn a personal level, can Russell imagine reaching a point where he’ll think his work is done? “I’ve always wanted to just get on with my very ordinary life and remember Molly fondly. But sadly, I don’t see that happening anytime soon, because this is a global problem.” He has tried to keep his life and career as ordinary and unchanged as it was, “so there was something familiar in that second part of my life after Molly’s death.” Russell’s work and his grief are inevitably intertwined. There’s not a day he doesn’t think about her, he says. “Some days, that can invigorate you and it can be tremendously powerful and comforting. And other days it can absolutely stop you in your steps and you can barely bring yourself to come out the door. As time goes on, the harder days are fewer.”",

    "title": "I got laid off from my tech job and retired in France at 69. Starting over is hard, but I love my life here.",
    "description": "Sandy Adams has always loved France. But it wasn't until she was laid off from her tech job at 69 that she decided to move there and retire.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sandy Adam, 69, who moved from Pittsburgh to Chatou, a suburb of Paris, in 2025. The essay, which also incorporates quotes from emails between Adam and Business Insider, has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy connection to Europe developed over a lifetime. Like many Americans, it began by studying French in high school. I had pen pals in both France and England, and later, when my children were young, we hosted a French student in our home for six weeks. Europe always felt familiar and aspirational.\n\nProfessionally, I spent most of my career working for global companies. But in 2013, I took my first personal trip to Paris and fell completely in love with its architecture and art. While I was there, I took a cooking class to learn how to make macarons and visited Giverny and Versailles.\n\nThat experience reshaped how I imagined my future.\n\nI was kind of forced into retirement in 2025. I was laid off from my tech job and started looking around to see what I should do next. But it's hard to get a job in the US when you're over 50 — much less at my age — so I decided to retire.\n\nAround that time, moving to Europe started to feel more practical. I was living just outside Pittsburgh in a wealthy tax district, and my property taxes kept rising. I owned a 1,700-square-foot, three-bedroom colonial on about a quarter-acre lot that I bought for about $224,500 in 2017. In 2025, my property taxes were about $6,900.\n\nI asked myself: If I tried to live off Social Security, could I afford to stay in that house? I probably could, but it would be really tight. Long-term, though, the financial predictability felt increasingly uncertain — my everyday living expenses, like groceries, were going up too. I wanted to simplify my life, with fewer fixed costs and fewer surprises.\n\nI also wanted a more purposeful life. To me, moving to France meant being able to do more and learn more about history, architecture, and how people live differently from the way we're raised in the US.\n\nI wasn't looking for luxury or escape in France, but for a more grounded and intentional life, one that was rich in experience rather than centered on consumption.\n\nI was also drawn to the European model of daily life: walking as a default, using trains to explore, and having easy access to multiple countries and cultures.\n\nBefore I moved to Europe, I sold my home for $365,000. I used some of the equity from the sale to help fund the move. I'm also on Social Security right now, and when I moved, my monthly benefit was $3,608.\n\nI came to this realization not too long ago: not having a paycheck is a big deal. It took me a while to fully accept that Social Security is my paycheck now, and that my 401(k) and investment portfolio stabilize everything.\n\nI landed in Paris with my dog Phoenix in September and live in the western suburbs, in a town called Chatou.\n\nChatou feels like something out of a Hallmark movie. It's a cute, charming town with beautiful cobblestone streets. You can walk beneath tall trees that form a canopy of leaves overhead, and I can hop on a train and be in central Paris in about 20 minutes.\n\nThe community is a mix of young and older residents, though I'm noticing it skews a bit older. It's also a very wealthy area; the homes here are stunning, at least from the outside.\n\nThe apartment I live in is about 548 square feet. It's a one-bedroom, and it's plenty of room for my dog and me. I pay $1,679 a month, and while it's a little expensive for me, it gives me a soft landing while I figure out where I ultimately want to settle down.\n\nBefore moving to France, I was taking French classes through Carnegie Mellon's online program. I also attended tons of webinars to help establish myself. But I will say this: even if you're prepared, unexpected things still happen.\n\nWhen I got here, my first experience was finding a doctor to refill a prescription. I signed up for Doctolib, got a referral from the local pharmacy, and booked an appointment. The people at the pharmacy didn't speak any English, but fortunately, my French was barely good enough to get by.\n\nThe first few months living in a new country can be exhausting. There's always something new you have to do, another form to file, or another process to start.\n\nFor example, I applied to exchange my driver's license because Pennsylvania has an agreement with France that allows you to do that, but it required a lot of paperwork, like birth certificates, and there were a lot of forms, and I needed translations.\n\nThere's just a lot that keeps you very busy when you move.\n\nStill, I guess I'm lucky that it's just my dog and me. If I had a family and children, I could only imagine how much more overwhelming it would be.\n\nI wondered how I was going to make friends in France.\n\nI told myself I'd join organizations, but I didn't do that right away. One day, I was in the grocery store and overheard two women speaking English. I said out loud, \"Oh, I hear English, it's music to my ears.\" They came over, and it turned out they were au pairs here in Chatou.\n\nOne of them and I became friends; she's 22, and we do a lot together, like running errands and shopping. She has her own social life with other young people, but we still try to get together about once a week.\n\nI also posted in a local Facebook group looking for people to do dog playdates, because I think the move was harder on my dog than it was on me. Through that, I met a nice couple from the UK who are here for three years, and now we hang out and do things together.\n\nI'm also teaching myself urban sketching. I recently found out there's an Urban Sketchers group that meets in Versailles once a month, and I'm planning to go. I'm sure I'll meet more people that way.\n\nIn the US, I felt resolved, though not necessarily excited, about what I thought my life would be.\n\nMy lifestyle was about putting money into things. I'd think, \"Oh, I'll buy a new TV,\" or \"Oh, I'll buy a new couch.\" Here, I'm using my money differently: I bought an annual pass to the Louvre, I'm buying art supplies as I learn to paint, and I just bought a new guitar.\n\nIn France, I wake up happy every day. Retiring abroad feels like a natural extension of the interests and values I have been forming for decades, and is exactly how I want to spend this next chapter of my life.\n\nSometimes, I wonder how long I can afford to live in France. I also imagine what it would be like to move back to the US. I have a son there, and I'm thinking about how to leave him an inheritance.\n\nBut honestly, I don't really see myself moving back. In the US, my life just felt more reactive. It happened around work and obligations. While I still value my ties to the country and its people, I don't feel the same pull to return to that default rhythm.",

    "description": "The killing of Alex Pretti, a US citizen, by ICE in Minneapolis on Saturday has drawn sharp responses from many Americans, including business leaders.",
    "fullText": "Federal immigration agents on Saturday shot and killed a US citizen in Minneapolis — the second fatal shooting involving ICE officers this month — adding more fuel to an already explosive national debate over immigration enforcement.\n\nThe killing sparked an outcry on Minneapolis streets, as well as online, eliciting sharp responses from all sides, including leaders in the business and tech communities.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, for instance, wrote in a post on X that it was \"time to take the temperature down before more lives are lost.\"\n\nMinnesota officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, criticized the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, for what they said were overly aggressive tactics. The DHS, meanwhile, defended its agents, arguing that they are being provoked by unruly protesters and an uncooperative city government and police.\n\nThousands of ICE officers began descending on Minnesota on December 1 as part of Operation Metro Surge. The DHS says it is targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state and has deployed over 2,000 ICE agents across Minnesota.\n\nResidents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul have been protesting since the federal immigration agents arrived. Those demonstrations grew more intense after the first fatal shooting on January 7. In that incident, ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good, 37, as she tried to drive away in a car.\n\nHere's how business and tech leaders are reacting to the latest violence.\n\nThe hedge-fund billionaire called for calm in an X post on Saturday, lamenting that the United States had reached a point where \"there are only two sides to every issue and every incident.\"\n\n\"Individuals are 'convicted' of serious crimes in the headlines, by politicians appealing to their base, and ultimately in the minds of the public, or they are exonerated, before all of the facts are in and a detailed investigation has been completed,\" He wrote. \"This is not good for America.\"\n\nJust two hours later, in another post on X, Ackman laid the blame on Minnesota's state government.\n\n\"It is almost as if the governor of Minnesota called for protesters to intervene in ICE enforcements in an incendiary manner,\" he said, tagging Walz. \"Inciting the people to rise up against law enforcement is guaranteed to end badly, and now we have seen the tragic consequences.\"\n\nLike Ackman, billionaire LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman is perpetually online, posting frequently on social media. He has been largely quiet this weekend, though he has reposted comments from other people, including one that called ICE \"out of control.\"\n\nIn another post that Hoffman amplified, an X user called out \"chronically online tech leaders\" for suddenly falling quiet. Another X user called on business and tech leaders to use their platform to stand up to the Trump administration and its immigration enforcement tactics, to which Hoffman replied, \"It's time for all Americans to do so.\"\n\nJeff Dean, Google DeepMind's chief scientist, wrote in response to a video of the shooting circulating on X: \"This is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nMinneapolis police confirmed that Pretti, who was filming ICE agents when they wrestled him to the ground, was legally carrying a gun.\n\nBorder Patrol officials said Pretti had threatened them with the gun, but multiple videos of the incident show that agents had already disarmed and subdued Pretti when he was shot.\n\nJason Calacanis, a prominent investor and entrepreneur who is these days perhaps most known as one of the hosts of the popular \"All-In\" podcast, blamed the country's political leaders in a post on X on Sunday.\n\n\"Once again, I will remind everyone that our leaders are failing us,\" he wrote. \"True leadership would be to calm this situation down by telling these non-peaceful protesters to stay home while recalling these inadequately-trained agents.\"\n\nHe later posted that \"all of this violence\" could be avoided by fining businesses that hire immigrants who are not in the country legally.\n\nCristina Cordova, the chief operating officer at Linear, a product management software company, called the incident \"indefensible\" in a post on X.\n\n\"The victim's legally owned handgun was removed from the scene, and then ICE agents shot him multiple times. It's far from law enforcement — it's just murder,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Those who defend this don't care about law or order. It's about money, power, and protecting an executive branch that's already been bought and paid for.\"",

    "description": "Kyle Elliott, a career coach for tech employees, told Business Insider clients can vent to the wrong people when they're dealing with a difficult boss.",
    "fullText": "Kyle Elliott, who's been a full-time career coach since 2017, spends his days helping tech employees solve their most challenging work issues.\n\nHe's noticed a common problem among clients: difficult bosses, including micromanagers.\n\nOne key mistake employees make when they're trying to fix a problem, Elliot told Business Insider, is venting to the wrong person — particularly your boss.\n\nIt makes sense to push back against a difficult boss when their behaviour or expectations are disrupting your work, said Elliot, who is based in California. But venting to them will rarely make the situation better, but nearly always damage trust, he added.\n\nEven if you have a good relationship, it would be more appropriate to vent to a friend, family member, or career coach. They can also help you brainstorm solutions.\n\n\"Your boss is not your therapist. You want to come to them with solutions, or at least a clear sense of how they can help you improve the situation or the working relationship,\" he said. \"If you want a promotion, you want your boss to view you as someone who is thoughtful and solution-oriented, not someone who complains.\"\n\nWhen you organize the feedback session with a difficult boss, choose a private setting, such as in a 1-1 meeting, and interlace constructive feedback with positive remarks about things they do that you like.\n\nAnother common issue Elliott encounters is clients misusing their time with him by ranting about their struggles with their boss and what's frustrating them, he said.\n\n\"They often believe they must provide extensive context in order to receive effective coaching, but this isn't true,\" he said.\n\n\"You can vent,\" Elliot added, but \"it's a very expensive venting session.\" While it may feel cathartic, you're better off airing your frustrations to a friend and using your paid coaching session to outline what you can change, such as what battles with your boss to choose, or how to communicate better with them.\n\n\"Coaching is about empowering you, not venting about your manager. Your boss isn't in the coaching session. You are,\" he said.\n\nRead more of Elliott's tips for dealing with a difficult boss.",

    "description": "William Tunstall-Pedoe co-founded Evi, which became Amazon Alexa. Here's why he decided to leave the tech giant and launch a startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, a founder and CEO. Amazon's acquisition of his startup and his role at Unlikely AI have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI helped create Alexa, a product that everyone has heard of and most people have used. I'm proud of what we built.\n\nBut by 2016, it was clear that leaving Amazon, which I joined after the company acquired my startup, was the right decision. Continuing to work on Alexa would have been a very different job from building and launching startups, which I love to do.\n\nWhen I was 13, I would go to a college next to my school to use their mainframe, and since then I've been excited by computers and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with software.\n\nI studied computer science at the University of Cambridge and taught there after graduating in 1991, but I felt better suited to entrepreneurship than to academia. If you create something genuinely new in software, it can be on a billion smartphones in six months and truly change the world. That's impact.\n\nI set out to solve what I saw as a big problem. Internet search relied on users guessing keywords to get results, rather than asking natural questions like we learn to do as children. I imagined a world where you could have that same kind of conversation with computers, which led me to found True Knowledge in 2006.\n\nInitially, we tried to build a search engine that would compete with Google, which didn't work. Then, we enabled other companies to integrate our search engine into their own products — but the larger companies didn't. For a time, we focused on SEO.\n\nThe final pivot was building a voice assistant. We created an application called Evi, which launched in the UK in 2012, a year after Apple introduced Siri. We renamed the company from True Knowledge to Evi to match our product.\n\nAs a 30-person startup, we suddenly found ourselves competing with the world's most valuable company. We spent much of that year talking to major players in tech about being acquired. Later in 2012, Amazon bought our company.\n\nJoining Amazon was the right decision. The company invested heavily in the city of Cambridge, where Evi was based, and turned our startup into a major Amazon office. Our voice assistant became one of the company's biggest and most exciting secrets.\n\nMoving from running a small startup to working inside a business with hundreds of thousands of employees, with Jeff Bezos at the top, was a big change, but I loved working there. I split my time between Amazon's offices in Seattle and Cambridge, and enjoyed going back and forth, making things happen.\n\nWhen we launched Alexa, we were taken aback by the response. It was instantly successful. Today, Alexa is a household name. I'm immensely proud of the Evi team.\n\nAmazon is known for using six-page memos instead of PowerPoint presentations to promote clarity of thought. In 2016, I wrote one to help me decide if I should leave Amazon. In the memo, I laid out these facts: I'd delivered everything I could, the acquisition had been an unambiguous success, and so too had the product. At the time, thousands of people were working on Alexa.\n\nAfter about three and a half years at Amazon, in 2016, it was time to go. I wanted to re-enter the startup world.\n\nIt's certainly possible to launch something new within a big organization, and there are real advantages to doing so. When we launched Alexa, it immediately appeared on the front page of Amazon.com, a level of exposure that most startups could only dream of. I expect I'll work at a big company again at some point in my career.\n\nBut if you're trying to do something novel or contrarian, a startup is often better suited. Within a large company, all it takes is one manager deciding that resources are better spent elsewhere for a project to die. At a startup, it's the opposite. Even if 99 venture capitalists say no, you only need one investor to say yes to keep the project alive.\n\nAfter Amazon, I spent time mentoring at startup incubators such as Creative Destruction Lab. Through that, I became an active angel investor, which gave me a broad perspective of the many ways startups succeed and fail.\n\nIn 2019, I launched Unlikely AI, a deeptech startup focused on building neurosymbolic AI. The goal is to combine the powerful but sometimes incorrect machine-learning models with the world of algorithms, where computers are almost always right. The mission of the business is about making AI trustworthy and reliable.\n\nAs CEO, I'm constantly swamped. Running a startup can be stressful, but working on something truly big and ambitious is incredibly exciting.\n\nI sometimes feel nostalgic about working inside a big organization, but I love being in the startup world. For me, leaving Amazon was the right decision. I don't regret it.",

    "description": "The partnership with the tech giant speaks to a push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind",
    "fullText": "Partnership with tech giant speaks to push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind\n\nIn this World Cup year, Fifa has come out of the blocks quickly. In the past few weeks any number of initiatives have been announced or activated, from a data partnership with Opta to facilitate more betting, to the Fifa Pass for speeding up visa applications for the US this summer, to the unveiling of the official Lego World Cup trophy. Among the ever-expanding list is an intriguing deal with TikTok, a partnership that will give digital creators front-row seats at the 104-match tournament.\n\nIn Fifa language its partnership with the short-form video platform will make “the most inclusive event in football history … even more accessible”. According to TikTok’s global head of content, James Stafford, it will bring fans “closer to the action in ways they can’t get anywhere else”. It plans to do so by granting an unspecified number of online personalities behind-the-scenes access, giving them archive and highlights footage to use in their content and, in return, requesting an avalanche of posts that will make the World Cup inescapable for TikTok users.\n\nIn choosing TikTok as its preferred platform Fifa is catching up with the times. The use of creators, also known as influencers, is increasingly essential for any consumer business. The NFL has integrated creators (quick definition: online personalities who make their living from posting on social media) into coverage of the Super Bowl since the turn of the decade. But the full possibilities of the creator economy are only beginning to be explored by sports organisations.\n\nLast summer the streaming company Dazn built its own creator network for Fifa’s Club World Cup. It enlisted as many as 50 creators to post videos that built excitement around the event, be they behind-the-scenes tours, interviews with players and coaches or stunts such as racing to see who could make it to the Chelsea v Palmeiras game on time.\n\n“It was a new tournament and we wanted to hit every lever we possibly could to generate awareness in as many places as possible, particularly with a younger audience,” says Joe Caporoso, the president of Team Whistle, a Dazn-owned company that specialises in digital strategy. “We searched through people who had strong organic followings on places like Instagram and TikTok, and who had a history of a high volume of posting consistency around not just the sport of soccer, but also the culture of it. We wanted to make sure we had people and creators who spoke authentically and were not shy about showing everything that goes on around the game.”\n\nFrom there, Caporoso’s team laid out a campaign that defined the amount of content creators were expected to generate. A group of editors and content programmers made sure each post was optimised for maximum exposure and liaised with creators to make sure no potential talking point or key moment was missed. Dazn and Whistle tracked the performance of each post, monitored the traffic that went back to Dazn’s coverage, and discussed the outcomes with TikTok.\n\nThis is a degree of oversight materially higher than that of, say, the BBC over Gary Lineker at the last European Championship. It gives a clue to one reason why creators are coming to the fore in sports coverage. Not only are they generally younger, part of a demographic sports leaders are anxious to attract, not only are they trusted by their audience due to a perceived authenticity, but creators are comfortable working in a media environment where the demands of the client come first. Their productivity can be off the charts. They perform, they shoot, they edit, they strike promotional deals, they post regularly and often. They are, in Caporoso’s words, “one-person companies”.\n\nTikTok says the Club World Cup creator platform drove more than 500,000 fans to Dazn’s service and that 90% of fans take “at least one off-platform action” after viewing sports content on their app. Fifa says its creator platform is designed for similar purposes, such as directing new viewers to its match coverage, but it could perform other functions too. It could be a new revenue stream, for example, with Fifa taking a cut from the advertising revenue generated on TikTok through the deal. It could be a way of expanding the reach of sponsorship deals Fifa has elsewhere. It establishes a relationship with a tech giant who may yet be tempted into paying for broadcast rights more broadly. Finally, the new platform could also provide a means for shaping the way the World Cup is talked about.\n\nInstead of allowing the post-match debate or attention between matchdays to be channeled by media companies, a creator platform deal keeps sports organisers in the conversation. “It’s a way for them to become a partner and to have their say, a bit of their say, in how their material is presented on second screens,” says François Godard of the media research company Enders Analysis. Creators offer the possibility of drumming up enthusiasm should interest begin to wane, but also keeping discussion away from topics that might be problematic. When Dazn secured an interview with Donald Trump before the Club World Cup final, it asked Emily Austin, from its roster of creators, to conduct it. A Maga enthusiast and marketer of Trump Derangement Syndrome merchandise, she flattered the US president and Fifa while celebrating the success of the tournament.\n\nCreators present an efficient and effective way of reaching audiences with a defined message. Godard, however, is sceptical of how useful they might be in driving audience growth for sport. “In our data, we see that the viewership of traditional TV by the 16-to-34 age group has collapsed over the past 10 years, but not in sports,” he says. “That’s because sports is unique. It’s live, and there’s no alternative.”\n\nReports in the US have suggested the picture is complicated somewhat by traditional broadcasters having acquired the rights Fifa wants to share with influencers. According to the publication Puck, TikTok would need a sublicensing deal with the broadcaster Fox, an arrangement yet to be struck. In the UK the BBC and ITV jointly hold rights to linear and digital broadcasts. The BBC said it would not comment on rights negotiations.\n\nGodard believes that instead the platform is a play to develop new places where Fifa may ultimately sell its rights, even as it extends the offering on its Fifa+ broadcast platform (thanks to a new deal with Dazn). Whatever the outcome, it may be just that creators have the power to disrupt the media environment that has made Fifa decide to embrace them.",

    "fullText": "To beat the market in recent years, many investors applied a simple strategy: Load up on the biggest U.S. technology stocks.\n\nIt paid handsomely for a long time. But last year, it didn’t. For the first time since 2022, when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, the majority of the Magnificent 7 tech giants performed worse than the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. While the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index rose 25% in 2025, compared with 16% for the S&P 500, that was only because of the enormous gains by Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp.\n\nMany Wall Street pros see that dynamic continuing in 2026, as profit growth slows and questions about payoffs from heavy artificial intelligence spending rise. So far they’ve been right, with the Magnificent 7 index up just 0.5% and the S&P 500 climbing 1.8% to start the year. Suddenly, stock picking within the group is crucial.\n\n“This isn’t a one-size-fits-all market,” said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, which has $1.4 trillion in assets. “If you’re just buying the group, the losers could offset the winners.”\n\nThe three-year bull market has been led by the tech giants, with Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. alone accounting for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gains since the run began in October 2022. But enthusiasm for them is cooling as interest in the rest of the S&P 500 rises.\n\nWith Big Tech’s earnings growth slowing, investors are no longer content with promises of AI riches — they want to start seeing a return. Profits for the Magnificent 7 are expected to climb about 18% in 2026, the slowest pace since 2022 and not much better than the 13% rise projected for the other 493 companies in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n“We’re already seeing a broadening of earnings growth and we think that’s going to continue,” said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Tech is not the only game in town.”\n\nOne source of optimism is the group’s relatively subdued valuations. The Magnificent 7 index is priced at 29 times profits projected over the next 12 months, well below the 40s multiples earlier in the decade. The S&P 500 is trading at 22 times expected earnings, and the Nasdaq 100 Index is at 25 times.\n\nHere’s a look at expectations for the year ahead.\n\nThe dominant AI chipmaker is under pressure from rising competition and concerns about the sustainability of spending by its biggest customers. The stock is up 1,165% since the end of 2022, but it has lost 11% since its Oct. 29 record.\n\nRival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has won data center orders from OpenAI and Oracle Corp., and Nvidia customers like Alphabet are increasingly deploying their own custom made processors. Still, its sales continue to race ahead as demand for chips outstrips supply.\n\nWall Street is bullish, with 76 of the 82 analysts covering the chipmaker holding buy ratings. The average analyst price target implies a roughly 39% gain over the next 12 months, best among the group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFor Microsoft, 2025 was the second consecutive year it underperformed the S&P 500. One of the biggest AI spenders, it’s expected to invest nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures during its current fiscal year, which ends in June. That figure is projected to rise to $116 billion the following year, according to the average of analyst estimates.\n\nThe data center buildout is fueling a resurgence in revenue growth in Microsoft’s cloud-computing business, but the company hasn’t had as much success in getting customers to pay for the AI services infused into its software products. Investors want to start seeing returns on those investments, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\n“What you’re seeing is some people looking for a little bit more quality management in terms of that cash flow management and a better idea on what profitability really looks like when it comes to AI,” Mulberry said.\n\nApple has been far less aggressive with its AI ambitions than the rest of the Magnificent 7. The stock was punished for it last year, falling almost 20% through the start of August.\n\nBut then it caught on as an “anti-AI” play, soaring 34% through the end of the year as investors rewarded its lack of AI spending risk. At the same time, strong iPhone sales reassured investors that the company’s most important product remains in high demand.\n\nAccelerating growth will be the key for Apple shares this year. Its momentum has slowed recently, although the stock closed higher on Friday, narrowly avoiding matching its longest losing streak since 1991. However, revenue is expected to expand 9% in fiscal 2026, which ends in September, the fastest pace since 2021. With the stock valued at 31 times estimated earnings, the second highest in the Magnificent 7 after Tesla, it will need the push to keep the rally going.\n\nA year ago, OpenAI was seen as leading the AI race and investors feared Alphabet would get left behind. Today, Google’s parent is a consensus favorite, with dominant positions across the AI landscape.\n\nAlphabet’s latest Gemini AI model received rave reviews, easing concerns about OpenAI. And its tensor processing unit chips are considered a potential significant driver of future revenue growth, which could eat into Nvidia’s commanding share of the AI semiconductor market.\n\nThe stock rose more than 65% last year, the best performance in the Magnificent 7. But how much more can it run? The company is approaching $4 trillion in market value, and the shares trade at around 28 times estimated earnings, well above their five-year average of 20. The average analyst price target projects just a 3.9% gain this year.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud-computing giant was the weakest Magnificent 7 stock in 2025, its seventh straight year in that position. But Amazon has charged out of the gate in early 2026 and is leading the pack.\n\nMuch of the optimism surrounding the company is based on Amazon Web Services, which posted its fastest growth in years in the company’s most recent results. Concerns that AWS was falling behind its rivals has pressured the stock, as has the company’s aggressive AI spending, which includes efforts to improve efficiency at its warehouses, in part by using robotics. Investors expect the efficiency push to start paying off before long, which could make this the year the stock goes from laggard to leader.\n\n“Automation in warehouses and more efficient shipping will be huge,” said Clayton Allison, portfolio manager at Prime Capital Financial, which owns Amazon shares. “It hasn’t gotten the love yet, but it reminds me of Alphabet last year, which was sort of left behind amid all the concerns about competition from OpenAI, then really took off.”\n\nPerhaps no stock in the group shows how investors have turned skeptical about lavish AI spending more than Meta. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has pushed expensive acquisitions and talent hires in pursuit of his AI ambitions, including a $14-billion investment in Scale AI in which Meta also hired the startup’s CEO Alexandr Wang to be its chief AI officer.\n\nThat strategy was fine with shareholders — until it wasn’t. The stock tumbled in late October after Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $72 billion and projected “notably larger” spending in 2026. When the shares hit a record in August they were up 35% for the year, but they’ve since dropped 17%. Demonstrating how that spending is boosting profits will be critical for Meta in 2026.\n\nTesla’s shares were the worst performers in the Magnificent 7 through the first half of 2025, but then soared more than 40% in the second half as Chief Executive Elon Musk shifted focus from slumping electric vehicle sales to self-driving cars and robotics. The rally has Tesla’s valuation at almost 200 times estimated profits, making it the second most expensive stock in the S&P 500 behind takeover target Warner Bros. Discover Inc.\n\nAfter two years of stagnant revenue, Tesla is expected to start growing again in 2026. Revenue is projected to rise 12% this year and 18% next year, following an estimated 3% contraction in 2025, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStill, Wall Street is pessimistic about Tesla shares this year. The average analyst price target projects a 9.1% decline over the next 12 months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nWittenstein and Vlastelica write for Bloomberg.",

    "fullText": "After 46 years of service to the Royal Danish Air Force, Denmark has retired its fleet of F-16 fighter planes as of January 18, 2026. Denmark has used this versatile, but now obsolete, fighter plane since 1980, having bought a total of 77 of these aircraft. A farewell ceremony was held at Skrydstrup Air Base's Hangar 3, where four F-16s landed after performing one final flight over Danish soil. Pilots, technicians, and others who had worked with the F-16s greeted the invited guests, showing off these planes one last time.\n\nThe history of the F-16 starts in the early 1970s, when a group of General Dynamics aerospace analysts and engineers designed what would become the F-16. Dissatisfied with the trend of making fighter planes more difficult to maneuver and heavier than their predecessors, this group, known as the Lightweight Fighter Mafia, created something completely different.\n\nDenmark is replacing the last of its F-16 aircraft with the F-35A Lightning II fighter jet, which has been used by the Danes since the first ones arrived there in 2023. On the first of April 2025, Denmark's F-35s took over from its F-16s in NATO's Quick Reaction Alert mission. In total, the Danish Defense Ministry has bought a total of 43 F-35s, 27 of them ordered in 2016 plus 16 additional planes in 2025. The F-35A is a single-seat aircraft powered by a Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 engine with 40,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nDenmark's switch to a full fleet of F-35A Lightning IIs makes the Royal Danish Air Force the third air force in the world, after Norway in 2022 and the Netherlands in 2024, to consist entirely of fifth-generation fighter planes, all of them being F-35As. They have all replaced their obsolete fleets of F-16s with these cutting-edge, multirole fighters. The replacement process took as long as it did due to major delays in producing the F-35 for the various forces around the world.\n\nThe F-35, which comes in many variants with distinct features, is made in three different versions for various use cases. The F-35A, the version which the U.S. Air Force and Denmark uses, is designed for conventional takeoff and landing. The F-35B, made for the U.S. Marine Corps, has a short takeoff and vertical landing capability. The F-35C, produced for the U.S. Navy, is adapted for launching from and landing on the Navy's aircraft carriers.\n\nDenmark's fleet of F-16 fighter jets are going to two different locations. Even though these F-16s are quite old, with the first batch delivered in 1980, the Danes have not only maintained them very well, they have also modernized them over the years. These actions have helped to make these planes more suitable for sale than scrapping.\n\nOne group of F-16s will be donated to Ukraine, as part of the 19 planes Denmark agreed to donate to the Ukrainian Air Force in 2023. The first of the Danish F-16s, one of the many kinds of fighter jets Ukraine has, reached Ukraine in August 2024. Denmark has also pledged to support the costs associated with training of Ukrainian pilots in Denmark, as well as those required for the maintenance and operations of these planes after they reach Ukraine. The Ukrainian Air Force uses their F-16s primarily to defend the country against Russian drones and missiles, as well as for dropping precision-guided bombs to provide close air support.\n\nA total of 24 of Denmark's F-16s will be sold to Argentina, which has not had any supersonic fighters in its arsenal since the country retired its French Mirages back in 2015. The U.S. Government was heavily involved in this deal due to its export regulations. The Argentinian F-16 package also includes training, parts, and simulators, to ensure proper maintenance and operation of the Argentine Air Force's 'new' F-16s. The first six planes were delivered in December, with additional batches each year through 2028.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Kristalina Georgieva says research suggests 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected, with many entry-level roles wiped out\n\nArtificial intelligence will be a “tsunami hitting the labour market”, with young people worst affected, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned the World Economic Forum on Friday.\n\nKristalina Georgieva told delegates in Davos that the IMF’s own research suggested there would be a big transformation of demand for skills, as the technology becomes increasingly widespread.\n\n“We expect over the next years, in advanced economies, 60% of jobs to be affected by AI, either enhanced or eliminated or transformed – 40% globally,” she said. “This is like a tsunami hitting the labour market.”\n\nShe suggested that in advanced economies, one in 10 jobs had already been “enhanced” by AI, tending to boost these workers’ pay, with knock-on benefits for the local economy.\n\nMeanwhile people whose jobs were not directly changed by artificial intelligence risked being squeezed, she said, with their pay potentially falling without a productivity boost from AI.\n\n“So the middle class, inevitably, is going to be affected,” Georgieva predicted.\n\nShe said her greatest fear was that AI was insufficiently regulated. “This is moving so fast, and yet we don’t know how to make it safe. We don’t know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it,” she said.\n\nMuch of the debate at the annual meeting of the business and political elite in the Swiss ski resort this week has been hijacked by Donald Trump’s on-off tariff threats over the future of Greenland.\n\nBut many delegates were also keen to highlight the risks and benefits of AI. Christy Hoffman, general secretary of the UNI global union, told the Guardian: “It’s just a basic premise that the point of AI, on the business side, is to increase productivity, therefore lower costs – which will be cutting jobs.”\n\n“I think it’s time to come to terms with that disruption – and how to manage that disruption,” she said, calling for the productivity benefits to be distributed fairly across the economy.\n\n“We want to share in the gains. We’re not going to stop AI, nor do we want to even try – but we don’t want it to just roll over us.” She called on employers to discuss the role of AI tools with workers and their representatives before introducing them.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, warned that AI could lose its “social permission” to compete for resources such as energy, for example, if it failed to generate benefits beyond a few powerful tech firms – such as the rapid development of effective new drugs.\n\nGeorgieva was speaking on a panel alongside the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who warned that the AI boom could be hampered by growing mistrust between rival economies, as the US throws up tariff barriers.\n\n“We are dependent on each other,” she said, pointing out that AI was capital intensive, energy intensive and data intensive. If countries did not work cooperatively and “define the new rules of the game,” she said, there would be less capital and less data. “We are in a bind, lets face it,” she said.\n\nLagarde also sounded the alarm about widening global inequality, highlighting the “disparity that is getting deeper and bigger”.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, urged delegates to face up to a permanent “rupture” in the global economic order, and band together in the face of erratic US trade policy.\n\nBut Lagarde said she was less gloomy. “I’m not exactly on the same page as Mark,” she said. “I’m not sure that we should be talking about rupture. I think we should be talking about alternatives.”",

    "fullText": "US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over private share sale that values business at $800bn\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly lining up four Wall Street banks to help the company list on the stock market as investors prepare for an expected rush of US tech listings.\n\nSpaceX is considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in an initial public offering, according to the Financial Times and Reuters.\n\nThe US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over a private share sale that values the business at $800bn (£591bn), months after it was valued at $400bn. Reuters has also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $25bn from what would be one of the biggest ever global listings if it goes ahead.\n\nLast year Musk, the world’s richest man with a $690bn fortune, said SpaceX’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa, the US space agency. SpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink broadband service.\n\nReports of SpaceX’s flotation plans come amid expectations of a bumper year for US tech listings. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and AI rival Anthropic are among the startups that are the focus of IPO speculation, with reported valuations of $1tn and $350bn respectively. The potential IPOs have been dubbed “hectocorns” – businesses worth more than $100bn.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said Musk’s ambitions to colonise Mars were the “headline grabber” for SpaceX, but investors will pay more attention to growth plans, such as putting solar farms and datacentres into orbit.\n\nReferring to a potential OpenAI IPO, Wilson added: “SpaceX is going to garner a lot of attention but it’s going to be a real test for these AI IPOs. If OpenAI does IPO then it’s a litmus test for the entire sector – can we really hang our hats on a startup? Do the figures add up?\n\n“The stock market has been riding the AI wave for two years and faces a stern test of resilience with some monster IPOs that will define whether this was a bubble or not.”\n\nGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and SpaceX were approached for comment.",

    "description": "Hisham Alrayes, CEO of GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models to spread AI's gains across its economy.",
    "fullText": "Open source — that might be the clearest signal of how China wants artificial intelligence to reshape its economy.\n\nHisham Alrayes, the group CEO of Bahrain-based GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models and broad deployment to spread AI's gains across the economy, instead of funneling them to a few tech giants.\n\nSpeaking at a Davos panel on China's \"AI+ Economy\" strategy on Wednesday, Alrayes said the country's approach reflects a fundamentally different economic philosophy.\n\n\"You look at the open structure of the China AI philosophy — then you have the non-open structure,\" Alrayes said. \"That signals that the benefit they want to see is to trickle down into the economy, into the companies.\"\n\nChina's most prominent AI breakout, DeepSeek, reflects that philosophy.\n\nIt mostly uses open-source models that have drawn global attention, in contrast to many large US language models that remain closed and proprietary, reaping the benefits of tightly controlled commercial ecosystems.\n\nMeta's former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, has said that a key reason behind DeepSeek's success is its open-source model, which, he said, can outperform proprietary models in terms of efficiency and innovation by building on shared research.\n\nMeanwhile, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said that China's open-source AI models could gain an edge globally because they're free, making them more attractive than costly proprietary US systems for governments and countries that can't afford closed models.\n\nSimilarly, Alrayes said, China — in pursuing the open model — is aiming for affordability and scale.\n\n\"It's not the benefit of that company, of that product, the return of that individual. It's not an individual — it's an economy,\" Alrayes said.\n\nThat philosophy is reflected in China's national \"AI Plus\" action plan, which prioritizes diffusion, said fellow panelist Gong Ke, executive director of the Chinese Institute for New Generation AI Development Strategies at Nankai University.\n\nThe policy, he said, focuses on embedding AI across manufacturing, healthcare, finance, education, and other sectors, rather than on breakthroughs such as artificial general intelligence.\n\nHe added that the plan sets explicit adoption targets, with AI agents and intelligent terminals expected to reach 70% penetration by 2027 and 90% by 2030.\n\nAlrayes said China's open-source tilt ultimately reflects a broader goal: making AI an economic utility rather than a profit center for a small group of companies.\n\n\"China is looking to create value throughout the economy, very clear, with very specific objectives across the economy,\" he said. \"Not just as a benefit to those companies. This is the difference in the philosophy.\"",

    "fullText": "My colleague Ben Bergman rubbed shoulders with world leaders, tech gurus, and venture capitalists in Davos this week.\n\nThere's nothing better than being in the room where it happens. I asked Ben what he saw and heard. Here are his highlights:\n\nQ: What was the biggest tech thing that was talked about at Davos this year?\n\nIt's hard to compete with President Trump and Greenland, but aside from that, AI was what everyone was talking about.\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about when businesses will start to see productivity gains that justify their huge AI spend and whether we are in a bubble.\n\nQ: What tech discussion/theme surprised you at Davos?\n\nWalking down the main thoroughfare in Davos is always a highlight because all the shops that are open the rest of the year are taken over this week by companies that host \"houses\" to showcase their brands and host clients and events.\n\nIt is interesting to see who's here and who's not.\n\nDavos is not a tech conference, and I've usually thought of it as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies.\n\nWalking along the street this year, 80% of the houses were tech. Palantir and Meta (with its free hot chocolate stand) had the most visible presence. Amazon's house was surprisingly small. Google was far away from the main action. Lightspeed was the only venture capital firm I saw, with its odd retro \"Lighthouse.\"\n\nIt is also interesting to see who was not here. OpenAI has no house, and Sam Altman did not come, though some executives are here. Elon Musk was not originally part of the program but was a last-minute addition on Thursday.\n\nQ: What was the tone of the tech executives and tech investors there?\n\nIf executives and investors are worried about the future, they did not share that with me or on stage.\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang described what is happening with AI as \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" and not only that, but said it will drive job creation across the global economy.\n\nQ: What was the biggest concern expressed by tech executives and tech investors at Davos this year?\n\nWhile optimism ruled the week, the fear of being in an AI bubble was on everyone's mind.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella warned onstage Tuesday that there would be a bubble if the only companies using AI are other AI companies.\n\n\"For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,\" Nadella said.\n\nHuang cited the rising rental price of computer chips as evidence that we are not in a bubble.\n\n\"If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs,\" he said.\n\nAnother concern from tech executives I spoke to was how hard it is to hire and retain top talent right now, especially as big AI labs spend like drunken sailors to hire.\n\n\"It's astronomical amounts of money at the big level,\" Winston Weinberg, CEO and co-founder of Harvey, told me. He said he spends 70% of his time on hiring.\n\n\"I'm super involved, and I think it's the most important thing at our company right now, Weinberg said.\n\nQ: Anything else tech folks should know from your time there?\n\nThere were so many techies here that sometimes I felt like I was in San Francisco.\n\nI asked a couple of startup founders why they came so far to be here, and the consensus was that there's nothing like Davos for the efficiency of meeting potential customers and investors who are all packed into a tiny Swiss village for the week.\n\nWaiting in the cold in a long line for a party for General Catalyst and Lightspeed, I asked one founder why he traveled here.\n\nHe told me Alexandr Wang, founder and former CEO of Scale AI, who is now chief AI officer at Meta, advised him Davos was highly useful because Wang last year said he signed almost a third of Scale's customers in the short time he was here.\n\nWeinberg told me that dealmaking started even before I arrived, with many transactions happening in the business-class sections of flights to Zurich from San Francisco and New York.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "The Federal Trade Commission filed a notice on Tuesday appealing its loss in a lawsuit that accused Meta of breaking antitrust laws to protect a monopoly in social networking.\n\nAt a trial last year, Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia considered the government’s claims that Meta snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago. He ruled in November that Meta had not broken the law.\n\n“Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp,” an agency spokesman, Joe Simonson, said. “Thankfully for Americans, there is an appeal process.”\n\nA Meta spokesman, Christopher Sgro, said in a statement that Judge Boasberg’s “decision to reject the F.T.C.’s arguments is correct, and recognizes the fierce competition we face.”\n\nThe F.T.C. is aiming to reverse a setback in the government’s campaign to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies. In the last two years, the government has won federal antitrust cases against Google, with judges saying the company has monopolies in online search and advertising technology. It has also sued Amazon and Apple over monopoly concerns.\n\nJudge Boasberg’s six-week trial in the lawsuit against Meta featured testimony from witnesses including Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, and an Instagram founder, Kevin Systrom.\n\nThe government argued that Meta bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014 to get rid of the threat posed by young competitors.\n\nJudge Boasberg ruled in favor of Meta’s arguments that changes in social media, including the growth of TikTok and YouTube, undercut the government’s case about Meta’s dominance.\n\nThe F.T.C.’s notice of appeal on Tuesday, filed in the District Court, is preliminary. The agency will lay out its legal argument for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit at a later date.",

    "description": "The early winners of the legal tech boom are gobbling up smaller competitors.",
    "fullText": "Legal tech is entering its consolidation era.\n\nEarly signs are already visible. This week, Harvey, an $8 billion legal software giant, acquired Hexus, a sales tech startup built by former Google and Twitter (now X) engineers. Filevine, another major legal tech player, recently snapped up Pincites, a four-person startup that was an early Y Combinator bet on what has since become one of legal tech's hottest frontiers: artificial intelligence-powered contract drafting and revision.\n\nAnd earlier this month, Microsoft quietly absorbed 18 employees from the legal software startup Robin AI after it filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIndustry executives say this is just the beginning. Early winners of the legal tech boom are expected to buy smaller companies to extend their leads and add new features to their software.\n\nFor teams in a crowded legal tech market, joining one of those platforms is increasingly attractive, said John Locke, a Filevine investor and partner at Accel, who leads the firm's growth fund. He believes Harvey and Filevine could both be significant public companies someday.\n\n\"They're now at a point where people look at them and say, 'I would like to join that fast train,'\" Locke said.\n\nPincites wasn't looking for an exit.\n\nThe company was founded in 2023 by two sisters working from home. Sona Sulakian was a transactional patent attorney. Mariam Sulakian worked on GitHub Copilot, focusing on security. They saw a gap: Lawyers negotiate contracts inside Microsoft Word, but most AI tools lived elsewhere.\n\nThey built a Word plug-in lawyers actually used, and racked up customers including Redis, Glean, and Vercel. In 2023, Pincites raised a seed round led by Nat Friedman, GitHub's former CEO, and Daniel Gross, who, with Friedman, now works in Meta's superintelligence lab.\n\nInvestors encouraged the sisters to raise another round of funding. Then the inbound acquisition interest started.\n\nAt one point, there were at least five or six term sheets on the table, Ryan Anderson, Filevine's founder and CEO, said. The sisters initially waved them off.\n\nWhat changed, both sides said, was familiarity. Filevine had already been a customer. Its internal legal team used the Pincites software for contract redlining — the process of marking up and revising contract drafts during negotiations — and pushed Anderson to take a closer look.\n\nFounded in 2014, the Utah company now manages over 13 million active legal matters on the platform and sells software used by law firms, corporate legal teams, and government agencies. Its customers include Kroger, Goodwill, the Utah Jazz, and five state attorneys general.\n\nFilevine has raised over $600 million in funding to date and was last valued at $3 billion.\n\nWhat the company lacked was a next-generation redlining tool.\n\nSome competitors, Anderson noted, promote redlining as a core feature. To compete for enterprise and mid-market deals, Filevine needed a comparable offering.\n\nThe entire Pincites team is joining Filevine and will anchor a new San Francisco office. Over time, the product will be folded into Filevine's system, creating what Anderson calls \"a single pane of glass\" where users can draft and edit documents, pull in context from other systems, and track time and billing.\n\nFor the Sulakian sisters, the decision came down to distribution. Pincites had more ideas than it had capacity to execute, they said, and expanding its customer base fast enough to capture the market would have required years of additional fundraising and hiring. Joining a larger platform offered a shortcut.\n\nPincites didn't sell because it was distressed, Mariam said. \"We would have been fine no matter what.\" It sold because the market is maturing.\n\nAfter years of experimenting with narrow, single-purpose tools, law firms and in-house legal teams are looking to simplify, Sona said. Managing a patchwork of apps became costly and unwieldy, particularly for smaller firms.\n\nThat pressure is now driving a \"shakeout of point solutions,\" said Omar Haroun, cofounder and chief executive of the legal tech company Eudia.\n\n\"The winners will be platforms embedded in daily legal workflows and tied to outcomes,\" Haroun said. \"The rest will be acquired, merged, or phased out.\"\n\nThat dynamic mirrors what played out during the rise of mobile software. Smartphones unleashed a wave of narrowly focused apps, made possible by cheap development and easy distribution. But as platforms matured, users tired of app sprawl, and the biggest companies began bundling features or buying competitors outright. Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. Google bought Waze.\n\nLegal tech now appears to be entering a similar phase, as large language models lower the barrier to building these tools — and raise the bar for surviving as a standalone company.\n\nOver $4 billion flowed into startups building technology for lawyers last year, nearly double the amount raised the year before, according to Crunchbase. More than a third of last year's investment went to just three companies: Harvey, Filevine, and Clio, which sells software used by law firms to track cases and send invoices.\n\nLast year, Clio scooped up the legal research platform vLex for $1 billion, part of its push to become the system of record for small and midsize firms.\n\nWith that concentration of capital comes pressure. The biggest players have to deploy it. And smaller startups have to prove they can hold their own. For some builders, the choice may increasingly be to sell — before the window narrows further.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Janie George, 31, a mother and senior art director based in Utah. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in the '90s and 2000s with the sound of dial-up and the feeling of figuring out how to use a computer for the first time. When the first iPhone came out, I was in junior high school, and I learned more digital things as time went on.\n\nAs parents to our 3, 6, and 9-year-olds, my husband and I are trying to raise our kids with a nice balance between modern and analog. Our goal is to keep the '90s alive in our household.\n\nWe live in a really busy time, and I don't want to pretend we don't have modern conveniences in my house. We have TVs and other things that are definitely not from the '90s and back further, but living a more analog lifestyle has allowed my family to connect, slow down, and have more fun moments together. We use everything from a film camera to a typewriter, a Tin Can phone, VHS tapes, and more.\n\nIt has brought me a lot of joy, and it's been fun to share with my kids what both my husband and I experienced growing up.\n\nIt's been two or three years of trying to be more selective and more specific about the media that my kids consume as it relates to their development and attention span. A few months ago, we bought a VHS and DVD machine from Facebook Marketplace for $80.\n\nMy husband and I have been showing our kids classic movies, and my son loves to watch \"Jaws\" and \"Indiana Jones.\" I know my parents loved showing me \"Gilligan's Island,\" \"Bewitched,\" \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" and \"Hogan's Heroes,\" and I had a lot of joy experiencing their joy with them. It's been fun to connect on that and share with my kids.\n\nWe also have a Nintendo Classic Mini: Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System, which include classic games. They plug in with an HDMI and are preloaded with games, making them super easy to set up.\n\nThey can turn on what they want, rewind it, and be fully independent. When they want to play the Nintendo Switch or watch a more modern movie or something on YouTube TV, it's upstairs with mom and dad, and we're helping facilitate that.\n\nWe have a thrift store just down the road, and my kids are welcome to use the money from chores to purchase any movie they're hoping to get. We've also been looking for certain movies on eBay to add to our collection, which is really fun.\n\nSomething we've implemented and plan to do more often is creating the feeling of going to the movie rental store and picking out a movie. We've done it a couple of times: we go to Savers, a local thrift store, pick out a movie, get a pizza, pick out a treat, and have that same feeling I had, but letting them lead the way.\n\nI've taken our family photos on film for several years, and I'm trying to teach my kids that we don't need an instant photo. We can take our time, be in the moment, and feel excited about the process.\n\nIt's fun for me to pick the photos and turn them into a family book every year. A huge part of it is made up of the photos I take with that camera. You just can't capture that type of moment with an iPhone or other digital camera.\n\nI don't know if my children really care about it yet, but they love getting the chance to take the photo and hear the noises, along with the tactile feeling. I've spent a lot of money on film and developing it, but it's worth it.\n\nOne time, we found a really cool box of trading cards at Savers, and my son curated a pack of them for his friends for Christmas. One of his friends really likes the Packers, so we found all the Packers cards that were in that box and gave them to him. It just offers another activity and form of connection for my kids and their friends.\n\nThey like to take their binder of cards in the basket of their bike to their friend's home to trade cards — stuff that I watched my brothers do. I didn't offer it to them; it was just a natural thing they wanted to do.\n\nWhen one of my kids wants to have a playdate, they have to ask me to call their friend's mom to schedule it. I work full time, so it can be difficult to manage my kids' schedules in their entirety.\n\nThe Tin Can phone idea was really exciting to me because we can decide who they can call and when it's available to use, using its quiet time feature.\n\nThe Tin Can phone costs $75 plus shipping, but there's a $9.99 monthly fee to call any phone on any network. It's been 100% worth it. Sometimes on FaceTime, they want to hit all of the buttons and see all the faces. While that's fun, I don't know that they're actually communicating with the other person.\n\nBesides being able to schedule play dates, my son is having fun coming home from school and calling a friend. It's such a great way to gain skills like speaking on the phone, speaking politely, and managing their schedules. It also delays the need for a cellphone. I just want them to be present with where they are.\n\nA few years ago, one of my sons asked for a typewriter for Christmas. He had one in one of his preschool classes. It was analog and fun, and he was really excited about it. I spent $35 on a vintage typewriter on Facebook Marketplace.\n\nMy kids say they love writing letters to friends and Santa on the typewriter. They show their friends how it works, and they use it every couple of days. One of their favorite activities is when I type up a design \"brief,\" and they draw or design a logo based on that brief.\n\nWhen we bought the Tin Can phone, we thought a Rolodex would be a really fun way for them to keep track of their friends' and other phone numbers. Plus, it looks kind of cute on the table. We picked one out on eBay, typed out all of the cards with the typewriter, and decorated them with stickers.",

    "description": "A Gen Zer landed an engineering role at Snap without a tech internship, thanks to a networking trick and support from her friends.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sreeja Apparaju, a 24-year-old machine learning engineer at Snap living in New York. Business Insider has verified Apparaju's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I decided to pivot from finance to tech in the fall of 2022, a couple of things were working against me.\n\nI was less than a year from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with a double major in computer science and economics, and some large tech companies had announced major layoffs before the end of the year. That made me nervous about the demand for new hires.\n\nI also didn't have any tech internships to fall back on. The prior summer, I'd interned as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, but I realized that finance didn't feel like the right path; I was more excited about the kind of work happening in tech.\n\nIt felt like unfortunate timing to be searching for tech roles — but at least I didn't have to job hunt alone.\n\nGiven these challenges, I was fortunate to have the support of a close circle of four friends who were applying to many of the same software engineering roles. When one of us heard from a recruiter or HR professional, we'd share their contact information with the group.\n\nThat's how I connected with a Palantir recruiter. Within a week of applying, I received an online assessment and was scheduled for an interview. I didn't end up getting the job, but I'm confident that getting on the recruiter's radar helped boost my chances.\n\nIn job searching, there can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of others. In my experience, though, sharing what we knew and helping each other out made the process easier — and faster — for all five of us.\n\nEvery win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was the motivation I needed to keep pushing for a job offer. One landed a role at Amazon, and another joined Salesforce. However, by the end of 2022, I was still looking.\n\nIn early January 2023, I came across an opening at Snap Inc. — the company behind Snapchat — for a software engineering role. Snap had already been on my radar as a company I thought could be a good fit. The cousin of one of my friends in my job search circle worked there, and I immediately reached out to them, obtained their referral, and submitted my application within a couple of days of the role being posted.\n\nHowever, February came around, and I still hadn't heard back from Snap. I decided to take action; I got on LinkedIn and searched for a recruiter at the company who specialized in hiring new graduates.\n\nMy goal was to reach out via email rather than a LinkedIn message. Since I didn't have a LinkedIn Premium account, I was limited in the number of characters I could use — and I worried that sending a short message would come across as superficial.\n\nI eventually found someone who appeared to be the recruiter, but their email wasn't listed anywhere. However, I did have the email of my referral contact, so I decided to guess the recruiter's email address based on the same email format — a strategy that had worked for me in the past. If I guessed incorrectly, I'd get an error message, and then I'd try a different version.\n\nI could have asked my referral for the recruiter's email, but I was already deeply grateful for their time and referral, and I felt uncomfortable asking for more.\n\nFortunately, it didn't take long for me to send an email that appeared to go through. It included my résumé and an expression of interest in the role.\n\nWithin a few days, I received a response from the recruiter and was given an online assessment to complete. Shortly after, I did my first interview — a one-hour technical and behavioral interview with an engineer.\n\nThat was followed by a final interview round, which included four one-hour technical interviews, a 30-minute Q&A session, and a 30-minute break between the third and fourth rounds — about five hours total in a single day.\n\nOne thing I like about Snap is that it's smaller than companies like Meta or Google, which means I'm given a lot of agency and independence on the projects I work on.\n\nMy top pieces of advice for other job seekers are:\n\nI'm really glad I listened to my gut and decided to pivot to tech when I started to sense during my finance internship that it wasn't the right path for me, rather than continuing down the same road.\n\nAdditionally, I'd recommend leaning on others, whether that's friends or your broader network. Given the tough job market, I've found that many people are willing to help if you reach out to them.",

    "fullText": "Misinformation technology could be deployed at scale to disrupt 2028 US presidential election, AI researchers say\n\nPolitical leaders could soon launch swarms of human-imitating AI agents to reshape public opinion in a way that threatens to undermine democracy, a high profile group of experts in AI and online misinformation has warned.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize-winning free-speech activist Maria Ressa, and leading AI and social science researchers from Berkeley, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and Yale are among a global consortium flagging the new “disruptive threat” posed by hard-to-detect, malicious “AI swarms” infesting social media and messaging channels.\n\nA would-be autocrat could use such swarms to persuade populations to accept cancelled elections or overturn results, they said, amid predictions the technology could be deployed at scale by the time of the US presidential election in 2028.\n\nThe warnings, published today in Science, come alongside calls for coordinated global action to counter the risk, including “swarm scanners” and watermarked content to counter AI-run misinformation campaigns. Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said. “These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”\n\nOne leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.\n\nThe experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”\n\nOthers include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.\n\nTogether they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.\n\nThe threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.\n\nAs well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.\n\n“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.\n\nAnother of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”\n\nIn Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.\n\nDuring discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.\n\n“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”\n\nAmid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.\n\n“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”\n\n“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "Growing concerns about the impact of smartphones on the youngest children must be addressed\n\nThe first UK government guidance on young children’s use of tablets, smartphones and other screens, expected in April, cannot come soon enough. The laissez-faire approach to the boom in social media, handheld devices and other digital technology was arguably nowhere less suitable than when such machines were placed in front of babies. The Department for Education’s ongoing Children of the 2020s study has found that 98% of two-year-olds watch screens on a typical day for more than two hours. Those who spent the most time had smaller vocabularies, and were twice as likely as other children to show signs of emotional and behavioural difficulties.\n\nCorrelation must not be mistaken for causation. This is still a relatively new area of research, and much remains uncertain. But the findings of a recent survey by the charity Kindred Squared, combined with observations by teachers, are highly concerning. Answers from 1,000 primary-school staff revealed that 37% of four-year-olds arrived without basic life skills such as dressing and eating in 2025 – up from 33% two years earlier.\n\nSome of these may have additional needs. And there is no suggestion from the charity that screens are the only issue. Stresses caused by the high cost of living, cuts to local early years services and other factors affect the quality of the youngest children’s lives. But many teachers, along with one of their unions, the NASUWT, believe that the impact of screens must be addressed, with parents as well as children encouraged to prioritise books and bricks over swipes and clicks.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends that children under two should not use screens at all. But even if such prohibitions are unlikely to be heeded by the majority, ministers could be more ambitious in making the case for a precautionary approach. The importance of early speech, communication and emotional development should be clearly explained, and parents given support when they need it.\n\nSince global outrage was sparked earlier this month by nudification on Grok, and the ease with which such images could be shared on X, the debate around regulation has dramatically shifted. Over recent days, Kemi Badenoch has thrown her party’s weight behind an age limit of 16 for social media apps, following Australia’s example. With a number of Labour MPs sympathetic, the government is under pressure to agree.\n\nThose pushing for tougher rules are right that existing regulations are full of holes. Age verification should have been introduced sooner. Addictive features should never have been allowed on children’s accounts. But in the rush to gain political advantage from the current spike in concern, there is a risk of issues becoming confused. When considering screens and preschool children, a key question is what other activities (books, toys, ballgames) are being replaced, and why this matters. Weighing the impact of social media and smartphones on teenagers involves different calculations. Nudification apps are a distinct problem. It could be argued that the new focus on under-16s risks distracting attention from the more general danger posed by sexually explicit AI-generated material.\n\nOfcom’s prompt response to the Grok/X nudification outcry was welcome. Politicians and campaigners may be right that under-16s’ social media use should be restricted. Warnings about screens and toddlers should be heeded. The wider message of the past few weeks is that democratic oversight of the tech industry needs to accelerate.\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "description": "Here’s a roundup of research and predictions for tech workers amid the AI revolution.",
    "fullText": "The tech job market in 2026 is being built on contradictions.\n\nCompanies are laying off staff, insisting artificial intelligence will “do more with less” — yet they haven’t found ways to deploy AI at scale. Recruiters say entry-level pathways are narrowing, but critical roles remain hard to fill.\n\nEven as headlines scream “automation,” the day-to-day reality is messier: Hybrid work is still a dealbreaker, job titles are splintering into new specialties, and workers are being asked to produce more output with fewer resources.\n\nRest of World reviewed recent research on tech job trends in 2026\n\nDeloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study noted that while 30% of surveyed organizations are exploring agentic options and 38% are piloting solutions, only 14% have solutions that are ready to be deployed. A mere 11% are actively using these systems in production. Furthermore, 42% of organizations report they are still developing their agentic strategy road map, with 35% having no formal strategy at all.\n\nWhile most human workers are generally comfortable with predictable, rule-based robots, physical AI systems that learn and adapt introduce new uncertainties, especially worries about job displacement. Experts predict, however, that most roles will evolve toward collaboration rather than replacement.\n\nThe goal is to create environments where robots handle repetitive or dangerous tasks while humans focus on creative problem-solving and complex decision-making.\n\nThe best workers want hybrid or remote roles. Yet more companies are demanding full-time in-office attendance. It’s not making hiring any easier.\n\nThe battle lines have been drawn. Companies are demanding people return to the office full-time while workers dig in their heels, insisting they want remote or hybrid work options.\n\nCompanies are demanding people return to office while workers dig in their heels”\n\nAccording to the Korn Ferry report, 52% of talent acquisition leaders say office mandates hinder recruitment, while 72% find remote roles easier to fill.\n\nBusiness leaders might think this is fine right now, but in roles with chronic skills shortages, it’ll rapidly be clear that it’s not fine at all.\n\nIf your employer brand isn’t strong enough to overcome the office requirement, you’ll end up paying premium salaries to attract people who would otherwise work elsewhere. Or worse, you’ll just be filling seats — settling for whoever is willing to show up, not the talent who will move your business forward.\n\nTech recruitment platform Built In\n\nAs companies seek specialists, the emergence of new roles with novel job titles and nuanced skill requirements will be a feature of 2026. As the economy picks up steam, companies will narrow their focus and drift away from broad-spectrum roles with catch-all titles like “software engineer” and “data scientist” toward more tailored, task-specific job titles.\n\nNavigating the future of work in tech this year will involve companies focused more at the intersection of AI-workflow integration, governance, and impact.",

    "description": "Paramount is giving more power to a streaming data and insights executive as part of David Ellison's plan to make Paramount into a tech-first company.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is showing that his tech-first vision for Paramount Skydance isn't just talk.\n\nEllison is taking his data-focused strategy to a new level by elevating Jason Kim, Paramount's EVP of data and insights, to oversee data for the entire company, instead of just the direct-to-consumer division.\n\nThe change was announced by Domenic DiMeglio — who heads up marketing as well as data and insights for Paramount's streaming division — in a Thursday afternoon staff meeting, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider.\n\nKim's increased remit comes a day after Ellison, Paramount's CEO, met with company leadership in its New York offices.\n\n\"It's a wonderful opportunity for Jason — and for the team overall — to start playing a bigger role for what's happening at Paramount as we move forward,\" DiMeglio said in the meeting.\n\nDiMeglio added that Kim's bigger role is part of \"David's vision of trying to transform ourselves into being a tech-first media company — and, really, the most tech-forward media company in this space.\"\n\nEllison has remade Paramount in other ways since taking control of the company in August, including securing US UFC rights, hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News, and attempting to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhile Paramount already had data and analytics teams across the company, it now has a new point person to oversee those efforts.\n\n\"I would hope and expect that, little by little, we're going to bring those silos down,\" DiMeglio said. He added it's \"not easy work.\"\n\nDane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, said in an email to employees that \"these updates are part of a broader effort to focus our investments, reduce fragmentation, and move faster as one team.\"\n\nParamount's streaming team has become familiar with change. Last week, Paramount's streaming product and tech chief, Vibol Hou, told colleagues he was leaving at the end of January, Business Insider reported.\n\n\"You could probably sense that there's been some musical chairs stuff going on within the organization at large,\" Kim said. \"And that's not unique. That's sort of true of any company that's undergoing a large-scale organizational transformation, like the one that we're in the midst of now.\"\n\nContinuing the musical chairs analogy, Kim said that this change signals that \"this is our chair — we're here to stay.\"\n\nAlthough Paramount laid off about 1,000 employees in October, a few months after its Skydance merger closed, Kim downplayed the idea that this data and insights shake-up signals that more cuts are ahead.\n\n\"I don't think our scope is going to get smaller here. It is only going to get larger,\" Kim said. \"And I think those are all exciting tailwinds for us as a team.\"\n\nKim added that \"there might be more consolidation in the future, but that's going to be into our team.\"\n\nTwo Paramount employees in the meeting told Business Insider they were happy to hear about the change.\n\n\"It is exciting, given that we will have a lot more visibility than we used to,\" one employee on this team said.\n\nAnother staffer said this change indicates that Paramount is \"somewhat serious about the 'tech'-ification of the company.\"",

    "fullText": "Hundreds of writers, musicians and performers urge licensing deals instead of scraping creative work\n\nScarlett Johansson, Cate Blanchett, REM and Jodi Picoult are among hundreds of Hollywood stars, musicians and authors backing a new campaign accusing AI companies of “theft” of their work.\n\nThe “Stealing Isn’t Innovation” drive launched on Thursday with the support of approximately 800 creative professionals and bands. The campaign includes a statement accusing tech firms of using American creators’ work to “build AI platforms without authorisation or regard for copyright law”.\n\nIt adds: “Artists, writers, and creators of all kinds are banding together with a simple message: Stealing our work is not innovation. It’s not progress. It’s theft – plain and simple.”\n\nThe statement urges AI companies to pursue licensing deals and partnerships with the creative industries and acknowledges firms that have taken that route. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, has signed deals with content owners including Disney and the Guardian, while Warner Music Group has struck a licensing deal with AI music generator Suno.\n\nHowever, copyright remains one of the most contentious issues within AI, because the models that power chatbots like ChatGPT or image generators like Grok Imagine rely on vast amounts of data taken from the open web in order to help create their responses. Creative professionals argue that tech firms should seek their permission before using such material – and that they should receive a payment if they give their consent.\n\nOpenAI, and other AI firms, have argued that using material available online is “fair use”, a US legal doctrine that allows use of copyright-protected work without the owner’s permission in certain circumstances. As of last year, dozens of lawsuits had been launched in the US over the AI and copyright issue.\n\nJohansson was dragged into the AI debate in 2024 after OpenAI’s voice assistant used her vocal likeness, prompting the actor say she was “shocked, angered and in disbelief” by the move. OpenAI subsequently removed the voice from ChatGPT.\n\nOther signatories to the statement include actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and singer Cyndi Lauper. Last year Gilligan described AI as the “world’s most expensive and energy-intensive plagiarism machine”.\n\nThe “Stealing Isn’t Innovation” push has been organised by the Human Artistry Campaign, whose backers include the Writers Guild of America, the Recording Industry Association of America and the actors’ trade union SAG-AFTRA, which went on strike in 2023, partly over the use of AI.\n\nIn the UK, the government has been under fire for proposing that AI firms should be allowed to use copyright-protected work without first seeking artists’ permission, unless they signal that they wish to “opt out” of the process. The technology secretary, Liz Kendall, said this month that the government was seeking a “reset” on these plans via an official review due to be published in March.",

    "fullText": "The president wants big tech to pay more for electricity, but he’s curbing renewable projects that could boost supply\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nThe US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and the Trump administration to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardian reported just after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off is scarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced $17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments may keep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.",

    "description": "Citadel CEO Ken Griffin says AI has shifted power to tech teams, but today's tools often fall short, even as massive data-center spending accelerates.",
    "fullText": "Hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin has a blunt message for anyone expecting artificial intelligence to instantly rewrite the global economy: the hype is real — and it's there to justify enormous spending.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, the Citadel CEO said the AI boom is being fueled as much by narrative as by real productivity gains.\n\nGriffin, who ranks as the 39th wealthiest person in the world with a net worth of about $48.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said that doesn't mean AI isn't powerful — but expectations have run far ahead of reality.\n\n\"Is it hype? Of course,\" Griffin said, pointing to the extraordinary scale of investment now pouring into AI infrastructure.\n\nGriffin said that data center spending in the US is estimated to top $500 billion this year. Bank of America previously estimated that Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta — who are leading the data center construction boom — will spend a combined $385 billion annually on AI infrastructure between 2025 and 2028.\n\n\"You're not going to generate this kind of spend unless you're going to make a promise you're going to profoundly change the world,\" Griffin said.\n\n\"How else are you going to get people to write $500 billion of checks just this year alone?\" he added.\n\nGriffin's skepticism came after he was asked whether he agreed with predictions from AI leaders such as Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who has said that half of all entry-level white-collar jobs could disappear within five years.\n\nGriffin didn't endorse that view, instead questioning whether AI systems are delivering the kind of deep productivity gains that would justify such forecasts.\n\nTech leaders, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, have pointed to overheated valuations and investor overexcitement to predict a looming bubble.\n\nOthers, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have said AI spending reflects a fundamental shift in computing and that demand and model capabilities are still growing fast enough to justify the buildout.\n\nWhat is certain for Griffin said is that AI has \"re-empowered the head of technology in every business in the United States,\" he said.\n\nGriffin was especially critical of generative AI outputs in white-collar work, saying they often look impressive at first glance but fall apart under scrutiny.\n\nHe described reviewing an AI-generated report that seemed insightful at the top but devolved into \"garbage\" further down.\n\nStill, Griffin isn't dismissing AI's long-term impact. He said the technology will be transformative in areas like call centers and software development, and that massive investment in technology broadly is already benefiting the economy.",

    "description": "Google launched free SAT practice tests via Gemini, with Princeton Review content, challenging traditional tutoring and ed-tech firms.",
    "fullText": "Students have long studied for the SATs with endless flashcards and prep books that doubled as doorstops. There's also personal tutors and prep classes for those who can afford it.\n\nGoogle debuted free, on-demand practice tests for the SAT through Google Gemini on Wednesday. The content of these tests is vetted by the Princeton Review — one of the publishers of those study tombs — while feedback is given by Google's AI.\n\nWhile the practice tests are only available for the SAT, Google teased that more exams were coming in the future.\n\n\"For anything you don't understand, you can ask Gemini to explain the correct answer,\" wrote Google DeepMind's Carol Walport. \"By helping you identify specific knowledge gaps, Gemini empowers you to turn those insights into action.\"\n\nWe’re launching full-length, on demand practice exams for standardized tests in @GeminiApp, starting with the SAT, available now at no cost.\n\nPractice SATs are grounded in rigorously vetted content in partnership with @ThePrincetonRev, and Gemini will provide immediate feedback… pic.twitter.com/GmivPuBp7B\n\nIt's another blow to the tutoring industry, a small but lucrative space coaching young adults toward academic success. College prep is especially high-earning. One SAT tutor told Business Insider last year that he charged $135 to $155 an hour; an essay tutor said he made $200,000 while only working nine months.\n\nIt's not the first time technology has eaten into the largely human tutoring industry. PDFs of practice tests have long run rampant around the internet. Tools like Quizlet and Chegg have made it easier for students to share study materials.\n\nThe threat of AI is wholly new, though, and the industry is still figuring out how to respond.\n\nIn 2023, Chegg's stock crashed 49% in a single day after the company said students were using ChatGPT to study. Two years later, the company laid off 45% of its workforce — or 388 employees — while citing the \"new realities of AI.\"\n\nSal Khan, the founder of the online tutoring program Khan Academy, said in 2023 that AI could be the \"biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen.\" Khan aims to give every student an \"artificially intelligent, but amazing, personal tutor.\"\n\nThe AI companies also know that education is a space where they can grow. Anthropic launched Claude for Education in April, which included student programs and a \"learning mode.\" Elon Musk's xAI has Grokipedia, a knowledge base similar to Wikipedia.\n\nOpenAI launched its Study Mode in July, when Business Insider declared education a \"new battlefield in the AI war.\"\n\nIn his famous 2023 letter about the future of AI, Bill Gates gave significant space to his predictions for education. Teachers would need to adapt, he wrote, but they wouldn't go away entirely.\n\n\"Even once the technology is perfected, learning will still depend on great relationships between students and teachers,\" Gates wrote. \"It will enhance — but never replace — the work that students and teachers do together in the classroom.\"\n\nBut for students and parents evaluating their options ahead of SAT season, Gemini's new test-prep offerings are the latest competition for human tutors.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk wants to see your results, not your résumé.\n\nThe Tesla CEO this week requested that people who want to work on the company's Dojo3 AI chip email three bullet points describing the \"toughest technical problems you've solved.\"\n\nMusk's just-the-facts approach, outlined in a post on X, reflects a focus on problem-solving over fancy résumés or cover letters.\n\n\"He's basically just trying to cut through the noise of the job market,\" said Michelle Volberg, a longtime recruiter who is the founder of Twill, a startup that pays tech workers to recommend peers for key jobs.\n\nShe said that résumés or LinkedIn profiles don't always make it clear to employers where a person's skills lie. Asking a job seeker to lay out a trio of battles won can help hiring managers get to the meat of someone's abilities, Volberg told Business Insider.\n\nIt's a way of thinking that she expects more employers will adopt.\n\n\"Elon is showing the way that the job market is going to go,\" she said.\n\nAlready, some tech companies are eager for job candidates to demonstrate their abilities by highlighting how they arrived at an answer. It's part of what appears to be a show-your-work ethos in Silicon Valley, where hefty spending on AI projects and a hangover from the pandemic-era staffing boom are driving hiring austerity in all but the hottest areas.\n\nVolberg said that hiring managers at large companies have told her that they're sick of relying on résumés so tailored to a job opening that they reveal little about candidates themselves. Asking job seekers to identify a small number of concrete problems they've solved can help overcome that challenge and help bring clarity for hiring managers, she said.\n\n\"They don't want to see fluffy résumés that have been written by ChatGPT,\" Volberg said.\n\nBullets over bona fides is, of course, a departure from the conventional approach of stuffing a résumé with bolded job titles, years of experience, and skills.\n\nAsking applicants to summarize the value they would bring by sharing vignettes of success can elevate technical accomplishment over pedigree or background, she said. It's an example of what some HR types call \"skills-based hiring.\"\n\nMusk's no-frills call for applicants appears to build on his prior statements about being open to candidates from nontraditional backgrounds. For years, the billionaire has said that people didn't need a college degree to work for Tesla. Musk has said that he's more focused on evidence of \"exceptional\" ability or achievement.\n\nHe also requested bullet points in 2025 when he oversaw efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency group to remake swaths of the US federal government. A nearly year-old post on X said that DOGE was seeking \"world-class\" software engineers, product managers, and data scientists, among other roles.\n\nAn application portal linked to the post contains a field instructing applicants to include two or three bullets \"showcasing exceptional ability,\" and to upload a résumé.\n\nVolberg said the bullet method is similar to guidance that her company already gives job seekers: Focus less on adjectives and more on outcomes.\n\nFrom a hiring manager's perspective, she said, the central question is whether a candidate can make their job easier by solving real problems.\n\nThe corollary, Volberg said, is fakers beware: \"If you say that you've solved these three things, you'd better be able to talk about them in detail.\"\n\nShe said that it's often immediately clear to tech recruiters whether someone has actually done the work they describe. Candidates who exaggerate or fabricate their accomplishments are likely to be found out — and potentially blacklisted, Volberg said.\n\nBeyond candidate chicanery, there could be other risks to Musk's strategy, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews.\n\nAsking people to submit summaries of their greatest tech wins could mean that an employer like Tesla misses out on the quiet contributors and introverts who might not do as good a job promoting themselves, he told Business Insider. Bullets of key achievements — even more than with a typical résumé — require people to make the case for their own work.\n\nMurray said that Musk's approach also overlooks the impacts of the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect, in which people who aren't great at something tend to overestimate their abilities, and those who are ace might assume a task is easy for anyone.\n\n\"What he is asking people to do is to market themselves,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "description": "Cougar Nation should be mighty proud of what its women’s basketball squad accomplished Wednesday night.",
    "fullText": "Thanks to recent football and men’s basketball matchups which all resulted in losses, BYU fans have learned to really loathe Texas Tech.\n\nThus, Cougar Nation should be mighty proud of what its women’s basketball squad accomplished Wednesday night.\n\nBYU scored a 73-61 upset victory over the No. 19-ranked Lady Raiders at the Marriott Center, toppling the Big 12’s top team for Lee Cummard’s first ranked win at the helm of the Cougars’ program.\n\n“I’m just really proud of the group and glad to see their hard work paying off and be rewarded for how close of a group it is, and how hard they work and prepare for these games,” Cummard told reporters after the win. “(We) had a great couple days of practice, great shoot around this morning. I just want (the players) to know that, you know, they’re a really good team and they’re rewarded for that tonight.”\n\nBYU trailed for less than a minute to open the night before quickly pulling ahead and never looking back, leading by as many as 17 points against a Texas Tech team that had yet to lose on the road and was 19-1 prior to arriving in Provo.\n\n“I felt like at least tonight, regardless of who they have, our five were more connected and tighter as a group, and we were the better five on the court,” Cummard said.\n\nThe Cougars shot a collective 47.3% from the field and 44.4% from 3-point range — a far cry from their previous season average of 29.7% — while feasting down low for 36 paint points.\n\nshots are fallin' ☔️\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/HaKZkEFic9\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\nBest exemplifying BYU’s fight was center Lara Rohkohl, who finished with 15 points, eight rebounds and a game-high plus/minus of +15, refusing to let the ultra-physical Lady Raiders push her around in the post.\n\n“They were a little aggressive down there, but you know, we stood against it and we did a good job down there,” Rohkohl said. “The guards were giving me perfect passes into my hands, and I just had to go up and finish it.”\n\nFeeding Rohkohl often was star sophomore point guard Delaney Gibb, who fought through double teams for 18 points, five rebounds and six assists while swiping four steals on the defensive end of the floor.\n\nAutomatic🔥\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/E5ruG3c7mP\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“I know that if I’m getting hounded and double-teamed, I can kick to shooters and pass to Lara and they’re gonna make plays out of it,” Gibb said. “And so I think we played super connected tonight and just moved the ball really well, which opened up great looks for us.”\n\nSome of that ball movement came from Rohkohl, who cashed in two assists by kicking outside to Gibb for a pair of 3-pointers.\n\nBullseye Delaney🎯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Dn4lsb6UJ6\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“Being in the paint and kicking out to a 3, in my opinion, is the best shot that there is,” Gibb said. “It’s really easy to make, all your momentum is going to the hoop. (Rohkohl) was fighting hard in the paint, and so for her to unselfishly spray out to shooters on the outside is never going to go unnoticed.”\n\nBYU’s leading scorer was freshman guard Olivia Hamlin, who put up the best performance of her young career — especially considering the competition — by posting 20 points of 9 of 15 shooting with four rebounds and two steals.\n\nEleven of Hamlin’s 20 points came in the first quarter to set the tone for the remainder of the contest, and she ended the night with six fourth quarter points to help bury Texas Tech for good.\n\n🤯🤯🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/XSatpyvczA\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“She was on it from the jump,” Cummard said of Hamlin. “... Tonight it was hard to keep her off the court. She was hugely impactful on the defensive end with those steals early, but even late, just with constant pressure.\n\n“People have a really hard time going around her, and people have a really hard time keeping her in front. (She is a) huge, huge asset to the group every game, but tonight she just brought it, you know, played with force and made plays for the group.”\n\nDefensively, BYU was outstanding, holding the Lady Raiders to 33.3% shooting and scoring 24 points off of 21 forced turnovers. The Cougars clamped down hardest in the fourth quarter, allowing just three makes on 16 field goal attempts.\n\nROBBED 'EM🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Jl3Aw4Ioyr\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“It was the most connected we’ve been all year defensively,” Cummard said. “We’ve been a pretty good defensive team, you know, visually, but also metrically speaking.\n\n“... I just thought that we minimized some of the lapses that we’ve had in some of our losses. ... It shows growth in what we’re doing, but just overall, the connectivity on that (defensive) end was really, really good as a group.”\n\nWith the win, BYU is now 15-4 on the campaign and has already matched last year’s mark of four victories in Big 12 play — a number Cummard’s Cougars will certainly increase given their 11 remaining conference contests, along with the newfound confidence from toppling a team such as Texas Tech.\n\n“I feel like we’ve had a pretty tough schedule thus far, and so it’s kind of like a breath of air (to win),” Gibb said. “I feel like this game is going to bring so much confidence to our team. We have a ton of young players, some of which this is their first year of college basketball, and so I think this kind of just reminds us that we can compete at the highest level. I think going into our next conference games, we’re going to be hungry to do the same thing every single night.”\n\nWIN CAM👐 pic.twitter.com/0H7qG1QNUo\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026",

    "fullText": "Snap’s chief executive had been due to testify in civil action also involving Meta, TikTok and YouTube\n\nSnapchat’s parent company has settled a civil lawsuit shortly before it was due to start in California, but other large tech companies still face a trial under the case.\n\nSnap’s chief executive, Evan Spiegel, had been due to testify in a tech addiction lawsuit which also involves the Instagram owner, Meta; ByteDance’s TikTok; and Alphabet-owned YouTube – which have not settled.\n\nSnap told the BBC the parties were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”.\n\nThe Snapchat parent was among those being sued by a plaintiff named K.G.M, a 19-year-old woman who alleges that she developed mental health problems after becoming addicted to social media apps.\n\nThe California case is the first of three “bellwether” trials consolidating thousands of lawsuits. Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.\n\nHistorically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.\n\nSnap remains a defendant in the other two cases.\n\nBeasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.\n\n“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in a statement last year.\n\nSnap, Meta, TikTok and YouTube have been contacted for comment.",

    "description": "Billionaire tech CEOs promise shorter weeks thanks to AI—but IWG’s Mark Dixon says automation won’t free time, it’ll just create more work.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nvidia’s boss Jensen Huang and Elon Musk have all made the same prediction in recent years: The workweek is about to shrink. Automation will take over routine tasks, they argue, freeing workers’ time and pushing a four-day week toward becoming standard. Gates has even floated the idea of a two-day workweek.\n\nBut Mark Dixon, CEO and founder of International Workplace Group (IWG) CEO isn’t buying it. From his vantage point, running the world’s largest flexible office provider—with more than 8 million users across 122 countries and 85% of the Fortune 500 among its customers—the math doesn’t add up.\n\n“Everyone is focused on productivity, so no time soon,” Dixon says flatly.\n\n“It’s about the cost of labor,” Dixon explains to Fortune. The U.S. and U.K. are experiencing significant cost-of-living crises. At the same time, he says, businesses are experiencing a “cost of operating crisis.”\n\n“Everyone’s having to control their labor costs because all costs have gone up so much, and you can’t get any more money from customers, so therefore you have to get more out of people.”\n\nEssentially, companies can’t afford to pay the same wages for fewer hours, and they can’t pass the difference on to customers. So any time ‘freed’ by automation is far more likely to be filled with new tasks than handed back to workers.\n\nSilicon Valley’s loudest voices frame AI as a route to more leisure. The world’s richest person and the boss of Space X, Tesla and X, Elon Musk has gone as far as predicting work will be completely “optional” and more like a hobby, in as little as 10 years.\n\nIn reality, Dixon suggests that this scenario would only happen if there’s not enough work to go around, rather than bosses suddenly becoming benevolent. But in his eyes, AI will most likely create more—not less—work.\n\nEvery major technological shift, he argues, has followed a similar arc: fear of displacement, followed by an expansion of opportunity.\n\n“AI will speed up companies development, so there’ll be more work, it’ll just be different work,” he says.\n\nIn 19th-century Britain, Dixon recalls English textile workers protesting against new automated machinery, fearing it threatened their livelihoods, lowered wages, and de-skilled their craft during the Industrial Revolution. They were called Luddites.\n\n“They went around the country smashing up the looms to stop progress. But look, in the end, you’ve heard of the Industrial Revolution. That’s what came from those looms and factory production.” As mass production made goods more available, retail grew; More managers were needed to oversee the machines; The middle-class grew, and so on.",

    "description": "Ishinomaki City has ordered drones carrying bear spray that can be operated remotely to deter bears.",
    "fullText": "A city in Japan has come up with a high-tech solution to its intense bear problem.\n\nIshinomaki City in Japan's eastern Miyagi Prefecture has ordered drones that will spray bear repellent at attacking bears.\n\nDrone manufacturer Terra Drone said in a press release on Monday that it will supply the city with what it calls \"bear repellent spray-equipped drones,\" which it said could remotely and safely repel bears without human intervention.\n\nA video of the drone's demonstration showed a drone spraying repellent on a human dressed in a bear suit, crouching on all fours to mimic a bear's stance.\n\nTerra Drone told Business Insider in an email that it would introduce one drone first and begin full-scale operations from next spring. The company expects the total project cost to be \"a few million yen.\"\n\nThe drones will be operated by a private company picked by the city's government to prevent bear damage, Terra Drone said.\n\nBear sightings and attacks have become a big problem for Japan. The word \"bear\" was one of Japan's words of the year in 2025.\n\nThe release, citing figures from Japan's environment ministry, said bear sightings increased 163% between 2021 and 2025, and there had been 100 bear attack-linked injuries and 12 deaths in Japan since April.\n\nJapan deployed troops from the Self-Defense Forces — the country's key military branch — in December to its northern regions, where several bear sightings had been reported. The troops set box traps to capture the bears.\n\nThe drones can be controlled from about half a mile away, and can spray the bears with \"pinpoint accuracy,\" the release said. Bear sprays contain capsaicin, a chemical found in chili peppers, which irritates the bear's eyes and nose, giving the human time to escape.\n\nIt added, \"This provides a highly effective method of scaring away bears, whose sense of smell is thousands of times stronger than that of humans, and allows them time to temporarily evacuate.\"\n\nThe bear-spray drones are not the only drone-based solution Japan has deployed thus far.\n\nIn November, Gifu Prefecture deployed barking drones that mimic the sounds of hunting dogs, along with firecrackers, to scare off incoming bears. The drones featured large googly eyes and loudspeakers.",

    "fullText": "PC; Inkle\nThe UK game developer’s latest is a database mystery constructed from an archive of fictional books. Their combined contents threaten to crack the code of reality\n\nBletchley Park: famed home of the Enigma machine, Colossus computer, and, according to the premise of TR-49, an altogether stranger piece of tech. Two engineers created a machine that feeds on the most esoteric books: treatises on quantum computing, meditations on dark matter, pulp sci-fi novels and more. In the mid-2010s, when the game is set, Britain finds itself again engulfed by war, this time with itself. The arcane tool may hold the key to victory.\n\nYou play as budding codebreaker Abbi, a straight-talking northerner who is sifting through the machine now moved to a crypt beneath Manchester Cathedral. She has no idea how it works and neither do you. So you start tinkering. You input a four-digit code – two letters followed by two numbers. What do these correspond to? The initials of people and the year of a particular book’s publication. Input a code correctly and you are whisked away to the corresponding page, as if using a particularly speedy microfiche reader. These pages – say, by famed fictional physicist, Joshua Silverton – are filled with clues and, should you get lucky, further codes and even the titles of particular works. Your primary goal is to match codes with the corresponding book title in a bid to find the most crucial text of all, Endpeace, the key to understanding the erudite ghosts of this machine.\n\nHidden within this rhizomatic network of information is a mystery so intriguing and elegant that it can unfold naturally from any individual player’s investigations – no matter which titles or authors you see first, or where your particular curiosities lead you thereafter. Connections can cascade, tumbling like a waterfall, before swerving in unexpected directions, defying the traditionally linear logic of mystery fiction. TR-49 gives you an in-game notepad to keep track of everything; I recommend also keeping an actual pen and paper beside you.\n\nYou might imagine TR-49 as a comment on the rise of AI large language models (LLMs) which “scrape” data as this game’s machine feeds on writing. Actually, its concerns are broader and more ambitious, recalling the heady recent books of Chilean author Benjamín Labatut (When We Cease to Understand the World and The Maniac). Like Labatut, TR-49 brims with awe, scepticism and horror at the reality-shredding possibilities of scientific and technological advances made in the 20th century, all while pushing these concepts into a playful, fantastical space.\n\nLess compelling are conversations that play out between Abbi and her companions on the other end of a radio transmission. Where the mystery told through the machine itself is lavishly detailed, what happens outside it feels too thin: Abbi’s reasons for being there; the nature of the conflict raging above, which is sketched in frustratingly vague terms.\n\nStill, the interactive heart of TR-49 resides in trawling this codebreaking device for secrets. And in this regard, the game is an unqualified success; TR-49’s database mystery rivals Sam Barlow’s games Her Story and Immortality, though it is of an unashamedly literary nature compared to those more filmic works.\n\nCloser to TR-49’s beginning, you may feel crushed by this mass of inscrutable writings. Quickly, you will swim elegantly amid it, conversant in its many, many peculiarities. Across a handful of evenings, I relished disappearing into this archive, cavorting from log to log, title to title, following threads and losing track of time. Each scrap of paper, water-damaged periodical and rare first edition threatened to solve this mystery, yet none could in isolation. Just as the fictional maker of the archive fell under the spell of these records and materials, I too was seduced.",

    "description": "Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang attended or donated to President DonaldTrump's inauguration. All of them got richer last year.",
    "fullText": "It's been one year since President Donald Trump was sworn back into office — and four of the wealthiest tech billionaires who attended or donated to his inauguration have gotten richer.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Jensen Huang — all of whom are featured on Bloomberg's list of 500 wealthiest people in the world — were among the tech royalty who signaled support for the administration, either through attendance or a donation. Others included Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and Shou Zi Chew.\n\nThe tech billionaire with the largest increase in his net worth during Trump's first year is also the one who was closest to the Trump administration: Elon Musk. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the Tesla CEO's wealth increased by 52% over the past year.\n\nWhile Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Huang are all wealthier today than they were on Inauguration Day in 2025, there have been some ups and downs. Collectively, the group lost $194 billion in wealth during Trump's first 100 days as markets reacted to the administration's tariffs. They've since made up for those losses and then some. As of January 19, the group was cumulatively $288 billion wealthier than a year prior.\n\nHere's where all four stood as of Monday, January 19, 2026.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $449 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $681 billion\n\nAfter spending at least $277 million backing Trump and Republicans during the 2024 election, Musk attended the inauguration and worked closely with the White House as the public face of the White House DOGE Office. Following his departure in May, Musk and Trump had a very public falling out, though they later reconciled.\n\nMusk's work with DOGE resulted in backlash against Tesla, with the company's share price declining in the first few months of Trump's presidency. It has since recovered, and in the year since Trump was elected Musk has solidified his standing as the world's richest man. In November, Tesla shareholders approved a $1 trillion-dollar pay package for the Tesla CEO, if he hits a series of goals, and there are plans for a SpaceX IPO in 2026.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $245 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $261 billion\n\nBezos's wealth, most of which is tied to Amazon stock, has increased since Trump took office a second time. Bezos, the Amazon founder and chairman, attended the inauguration alongside his now-wife Lauren Sánchez. Amazon also donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee.\n\nAnalysts have said that Amazon was especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, and CEO Andy Jassy said this week prices on the platform are increasing as a result of tariffs. Amazon's share price is roughly the same as it was a year ago.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $217 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $220 billion\n\nZuckerberg and Trump once had a contentious relationship that went back several years prior to the 2024 election, with the latter at one time threatening to have the Meta CEO jailed over Facebook banning Trump's account in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nZuckerberg publicly warmed to Trump during the 2024 cycle, offering him praise and attending the inauguration. Zuckerberg was seated next to Trump at a White House dinner attended by tech leaders last year. Meta also donated $1 million to the inaugural committee.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $117 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $154 billion\n\nHuang did not attend the inauguration, but Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural committee. The Nvidia CEO also met with Trump shortly after he took office and the company has worked with the White House on AI policy.",

Business Insider reached out to the contact provided on the website and did not immediately get a response.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has been aggressively executing on immigration enforcement; some of the tactics have led to highly publicized clashes between local community members and ICE agents.\n\nMinneapolis — the city where George Floyd was killed by a police officer — recently became a focal point of an immigration crackdown, and where an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Good, a US citizen.\n\nThe Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, an AFL-CIO affiliate, endorsed a move on Saturday encouraging local residents to skip work on January 23.\n\nThe White House has also targeted the tech industry by attaching a higher fee to the H-1B visa — a program tech companies and other industries have relied on to hire overseas talent.\n\nThe move has seen ripple effects from Big Tech, down to higher education.\n\nData from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center showed a 5.9% decline in enrollment at US universities by graduate international students for the Fall 2025 semester.",

    "fullText": "Feel like X's algorithm needs work? Elon Musk agrees.\n\nMusk isn't a fan of X's algorithm, and he's documenting the company's efforts to improve the technology that decides what you see in the platform's \"For You\" feed.\n\nMusk said he is overhauling the recommendation system that decides which user-generated posts and advertisements are shown when you open the app. He also pledged to make that system transparent in the process, with the underlying code getting published on GitHub every four weeks. Musk said any changes to the code will be explained with every post.\n\n\"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote on X. \"No other social media companies do this.\"\n\nX's engineering team has also said the new recommendation system is built on the same architecture as Grok, the chatbot developed by Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nWhile X has not said the two systems share training data or model weights, the comparison signals a shift toward more AI-driven content ranking, moving beyond the rules-based and engagement-heavy systems the app has historically relied on.\n\nKey questions remain about how the system operates in practice. X did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for more specifics on the algorithm.\n\nThe social media app, formerly known as Twitter, hasn't always relied on algorithms to serve its users.\n\nFrom its launch in 2006 through 2015, it presented posts in reverse chronological order, showing users the most recent tweets from accounts they followed.\n\nBut, in 2016, after several updates, a \"Show me the best tweets first\" option became the default for all users.\n\nOver time, the system grew more complex, incorporating engagement signals such as likes, replies, shares, and blocks to predict what content users were most likely to interact with or remove.\n\nMusk has long voiced frustrations with that algorithm.\n\nBefore acquiring Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he repeatedly described the platform's algorithm as a \"black box,\" arguing that it introduced political bias and failed to reflect users' true preferences — particularly for politically conservative users.\n\nHis complaints continued after the purchase. In a 2024 post, he said the rules-based algorithms had become too divisive.\n\n\"One of the strongest signals is if you forward X posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot, because it takes effort to forward,\" Musk wrote. \"Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realize that.\"\n\nHe recommended that users send videos of puppies to friends to combat the issue.",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk are at it again, with each of the tech titans taking aim at the other in a series of heated posts on X.\n\nMusk appeared to start the latest escalation early on Tuesday morning, when he posted \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT\" in response to a post that said that use of OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to the deaths of nine children and adults since it was released in 2022.\n\nAltman fired back, first in defense of ChatGPT and OpenAI's desire to protect its users, and then blasting Tesla's Autopilot technology, calling it unsafe.\n\n\"It is genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman continued, calling out Autopilot.\n\n\"I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released,\" he wrote. \"I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions.\"\n\nAltman added: \"You take 'every accusation is a confession' so far.\"\n\nThere have been at least eight wrongful-death lawsuits filed against OpenAI that allege use of ChatGPT has contributed to worsening mental health conditions, leading to instances of suicide and murder, including among children and young adults.\n\nSafety concerns around Tesla's self-driving technology have also been central to multiple wrongful-death lawsuits, including one surrounding a 2019 crash in Florida that left a 22-year-old woman dead. A jury determined Tesla was 33% liable for the crash and awarded the plaintiffs $329 million in total damages, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe social media feud comes as the pair is stuck in the middle of a long-running legal battle over OpenAI's status as a nonprofit company. Musk sued Altman, and other leaders of OpenAI, alleging that they misled him when they decided to pursue a for-profit structure, moving the company away from its original nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit.",

    "fullText": "Tesla boss clashed with Michael O’Leary when airline boss rejected installing Starlink technology on aircraft\n\nElon Musk has floated the idea of buying the budget airline Ryanair, escalating his public spat with the Irish carrier’s boss, Michael O’Leary.\n\nThe two outspoken businessmen have locked horns since last week, when O’Leary was asked whether he would follow Lufthansa and British Airways in installing Musk’s Starlink satellite internet technology on his fleet of 650 aircraft.\n\nThe Ryanair chief executive rejected the idea, saying that adding antennas to the jets would result in “2% fuel drag”, adding an extra $200m-$250m to its $5bn (£3.71bn) annual kerosene bill.\n\nMusk said that interpretation was “misinformed” in a post on his X platform, prompting a tit-for-tat exchange of insults, with each calling the other an “idiot” and then the Tesla and SpaceX CEO saying O’Leary should be fired.\n\nOn Friday, the world’s richest person asked his followers on X whether he should buy Europe’s biggest airline, which is valued at €30bn (£26bn), posting: “Should I buy Ryan Air and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?”\n\nHe followed it up with a poll asking whether he should “Buy Ryan Air and restore Ryan as their rightful ruler”. More than three-quarters of the nearly 900,000 respondents said yes, three hours before the poll closed. Tony Ryan, the Irish billionaire businessman who co-founded the budget airline in 1984, died in 2007.\n\nRyanair’s X account also mocked Musk, posting in response to an X outage across the US last week: “Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?”\n\nMusk wrote in a reply to a post from the airline teasing him: “How much would it cost to buy you?”\n\nAll this may look like idle talk, but the billionaire has followed through on such threats before. In a social media exchange in 2017 he tweeted that he loved Twitter and when a journalist suggested he should buy it, Musk replied: “How much is it?” He bought the platform almost five years later in a $44bn deal, later renaming it X.\n\nHowever, movements in the airline’s share price on Tuesday suggested investors were not taking the idea of a takeover seriously, with Ryanair shares closing nearly 1% down.\n\nMusk was born in South Africa and, after a stint in Canada, now lives in the US. Airlines based in the EU must be majority-owned by EU nationals or citizens of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein under the bloc’s rules.\n\nThe row began when O’Leary spoke on Irish radio on Friday, telling an interviewer that he would take no notice of what the Tesla CEO had to say about installing wifi on Ryanair planes.\n\n“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,” he told Newstalk. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot … What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”\n\nHe claimed that adding a Starlink antenna to every jet would push the fuel bill up by “an extra dollar for every passenger we fly and the reality for us is we can’t afford those costs. Passengers won’t pay for internet usage; if it’s free, they’ll use it – but they won’t pay one euro each to use the internet.”\n\nO’Leary, 64, also said he was “thankfully” too old to have any social media accounts.\n\nRyanair was contacted for comment.",

    "fullText": "Inside the big rewards tech titans have reaped from caving to Trump. Plus, a look at the US datacenter boom and the effects of Australia’s social media ban\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, the Guardian’s US tech editor.\n\nOne year ago today, Donald Trump was inaugurated as president of the United States. Standing alongside him that day were the leaders of the tech industry’s most powerful companies, who had donated to him in an unprecedented bending of the knee. In the ensuing year, the companies have reaped enormous rewards from their alliance with Trump, which my colleague Nick Robins-Early and I wrote about last month after Trump signed an executive order prohibiting states from passing laws regulating AI. Trump has sponsored the tech industry with billions in government funding and with diplomatic visits that featured CEOs as his fellow negotiators in massive, lucrative deals.\n\nAs year two of Trump’s second term begins, Silicon Valley’s titans appear poised to enrich themselves even more with the president’s enthusiastic aid.\n\nToday in tech, we’re exploring the political consequences of the expansion of datacenters in the US and Europe as well as taking stock of Australia’s under-16 social media ban.\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his goal of total deregulation of AI and his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nTrump’s anxiety is evident in two actions last week. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n““We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nAnd then on Friday, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as my colleagues Oliver Milman and Dharna Noor reported over the weekend, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue which has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On Thursday, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like the rest of us (Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon). Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters, but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those of the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost of living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stop in the datacenter boom: the Middle East, where energy is cheap but water is not abundant, and India, where the power grid is not as reliable …\n\nLawmakers in the UK and around the world are calling for bans on social media accounts for teenagers and children in the wake of Australia’s successful social media ban for under-16s. My colleague Josh Taylor offers a look at how the ban is playing out in its native country. Despite social media companies reporting millions of accounts deleted in compliance with the ban, the opposition party is questioning its effectiveness:\n\nMore than 4.7m social media accounts held by Australians who platforms have judged to be under 16 years of age were deactivated, removed or restricted in the first days after the ban came into effect on 10 December, the prime minister has said.\n\nDespite the high numbers, the federal opposition, which campaigned for the policy before it was adopted by the government, last week said the ban implementation had “fallen flat”.\n\n“New accounts are being created and the age-verification tools that the government assured Australians would be effective, have proven laughably easy to bypass with some makeup and good lighting,” said the shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh.\n\nHe called himself an ‘untouchable hacker god’. But who was behind the biggest crime Finland has ever known?\n\nChatGPT to start showing ads in the US\n\nMy picture was used in child abuse images.

CEO Tony Xu said on an earnings call in November that DoorDash would invest hundreds of millions of dollars this year in key initiatives, including a global tech platform for all its brands and autonomous tech.\n\nDoorDash employees don't just work on big problems, though. The company requires its corporate workforce to periodically make deliveries themselves through a program called WeDash.\n\nSome of the people making all of that happen at DoorDash corporate have joined the company from outside the US, and the company has sponsored H-1B visas.\n\nEmployers include salary information when submitting applications to the US Department of Labor for H-1B work visas. The publicly available data includes ranges for base pay, but excludes equity or other benefits that companies often offer employees. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers in similar roles.\n\nIn the year ending September 30, 2025, DoorDash submitted roughly 540 H-1B visa applications, which can offer insight into what the delivery company pays for certain jobs.\n\nThe H-1B visa application process is changing under President Donald Trump.\n\nIn September, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications. He's also proposed changes to work visa rules that could tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nHere's a look at some of the jobs for which DoorDash has disclosed salaries in the work visa data.

But this is a competitive business for them,\" Ahn said. \"People who own Fords own Fords for certain reasons that are probably different reasons than why people who own Mercedes own Mercedes. And I think each of these automakers are going to have to define what does ADAS mean for the user base of my brand today.\"\n\nSteve Man, a senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider that the technology stack of autonomous vehicles could be thought of as three interconnected parts: the software, the sensors, and the actuators — the components that control the physical movement of the car.\n\nAll three components need to be able to \"talk\" to each other within a vehicle platform, Man said, which can be challenging and costly to do when an automaker relies on multiple suppliers.\n\n\"It's actually cheaper to bring everything in-house to integrate those three buckets of things,\" Man said.\n\nAs automakers seek more control over their technology, the tools to build autonomy are becoming more accessible. That makes a Tesla FSD license a less compelling business case.\n\nAt CES, Nvidia introduced Alpamayo, a package of AI reasoning models, simulation tools, and datasets automakers can use to develop self-driving technology.\n\nMercedes-Benz was revealed to be Nvidia's first major customer; the automaker plans to launch a Tesla FSD-level ADAS built on Alpamayo by the end of the year.\n\nAlpamayo isn't a full-stack autonomous driving software that automakers simply plug in. An Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider it's a toolset that can \"strengthen and speed up an OEM's own ADAS or autonomy program, whether they're building end-to-end systems or upgrading existing architectures.\"\n\nAutomakers still need proprietary data and talent to implement and develop their autonomous systems.\n\nHugh Nguyen, a KPMG partner who specializes in autonomous driving systems, told Business Insider that Alpamayo \"democratizes\" AV development by reducing the cost and time for training self-driving systems.\n\nDuring a Q&A session at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Tesla FSD \"completely world-class,\" before drawing a distinction between Tesla's goals and Nvidia's.\n\n\"We're not a self-driving car company,\" he said. \"We just want to enable the world's autonomous industry. Everything that moves should be autonomous.\"",

    "title": "Open source's new mission: Rebuild the EU tech stack",
    "description": "Opinion: Freedom can be very contagious if it grows on its own terms. Europe of all places should know that",
    "fullText": "Opinion Europe is famous for having the most tightly regulated non-existent tech sector in the world. This is a mildly unfair characterization, as there are plenty of tech enterprises across the continent, quite a respectable smattering if it wasn't for the US doing everything at least ten times bigger.\n\nQuite the problem, sighed the EU’s 2024 Draghi Report on European competitiveness. Those regulations regressively hit startups and SMEs the hardest, there's no central capital market for funding innovation, while Uncle Sam's wallet opens wide for the ambitious and talented. It looked bad in 2024, when tech deficit was primarily an economic matter. Mix in the changes since then, and you can apply the five word version of all Russian history — \"And then it got worse.\"\n\nWhich is why the EU is now eagerly looking to open source as part of digital decolonization. It wants to end dependency on American software and services, not just for a healthier and more influential home sector, but to protect itself from hostile leverage.\n\nThe EU being the way it is, it wants to think big, and there's no doubt that FOSS has an infinite appetite for resources and relevance. FOSS is also mostly immune to EU regulations, which exist to protect citizens from systematic abuse. That possibility barely exists in open source development. You don't have to tell a bird not to rob banks.\n\nIt's just that you couldn't find a bigger culture clash between top-down and bottom-up if you invested a billion euros on a 27-nation research project. Finding the sweet spot where EU involvement can make the biggest difference to FOSS enterprise adoption, while maintaining the essential spark of agility and freedom that brings FOSS alive, that's where technical, economic and cultural engineering needs to happen. Fast.\n\nOpen source by itself is no guarantee of independence. Linux is the giant hogweed of European open source, even if it started four years before its home nation of Finland joined the EU. It has kept the internet and supercomputing free of commercial or state monopoly. The best it could do in mobile, though, is maintenance of an American OS duopoly. In the enterprise and public sector, it has done nothing to crimp Microsoft's tendrils. Which is where the EU most desperately needs it to succeed.\n\nAnd this is not for want of technical prowess, nor interoperability. In fact, there is far too much. Linux desktops have been enterprise-class for more than a decade, and of late the options for integration with Windows apps and functionality have flowered like fridge contents in a midsummer power cut. As Windows has got worse, the interoperable Linux choices have become better.\n\nThere are many options. Wine just gets better and better, no matter what distro you use. Windows-focused distros like Zorin OS come with lots of ways to look and function like Windows, including web app integration so online Word and Outlook integrate with the desktop. Products like Winboat offer highly optimized containerization to bring Windows apps to near-native Linux behavior. High performance specialized emulations like Winlator can run native x86 games — the good ones — on Android.\n\nWhat all these show is that small teams, even one-man bands, can use the very high quality software components freely available to almost completely remove old ideas of performance and functionality as batteries to platform-independent computing. The skills, the tools, the hardware and the whole production chain have been democratized. Given motivation and modest resources, FOSS designers can work miracles — and will. The downside is that there are too many good choices, making selection and support untenable in most organizations. Windows is Windows is Windows. Or it would be, if Microsoft stopped mucking about.\n\nWhat FOSS per se is bad at, is synchronizing with specific needs. It can do it with the right people, see Red Hat, but those people can also take it into darkness. Stare too long into the abyss, and the enterprise stares back at you. Focus, alignment, the disciplines of documentation, support and detail, get harder the more complex a system becomes.\n\nThis is where the EU could start to make an immediate difference to open source. It can say that it wants an open source desktop system that has explicit Windows migration support through a mix of technologies that will remain stable and supportable, and that reflects the particular needs of the EU's public and private sectors. This will be a state requirement that absolutely does not need state resources to meet.\n\nThen comes the support structure. Whatever team builds the distro will be the top tier of support, with everything else handled elsewhere. The EU's job will be to co-ordinate support for states, doing so in as transparent a way as possible so that the private sector can create and integrate support for itself. It's no different in the broadest terms to how support should work with departmental, company, and contracted support tiers, but with many more options, no secrets, and resources flowing into FOSS development as requirements evolve.\n\nThis whole process can be argued as necessary for EU state security and sovereignty, arguments we already hear loudly from Europe's erstwhile allies as reasons for far more than a new desktop OS. The initial migration will be as incremental and non-disruptive as possible, the aim being to demonstrate and sustain a new model of infrastructure evolution, one that can go on to power a roadmap of accelerating replacement and renewal.\n\nIt is very difficult to force the evolution of FOSS if the environment is wrong. It is very difficult to stop it, or even slow it down, when the environment is right. The EU knows what it wants and why it wants it. It also knows it can't force it. What it can do is create the right conditions and step back. Open source asks for no more than that. ®",

    "description": "Tech News News: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims .",
    "fullText": "MacKenzie Scott's ex-wife, Jeff Bezos, has donated millions to the Solidaire Network, which funds groups facing FBI and congressional investigations for alleged Hamas ties. While Scott's donations are unrestricted, the network supports organizations like Students for Justice in Palestine. Scott has given billions to various causes, impacting diversity programs and higher education. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims that the billionaire philanthropist donated millions of dollars to a funding network that supports organisations now facing FBI and congressional investigations over alleged ties to Hamas. In 2025, Scott reportedly donated $5 million, and in 2021, $10 million, to the Solidaire Network through her charity, Yield Giving. The network describes itself as connecting social movements with donors to build systems based on love and justice.However, Solidaire Network has funded groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), according to tax records and press releases reviewed by Fortune. Both organisations are under investigation by the House and Senate for allegedly working with the terror group Hamas to organise anti-Israel protests in the United States.The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent a letter to AMP's executive director in May 2024 expressing concern that groups spreading pro-Hamas messages and breaking laws on college campuses may be receiving money from sources supporting Hamas or other terrorist organisations.US Senator Tom Cotton also asked the FBI in September 2025 to investigate the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), calling it hateful toward Jewish people after its leader, Aisha Nizar, urged supporters to disrupt the US F-35 fighter jet supply chain, the report noted.In a statement (shared by Fortune), Cotton said, “Nizar’s statements constitute direct incitement of violence against U.S. national security interests by advocating for actions against the men and women who build the F-35 and seeking to imperil the delivery of one of the nation’s most strategic assets.”Scott donated more than $7 billion in 2025 alone, bringing her total giving since 2020 to $26 billion across over 2,700 donations. With a net worth of about $40 billion, mostly from her divorce settlement, she ranks among the world's biggest donors alongside Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett. Most of her 2025 donations supported diversity programmes, disaster relief, and colleges.What the Solidaire Network said about MacKenzie Scott’s donationsIt's important to note that the Solidaire Network also funds other progressive groups working on racial and gender equality, climate change, and economic fairness. Scott was also just one of more than 280 people who donated to Solidaire Network in 2021.\"Funding social movements while transforming our own relationship to wealth is clearly the way to go for philanthropy. MacKenzie's generous, no-strings-attached gift honours our bold ambitions for our collective work,” the Solidaire Network noted.Around that time, Solidaire Network had just given out multimillion-dollar grants through its Black Liberation Pooled Fund, Movement Protection Fund, and Movement Infrastructure Fund.As Scott's donations have no restrictions, which means the receiving organisation can spend the money however it chooses, there's no proof that her 2021 or 2025 gifts went directly to SJP or AMP.On January 30, 2024, Solidaire Network also announced it started a Unity & Power Fund to support the “movement for a permanent ceasefire and against Islamophobia and antisemitism.” SJP and AMP mainly focus on \"Palestinian freedom\" and firm opposition to Israel.“We need more philanthropic partners to show up during these flashpoints, and we also need their longer-term support to grow and sustain our work beyond this crisis moment. We are only able to do this work because of the multi-year funding we have received through committed partners like Solidaire Network,” Stacey Krueger of Palestine Legal said in a statement.While some people have criticised Scott's donation to Solidaire Network, she's widely recognised as one of the most impactful charitable donors in recent years. She's made a real difference for diversity-focused organisations and groups working on higher education, veterans' issues, social justice, disaster relief, and climate change. For example, Scott gave $80 million to Howard University last fall, and the school said the gift came at an “opportune time” as the US government shutdown delayed annual federal money the university receives to support students, academic programs, research, and hospital operations.Scott has also said her giving was inspired by her college roommate, who lent her $1,000 so she wouldn't have to quit school, and her dentist, who gave her free dental work after seeing her use denture glue to fix a broken tooth in college.In a blog post from December 2025, Scott wrote, “Generosity and kindness engage the same pleasure centres in the brain as sex, food, and receiving gifts, and they improve our health and long-term happiness as well. The peace-fostering byproducts of one unexpected act of kindness toward a stranger of a different background or beliefs might inspire a beneficial chain reaction that goes on for years.”Sotheby's International Realty said Scott has donated an estimated $14 billion to causes, including racial equality, LGBTQ+ equality, strengthening functional democracy, and climate action. She now ranks sixth on the list of the world's top 10 philanthropists, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The Sotheby's list adds that Scott's gifts support nonprofit groups working against racial injustice, advancing gender equality, and backing public health programs.",

    "description": "Vay is rental car service startup that is fully embracing remote-driving technology in order to deliver cars to users without a human inside.",
    "fullText": "In the world of robotaxis, there's a stigma around remote driving. Are you really \"driverless\" if there's a person — even remotely — at the wheel?\n\nOne startup is fully embracing it.\n\nVay is a Berlin-based startup founded by two engineers and a former Zoox employee.\n\nThe company is taking a somewhat contrarian approach to what it calls a \"driverless car.\"\n\nInstead of automating the ride-hailing service, which can be technically challenging and costly to scale, Vay wants to rethink how we rent cars.\n\nTo do so, Vay wants to leverage remote-driving technology and, eventually, autonomy to deliver cars without humans inside to people who need a private vehicle for less than a day.\n\nThomas von der Ohe, cofounder and CEO of Vay, told Business Insider that the goal is to be cheaper than an Uber and more convenient than a traditional brick-and-mortar rental program.\n\n\"It's basically by far the most affordable A to B transport,\" von der Ohe, a former technical program manager during the early days of Zoox, said. \"It's half the price of Uber and half the price of robotaxis. How it works: We just bring the car, you then drive, and then when you're done, you don't have to park.\"\n\nVon der Ohe spent less than two years at Zoox when the company was just 60 people large and had yet to be acquired by Amazon. The Vay cofounder said he oversaw some of the first public testing of Zoox cars when there were safety drivers inside the vehicle.\n\nAt the robotaxi company, von der Ohe said he saw a goal with an ever-shifting timeline.\n\n\"It always felt like it was three years out,\" he said of autonomous driving. \"And then every year it shifted by a year. So we wanted to have self-driving cars everywhere in 2020 at Zoox. And then it was 2021 and so forth.\"\n\nVon der Ohe left Zoox in 2018. Instead of fixating on robotaxis, von der Ohe wanted to stay in mobility but work on something that could be faster to bring to market and easier to scale with less capital. Vay was born.\n\nCustomers order a car the same way they hail an Uber or Lyft through Vay's app. To rent a car, users have to upload a driver's license and a photo of themselves.\n\nVay proposes that users can get a car delivered to them without a driver within minutes, as long as they're within the service area or geofence. If you're out of the service area, then you're out of luck.\n\nOnce the car is delivered, the renter takes over.\n\nThe startup services Las Vegas, where it manages a fleet of 100 Kia Niros, a compact, all-electric SUV. Each Kia is retrofitted with four cameras. There are no other sensors, von der Ohe said.\n\nThe Vay cofounder told Business Insider that the service area is about twice the size of San Francisco.\n\nInside Vay's Vegas office, there are about eight driving stations, in which a trained human operator remotely controls Vay's vehicle fleet. The setup looks like a video game simulation with three computer screens and a disembodied driver's seat.\n\nA large red button to the left of the driver's seat activates an emergency protocol during which the car pulls over to the side of the road.\n\nVincent Reddy, an operations lead for Vay, said that there are several criteria a remote driver needs to meet, including completing about 1,000 kilometers of remote driving. Reddy remotely drove Business Insider during a demo ride.\n\n\"It's similar to kind of like a high-grade racing sim,\" Reddy said of the driving experience. \"The thing that feels the most different is not having the feedback of what it feels like driving over bumps and things on the road because the seat doesn't move. There's no G-force, or you don't get the feeling of accelerating or braking.\"\n\nTo deliver the cars, Vay only uses the remote-driving technology on local roads and stays under 25 mph. The car can go on the highway once the customer takes over the vehicle.\n\nThere were no notable incidents during a 10-minute driverless ride around the block of Vay's Vegas office.\n\nVay's value proposition to customers is that the service is cheaper and more flexible than hailing an Uber.\n\nVon der Ohe told Business Insider that the service should be about 50% cheaper than the average Uber ride.\n\nUsers are charged by the minute, with a decreased price if they are parked, in case they, for example, need to grab groceries or hit the gym.\n\nWhen Business Insider viewed the app, the pricing was at $0.35 per minute while driving and $0.05 per minute while parked. At those prices, a 30-minute drive to and from a destination, including an hour-and-a-half stop, would cost around $25.\n\nWhen asked if the pricing will change based on demand, von der Ohe said the company doesn't yet have a pricing mechanism, such as surge pricing, in place, but expects there will be changes to the structure.\n\nThe CEO said he can keep the costs low because Vay's vehicle fleet doesn't have a complex sensor suite, and the remote operators manage multiple cars.\n\nVon der Ohe said that as of January 2026, there is one remote operator for every 10 vehicles. However, that doesn't mean a remote driver is operating 10 vehicles at the same time. Instead, a remote operator can deliver one car and immediately move on to the next vehicle.\n\n\"So I have much more cars and remote drivers, and that's why we make it half the price,\" he said.\n\nVay employs about 200 people and raised more than $200 million, including a $60 million investment from Grab Holdings, the Singaporean tech company that owns Grab, the super app of Southeast Asia.\n\nWhile von der Ohe told Business Insider that building a fully autonomous ride experience like Waymo is not on Vay's road map, the CEO said his startup will gradually add autonomous driving features.\n\n\"We're not in competition with them,\" von der Ohe said of robotaxi operators.\n\nSince its founding, Vay has provided 35,000 trips, according to the CEO.\n\nHe said the service has especially seen high demand during the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nWhen Von der Ohe opened the app, the wait time to get a car was 31 minutes.\n\n\"It's extremely busy today already,\" he said. \"It's a long way. It should be five.\"",

    "fullText": "I am a science-fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to.\n\nWhat I do not do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean we couldn’t change it.\n\nNow, not everyone understands the distinction. They think science-fiction writers are oracles. Even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that we can “see the future”.\n\nThen there are science-fiction fans who believe that they are reading the future. A depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. These guys can’t shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI.\n\nThat’s something I used to strenuously resist doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentlessly bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn’t understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, they insisted that I must be a paid shill.\n\nThis is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is just too short. That said, people would not stop asking – so I’m going to explain what I think about AI and how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: “How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm.”\n\nIn automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete.\n\nA reverse centaur is a machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.\n\nFor example, an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras that monitor the driver’s eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver’s mouth because singing is not allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they do not make quota.\n\nThe driver is in that van because the van cannot drive itself and cannot get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance.\n\nObviously, it’s nice to be a centaur, and it’s horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaurlike, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse centaurs, which none of us want to be.\n\nBut like I said, the job of a science-fiction writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it is technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it is impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you to think that it is for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite.\n\nThis is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher’s mantra was: “There is no alternative.” She repeated this so often they called her “Tina” Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative.\n\n“There is no alternative” is a cheap rhetorical slight. It’s a demand dressed up as an observation. “There is no alternative” means: “stop trying to think of an alternative.”\n\nI’m a science-fiction writer – my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast.\n\nSo let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble and who the reverse-centaur army is serving, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality.\n\nStart with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don’t compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels.\n\nGoogle and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than $20bn a year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% search market share.\n\nNow, you would think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector.\n\nBut it’s actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a “growth stock”, and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you are making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the “price to earnings ratio” or “PE ratio”.\n\nBut once a company stops growing, it is a “mature” stock, and it trades at a much lower PE ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth $10. It has a PE ratio of 10, while Amazon has a PE ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36.\n\nIt’s wonderful to run a company that has a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeros into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors.\n\nSo when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeros into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars.\n\nThat’s the upside of having a growth stock. But here is the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you going to grow?\n\nIf you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you are not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the US than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, $240bn sell-off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history.\n\nThat’s a monopolist’s worst nightmare, because once you’re presiding over a “mature” firm, the key employees you have been compensating with stock experience a precipitous pay drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars – not shares.\n\nThis is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they do not trust your pricing power.\n\nWhich is why growth-stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video or cryptocurrency or NFTs or the metaverse or AI.\n\nI am not saying that tech bosses are making bets they do not plan on winning. But winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along.\n\nSo this is why they’re hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment.\n\nNow I want to talk about how they’re selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use “disrupt” here in its most disreputable tech-bro sense.\n\nThe promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AI that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself and give the other half to the AI company.\n\nThat is the $13tn growth story that Morgan Stanley is telling. It’s why big investors are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family’s financial security.\n\nNow, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We would have to figure out what to do with all these unemployed people.\n\nBut AI can’t do your job. It can help you do your job, but that does not mean it is going to save anyone money.\n\nTake radiology: there is some evidence that AI can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss. Look, I’ve got cancer. Thankfully, it’s very treatable, but I’ve got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible.\n\nLet’s say my hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: “Hey folks, here’s the deal. Today, you’re processing about 100 X-rays per day. From now on, we’re going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you’ve missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you’re only processing 98 X-rays per day. That’s fine, we just care about finding all those tumors.”\n\nIf that’s what they said, I’d be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market’s bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: “Look, you fire nine out of 10 of your radiologists, saving $20m a year. You give us $10m a year, and you net $10m a year, and the remaining radiologists’ job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed – and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it’s catastrophically wrong.\n\n“And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist’s fault, because they are the ‘human in the loop’. It’s their signature on the diagnosis.”\n\nThis is a reverse centaur, and it is a specific kind of reverse centaur: it is what Dan Davies calls an “accountability sink”. The radiologist’s job is not really to oversee the AI’s work, it is to take the blame for the AI’s mistakes.\n\nThis is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can’t do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can’t do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble.\n\nIf you are someone who is worried about cancer, and you are being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we are going to have to rehouse America’s 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say: “Well, OK, I’m sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I’m on.”\n\nAI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs’ labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers.\n\nNow, some people will be on the workers’ side because of politics or aesthetics. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you.\n\nWill those products be substandard? There is every reason to think so.\n\nThink of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI. Using AI for simple tasks can genuinely make them more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it’s clear they are not hoping to make some centaurs.\n\nThey want to fire a lot of tech workers – 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AI’s code.\n\nAnd because AI is just a word-guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are nearly indistinguishable from working code.\n\nFor example: programmers routinely use standard “code libraries” to handle routine tasks. Say you want your program to slurp in a document and make some kind of sense of it – find all the addresses, say, or all the credit card numbers. Rather than writing a program to break down a document into its constituent parts, you’ll just grab a library that does it for you.\n\nThese libraries come in families, and they have predictable names. If it’s a library for pulling in an html file, it might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it’s a for docx file, it’ll be lib.docx.text.parsing.\n\nBut reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there will be another library, say, one for parsing pdfs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it’s called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Someone just entered an incorrect library name and it stuck. Like I said, the world is messy.\n\nNow, AI is a statistical inference engine. All it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past. That means that it will “hallucinate” a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing, because that matches the pattern it’s already seen. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into the AI’s program, and it will do things like steal user data or try to penetrate other computers on the same network.\n\nAnd you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard-to-find error, this bug that is indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they have been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire.\n\nBut guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don’t think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company’s top management. The kind of coder who would lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google $10bn in 2018.\n\nFor AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the workers who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors.\n\nIf you can replace coders with AI, who can’t you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI.\n\nWhich brings me to AI art – or “art” – which is often used as an ad for AI, even though it is not part of AI’s business model.\n\nLet me explain: on average, illustrators do not make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precarious groups of workers out there. If AI image-generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of OpenAI’s campuses.\n\nThe purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It is to create buzz. Which is not to say that it is not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that “some creative jobs shouldn’t have been there in the first place”.\n\nIt’s supposed to be disgusting. It’s supposed to get artists to run around and say: “The AI can do my job, and it’s going to steal my job, and isn’t that terrible?“\n\nBut can AI do an illustrator’s job? Or any artist’s job?\n\nLet’s think about that for a second. I have been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story. Here’s what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, a poem, a painting, a drawing, a dance, a book or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind.\n\nBut the image-generation program does not know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred-thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero.\n\nIt is possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or the Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, interesting or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human.\n\nAnd in the meantime, it’s bad art. It’s bad art in the sense of being “eerie”, the word that cultural theorist Mark Fisher used to describe “when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something”.\n\nAI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it is missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it is undetectable.\n\nWe should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism’s fatalism: “There is no alternative.”\n\nSo what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model.\n\nAnd I am here to tell you they are wrong. Wrong because this would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason. I’ll explain:\n\nAI training involves scraping a bunch of webpages, which is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for.\n\nAnd after you count all the pixels or the words, it is time for the final step: publishing them. Because that is what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array.\n\nAnd again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which factual statements you can publish.\n\nBut hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I’m full of shit. That’s fine. It wouldn’t be the first time someone thought that.\n\nAfter all, even if I’m right about how copyright works now, there’s no reason we couldn’t change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there’s even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don’t like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing – such as search engines and academic scholarship.\n\nWell, even then, you’re not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. We have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer.\n\nAnd today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also – the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than it has ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators’ bosses at the media company.\n\nIn a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming: “Think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!”\n\nCreative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what’s good for you.\n\nA new copyright to train models will not get us a world where models are not used to destroy artists, it will just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss.\n\nWhen really what they’re demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders’ pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal?\n\nWe need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment.\n\nIncredibly enough, there is a really simple way to do that. After more than 20 years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists’ rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That is why the “monkey selfie” is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium.\n\nAnd not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they have defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle.\n\nThe fact that every AI-created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them or give them away for nothing. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission.\n\nThe US Copyright Office’s position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you are a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that’s no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you are a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted.\n\nBut creative workers do not have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers’ strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in “sectoral bargaining”, whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector.\n\nThat has been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright.\n\nAI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible.\n\nBubbles transfer the life savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it.\n\nBut not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It’s still in the ground. At my home, I’ve got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber.\n\nIt would have been better if Worldcom had not ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage.\n\nI do not think we will salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. When crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey jpegs.\n\nAI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the datacenters will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind?\n\nWe will have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We will have a lot of cheap GPUs, which will be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who will be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we will have the open-source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video; describing images; summarizing documents; and automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing – such as removing backgrounds or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open-source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamed of.\n\nIf there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We would call them “plugins”.\n\nIt’s the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn’t want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, “disruptive” things: big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year.\n\nWhen the AI-investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won’t be economical to keep the datacenters running. As Stein’s law has it: “Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops.”\n\nThe collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100bn IOU.\n\nAI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more.\n\nTo pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever more outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side.\n\nBecause the AI bubble really is very bad news, it’s worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with hi-tech asbestos.\n\nCory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist.

    "description": "Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a senior software engineer, explains how AI integration and prompt engineering are changing hiring in Big Tech software roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a 29-year-old senior software engineer based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a Big Tech employee for the past eight years, working at Google, Amazon, Splunk, and now Salesforce. I've had a front-row seat to witness the changes in the tech landscape.\n\nI've learned which skill sets software engineers need to land a job offer in the AI era. Tech companies agree that AI makes engineers more productive, so engineers are expected to use it to build things more quickly and reliably.\n\nI personally make heavy use of AI to help me with boilerplate stuff so that I can concentrate on the hard stuff, like system design and complex business logic.\n\nWhen I was interviewing for software engineering jobs in 2020, LeetCode and system design were the de facto standards for cracking a job interview. Job seekers who had an advanced understanding of data structures and algorithms would come out on top.\n\nToday, this is just the baseline expectation. AI is now widely used for coding, review, and design, so tech companies, especially startups, expect more from candidates.\n\nSome skills remain the same: Software engineers still need a problem-solving mindset and should know how to scale systems and leverage cloud services. New hires must now also understand prompt engineering — how to leverage AI to code a solution more efficiently.\n\nYou need to be able to use AI for error handling and bug fixing. AI systems integration is another important new skill that involves incorporating AI into existing workflows, scaling AI systems, and determining when to use traditional versus AI solutions for business decisions.\n\nYou're still expected to have fundamental knowledge of core system design, data structures, and algorithms. You can still expect interviewers to test your problem-solving approaches, and if you know how to make the correct tradeoffs in time and space. Interviewers still care about debugging skills, since AI makes a lot of fundamental logic errors.\n\nYou also need to be prepared for some new things. I've seen firsthand that working with AI assistants in live screen-sharing mode is now allowed in some interviews. Interviewers are looking to see if you can help them achieve their business outcomes by combining software engineering skills with AI prompting.\n\nIn an interview I had with a Silicon Valley startup in 2024, I expected the hiring team to give traditional coding challenges. I was taken aback when I was given a huge code file and asked to debug a buggy behavior, and the interviewers explicitly said I could use AI assistance.\n\nI ignored the invitation to use AI, thinking I was supposed to do it myself, and ended up spending a lot of time on the problem to no avail. I failed that interview. That was an eye-opener for me about AI's new role in this field.\n\nYou may also be asked system design questions about where AI should be integrated into the current business workflow, or to discuss the trade-offs of using AI and traditional approaches in various problem contexts.\n\nDuring my own system design interviews, I noticed companies starting to ask questions about how to integrate AI to enhance existing systems and support a particular model lifecycle in terms of infrastructure. What I've seen is that companies give access to a small codebase and expect you to deliver a small feature in about one hour, which is impossible without AI. With AI, you can roll it out easily.\n\nI've also been asked behavioral questions, like \"How do you plan to evaluate the use of AI in order to make the workflow better?\" and \"How do you plan to balance automation and manual oversight?\"\n\nFor new graduates, here's how to show hiring teams that you're equipped for the emerging needs of the software engineering role.\n\nStart by contributing to open-source projects on AI or any other GitHub project. This demonstrates that you can navigate a production codebase and work on it independently to build a new feature or fix a bug. For solo repositories, include a README that explains the rationale for your decision.\n\nIncorporate the use of AI in traditional repositories to demonstrate hands-on experience with AI integration. Don't just deploy and run it locally — try to deploy it to the cloud. Many cloud providers provide free student credits.\n\nFocus on prompting AI to drive intended outcomes more effectively by providing structured input and output. Skills like AWS or GCP cloud certifications demonstrate your ability to be a keen learner.\n\nLearn different problem-solving patterns and practice these skills regularly. Muscle memory and pattern recognition go a long way.\n\nFor experienced software engineers, your biggest asset is your deep engineering experience — here are three tips that will help you in 2026 and beyond.\n\nPairing years of engineering expertise with impressive AI skills will get the attention of hiring managers. Consider boning up on these complementary skills:\n\nSenior software engineers don't just build; they also need to strategize and innovate. Try to understand the trade-offs of relying on a third-party API versus using an open-source one and fine-tuning it for your business purposes. Questions on cost, reliability, and maintainability should always be top of mind as you develop an AI product mindset.\n\nIdentify workflows that have a great deal of manual involvement in your current job, and use AI to see if you can improve them. You can leverage AI to help you brainstorm on how to make it more efficient.\n\nBoth veteran and newbie engineers should stay curious: find out the cool technologies and AI agents available in today's market, but don't abandon fundamental engineering approaches. The hybrid understanding of these technologies is what makes you valuable.\n\nIf I were interviewing, I'd position myself as a 'hybrid engineer.' Don't just be a pure coder or just a prompt engineer. Be the bridge.",

    "fullText": "China is now a key market for global carmakers, and, surprisingly, buyers there are shifting back to sedans that offer serious tech. Automakers are pushing boundaries to get noticed, and Nissan is one of them. The brand launched two new electrified sedans and a refreshed Teana late last year – the latter being the more premium take on the Altima sold in the US.\n\nThe new Teana, built by Dongfeng Nissan, puts a big emphasis on tech and interior quality. It looks a class above what you’d expect from an Altima-based sedan. Part of that comes from a glowing AI speaker on the dash, but the real surprise is the material choice. Nissan worked with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC) to use Durabio, a plant-based plastic that looks and feels closer to crystal than the usual trim.\n\nIn China, buyers care about big screens, lighting, and how upscale a car feels. The Teana’s interior is built to make a strong first impression, and it stands out even more when you see it lit up at night.\n\nDurabio is more than just a marketing fluff. MCC developed it as a bio-based plastic using plant-derived isosorbide. It’s clearer and handles light better than regular polycarbonate, which helps create lighting that looks deep and high-end instead of cheap or artificial.\n\nOn the Teana, Durabio is used for the inverted-pyramid AI speaker that lights up with six pillars glowing in up to 256 colors. The material refracts light cleanly, giving it a crystal-like look without needing a clear coat. That saves manufacturing steps, lowers environmental footprint, and still meets automotive durability standards.\n\nTeana runs a Huawei-based operating system to go with Durabio. The end result is an interior that feels modern and thoughtfully put together (at least visually), not just a quick update.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-market Altima heads into 2026 with almost no changes from last year. It remains affordable and practical, but next to the Teana, it comes across as very restrained. Nissan still sells a lot of sedans in the US, with over 255,000 units last year (out of the brand's over 760,000-unit sales), but the Altima’s own sales dropped to 93,268 in 2025, down 18 percent from the year before.\n\nThat drop probably comes from the Altima’s age. The current model dates back to 2018, with its last big update in 2022. It no longer stands out for design or interior appeal. After seeing what Nissan has done with the Teana, it’s fair to ask (hope, even) if a more upscale, more distinctive Altima could bring buyers back to the midsize sedan segment.\n\nFor now, there’s no clear answer. But with China getting the more ambitious upgrades, it’s easy to see how a bit of that Durabio-inspired thinking could only help the Altima.\n\nView the 9 images of this gallery on the original article",

Indeed's list of top jobs also highlights accessible on-ramps for career switchers, with roles such as ServiceNow developer and full-stack developer that emphasize skills and real-world experience over formal credentials.\n\nNotably, trade jobs are rising alongside tech. Electricians, HVAC technicians, and electrical foremen are increasingly in demand, a trend likely fueled by large-scale AI data center construction.\n\nAs AI reshapes white-collar work, specialized tech roles and skilled trades are emerging as durable, future-proof career paths.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "If you follow me, you might already know Tech Workers Coalition (TWC). For everybody else, TWC is an international organization that supports union and political organizing of workers within the tech sector. It's heavily decentralized and has chapters spread throughout North America and Europe. It includes every kind of profession in the field: developers, content moderators, designers, testers, sysadmins, data workers, customer service, and so on.\n\nThe organization, over the years, tried different paths to communicate to the outside what it does, why it does what it does, and what it would like to do in the future. The most recent iteration is probably this Identity Document, which gets regularly printed into flyers and handed to newcomers during onboarding sessions.\n\nThe challenge comes from different factors:\n\nI've been part of TWC for 7 years now. I helped start the Berlin chapter, then the Italian chapter, and in the last two years, the Global chapter. I've talked with hundreds of people participating in the communities, coached many chapter organizers, given workshops and onboarding sessions, and facilitated hundreds of meetings within TWC. It is now an integral part of my present and my past.\n\nIn this article, I want to give my take on why I do this, why I think it's important, and why some of you might want to join us. Because, ultimately, it is not so obvious and linear why somebody should be contributing their time to TWC rather than, for example, a union.\n\nLet me preface by saying that I strongly believe that any healthy political ecosystem is composed of organizations aware of their own role. Constructive relationships are also built by behaving in a way that fosters the success of your peers and the health of the whole ecology, rather than by exclusively pursuing the success of your own ideas, your own model, and your own issues. In the context of political participation and activation, this often translates into growing the organization with just the right people, rather than growing indefinitely. Trying to incorporate everybody and preventing them from joining organizations with slightly different values or goals turns political engagement into a zero-sum game. That means that we often invite workers NOT to join TWC if it's not the right thing for them, and rather do direct workplace organizing, join a union, or a party.\n\nThis article, then, while advocating for the merit and worth of participating in TWC, should be seen primarily as a useful tool to decide if you might be a good fit for TWC or if you should rather join a different space.\n\nSo, why Tech Workers Coalition? Why should you join? And how would your effort translate into impact?\n\nOne of the most recognized contributions of TWC has always been its ability to complement unions at the local level. Often stuck in a Fordist mindset, unions struggle to grasp the implications of cognitive labor and its specificities, worsening the gap of language, culture, and aesthetics between unions and office workers in the tech sector.\n\nThis doesn't happen magically: TWC organizers create offline and online community spaces, conferences, and events for green and experienced tech organizers to connect. They develop relationships with unions and link them to workplaces that are interested in organizing. They translate in both directions and facilitate interactions. They offer educational activities specific to labor organizing in the tech sector that unions overlook.\n\nUnions are often big organizations, slow to adapt and transform. Cognitive work poses deep challenges that are still unsolved at a global strategic level. TWC allows tech unions to still develop and thrive on the ground by filling the gaps in the areas traditional unions cannot yet see.\n\nThe more we go on, the more we realize how the tech elites, especially in the USA, are openly supporting a return to Fascism and other forms of oppression. They are reshaping the global economy to entrench themselves in the productive processes and state machinery. They imprint their values and beliefs on the psychic landscape of the ever-increasingly alienated modern and post-modern worlds.\n\nMany are fighting the tech oligarchs from without: hackers and FOSS communities, environmental activists, NGOs, and sometimes even governments. The truth is, though, that the real leverage is between the office chair and the keyboard. We could talk extensively about economics, infrastructure, power analysis, and even draw historical comparisons with the organizing of early factory workers, when only a few, like Marx, were advocating for focusing on them rather than organizing farmers, like most socialists were doing. It would be a long and boring analysis. Suffice to say that there's a lot of power in the tech industry, and that's a lot of power that could be contested and won by tech workers. We are uniquely positioned to bind such power enough to, at the very least, limit the harm the tech industry is doing to the rest of the world or, in the best scenario, reshape how and why technology is produced.\n\nWhat if you believe this, but you don't work in tech? Well, join TWC anyway. Workplace organizing is not possible for everybody: geography, workplace conditions, or, as I said, a different career path might prevent you from doing “the Thing”. TWC is a space where you can help others do “the Thing”. It's meta-organizing, baby. For some, it is frustrating: they want to be directly involved, they want the tension of a high-stakes union election, or the thrill and risk of a direct action during a protest. For others, it is cozy and reassuring: you help a hundred plants grow, and some of them for sure will bear fruit.\n\nThe tech labor movement is, worldwide, a relatively young phenomenon. In some countries, it's unheard of. In some others, it is growing and exploring what's possible. While we are beginning to understand what works and what doesn't, nobody really has found a magic formula that solves it all. Contrary to other forms of labor organizing, where ideas decades old are crystallized and organizations struggle to keep up with social and political changes, in the tech sector there's a lot of experimentation going on.\n\nOn one side it is stressful for many: some workers just want to improve their workplace and would like to have a cookiecutter strategy to apply. On the other side, for the more creative and ambitious, there's a lot of room to try new approaches. For example, we are still not set on what a strike in tech looks like. Some workers just stop working. Some employ traditional forms like picketing or marching instead of going to the office. Some others do more fun and creative stuff to keep busy and attract attention: live streaming, union-themed game jams and hackathons, and so on and so forth.\n\nTWC acts as a network throuch which these ideas travel. Traditional media or social media don't always cover these topics, especially outside the USA. Established networks of unions often talk high-level strategy and rarely go into such level of detail. TWC instead often sees meetings with tech workers from all over, sharing their stories and circulating know-how they didn't know they had. In a way, being in TWC feels like the early internet: tech labor is fragmented and disconnected across national boundaries, and absent from traditional media. TWC acts as a network for the first time, allowing tech workers to discover that in Czechia, India, or the Philippines, there are people like them, with similar issues, but maybe completely different approaches, ideas, and aesthetics.\n\nAs we said, the fight against Big Tech takes many shapes. TWC doesn't collaborate only with labor organizations, but, especially at a local level, acts as an aggregator for people working professionally on the political side of technology: researchers, investigators, artists, occultists, cooperative entrepreneurs, sometimes even party politicians.\n\nThis means that many members of TWC get involved in a lot of different and interesting initiatives happening at the fringes of our network: experimental commoning of technology, litigations, hackatons, policy-making, campaigns, performances, exhibitions, and so on.\n\nIn many places, especially smaller cities, TWC becomes a beacon for anybody working with radical technology but dissatisfied with the more traditional aggregation around hackerspaces or technical communities.\n\nFor some of us, this turned into a whole new career. Workplace organizing is fundamental, but after you're done, after you have your union in place, the company will probably still be working on how to feed the souls of innocent babies into a spirit-grinding, high-performance, demonic contraption. It takes a long time before the union is strong enough to push the company away from the business of butchering baby souls and towards more useful endeavors.\n\nThere are many cases of members that, after several years of TWC, decide to abandon their career in the tech startup or corporate world and go do something different. Some get employed by unions. Some start their own cooperative with their friends. Others join TWC meetings after waking up early to work on a farm. Some go teach in a movement school or join an NGO. Personally, participating in TWC allowed me to connect with people who eventually got me involved into AI Forensics first, and Reversing.works later. The full story here.\n\nI hope this article gave a compelling overview of what I helped build through a whole fifth of my life and I will keep building going forward. A journey that thought me agency, compassion, patience, dedication, and especially the ecstactic joy of seeing the world and the life of people around you change and get better over time.\n\nIf you're tired of arguing on the internet, if you think there's nothing to be done to form a union at work, if you're forced to “monitor the situation”, join TWC.",

    "description": "\"It's time to build\" means there's no time to bone.",
    "fullText": "There's two things that I care about the most: the gym and my work,\" says Mahir Laul.\n\nThe 18-year-old took a leave of absence from New York University this past fall to work full-time on his HR tech startup, Velric. While his classmates are taking shots and hooking up, Laul is coding and lifting. That means almost no time for romance.\n\n\"I am obsessed with work,\" he tells me. \"My love life is in the gutters.\"\n\nHis young founder friends are a similar story, he says. The few who are dating found their partners before they started their companies, while the rest are \"locked in\" on building — and locking themselves out of the dating pool.\n\nSilicon Valley has long been the land where mixing work with play was seen as crucial to its growth. While Google and Facebook were being built, their staff were also tripping on ayahuasca and canoodling in \"cuddle puddles.\" Now, amid the white-collar job apocalypse and the cutthroat AI race, tech has gone hardcore. Ramp has seen a spike in corporate card purchases on Saturdays in the Bay Area. Foot traffic at San Francisco office buildings was up 21.6% year over year in July, per Placer.ai, the highest uptick among major cities. And as I found in conversations with more than two dozen young tech professionals, the industry's upstarts are pounding through hourslong coding sprints, working 996 schedules (9 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week), and proudly telling their investors and X followers how they've gone \"monk mode\" in service of scaling their startups.\n\nFor many in Silicon Valley's young hustle class, \"it's time to build\" means there's no time to bone. They're on one type of grind, and it's not on the dance floor, which shuts down early in San Francisco anyway. Tech's dating scene, never particularly hot, has frozen over.\n\nHackathons, pitch decks, scrambling for investors — the life of a startup founder has never been amenable to a rich dating life. Lauren Kay, a former dating app founder who now runs a literary business, tells me that when she was a member of the 2014 Y Combinator class, she had to ask her cofounder for permission to go on a first date at 10 p.m. on a Saturday. Still, she did meet her husband in that YC class. Douglas Feigelson, a member of that same class, says \"there was opportunity to drink and date when I was in YC.\"\n\nA decade later, many founders feel like they can't afford to make the time.\n\nA good relationship is like a good startup, says Daivik Goel, the 27-year-old founder of the payroll platform Shor. \"It takes a lot of time to nurture at the beginning if you want to do them right.\" For now, he only has the bandwidth to nurture one. Like many of his founder friends, he says, he's not on any dating apps, and he doesn't seek out hookups at bars. \"I haven't had the time to really invest yet.\"\n\nSeveral founders I spoke to described dating in founder terms. \"The opportunity cost is really high,\" says Annie Liao, the 24-year-old founder of AI learning startup Build Club. \"Every night you spent out is time you could have spent building your startup.\" She adds, \"Most founders wait until the startup is more stable, like Series B.\"\n\nLiao says her founder roommates aren't dating either. They hook up sometimes for fun — so long as they don't get \"emotionally attached.\" For those working seven days a week on their startup, opening Hinge is \"a big, big distraction,\" she says.\n\nSome blame the dating recession on tech workers treating dating like an extension of their work. Liao says her male friends often give women ratings, \"like KPIs.\" These ratings are out of 10, and offer a \"numerical logical quantification justified in their brains to help them make an informed decision on who to date.\" Allie Hoffman, founder of dating event The Feels, tells me her San Francisco clients often ask her: \"Am I going to meet my unicorn here?\"\n\nAmy Andersen, CEO of Linx Dating, says that founders who have spent years focusing on \"optimization\" and \"ROI\" are now approaching her, looking for an equally perfect partner.\n\n\"People want to biohack love,\" she says. \"They're not necessarily thinking intelligently.\"\n\nStartup advisor Dylan Oriundo has another theory: fear. Founders aren't just afraid to give up precious building time; they're also skeptical of the motives of their potential suitors as they build their potential unicorns.\n\n\"They're not going to want me because I don't have enough money,\" Oriundo says. \"Once I reach a certain goal, they're just going to want me for my money.\"\n\nTony Bennett notwithstanding, the city has long had a reputation for its poor dating scene. Some blame it on San Francisco's wealth gap; others blame the \"ratio\" — the perceived numbers gap between men and women. The city is comprised of 51% men and 49% women, which some men say gives women the dating edge. The gender disparities likely grow even wider within tight tech circles, with women accounting for 13.2% of startup founders in 2023, and about a quarter of the tech workforce.\n\n\"If you're straight and a guy, there's just not that many women,\" says Wesley Tian, cofounder of the AI photo platform Aragon. Fed up with San Francisco dating, he says that some of his friends \"import\" people from other cities: They'll travel to another hub, meet someone, convince them to do long-distance, and eventually get them to move to the Bay Area. Some of Tian's friends in tech are moving to New York so they can date.\n\nFilip Kozera, founder of the Y-Combinator-backed Wordware and a native of Poland, tells me that he's interested in women who have creative interests like painting or singing, but finds that most of the women in San Francisco are interested in tech. So he mainly goes to Europe to date. He also shares his plan to fix the city: Take 10,000 women in Miami, teach them that having \"a boat is not the most important thing in life,\" and ship them to San Francisco. (Maybe if these women were swapped with 10,000 deep learning engineers, Miami's long-promised tech scene would finally arrive.)\n\nAnd still others say the \"ratio\" is more of a mirage, and an excuse. Joyce Zhang, a San Francisco-based dating coach and former Stripe product manager, tells me that when her male clients complain about the ratio, she asks them: \"What is in your control that you can change?\"\n\n\"Who are the men who are actually emotionally available?\" she tells them. \"If you can do the work to be that, there will be plenty of options for you.\"\n\nThose in tech's rising class who are dating, I found, had been in their relationships long before they began building and pitching.\n\nYang Fan Yun met his girlfriend during his first semester at Stanford, years before he cofounded the browser assistant startup Composite. They dated for all of college, and eventually went long distance when she moved to New York and he stayed in the Bay Area.\n\nThe New York-San Francisco long-distance relationship was common among Yun's tech friends. Even more common: \"not dating.\"\n\n\"Being in a relationship is really helpful for building the company,\" he said, describing his girlfriend, who works at a bank, as a constant supporter and the company's first product tester.\n\nSeveral of the tech workers I spoke to seemed to hope for the same thing, to have an unconditional support system through the grueling slog of building a startup. The future Zucks and Bezoses yearn for their Priscilla Chans and MacKenzie Scotts. (Those entrepreneurial forebearers are even pushing for marriage. Tech titans like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel warn about a fertility crisis. Anduril cofounder Palmer Luckey says that people should have kids in their teens.)\n\n\"You've always heard the mentality, 'Behind every successful man, there's the right woman,'\" Laul say. \"Rather than looking for hookups, I tend to look for someone as a life partner. But it's been difficult.\"\n\nSean Horan, a professor of communications at Fairfield University who studies romance and the workplace, points to some theories of \"positive life-to-work spillover.\"\n\n\"If my personal life is fulfilled, I'll actually be happier at work, which should contribute to productivity,\" he says.\n\nAnd there are exceptions to tech's dating dry spell. Queer daters may be better off. They're unencumbered by San Francisco's ratio, and find a flourishing LGBTQ+ scene in the city.\n\nSorcerer cofounder Jia Chen grew up in Michigan. Moving to San Francisco, she's found bigger populations of queer and East Asian daters. \"There are so many accomplished girls that are very multidimensional,\" she says.\n\nSome of the locked-in and lonely, meanwhile, are turning to other solutions. I heard founders describe first dates where the pair worked side-by-side. Other tech couples are finding each other on the hottest new dating app: LinkedIn. When I ask Shruti Gandhi, an investor at Array Ventures, if young founders are using actual dating apps, she laughs. \"Yeah, she says, \"to network.\"\n\nHenry Chandonnet is a reporter on the Business News desk.

    "description": "Shiyao Tang quit her $390K job at DoorDash to build a silk womenswear brand. Five months of careful planning helped her exit her corporate job.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shiyao Tang, a 34-year-old business owner based in New York City and Paris. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was on a very strong upward trajectory in my manager role at DoorDash when I quit in 2025. I was making $390,000 and felt that I still had room to grow, but when I was honest with myself, my heart wasn't in it.\n\nLeaving to start my own silk womenswear brand wasn't an instantaneous decision; it was a long-term calling inside of me. It took a lot of courage to quit and choose the unknown.\n\nI still constantly ask myself if I made a huge mistake. I think to myself, \"How could I just leave a job that most people would dream of?\" It was high-paying, the benefits were great, and there was room for learning. But I don't want to look back and think I climbed the wrong mountain.\n\nIn 2022, I was hired as a strategy and operations manager on the homepage team at DoorDash. My job was challenging, and I got to wear a lot of hats. I also developed deep friendships with some truly talented people.\n\nHowever, I realized I missed the feeling of being close to the people I was building for.\n\nEarlier in my career, I had a small entrepreneurial chapter where I worked on a fashion wholesale startup. I built my own customers from the ground up and interacted with them every day.\n\nWhen I was 16, I moved from China to the US and later spent a year studying abroad in Paris. I've always lived between cultures and felt super energized by working with people from distinct backgrounds and creative disciplines. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I wanted my career to reflect that part of me, too.\n\nTech created a structure for me to learn and expand my horizon, but I was ready to try entrepreneurship again. I spent a lot of time journaling and reflecting on what business I really wanted to make.\n\nEvery weekend was dedicated to foundational discovery work and even talking to potential customers or friends to get some early feedback on different ideas. I even started connecting with other young, inspiring entrepreneurs at founder events, which expanded my horizons regarding what life might look like as an entrepreneur.\n\nFrankly, I was extremely scared every day, but seeing people thrive gave me more confidence to envision what it might look like for me. I decided on my business, Soir Si, where I make simple, minimal sculptural silk pieces. The mission is to make luxury accessible.\n\nEven though I was sure of my decision, walking away was scary, and honestly, it was really sad for me. However, the thought of not pushing to the edge of my potential was scarier than quitting.\n\nI have my own apartment in NYC, and I spend half my time in Paris, typically staying with friends or family, to fuel my creative inspiration during the design process.\n\nThe first month after quitting, I focused on building a strong visual and emotional identity for Soir Si by enrolling in online courses and even partnering with a freelancer. The next stages were developing my website, connecting directly with customers, and using my branding and website to open up my supply chain.\n\nNow I'm focused on securing and strengthening those relationships while sprinting toward product development.\n\nRight after quitting, I was so focused on transitioning into entrepreneurship that I didn't have time for self-doubt. I felt a mix of grief and sadness about leaving, but I also felt excitement about what was ahead of me. The doubts didn't start bubbling up until several weeks later, when I hit a steep learning curve. I realized I had no idea what went into manufacturing or production, or even how to find a pattern-maker.\n\nI remember the first time I visited some manufacturers in New York, they treated me like I had no idea what I was doing. I knew I didn't speak their \"language,\" and it felt alienating. However, those moments of self-doubt were always counterbalanced by the highs, such as building relationships with potential partners. For example, my branding designer is based in Italy, and my manufacturers are based in Portugal. Establishing those relationships from scratch without any experience gave me the assurance that I can really do this.\n\nEvery day, I wake up knowing I need to work really hard and give it my all to make this dream a reality. The gradual, positive feedback from peers or my audience feeds me every day, and it's fulfilling to work with people from around the world and get to talk about silk and the region it comes from.\n\nThere are still moments when I'm super scared about the path I chose. The self-doubt bubbles up, and it all feels overwhelming, but underneath it all is a steady sense that I'm building something that aligns with who I am, not just the perception of success or stability. I'm finally excited about life again.\n\nPeople might say this is a risky move, but everyone starts from nothing. I just had to be willing to take the first step.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting your six-figure job for a riskier path? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Experts warn use of VPNs makes it hard to limit access to technology that can create nonconsensual explicit images\n\nDays after Malaysia made global headlines by announcing it would temporarily ban Grok over its ability to generate “grossly offensive and nonconsensual manipulated images”, the generative AI tool was conversing breezily with accounts registered in the country.\n\n“Still here! That DNS block in Malaysia is pretty lightweight – easy to bypass with a VPN or DNS tweak,” Grok’s account on X said in response to a question from a user.\n\nGrok’s ability to allow users to create sexually explicit images, including images of children, has created a global outcry over recent weeks, with regulators and politicians around the world launching investigations. Indonesia and Malaysia became the first two countries to announce blocks on the technology, with Malaysia’s regulatory body saying last Sunday it had “directed a temporary restriction” on access to Grok, effective as of 11 January 2026. Officials in the Philippines have said they too plan to ban the technology.\n\nBlocking access to Grok is not straightforward, however. The technology not only exists across multiple platforms, including a standalone app and website, but is also integrated across X, which, along with Grok, is owned by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nOver the past week, X users, and even Grok itself, have advised people on how to bypass restrictions. This includes using a VPN – many of which are available for free – or changing domain name system (DNS), the protocol on the internet that turns address names into IP addresses that load websites.\n\nWhen the Guardian tried to use Grok in Indonesia, its website was working even without a VPN, though the Grok app did not work. Grok was also still responding to Indonesian accounts on X, where it functions as an integrated chatbot. X has not been subject to a ban.\n\nEven if governments could completely restrict Grok, though, this is not a real solution, said Nana Nwachukwu, an AI governance expert and PhD researcher at Trinity College Dublin.\n\n“Blocking Grok is like slapping a Band-Aid on a weeping wound that you haven’t cleaned,” she said. “You block Grok, and then you go around shouting you’ve done something. Meanwhile, people can use VPNs to access the same platforms.” Or, they could simply turn to one of the many other platforms that offer the same functions, including “smaller, general purpose AI systems that are largely unknown”, Nwachukwu added.\n\nGovernments should instead focus on law enforcement and investigating individuals who use such tools to break the law, she added. “Platforms are required by law to provide information to law enforcement when a crime has been committed,” Nwachukwu said. “If we see people being arrested, people being tried in courts, people being jailed for these offences, that’s a sign that this is a real crime.”\n\nX should build accountability into its platform – and clean itself up, said Nwachukwu: “All of those offending images should be removed from the platform.”\n\nOn Wednesday, X announced additional safeguards in response to continued public anger, saying it would stop the @Grok account on X from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”, including paid subscribers. However, the Guardian found that it was possible to get around such restrictions by using the standalone version of Grok, easily accessible through a web browser, to create short videos in which clothes are removed from images of real women.\n\nThis could then be posted to X’s public platform, where it could be viewed by users around the world within seconds.\n\nMusk’s company also said that, in jurisdictions where such content is illegal, it will geoblock the ability of all users in those locations to generate images of real people in bikinis, or similar attire, in Grok on X, adding that “xAI is implementing similar geoblocking measures for the Grok app”.\n\nExperts warn users may still be able to get around such “geoblocks” through a VPN. It is also not clear in which countries such restrictions will be implemented.\n\nIn Malaysia, the communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, has said restrictions on Grok would only be lifted once the ability to produce harmful content had been disabled, according to local media reports.\n\nDr Nuurrianti Jalli, a visiting fellow at the media, technology and society programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the threat of blocking Grok could be a useful way to apply pressure to companies to respond quickly, adding that it “shifts the debate from ‘individual bad actors’ to questions of platform responsibility, safety by design, and accountability when safeguards fail”. It could also “slow the spread of abuse, reduce casual misuse and create a clear boundary around what authorities consider unacceptable”, she said.\n\nIn Indonesia, Grok has been used to create nonconsensual sexualised images of singers and celebrities, including one of the country’s most popular girl groups, JKT48, while in Malaysia, women report similar abuses, including cases where the tool has been used to remove their hijabs, according to Malaysian media.\n\nSome women resorted to publicly telling Grok on X that they do not authorise it to “crawl, take, process or edit” any of their photos.\n\nJalli said governments should push for greater transparency “about how safety measures are implemented, how abuse reports are handled and what enforcement steps are taken when harmful content is generated or circulated”.\n\nThe Malaysian communications and multimedia commission and the ministry of communications did not respond to a request for comment. Indonesia’s ministry of communication and digital affairs also did not respond.\n\nNwachukwu said safeguards should be built into the AI system, rather than “gates” built around it. “Both the [geographic] restriction from X, [and] the restriction from the government is gated access, and gates can be broken down,” she said.\n\nAdditional reporting from Hidayatullah",

    "fullText": "Big tech treats our attention like a resource to be mercilessly extracted. The fightback begins here\n\nIn the last 15 years, a linked series of unprecedented technologies have changed the experience of personhood across most of the world. It is estimated that nearly 70% of the human population of the Earth currently possesses a smartphone, and these devices constitute about 95% of internet access-points on the planet. Globally, on average, people seem to spend close to half their waking hours looking at screens, and among young people in the rich world the number is a good deal higher than that.\n\nHistory teaches that new technologies always make possible new forms of exploitation, and this basic fact has been spectacularly exemplified by the rise of society-scale digital platforms. It has been driven by a remarkable new way of extracting money from human beings: call it “human fracking”. Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetisable black gold to the surface, human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.\n\nFracking (of the Earth and of our minds) produces tectonic instability, toxicity and the despoliation of our landscapes, natural and social. We now know that the heedless exploitation of our external environment has been so relentless and irresponsible that human survival on Earth has been placed in actual jeopardy. The new “gold rush” into the inner environment of the human psyche is well on its way to effecting parallel, if even more insidious destruction.\n\nThe stakes are existential. And that is because, rightly understood, our actual human “attention” – the thing the frackers want, in the form of our eyes on their screens – is nothing less than our ability to care, our ability to think, our ability to give our minds, time and senses to ourselves, the world and each other. To commodify that is to commodify our very beings. The problem isn’t “phones”, and it isn’t “social media”. The problem is human fracking, a world-spanning land-grab into human consciousness – which big tech is treating as a vast, unclaimed territory, ripe for sacking and empire.\n\nThat’s the bad news. The good news is that novel forms of exploitation produce novel forms of resistance. What fills the coffers of the six largest corporations on the planet is nothing other than the stuff of our humanity. Which is to say this new fight for our attention stands in a long line of clashes between those who are willing to reduce people (their labour, their eyeballs) to cash value and those who insist on a higher view of human flourishing. This history is long and complex, and often painful. But it tells us this much: we can fight back. Indeed, we must.\n\nSo what is to be done about this new kind of human exploitation that is harming us – harming children and adults, compromising our deliberative politics and our psychological wellbeing? Regulatory efforts are piecemeal and actively thwarted by the powerful interests in play. Psychopharmacological fixes for the ever-expanding damage merely monetise the destruction in a complementary way and render us better able to submit to conditions that are palpably at odds with human flourishing. How to confront a problem that is both unspeakably intimate and unthinkably extensive?\n\nThe answer is clear: we, the actual people of this planet, must come together in decisive solidarity; we must say no to the human frackers, and do so by insisting, in new ways, that human attention is human, and it is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds in which we want to live. In other words, we need a movement.\n\nThink that sounds quixotic? Well, keep in mind that’s how actual change actually happens. And it can happen fast. The environmental movement as we know it did not exist in 1950, but by 1970 it was a global force. In 1946 Reynolds Tobacco was using doctors to promote cigarettes. Fewer than 20 years later, the American Medical Association and the US surgeon general publicly averred that smoking caused lung cancer.\n\nAnd the changes get much bigger than that. Precious few do-gooders devoted themselves to environmental politics in 1925. That’s because “environmental politics” wasn’t even a thing. It took a cultural shift (and the work of advocates such as Rachel Carson) across the mid-20th century to establish the physical environment – the unity of land, water, and air that produces shared life – as a politically tractable object around which diverse groups could organise. This is to say that the very structures of politics, not just our beliefs and hopes, are themselves emergent forms. New things come into being, and old things pass away.\n\nWhere attention is concerned, there are mounting signs that we are reaching an inflection point. People of all sorts, Maga Republicans and Mamdani progressives, hipsters in Portland and evangelicals in Arkansas – people who don’t agree about anything – all actually do agree that something is totally wrong with a world in which everyone spends nearly all their time scrolling endlessly through the algorithmic feeds of their social media, a world where military-grade technology and trillion-dollar corporations take aim at children, and feed them whatever it takes to keep them hooked.\n\nYou can only abuse people so much, and then, eventually, they turn, they rise, they insist on something else. Already politicians on the right and the left are identifying this issue as one that moves the electorate. In 30 years, we will look back, and this era – the wild west of the tech princes’ smash-and-grab into our hearts, souls and relationships – will be difficult to explain to our grandkids. “How did you all let that happen?” they will ask. And we’ll have to say: “It’s hard to explain: it happened before we noticed; it was so much fun, especially at first; it took us time to figure out what was going on … ”\n\nBut we are figuring it out. We write as representatives of a fast-growing and increasingly well-organised movement, focused on pushing back against the human frackers, and giving shape to a new politics of human attention. At the heart of our efforts? The formation of broad coalitions devoted to the politics of human attention, the practice of diverse forms of study that call forth the life-giving powers of the mind and senses, and the promotion of sanctuary spaces for the protection and cultivation of the kinds of attention that make life good. We call this work attention activism.\n\nOur claim? That all of us already have the tools to resist the frackers, because all of us already have things we do and care about that put us beyond the reach of the algorithms. We all already know the deepest truth: that true human attention isn’t the click and swipe of screen time. True human attention is love, curiosity, daydreaming and taking care of ourselves and others.\n\nYes, new technologies give rise to new kinds of exploitation and resistance. But new forms of exploitation can even give rise to genuinely new forms of politics. You couldn’t brutalise an industrial proletariat before the factory system. Steam engines set the conditions of possibility for this development. They weren’t themselves a “problem”, of course; they gleamed and were precise and powerful. Who could see them operate without awe? But they also created a world in which it was possible to aggregate and extract physical labour from human beings in a revolutionary way. Along the way, they created a new kind of political subject, Homo economicus, a person who had been reduced, in the calculus of modernity, to “labuor value”. Actual revolutions followed – and a new kind of politics was born which reflected a new world of industrial labour, and new forms of labour solidarity, such as unions and workers’ parties.\n\nThe new system of human fracking is turning all of us into attentional subjects in a powerful new way. Homo attentus is the end user of every networked system – economic, political, expressive. With this new form of life comes, as we have discovered, appalling new vulnerability. But we are on the brink of understanding the new power that has come into our hands in the fracklands. We believe a new kind of politics beckons. What will it look like? It is hard to say. And there are reasons to be fearful. But if we, the people, can take up the banner of a new kind of freedom movement – a movement for the true freedom of attention itself, what we call attensity – and deploy our truly human attention in new ways, with a new understanding of the stakes, we can defy the frackers, and insist on creating, together, a human world.\n\nD Graham Burnett is professor of history at Princeton University.

    "fullText": "Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a recent Substack exchange, calling out market darlings and warning that a prolonged slump is coming.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame took aim at the tech boom in a written debate with Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark and podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.\n\nBurry cautioned that so-called hyperscalers, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting huge sums on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, to power AI tools such as chatbots that will become commoditized.\n\nHe drew a parallel to a Baltimore department store briefly owned by Warren Buffett in the 1960s: Hochschild-Kohn.\n\n\"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too,\" Burry wrote. \"In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out.\"\n\nWhen one of the local department stores upgraded its window displays or debuted a new cash-register system, \"the others had to follow suit,\" author Alice Schroeder wrote in \"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life.\"\n\nBuffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, compared the situation to \"standing on tiptoe at a parade,\" she added. \"Once anybody did it, everybody had to do it.\"\n\nBurry wrote on Substack: \"This is why trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning. Most will not benefit, because their competitors will benefit to the same extent, and neither will have a competitive advantage because of it.\"\n\nBased on how previous capital-spending booms have played out, Burry wrote that we're now \"past the point where stocks will reward investors for further buildout, and getting into the period where the true costs and the lack of revenue will start to show themselves.\"\n\nLooking forward, he predicted that tech industry employment will \"be lower, or not much higher, because I think we are headed for a very long downturn.\"\n\nBurry shot to fame after his contrarian bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short,\" and actor Christian Bale portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nHe pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack late last year. Several of his early posts have taken aim at high-flying AI stocks, warning they're overvalued and destined to tumble.\n\n\"I think the market is most wrong about the two poster children for AI: Nvidia and Palantir,\" he told Clark and Patel.\n\nThe chipmaker and data-analysis specialist are \"two of the luckiest companies\" because their products were inadvertently well-suited to AI from the get-go, he added.\n\n\"Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe also said Palantir CEO Alex Karp criticizing him for being short the stock showed he's \"not a confident CEO.\"\n\n\"He's marketing as hard as he can to keep this going, but it will slip,\" Burry added.\n\nPalantir and Nvidia didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe value investor shared three things that have surprised him about the AI boom. The first was that Google \"fumbled it and gave an opening to competitors with far less going for them,\" he said. \"Google playing catch-up to a startup in AI: that is mind-blowing.\"\n\nThe second was that ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot, \"kicked off a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure race.\"\n\n\"It's like someone built a prototype robot and every business in the world started investing for a robot future,\" he wrote.\n\nThe third was Nvidia's continued dominance when he expected more power-efficient chips to have taken off by now.\n\nSpeaking about AI's real-world impacts, Burry cast doubt on the idea that trade careers are an \"AI-proof choice.\"\n\n\"If I'm middle class and am facing an $800 plumber or electrician call, I might just use Claude,\" he said, referring to Anthropic's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I love that I can take a picture and figure out everything I need to do to fix it,\" he added.\n\nBurry also raised the prospect that AI chatbots will \"make people dumber,\" such as doctors who overuse them and start to forget their medical knowledge.",

    "fullText": "Technophile Anne Goldberg has become accustomed to formatting PowerPoint presentations in her career as a recruiter.\n\nAs a result, when she found herself between jobs in the fall of 2013, she was happy when a friend paid her a fee to create a slideshow for a relative's 80th birthday party.\n\nThe guests loved the display and congratulated Golberg, then 61, on her digital prowess, which dates back to being an early adopter of computers in the 1980s. She thought nothing more of it.\n\nOver the next 10 days, she was surprised to receive a series of calls from older adults seeking her advice on operating their laptops, iPads, and iPhones.\n\nTheir queries led to a lightbulb moment. \"What if I turn this into a business?\" she thought.\n\nThe next day, harnessing the cold-calling skills she'd deployed in recruitment, she contacted an independent living facility in her home city of Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nShe spoke with the activities coordinator and asked whether the residents might be interested in a beginner's course in operating electronic devices such as smartphones.\n\n\"I got the gig,\" Goldberg told Business Insider. She hosted her first class within a week when seniors turned up with their seldom-used iPhones and Android devices.\n\nMany had been coerced by their families, who had tried unsuccessfully to show them the ropes. Golberg broke the ice by joking, \"I know you hate the idea of being here.\"\n\nBut the session was a resounding success. Twelve years later, she teaches classes at retirement homes in Florida.\n\nShe recently published her book, \"Take This Phone and Shove It!: A Frustrated Senior's Guide to Smartphones.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly rewarding,\" Goldberg, whose average client is 85 years old, said. \"It's great to see the glint in their eyes and the sense of achievement when someone finally 'gets it.'\"\n\nMost of the seniors, she said, are drawn to the fact that she's in her 70s. \"They prefer the advice of someone from their generation — or close enough — who understands the challenges.\"\n\nHere are three tips that Goldberg shares with her clientele.\n\nGoldberg said that many of her clients are scared of looking incompetent in the face of technology.\n\n\"They think they are dumb and feel threatened by having to learn,\" she said.\n\nStill, they soon prove to themselves — and others — that their fears are unfounded.\n\nShe recalled helping an octogenarian save a photo to her iPhone that had been sent by text.\n\nThe boomer talked her through the process, and she was amazed by how easy it was. \"She said, 'Are you kidding me? Is that all I have to do?\"\n\nCuriosity and a positive attitude go a long way. \"Don't say, 'I can't do it,'\" Goldberg said. \"Say, 'I can't do it yet.'\"\n\nIt's tempting to hark back to the \"golden age\" before every Tom, Dick, and Harry owned iPhones.\n\nThey might seem like halcyon days — and Goldberg respects that point of view — but the reality is that modern technology is here to stay.\n\nShe encourages her students to think about the benefits of electronic devices, especially when their families live far away.\n\n\"I say, 'You can talk to them and see them at the same time nowadays,'\" she said. \"'You couldn't do that 50 years ago.'\"\n\nAs soon as they learn how to use FaceTime, they wish they'd known about it sooner.\n\nGoldberg recalls the thrill of receiving a FaceTime tour of her son's new apartment in Colorado. \"I want other seniors to experience the same feeling.\"\n\nGoldberg understands people's misgivings about breaking their expensive devices.\n\nHowever, she said there are only a handful of ways to make that happen.\n\n\"If you throw your phone against the wall in frustration, it will break,\" she tells her clients with a laugh. Crushing it with your car wheels is not a smart idea.\n\nShe used to say that dropping an iPhone into the toilet was curtains, too. More recent Apple models can withstand immersion in water up to 6 meters for 30 minutes.\n\nStudents often tell her they're scared of damaging their screen by tapping it too hard. Goldberg asks if they've ever licked their finger and touched an iron to test the level of heat.\n\n\"Everybody nods their heads except for the rich people who never had to,\" she joked. \"I say, 'You touch the iron fast because you don't want to get burned — and that's exactly how you tap on your phone.'\"",

    "fullText": "Silicon Valley is sending a clear message about how staff should perform, and how it wants to pay them.\n\nInstead of obsessing over punishing the bottom of the stack, Big Tech is increasingly choosing to shower rewards on the top:\n\nWhat's especially notable is how this is being driven by AI, according to Zuhayeer Musa, cofounder of Silicon Valley compensation data cruncher Levels.fyi.\n\nAs AI tools get more powerful, the value of high-leverage individuals is rising. The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds.

    "fullText": "2 minute read | Jan 16, 2026 \nmanagement, product\n\nIf you’re worried about being left behind by technology, stop obsessing over tools.\n\nBefore alarm clocks were common, people paid humans to wake them up - called knocker uppers.\n\nIf you were alive during the 1800s Industrial Revolution, you had to start your factory shift before dawn. Being late would mean being fined or losing your livelihood. Alarm clocks were expensive and unreliable. To solve this you would pay knocker uppers to tap on your window to wake you up.\n\nAnd for over 100 years this worked.\n\nBut, technology improved. Alarm clocks became affordable and the human alarm clocks became obsolete. They resisted change by defending their tools - reaching clients without waking neighbours, tapping without breaking glass, waiting to confirm clients were awake.\n\nInstead of resisting change, they should have obsessed over the Job To Be Done:\n“Help me be ready for my shift.”\n\nIf they framed it this way, the future could have looked different. They had the customer relationships and could have sold alarm clocks instead of competing, or expanded into new services such as breakfast delivery - the original DoorDash perhaps.\n\nPeople fear both technology disruption and FOMO. Jensen Huang of NVIDIA frames technology as enabling new ideas:\n\n“If you think about a company and say if we improve productivity, then they need fewer people - well that’s because the company has no more ideas.\n\nBut that’s not true for most companies. If you become more productive and the company becomes more profitable, then usually they hire more people to expand into new areas.\n\nSo long as humans have more ideas, the prosperity of the industry which comes from improved productivity, results in hiring more people, more ideas.”\n\nIf you don’t want to be left behind by technology like the human alarm clock, stop obsessing over tools and start obsessing over problems and ideas on how to solve them.\n\nGet future posts with actionable tips in under 5 minutes and a bonus cheat sheet on '10 Biases Everyone Should Know'.\n\nYour email stays private.

    "description": "From Elon Musk to Mark Zuckerberg, here's a look back at what industry titans were doing 10 years ago and what has changed.",
    "fullText": "Forget what you were doing in 2016 — what about the world's tech elite?\n\nMillennials are posting throwback pictures on social media and reminiscing over what many see as simpler times.\n\nIn some ways, the tech world was, too. Then, it was the era of apps. Today, it's the age of AI. Tech founders were more likely to be celebrated as disruptors, but in 2026, there is greater wariness about the billionaire class providing the tools we use every day.\n\nHere's what tech leaders were up to in 2016, and how their companies, personal brands, and net worths have changed in the decade since.\n\nA lot has changed for Elon Musk since 2016. The Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder is now worth over half a trillion dollars and wields extraordinary influence across the worlds of business and politics. But 10 years ago, he had a net worth of just over $11 billion, expressed little interest in politics, and was better known as an ambitious entrepreneur pioneering clean energy and rocket technology.\n\nIn July 2016, Musk released Tesla's \"masterplan part deux,\" which outlined the company's goals of building more affordable EVs and rolling out fleets of self-driving cars that make money for Tesla owners even when they're not using them. While Tesla has achieved the first goal, introducing the Model 3 and Y and dominating the US EV market, the second has proven more elusive.\n\nMusk also spent 2016 helping set up a mysterious new startup with an ambitious mission of building superintelligent AI — OpenAI. A decade later, he's suing the company and his former cochair, Sam Altman, over claims he was misled over the ChatGPT maker's abandonment of its nonprofit mission.\n\nIt's not just Mark Zuckerberg's personal look that's changed over the last decade — his company has a completely different name.\n\nIn 2016, Facebook was focused on social media and advertising growth. After rebranding to Meta in 2021 to focus on the metaverse, the company today is all in on the AI boom. Oh, and Zuckerberg wears chains now.\n\nA decade ago, Facebook was starting to come under scrutiny for its political influence, including the 2016 election that put Donald Trump in the White House. That's changed. Now, Zuckerberg openly embraces the Trump administration, and Meta this month hired his former advisor and official.\n\nZuckerberg was already a billionaire tech elite in 2016, but today he is the sixth-richest person in the world with a net worth of $220 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWhile Altman was influential in Silicon Valley in 2016, he was nowhere near the global name he is today. In 2016, Altman was leading the transformation of startup seed accelerator Y Combinator as its president, having launched a VC arm, a fellowship program, and a research lab.\n\nThe year before, Altman and Musk became co-chairs of OpenAI, having formed part of the team that founded the company. The company had already raised $1 billion in 2015 toward conducting research to benefit humanity. At the time, Altman told Business Insider that OpenAI's specific research goals were still being debated.\n\nAltman launched the website Voteplz in 2016 to streamline the voting process in the presidential election, and said in a tweet he was voting against Trump because he believed \"the principles he stands for represent an unacceptable threat to America.\"\n\nDespite this early opposition, Altman lauded Trump last year as a \"pro-business, pro-innovation president\".\n\nSame leather jacket. A whole different status. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, may have kept the same style, but his company has evolved from a gaming chip giant into the world's most valuable company that's also critical to the AI boom.\n\nThe graphics processing units designed by Nvidia were mostly sold to gamers in 2016, but its chips were already being used in AI research labs. Now they are stacked up in data centers across the world to power AI models like ChatGPT. They have become so important to the global economy that any signs of weakness in Nvidia's results prompt fears of an AI bubble.\n\nDespite founding the world's most valuable company, his net worth of $155 billion puts him in ninth place on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. Still, that's a huge jump from his net worth of about $3 billion at the end of 2016.\n\nPhilanthropy continues to dominate Bill Gates' public life. The Microsoft cofounder has ramped up donations through the Gates Foundation — formerly known as The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — as part of his plan to give away nearly all his wealth over the next 20 years.\n\nIn 2016, Gates was the richest person in the world with a net worth of $87.4 billion. With his then-wife, Melinda French Gates, the two dedicated their 2016 annual letter to clean-energy development, writing about making zero-carbon emissions a priority and bringing energy to the world's poorest people.\n\nThe foundation focused on eliminating HIV, malaria, and other infectious diseases — a mission that has continued to 2026.\n\nIn 2016, Amazon was already dominating the online retail market, and Jeff Bezos was still the company's CEO.\n\nDespite a barrage of negative media attention the year before based on reports that Amazon warehouses were high-pressure, toxic work environments — claims Bezos disputed — the company's dominance in cloud was growing. This trajectory has continued with Amazon Web Services seeing a 20% cloud sales growth in the third quarter of 2025, with plans to double capacity by the end of 2027.\n\nBezos said in 2016 that his ambition for his space technology company, Blue Origin, was to move heavy, polluting industry away from Earth to one day save the planet. In November 2025, the firm had its first successful booster recovery, bringing Blue Origin closer to rivaling SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nBezos was still married to MacKenzie Scott before the two filed for divorce in 2019. He stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021 and married Lauren Sánchez in a lavish multi-day celebration in Venice in June 2025.",

    "title": "Inside Selkirk's high-tech pickleball lab, where they use a 'performance cannon' and 'Thor's hammer' to make top-of-the-line paddles",
    "description": "Selkirk Sport's R&D lab puts its pickleball paddles through rigorous stress testing using cannons and CT scanners. See inside.",
    "fullText": "Selkirk isn't just producing pickleball paddles. They're running science experiments.\n\nOne such experiment involves firing pickleballs at a stationary paddle at up to 120 miles per hour — over and over and over again.\n\nWhen the ball leaves the \"durability cannon,\" which the engineers nicknamed Mjölnir after Thor's hammer, and makes contact with the paddle, it emits a booming sound that resembles, well, a cannon. Impressive for a perforated plastic sphere.\n\nThor's hammer is just one of the fancy and expensive pieces of machinery I got to see in action when I toured Selkirk LABS, the research and development division of Selkirk Sport, in mid-January.\n\nSelkirk is a leading pickleball equipment brand. If you play the sport, chances are you or your opponent is wielding one of their sticks. The shipping department manager, who works out of the company's 87,000-square-foot warehouse, told me they fulfill roughly 1,000 orders a day and up to 2,500 during the holiday season.\n\nThe company was founded in 2014 by two brothers, Rob and Mike Barnes, and their father, Jim, well before pickleball became popular.\n\n\"Pickleball had a connotation of being a senior sport for a while,\" Rob told me at the Selkirk headquarters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where the brothers grew up and started their first business as teens selling airsoft guns out of their dad's basement.\n\nThey sold the airsoft business to pivot to pickleball, a game they discovered in 2009 and couldn't get enough of. It seemed impossible that it wouldn't take off. They were right about that, but it took years, and a global pandemic that encouraged socially distant activities, before the rest of the world would catch on.\n\nAs the sport has exploded, so has the competition. The Barnes brothers believe in staying ahead by continuing to invest in R&D and deliver premium products. They have the only private sports science lab in pickleball, which they've invested roughly $1 million into, and one of the few private sports labs in racket sports in general.\n\nThe youngest Barnes brother, Tom, joined the family business after a career in the Marines. He's the director of R&D and spent nearly three hours walking me through the lab, explaining in detail how each machine works and why it's important.\n\nWhile the paddle is their hero product, Selkirk also makes shoes, apparel, balls, and nets — \"everything except the court surface,\" said Tom, as long as it's in the pickleball realm. He and his brothers don't have any interest in expanding into the myriad of racket sports: tennis, padel, squash, etc. \"We will only ever do pickleball. This was intentional from day one. It's called Selkirk Sport; it's not called Selkirk Sports.\"\n\nTom greeted me at the unassuming entrance of the facility, nicknamed \"Aqua.\" It makes up about 22,000 square feet of Selkirk's 160,000-square-foot campus.\n\nThe lab portion of the building, which has been up and running for about a year, is split into two rooms. We started in the larger of the two, which houses a bunch of machines, including this one designed to perform a \"pull test.\" They'll place a specimen of the paddle material between these two clamps and essentially rip it apart to test its resilience.\n\n\"This is aerospace material science,\" Tom told me — a phrase I never thought I'd include in the same sentence as \"pickleball.\"\n\nHe also showed me what's called the \"optical profilometer,\" a digital microscope that lets you examine the paddle's face in detail. The texture — or, grit — on a paddle is important. It creates spin and influences ball control.\n\nThanks to the fancy microscope, \"we can see every little crystal of our grit,\" said Tom. \"We can see every dot of the ink on here. And we can see defects.\"\n\nHere's a much better photo of the machine than the one I snapped:\n\nNext up is my personal favorite: Thor's hammer. Tom describes it as \"a really fancy potato cannon.\"\n\nAfter scanning a fresh paddle, engineers will place it inside this big, red cage, and the durability cannon will fire pickleballs at it every six seconds, about 1,000 times. Then it goes back to the profilometer for another scan to see what happened to the surface after all the abuse.\n\nIt's a bulky machine they sourced from China and originally intended for tennis racket testing. Tom describes it as \"big and slow,\" but it gets the job done for now. He was excited to share that his team is working on their own version of Thor's hammer that will be smaller and fire balls even faster.\n\nThere's also a CT scanner in this room. While the profilometer performs an external scan, the CT performs an internal scan.\n\nI asked what he's looking for in the images. \"Everything,\" he said. \"We can look at every microscopic detail inside the paddle and make sure everything is where we want it to be.\"\n\nBefore they had the CT scanner, the only way they could see what was going on inside the paddle was to saw it open and manually inspect it. The method worked, but destroyed the paddle.\n\n\"You can only do that once,\" said Tom. Whereas, with the CT scanner, the paddle is still playable after the inspection. \"This is the biggest, most important thing we've ever bought for non-destructive testing.\"\n\nThe second, smaller room of the lab has machines that test for swing and twist weight. It also houses what Tom likes to call their \"academic research cannon\" or \"performance cannon.\" Its main job is to help figure out the physics involved in the sport: What happens when a plastic ball hits a paddle?\n\nLike Thor's hammer, it involves firing pickleballs at a stationary paddle.\n\n\"It's measuring how efficient the collision is, which is basically how efficient the paddle is — not too dissimilar to how many miles a car can go on a gallon a gas,\" said Tom. \"The reason this is important is because in our sport, due to our limited court dimensions, we cannot have this ball come off too fast. We have to limit the power because if you don't limit power, the court gets really small and the game doesn't work anymore.\"\n\nAqua isn't just for R&D. Some of the paddles get finished here. About 30 employees work various stations of the production line, adding edge guards, caps, and grips to the paddles.\n\nThis employee is finishing the popular Boomstik paddle, which Selkirk launched in the summer of 2025. It's their most premium model, retailing for $333. He's spraying it with \"InfiniGrit\" — a spin coating that took thousands of trials and years to develop, said Tom: \"We call it that because it's gritty and it's infinite because it lasts really long.\"\n\nThis Boomstik is very close to being done. It just needs a grip.\n\nThe gripping station is fascinating, where employees use a machine that spins and guides the grip onto the paddle. The speed at which it spins is controlled by a pedal.\n\nOnce the paddles are gripped, they head to quality control for inspection. To pass, \"it needs to look perfect,\" Tom told me.\n\nThe ones that don't pass — maybe they have a scratch or a chip or a scuff — are deemed \"seconds\" and sold as used paddles or turned into demos.\n\nHere are the boxes of \"seconds.\"\n\nThe lab setup is overwhelmingly impressive, but Tom isn't yet satisfied.\n\n\"Even today, with all of this, I feel like we're 5% of the way there,\" he told me. \"Five years from now, I think our company will be insane.\"\n\nI guess I'll have to return in five years to see what they've cooked up.",

    "description": "\"Strategically, this is an attractive early entry market.\"",
    "fullText": "A San Diego battery maker has an impressive sodium-ion product designed to replace long-standing lead-acid batteries in multiple settings.\n\nWith it, UNIGRID is staking a greater claim in the replaceable battery market — valued by Fortune Business Insights at nearly $50 billion annually.\n\nThe 12-volt product, dubbed Na⁺ Fleet, is designed to better start internal combustion engines in cars, trucks, forklifts, and other technology, as well as power lights and electronics in electric vehicles.\n\n\"Strategically, this is an attractive early entry market for sodium-ion; it is a large, already-existing market using an outdated technology that is primed for disruption,\" UNIGRID co-founder Darren H. S. Tan said in a press release.\n\nThe downside is that it's an investment in a product that's included in pollution-chugging transportation. In addition to reducing local air quality, tailpipe exhaust can increase cancer risks, according to the American Lung Association.\n\nHowever, the battery is also an advancement for sodium-ion chemistry, which is being developed by experts around the world as a cheaper, better-performing alternative to lithium-ion and lead-acid versions.\n\nUNIGRID said in a press release that its battery's lifetime is 10 times greater than lead-acid, which has been used for more than a century.\n\nThe breakthrough could replace these types of batteries, thereby reducing the amount of harmful waste generated by improperly disposed lead-acid packs. The Environmental Protection Agency detailed a number of problems they pose, such as lead exposure that can lead to brain, kidney, and hearing damage.\n\nNa⁺ Fleet can last for 5,000 cycles in hot or cold weather, requires no maintenance, and is lighter, UNIGRID noted among a list of perks.\n\n\"Sodium-ion … beats lead-acid in almost all metrics … including total cost,\" Tan said in the release.\n\nDo you worry about the longevity of EV batteries?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSodium-ion packs are also being developed to power EVs, and UNIGRID's progress could be part of the path to next-generation technology for cleaner rides.\n\nEVs prevent thousands of pounds of air pollution annually when compared to gas cars, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Interesting Engineering added that Na⁺ Fleet can be used to power EV auxiliary systems, replacing lead-acid for that work, too.\n\nGlobal sales of EVs reached 18.5 million vehicles year-to-date through November, a 21% increase over 2024, according to supply chain analysts Rho Motion.\n\nOverseas markets are stronger than the stateside one, where growth has been \"subdued\" due to well-documented policy changes and the end of federal EV tax credits, the report added.\n\nBut it's still a great time to make the switch, as many states offer perks for buying and charging EVs, which provide yearly gas and service savings of up to $1,500. That's thanks to no oil changes, spark plug replacements, and other common maintenance.\n\nAdding home solar to charge the rides increases the savings. The Cool Down's Solar Explorer can help get you started with curated quotes, installer recommendations, and other tips.\n\nIn the meantime, UNIGRID continues to log sodium-ion innovations in a quickly advancing battery sector.\n\nThe latest one offers \"a substantially longer operational lifespan,\" the company said.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles. That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.\n\nExperts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”\n\n“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”\n\nOthers say the shift is inevitable.\n\n“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nWhat makes Chinese vehicles stand out?\n\nChinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.\n\n“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”\n\nThese vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.\n\nChinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle's driving range.\n\n“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. \"These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”\n\nMany automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.",

    "title": "Apple is losing its grip on the world's tech supply chain",
    "description": "Apple once set the bar for suppliers including TSMC. Now it's being unseated by Nvidia and AI cloud giants.",
    "fullText": "For over a decade, Apple sat at the center of the tech supply chain. Its enormous scale let it dictate pricing, lock up capacity, and steer the roadmaps of suppliers that made everything from chips and memory to substrates and packaging. That era is ending.\n\n\"Apple is no longer the gravitational center of the hardware universe,\" said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology, who tracks the industry's supply chain.\n\n\"Apple still moves huge volumes and has unmatched brand strength. But the company is no longer the anchor client for fabs, substrate makers, or key component suppliers. That's a fundamental change.\"\n\nThis is important because the tech companies that control the supply chain are more likely to win. When you can order the largest amount of a key component, you get better pricing and a more reliable supply. That results in better-priced products that are available sooner than your rivals. This power is now shifting toward AI giants, including Nvidia and huge cloud players such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (aka \"AMG\").\n\nThe most visible sign is at TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker. It's famous for churning out cutting-edge iPhone chips, which gave Apple a huge advantage over other consumer hardware players.\n\nWhen TSMC reported results this week, it became very clear that its smartphone business is no longer its most important segment. High-performance computing — a category dominated by AI chips for companies like Nvidia and hyperscale cloud providers — now accounts for roughly 58% of TSMC's revenue, far surpassing smartphone processors.\n\nTSMC makes chips for Nvidia's AI servers, which are being snapped up in huge volumes by the cloud giants. They pack this gear into huge data centers that train and run AI models to power new services such as ChatGPT. Is that a better business than making iPhone chips?\n\nTSMC's CEO C.C. Wei answered that. He's been talking to these AI giants a lot lately. Here's what he said on this week's earnings call:\n\n\"They show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business. So they grow their business successfully and see the financial return. So I also double-checked their financial status. They are very rich.\"\n\nSuppliers go where the money is. Increasingly, the biggest Benjamins are coming from AI and cloud giants, not Apple.\n\nThis shift is rippling through the rest of the supply chain. Memory chip makers are reallocating capacity away from phones and PCs to feed AI data centers hungry for DRAM, dynamic random access memory. This is a common type of memory chip that's used in AI servers and iPhones.\n\nMemory prices have surged lately, and that's likely to push up smartphone costs and potentially squeeze margins. Nvidia has locked in long-term memory supply, leaving smartphone makers with less negotiating power.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, Apple's scale let it dictate component supply, pricing, and roadmaps,\" Gastwirth said. \"That leverage diminishes when suppliers earn higher margins and higher growth from AI customers than from smartphones.\"\n\nBottlenecks are emerging in unexpected places, too. A shortage of high-end glass cloth, a critical input for chip substrates, has suppliers prioritizing AI customers who pre-pay and sign multi-year contracts.\n\nApple, which uses these substrates across nearly all its products, is now competing with AI chipmakers for limited supply and even sending engineers to help smaller suppliers qualify alternative materials, according to a report this week from Nikkei.\n\nManufacturing partners are also re-prioritizing. Foxconn, once synonymous with iPhone assembly, now generates more revenue from AI servers than from consumer electronics. Its fastest-growing customers are hyperscalers and Nvidia, not Apple.\n\nNone of this makes Apple irrelevant. The company remains one of the world's largest buyers of components. However, in a supply chain increasingly shaped by AI, pricing, allocation, and capacity planning are being set elsewhere — and Apple is learning what it's like to be just another very large customer.\n\n\"In the 2010s, Apple set the pace for the supply chain,\" Gastwirth said. \"In the late 2020s, Nvidia, hyperscalers, and AI infrastructure now dictate pricing, allocation, and long‑term capacity planning.\"\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "There is a yearslong lag in the AI hype cycle, according to one former AI researcher turned venture capitalist.\n\nJenny Xiao, who cofounded Leonis Capital in 2021 after a stint at OpenAI, said the current investment excitement around AI is far behind the actual research.\n\n\"There is a massive disconnect between what researchers are seeing and what investors are seeing,\" Xiao said on the Fortune Magazine podcast this week.\n\nWhat's being discussed at the biggest AI conferences is as much as 3 to 5 years behind what researchers are thinking about, Xiao said.\n\n\"We are so behind the technical frontier, and that's the gap I really want to bridge,\" she added.\n\nXiao, who dropped out of a Ph.D. program in economics and AI to take a researcher role at OpenAI, founded Leonis Capital to bridge the worlds of venture capital and deep academic AI research.\n\n\"With AI, there needs to be a new generation of founders. There needs to be a new generation of VCs,\" she said.\n\nIt's also the first time investors need to be able to provide financial support to both the market and the technology, she added. Unlike SaaS companies, which were built on a \"stable tech stack,\" AI is moving fast. To keep up, Xiao said investors are going to need to be as technical as the founders.\n\nIf she has one piece of advice for investors who haven't gone deep into the technical side, it's that they should know \"AI progress isn't linear,\" she said.\n\nThey should know AI progress happens in \"lumps,\" she said. So, questions about why AI progress is slowing down or speeding up aren't the best way to characterize the rate of development.\n\n\"It's neither of those two extremes,\" she said. \"It's somewhere in between.\"\n\nLeonis Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Writing at the end of the world, from Hveragerði, Iceland",
    "fullText": "It’s now been roughly six months since I slowed down this newsletter to give me space to think and reconsider.\n\nI’ve done this before – several times in the history of this website, in fact. Sometimes the blog has stayed sporadic for a couple of years. Sometimes only a few weeks passed until I found my motivation again.\n\nWriting just for yourself is its own kind of fun. Whatever else is going on in my life, even when the mental landscape that is my blog or newsletter is lying fallow and slowly regaining its fertility, I still update it occasionally because writing is both fun and a tool that helps me make sense of the world around me.\n\nBut writing – any media – only reaches its full potential if it’s done with an audience – not just for an audience, but written as a part of the field or community in discourse with others.\n\nAnd that kind of writing has to have a purpose. It needs to be of service and add value to the field that frames it.\n\nThat’s the bargain. That’s why people read what you write and, occasionally, help support the writer in some way.\n\nWhen you feel that you’re burning out on writing, one of the possible reasons is that the bargain that’s specific to the writing you’ve been doing isn’t working for you.\n\nWhen an audience wants anger and hostility, feeding that can be the writing bargain you offer and the audience will often reward you with attention, praise, and waves of hostility that lift you up, as if it were support, because the poison is directed elsewhere.\n\nBut the poison is still there. Feeding hostility in others requires feeding the hostility in yourself.\n\nThis is why I’ve been struggling for a while now to write constructively about tech and “AI” specifically. Constructive criticism has a purpose, but we’re at a point in the current iteration of “irrational exuberance” where the stakes for the pro- side are so high that nothing constructive registers and what we’re left with are anger and the expert chroniclers of “just how bad is it anyway?”\n\nAcademics and researchers who specialise in machine learning and related fields catalogue the hype and promises. The few genuinely numerate journalists, such as Ed Zitron, do the maths on just how big and potentially catastrophic the bubble is. We’re at a point where the finances, environmental impact (which is currently expressing itself mostly on a community level), workplace dysfunction, and outright debasement of the entire software industry’s user experience mean that there is simply no reasonable justification for supporting these tools. They are obviously destructive.\n\nSensible criticism is unnecessary in this environment. You need chroniclers – the experts who are cataloguing the various examples that show just how damaging these systems are – and you need the analysts – the journalists who can tell us just how many orders of magnitude the industry numbers are off by – but there is little outright need for low-key constructive criticism.\n\nBecause the correct response to those who are explicitly collaborating with authoritarians and fascists, as much of the “AI” industry is doing, isn’t to tell them that their tech is likely to cause substantial delays at the organisations that adopt it.\n\nThe correct response is to tell them to fuck off and then move on.\n\nWallowing in the anger isn’t productive. Mockery always works, but I’ve never been much of a humour writer so I already know that I should be leaving that kind of writing to others.\n\nSo I had to do a bit of contemplation. I’m not a particularly fast thinker. I tend to linger on details for too long and overthink things, but with enough time I get there and I think it’s time to put this newsletter back on a schedule. I’m putting together something that wraps up my coverage of “AI” specifically, at least for now, but other than that I’d like to continue my explorations of the impact of and problems caused by tech, but with a slight shift in focus:\n\nSoftware as a mass medium and the effect it has on other media.\n\nThe reason is straightforward: pretending software isn’t a medium, pretending that it doesn’t have \n\nIt doesn’t work for those of us who have been making software.\n\nIt doesn’t work for those of us who need to use the software.\n\nIt doesn’t work for the societies that have, inadvisedly, come to depend on what’s effectively a bunch of flared jeans designers cosplaying as engineers as the fundamental drivers of their economies.\n\nPretending this made-up bullshit makes sense doesn’t work any more. At least, it doesn’t work any more for those of us who have avoided getting caught up in the bubble irrationality.\n\nThe best way to deal with software – making it, using it, dealing with it as a creative medium, coping with it as a maker of other creative media – is to understand it as it really is:\n\nA creative medium driven by fashion that operates with limited regard for practicality or productivity.\n\nThis isn’t far off from what I was already doing. Systems-thinking is still one of the lenses I apply and I’m firmly of the school of media analysis that takes business factors and processes into account, so it’s mostly a question of broadening the focus slightly, coupled with a small change in perspective.\n\nMaybe it won’t work and I’ll have to rethink things again, which is fine. Maybe it’ll only work for a few weeks until the topic runs out of steam, which is also fine.\n\nBut at least it should be a bit fun.\n\nI’ve finally released print versions of all my books:\n\nIf you’d like to support this newsletter and make it likelier that I continue to publish in print in the future, this would be the time to order a copy. 🙂",

    "fullText": "Patrick Vallance says robots would take away ‘repetitive’ tasks, but Sadiq Khan warns AI will usher in ‘new era of mass unemployment’\n\nAdvances in AI and robotics will transform human jobs, starting with roles in warehouses and factories, the UK science minister has said, as the government announced plans to reduce red tape for robot and defence tech companies.\n\nPatrick Vallance said technological progress was creating a “whole new area” for robots to work in. “What’s really changing now is the combination of AI and robotics. It is opening up a whole new area, particularly in the sorts of things like humanoid robotics. And that will increase productivity, it will change the human job,” he told the Guardian.\n\nLord Vallance spoke as a government unit helping to deploy new technologies in Britain announced robots and defence as new sectors receiving its support.\n\nHe said factories and warehouses, already at the forefront of robot deployment, will undergo further change as a result of the new generation of humanoid robots.\n\n“Activities that require movement around warehouses and factories, or those sorts of things that can be made robotic, will be made robotic. I think they will be made robotic in many cases and therefore, will change the nature of those jobs. That’s going to be the first wave,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has warned that AI could “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nSpeaking in his annual Mansion House speech on Thursday, Khan said artificial intelligence could destroy a significant amount of jobs in London unless ministers act to help replace jobs taken over by the technology.\n\nAsked to comment on Khan’s speech, Vallance said robots would take away “repetitive” tasks. “You take away some of the things which are less interesting, repetitive things that can be done in another way,” he said.\n\nVallance, formerly the government’s chief scientific adviser, added that the example of robotics assisting in surgery showed how the technology can enhance jobs.\n\n“Robotics is not displacing surgeons, it’s radically improving how those surgeons work and allowing things to be done with more precision,” he said.\n\nThe government announced on Friday that the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO) is expanding its remit to defence tech and robotics, with the aim of slashing red tape for companies operating in those spaces.\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is also releasing £52m for new hubs to drive robotics adoption in British businesses. These hubs will offer companies advice on using robots and live demonstrations. “The RIO will aim to streamline overlapping requirements to bring products to market safely, but more quickly, to improve lives and grow our economy,” it said.\n\nThe department added that autonomous drones could benefit from the wider RIO remit. Such technology could require separate approvals for aviation, data protection, and sector-specific safety rules, in an expensive process that could take months.\n\nVallance was speaking during a visit to Humanoid, a UK-based robotics company that has already deployed its prototypes in a factory operated by German industrial group Siemens.\n\nAdam Kelsall, Humanoid’s head of product management, said the company welcomed “anything that gets us into the real world and testing [robots] sooner”.",

    "fullText": "Move comes as calls for Australia-style social media ban for under-16s grow around world\n\nTikTok will begin to roll out new age-verification technology across the EU in the coming weeks, as calls grow for an Australia-style social media ban for under-16s in countries including the UK.\n\nByteDance-owned TikTok, and other major platforms popular with young people such as YouTube, are coming under increasing pressure to better identify and remove accounts belonging to children.\n\nThe system, which has been quietly piloted in the EU over the past year, analyses profile information, posted videos and behavioural signals to predict whether an account may be belong to a user under the age of 13.\n\nAs well as analysing information the account holder provides about themselves, the technology looks at behaviour such as the videos a user publishes, and “other on-platform behaviour”.\n\nTikTok said accounts flagged by the system would be reviewed by specialist moderators rather than face an automatic ban, and may then be removed.\n\nIt also said users would have an opportunity to appeal against the removal of an account if an error had been made.\n\nOptions for age identification offered by TikTok during the appeal process include facial age estimation by the verification company Yoti, credit card authorisation or government-approved identification.\n\nThe European pilot led to the removal of thousands of accounts.\n\nThe rollout of the system comes as European authorities scrutinise how platforms verify users’ ages under data protection rules.\n\nTikTok said its system complied with data and privacy laws. “The prediction of the likelihood that someone is under the age of 13 is not used for purposes other than to decide whether to send an account to human moderators and to monitor and improve the technology,” the company said in a blogpost.\n\n“By adopting this approach, we are able to deliver safety for teens in a privacy-preserving manner. We take our responsibility to protect our community, and teens in particular, incredibly seriously.”\n\nIt said other features to protect younger users on its service included not allowing under-16s to direct-message, while under-18s have a 60-minute screen-time limit and do not receive notifications “after bed time”.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also uses Yoti to verify users’ ages on Facebook.\n\nIn December, Australia implemented a social media ban for people under the age of 16. On Thursday, the country’s eSafety commissioner revealed that more than 4.7m accounts had been removed across 10 platforms – including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snap and Facebook – since the ban was implemented on 10 December.\n\nEarlier this week, Keir Starmer told MPs he was open to a social media ban for young people in the UK after becoming concerned about the amount of time children and teenagers were spending on their smartphones.\n\nThe prime minister told Labour MPs he had become alarmed at reports of five-year-olds spending hours in front of screens each day, as well as increasingly worried about the damage social media was doing to under-16s.\n\nStarmer has previously opposed banning social media for children, believing such a move would be difficult to police and could push teenagers towards the dark web.\n\nEarlier this month, Ellen Roome, whose 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong, called for more rights for parents to access social media accounts of their children if they die.\n\nThe European parliament is pushing for age limits on social media, while Denmark wants to ban social media for those under 15.\n\nTikTok told Reuters the new technology was built specifically to comply with the EU’s regulatory requirements. The company has worked with Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, its lead EU privacy regulator, while developing the system.\n\nIn 2023, a Guardian investigation found that moderators were being told to allow under-13s to stay on the platform if they claimed their parents were overseeing their accounts.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - India has issued a final warning to Apple that it will proceed in an antitrust case ​against the U.S. tech giant as the company has delayed responses to ‌officials for over a year and undermined the investigation, a confidential order shows.\n\nApple has said it fears ‌it could be fined up to $38 billion if India's competition watchdog uses its global turnover calculation for penalties, after an investigation found it had abused its position on its app store. Apple, which denies the allegations, has challenged the penalty rules in ⁠an Indian court, and the ‌matter is pending.\n\nWhile the Delhi High Court is still hearing that challenge, a confidential December 31 order from the Competition Commission of ‍India (CCI) shows Apple privately sought to pause the entire case while the penalty‑rules dispute is before the court. The CCI rejected the request.\n\nThe watchdog said it asked Apple in October ​2024 to file objections to the investigation’s findings and provide financial details typically ‌used to assess penalties, but the company has received \"repeated extensions\" since then.\n\n\"The Commission is of the considered view that repeated extensions, despite unambiguous directions, undermine procedural discipline and impede the timely conclusion of proceedings,\" CCI noted in its order, seen by Reuters.\n\n\"Such indulgence cannot be continued indefinitely,\" it added, giving Apple a final warning ⁠that it will proceed in the case unilaterally ​if no response is received by next week.\n\nApple ​did not respond to Reuters queries.\n\nA source familiar with the matter said Apple views CCI's December order as a move to preempt the ‍ongoing court proceedings and ⁠the company was not likely to respond to it before the judges hear it next on January 27.\n\nSince 2022, Tinder-owner Match and Indian startups ⁠have been locked in an antitrust battle with Apple. Investigators in 2024 issued a report saying the ‌U.S. smartphone company engaged in \"abusive conduct\" on the iOS apps market.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Aditya Kalra, Editing by Louise Heavens)",

    "description": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson said AI isn't going away, but it's not quite at the level it needs to be to bring about major changes.",
    "fullText": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson says he's hopeful about AI in the long term, but right now, he's just not seeing enough to meaningfully change his approach.\n\n\"I feel like it's a little bit like a flickering light bulb,\" Hansson said during a recent episode of \"Next Token.\" \"You're in total darkness and then it'll flicker on and you go like, 'I can see everything.' And then two seconds later, boom, pitch black.\"\n\nHansson said when he asked AI to write lines of code, the output is not \"as good as a job as most junior programmers I've had to deal with.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling that we're falling behind at 37 Signals in terms of our ability to produce, in terms of our ability to launch things or improve the products,\" he said. \"And this is why I'm a little skeptical about the claims that AI is already now at a place where you can take your standard SaaS business and then fire half the programmers and still go faster.\"\n\nHumans coded 95% of the code for Fizzy, 37 Signals' Kanban-inspired organization product, Hansson said. They've experienced with AI-powered features for the product, but for now, they've ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nHansson said he doesn't see his business losing ground because he's focusing on writing his own code. For the time being, he can still \"care about the beauty of it.\"\n\n\"That's a luxury that perhaps is akin to what a modern saddle maker enjoys when you go, \"Oh, the letter's just right, and the stitching is just right.' And you're like, 'Okay, but you're no longer part of the main production for transportation,'\" he said. \"And I'm like, 'Well, so what?' I'll continue to make my handwritten code saddles as long as I can for my enjoyment.\"\n\nAlternatively, Hansson said he's seen the promise of AI in the type of tools Shopify uses, where he serves on the board.\n\n\"Some of the things that they've done with SiteKick, the AI agent they have helping merchants set up their shop and optimize their shop is truly incredible,\" he said. \"And there's some real tangible benefits in that that I think are undisputable.\"\n\nOverall, Hansson said he's excited about the promise of a new era that could upend development, just as the iPhone's 2007 release ushered in a focus on mobile optimization.\n\n\"This is the first one where we, in real time, know the world is going to look totally different, and we don't know what the final result is going to be,\" he said. \"So I think the best thing you can just do is accept that A, we don't know, B, that it's really exciting, and C, just try to hold onto your hat, jump on there cowboy and ride it and see where it goes.\"\n\nHe also said AI isn't going away, no matter what some people may hope.\n\n\"That power does not exist. You don't get to roll these things back. Now, you could personally choose that you're not going to use gen AI,\" he said, adding that some people may also try to avoid buying products that were aided by AI.\n\nHansson said he's amazed by just how much of the US economy is based on large bets that AI will break through its current limitations and reach something akin to Artificial General Intelligence, the theoretical moment where AI reaches capabilities akin to humans.\n\n\"The entire American economy right now is one big bet that that's going to happen,\" he said. \"And I, as AI positive as I am, still marvel at that. The conviction of an entire economy to just combined go like 'Whatever takes 100 trillion, a thousand trillion. I don't care. We will get there.' I go like, 'That's why America is fucking number one.'\"",

    "description": "Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch said European governments and firms want AI they can control, deploy locally, and run independently of US tech giants.",
    "fullText": "As the race to dominate AI accelerates, Europe's most prominent AI startup is betting that geography — not just technology — can be a competitive advantage in its home market.\n\nArthur Mensch, the CEO and cofounder of French AI company Mistral, said the company's edge in Europe over Silicon Valley rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic isn't about having dramatically smarter models.\n\nInstead, he said that many European governments and regulated enterprises are seeking AI systems they can control, customize, and operate independently, rather than relying on a small number of external providers.\n\n\"European governments are coming to us because they want to build the technology and they want to serve their citizens,\" Mensch said on the \"Big Technology Podcast\" on Wednesday.\n\nMistral, founded in 2023 and now valued at roughly $14 billion, develops large language models that rival those of leading US systems.\n\nBut Mensch said that frontier AI models are rapidly converging in performance as research spreads and training techniques become widely available.\n\nAs a result, the real battleground is shifting away from raw intelligence and toward deployment, control, and trust — a shift that plays directly into Mistral's pitch in Europe.\n\nMensch said governments, banks, and heavily regulated industries want AI systems they can customize, deploy locally, and operate independently — without fear that a single vendor could change the rules or shut off access.\n\nThe approach has already paid off. France's military recently selected Mistral for an AI deal that keeps sensitive systems running on French-controlled infrastructure.\n\nMensch pushed back on the idea that the company benefits merely from EU regulation or protectionism.\n\nInstead, he framed the demand as geopolitical and operational.\n\nEuropean governments, he said, want AI that they can govern themselves and use to serve citizens without depending on foreign platforms.\n\nThe same logic applies to regulated enterprises that need tighter control over data, compliance, and security.\n\nMistral's embrace of open-source models is central to that strategy.\n\nOpen source allows customers to run AI on their own infrastructure, build redundancy, and avoid vendor lock-in — a sharp contrast to the closed, centralized platforms favored by many US firms.\n\nThe appeal isn't limited to Europe. Mensch said Mistral also works with US and Asian customers who want to reduce dependence on a small group of American providers and retain more autonomy over how AI is used inside their organizations.\n\nThat approach is already extending beyond the West. Mistral recently deepened a partnership with Morocco's government to co-build locally tailored AI models and launch a joint research and development lab aimed at strengthening the country's technological autonomy.\n\nLong term, Mensch said he doesn't believe AI will be dominated by a single winner or country. Instead, he expects multiple regional centers of expertise shaped by local needs, industries, and political realities.\n\nIn that future, he suggested, Mistral's biggest advantage may not be the models it builds — but where, and how, it builds them.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

    "description": "The use of generative AI in video games has been controversial to say the least, but when it comes to art, the blowback has been even stronger. One game currently being accused of using the technology is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, as the new trailer for the fighting game's upcoming second season of DLC characters is being picked apart online. Viewers and commenters have pored over the trailer, claiming that the character designs are inconsistent and that certain visual elements contain generative AI. The biggest smoking gun, according to viewers, is a quick shot of series antagonist Geese Howard, who appears to be missing an entire foot.\nOther instances of generative AI pointed out include Blue Mary's motorcycle missing several vital components--and being a completely different model from what she normally rides--and Kim Jae Hoon having noticeably different wardrobes between his cinematic and gameplay character models.",

Now it's accountability.\n\nA new year means a new mantra for Silicon Valley, and this time it's all about showing your work, writes BI's Tim Paradis.\n\nFrom Amazon helping managers track employees' time spent in the office to Meta keeping tabs on workers' AI usage, tech's corporate overlords are no longer going to take your word for it.\n\nThere's a not-so-subtle reason for this sudden interest in documentation. You might have heard me say this before, but companies are investing lots into AI, and the benefits aren't entirely clear. (JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon literally told analysts to just \"trust me.\")\n\nSo with investors breathing down execs' necks about their tech budgets, they're now looking for the humans to give them something to show for it. Add this to the growing list of ways AI ends up creating more work for employees.\n\nThis isn't just a Big Tech phenomenon. Citi CEO Jane Fraser, who is in the midst of her own \"Transformation,\" told workers in a recent memo that old habits won't fly anymore and everyone needs to step up their game.\n\nThere's a slightly less cynical way to look at this whole thing, one expert told Tim. Collecting all this data will help bosses better justify their workers' existence. (I only said it was slightly less cynical.)\n\nIt reminds me of an old coach I had. He'd tell us you shouldn't worry about getting yelled at. You should only panic when he stops yelling at you. That means he thinks you're a lost cause.\n\nThat might be true, but it sure didn't make wind sprints after practice easier.\n\nMetrics aren't a complete disaster for workers, but they could pose a risk to innovation.\n\nA clear sense of what your company expects from you can be beneficial, especially when you're looking for a raise. You asked me to produce X. I delivered X+1. Time to pay up. (Results may vary on that pitch.)\n\nGuidelines can be limiting though. Let's say you crack the code on hitting your assigned number. Are you willing to deviate from that strategy? Is the risk of not hitting your number worth the reward of trying something new?\n\nCreativity is rarely born from repetition. You often need to understand what doesn't work to figure out what will work. But if you're constantly being asked to show your worth, putting up a bunch of Ls, even if a W is around the corner, is a dangerous game.\n\nBesides, the executives are already taking enough risks for all of us.",

Based on a close look at two seemingly similar Chinese online-to-offline companies, this choice about how to view technology within an organization can have far reaching effects. In these two companies, the way technology was introduced, understood, and applied shaped organizational structure, how and with whom employees collaborate, and the roles managers take on.",

Which Did Better? by Jianjun Zhang and Bin LiJanuary 15, 2026PostPostShareSavePrintSummary.   Leer en españolLer em portuguêsPostPostShareSavePrintTraditionally, leaders and managers often treat technology as a tool or capability that can help get work done more efficiently, but doesn’t drastically change the nature of that work. Email, for instance, allows for faster communication. The supply chain management (SCM) system reduces supply chain costs, shortens delivery cycles, and ensures that products are delivered to customers quickly and accurately. Increasingly, however, this view is out of date. In recent years, the role of technology in shaping organizations has undergone revolutionary changes.",

    "fullText": "The most recent global market forecasts from Boeing and Airbus project demand for more than 43,000 new commercial aviation airplanes over the next two decades. But according to Aleksey Matyushev, co-founder and CEO of Natilus, the manufacturing titans may struggle to meet it.\n\nMatyushev estimated that Boeing and Airbus have the capacity to produce about 11,000 and 15,000 planes, respectively, in that timeframe. That leaves a gap of more than 17,000-one the Natilus CEO believes could be filled by the company's fuel-efficient, blended-wing body (BWB) design, Horizon.\n\nThis Article First Appeared in FLYING Magazine\n\nIf you're not already a subscriber, what are you waiting for? \n\n\"I think the airlines are now more than ever interested in new ways of thinking, both from a manufacturing and a fuel efficiency perspective,\" Matyushev told FLYING.\n\nHorizon, which Matyushev said will have capacity for about 200 passengers, is one of a handful of regional jet concepts that developers position as solutions to airlines' anticipated capacity crunch. Natilus claims it will burn 30 percent less fuel than traditional aircraft and slash emissions and operating costs in half.\n\nAnother BWB design, JetZero's 250-passenger Z4, promises fuel burn reductions as high as 50 percent.\n\nFor now, these are simply promises.\n\nFew BWB aircraft have advanced beyond the prototype and demonstration phase, and none have been developed to fly passengers. But major U.S. carriers such as United Airlines and Alaska Airlines-which have invested in and placed conditional orders with JetZero-are already exploring the technology.\n\nDelta Air Lines is even aiding JetZero's development of the Z4, a prototype of which is expected to fly for the U.S. Air Force in 2027 under a $235 million contract award.\n\n\"Airlines need to refleet to more efficient aircraft and buy planes to support growth,\" JetZero said. \"Passenger demand is forecasted to double from 2019 levels by 2040, and the industry has pledged to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It will take innovation to meet this demand.\"\n\nThe BWB is an offshoot of the tailless, all-wing aircraft concept, or flying wing, which dates back to the early days of aviation.\n\nIn the 1910s, German engineer Hugo Junkers patented a pure flying wing design-a board-like airframe that would house engines and crew. The U.S. military used tailless biplanes for training around the time of World War I. Later flying wing designs, such as Northrop's B-2A Spirit bomber, became well known.",

    "fullText": "In Mansion House speech, mayor will talk of opportunities technology offers but highlight mass unemployment risk\n\nSadiq Khan is to warn in a major speech that artificial intelligence (AI) could destroy swathes of jobs in London and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” unless ministers act now.\n\nIn his annual Mansion House speech, the London mayor will say the capital is “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.\n\nThe mayor will argue that “we have a moral, social and economic duty to act” to ensure that new jobs are created to replace those that will disappear, with entry-level and junior jobs the first to go.\n\nIn the speech on Thursday night, Khan will highlight research that suggests 70% of skills in the average job will have changed by 2030.\n\nHowever, he also sees huge potential benefits from AI for public services and productivity across the economy.\n\nWhen he addresses business leaders and bankers at Mansion House, the London mayor will say: “AI could enable us to transform our public services, turbocharge productivity and tackle some of our most complex challenges,” but used recklessly, will “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”. He will warn that the impact on the labour market will be “nothing short of colossal”.\n\nBut he will say that there is a clear choice: “seize the potential of AI and use it as a superpower for positive transformation and creation or surrender to it and sit back and watch as it becomes a weapon of mass destruction of jobs.”\n\nCity Hall is launching a London taskforce on AI and the future of work, with expertise from the government, businesses and the AI sector, to assess the potential impact of the new technology on London’s jobs market. It will also offer free AI training for Londoners.\n\nMore than half of workers in London expect AI to affect their jobs in some way in the next 12 months, according to City Hall polling.\n\nAcross the UK, up to 3m low-skilled jobs in trades, machine operations and admin roles could disappear by 2035 because of automation and AI, a report by the charity National Foundation for Educational Research found in November.\n\n“We can shape this next technological revolution and, if we are bold in our efforts, ensure AI makes us richer, not poorer, stronger, not weaker, more connected and more confident, and more capable of building a fairer, safer and more prosperous London for everyone,” Khan will say.\n\nHe will argue the UK and others have been too slow to respond to new technology in the past and that the growth of social media has led to a youth mental health crisis, a surge in online abuse and a dangerous rise in misinformation.\n\nSeparately, Susan Langley, major of the City of London, said on Thursday morning she had noticed that some finance workers were wary of coming to London from abroad because they worry about their safety.\n\nHowever, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The City of London is one of the safest cities in the world. There’s this perception that you’re going to step out of your office and be swept away in a tsunami of crime.\n\n“It’s completely wrong. Competition for investment is really fierce at the moment, and I think any kind of unfounded negative sentiment that’s being pushed out there really risks undermining the UK on the global stage, and we just can’t let it happen.”",
