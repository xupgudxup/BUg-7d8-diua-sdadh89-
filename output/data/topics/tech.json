    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yasmin Santos, a former Meta ad specialist and the founder of the herbal alcohol alternative brand Altar Native. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I stopped drinking in 2018, it was for my health, not my career. It turned out to be great for both.\n\nI gave up alcohol to heal a gut issue, thinking it would just be temporary. But when I was finally healthy enough to drink again, I realized something had shifted. My body no longer wanted it. The buzz wasn't fun; it just felt wrong.\n\nStill, I missed the ritual. I missed the ease alcohol could bring in social settings. At the same time, I was caring for my mother, who was bedridden with early-onset dementia. I could see how much pain she was in, and how the pharmaceuticals she relied on often did more harm than good. I prayed for another way and felt a clear answer: \"The plants are there for you.\"\n\nThat's when I discovered herbalism — and the vast world of plants that humans have used for thousands of years to support their well-being. I learned about kava, CBD, kratom, and damiana — each with different properties that our ancestors used to calm, energize, or restore balance. It was like opening a door into a forgotten world of natural solutions.\n\nI'd bring little dropper bottles to social gatherings, letting friends try my blends. The response was overwhelming. People wanted to know where they could buy them. That was in 2021, and the spark became my company, Altar Native.\n\nThrough 2022, I refined the branding and recipes, and by January 2024, we were officially launched. I started small, still freelancing in marketing to fund the business, and using an $11,000 inheritance from my mom as seed money.\n\nBefore I started selling the tinctures themselves, I'd tested the idea with a \"cater bar\" — a mobile alcohol-free bar I could take to festivals and private events. It helped me prove the concept and reach my first customers. Between the events and tincture sales, I've had a 115% growth rate in the year since, and I'm projecting that I'll reach months with six-figure sales in the next few years.\n\nWhat has surprised me most is our customer base. I thought my audience would be \"wellness girlies\" who are into yoga and Pilates. But our biggest fans turned out to be van lifers, surfers, climbers, and outdoor adventurers; the sort of people who want to connect deeply to nature and stay clear-headed doing it.\n\nOur second demographic emerged unexpectedly: professional men, aged 40 to 55, often high-level business professionals. They order our \"Adapt\" blend, which helps regulate cortisol and balance energy.\n\nThey don't want alcohol, but they still want something to take the edge off — and since I come from the same corporate background, I get it, and I know exactly how to create what they're looking for.\n\nWe're riding a wave. Since the pandemic, people have woken up to the reality that how they care for their bodies defines their quality of life. They're drinking less, questioning what they put in their systems, and searching for alternatives that help them feel good without dulling their senses.\n\nThat's where I see Altar Native: at the intersection of wellness and ritual, bridging ancient plant wisdom with modern life. I call it \"herbal mixology\": the art of crafting functional, plant-based blends that elevate your mood and state of mind, without the use of alcohol.\n\nOur tinctures can be mixed into mocktails, added to tea or sparkling water, or taken straight on the tongue. My personal routine includes our \"Ecstatic\" blend in the morning with cacao instead of coffee to keep me focused without the afternoon crash. I take \"Adapt\" throughout the day when I need balance, and \"Lucid\" at night to calm my nerves and stave off anxiety.\n\nI haven't taken on investors yet. I've bootstrapped everything — through Meta income, freelancing, and careful reinvestment. My goal is to scale sustainably, eventually moving into ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages while staying true to our values of intentionality and environmental stewardship.\n\nMy co-manufacturer in Pennsylvania handles extraction, bottling, labeling, and fulfillment — allowing me to focus on building the brand.\n\nI'd love to grow Altar Native into a major player in this space, and maybe even exit one day, if it means partnering with a company that shares our vision for conscious, plant-based living.\n\nI was in a sorority in college, and each graduating senior was given a paper plate superlative award based on their personality and habits. Mine was \"Most likely to sell a million-dollar business to 'Shark Tank.'\" We'll see!\n\nBut for now, I'm focused on being a steward of this idea: helping it grow, and helping others find natural ways to reconnect with themselves.\n\nBecause for me, this isn't just about business. It's about remembering what the earth has always offered us — and choosing to listen.",

    "title": "This Personalized Running Spreadsheet Is My Tech Upgrade of the Week",
    "description": "Use my template below, or grab a blank spreadsheet and start logging now.",
    "fullText": "There's something deeply satisfying about tracking your running progress in a spreadsheet you built yourself. No algorithm showing off other people's workouts, no concerns about what happens to your data if the company pivots or shuts down. Just you, your numbers, and a system designed exactly the way you want it. And when I wrote about this earlier this year, I received some truly heartwarming messages from runners who'd been thinking the same thing. So many of us runners are tired of relying on apps, and we're instead drawn to a simple, customizable spreadsheet.\n\nSure, there's no shortage of fitness tracking apps out there. Strava, Garmin Connect, Nike Run Club—they all have their strengths. But owning your own spreadsheet offers something different: complete control. You can design your system to match your specific training needs. I also appreciate the intentionality that gets introduced when you have to design your own tracking system.\n\nThere's also the simple economics. Spreadsheets are free. They don't have premium tiers, they don't expire when you stop paying, and they don't suddenly lock features you've been using for months. Plus, creating custom charts and graphs to visualize your progress becomes a matter of a few clicks rather than hoping the app updates to include the exact view you're looking for.\n\nThis is not the first spreadsheet I've shared with my Lifehacker community, but this might be my magnum opus: a running tracker that logs every workout, calculates weekly mileage automatically, visualizes training load over time, and helps me plan toward specific race goals. It's evolved over months of use, shaped by what actually matters when I lace up my shoes each morning.\n\nHere she is. If the idea of a spreadsheet appeals to you, but you hate my spreadsheet, that's fine! I'm not even crying about it! Let's take a look at how you can perfect your own DIY running tracker.\n\nThe key to a sustainable running spreadsheet is tracking what actually helps you without drowning in data entry. Here's what I've found worth logging:\n\nThe essentials: Date, distance, time, and pace. These four fields form the backbone of any useful running log. They let you calculate weekly mileage, monitor whether you're getting faster, and spot trends over time.\n\nThe context: Route or location, weather conditions, and how you felt during the run. These qualitative details help you understand the story behind the numbers. That slower pace might make sense when you remember it was 95 degrees, or you were running hills, or you resolved to run slower now in order to run faster later.\n\nThe training details: Type of run (easy, tempo, intervals, long run), elevation gain if relevant to your training, and any specific workout structure. This helps you ensure you're balancing different types of training rather than just logging junk miles.\n\nWhat I don't track: Every single calorie burned (those estimates are notoriously unreliable anyway).\n\nStart simple. Create columns for your essential data and add a few basic formulas: total weekly mileage, average pace for the week, maybe a running total for the month. Google Sheets and Excel both make this straightforward, and you can always add complexity later.\n\nConsider organizing with separate tabs for different purposes. I keep one tab as my main running log where each row represents a workout, another tab for monthly summaries that automatically calculate totals and averages, and a third for goal tracking where I can see my progress toward specific races or mileage targets.\n\nThe beauty of building your own system is that you can iterate. After a month of tracking, you'll notice what information you actually reference and what just clutters the spreadsheet. Maybe you thought you'd care about cadence but never look at that column, or perhaps you wish you'd been tracking which shoes you wore to monitor when they need replacing. Adjust accordingly.\n\nNumbers in rows tell one story, but charts and graphs reveal patterns you might otherwise miss. Create a simple line graph showing your weekly mileage over time and you'll instantly see when you're ramping up training, when you backed off for recovery, and whether your current volume is sustainable.\n\nI like having a few standard visualizations: a line chart of weekly mileage, a bar graph comparing monthly totals across the year, and a scatter plot showing the relationship between distance and pace to spot my comfortable running ranges. None of this requires advanced spreadsheet skills—most programs will generate decent charts automatically once you select your data.\n\nThe point here isn't to use my exact system, but to recognize that you can build something better suited to your needs than any one-size-fits-all app. Your training is unique to you—your goals, your schedule, your body, your definition of progress. Why not track it in a way that reflects that? Keep what works, discard what doesn't, and enjoy this life upgrade.",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "fullText": "Chinese robotics players are emerging as a major force at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026), with a strong presence of humanoid robots set to take place in Las Vegas from January 4 to 9.\n\nMore than a dozen companies from China will exhibit at the event, joined by a record-sized delegation from Hong Kong.\n\nExpected participants include Unitree Robotics, AgiBot, Galbot, EngineAI, Noetix Robotics, and the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Centre, also known as X-Humanoid, reports China online media outlets. Hangzhou-based Unitree plans to showcase its \"next-generation humanoids\", while AgiBot will present its full product lineup.\n\nLast week, Chinese robotics firm UBTech reached a key milestone by producing its 1,000th Walker S2 humanoid robot at its Liuzhou manufacturing facility.\n\nChina's advances in humanoid robotics are no longer confined to research centers or industrial labs.\n\nIn Beijing, humanoid machines are now appearing in retail environments next to common consumer products, highlighting how quickly the technology is entering everyday commerce. This shift from experimentation to commercialization is set to gain international attention at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, where China's growing influence in the sector will be prominently on display.\n\nOfficial CES figures show that Chinese companies make up the majority of exhibitors in the humanoid robotics category this year. Of the 38 companies participating, 21 are from China, giving the country more than half of the total presence.\n\nThe group includes well-known names such as Unitree Robotics, alongside newcomers like AgiBot and Noetix Robotics, many of which are using the event to pursue international expansion, reports Ajupress.\n\nThe size and diversity of China's showing highlights its growing influence in a sector widely viewed as a critical intersection of advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence.\n\nIndustry analysts note that the number of exhibitors suggests a broad, coordinated effort to establish leadership before the global humanoid market fully takes shape.\n\nChina's advantage is also evident in intellectual property and production capability. Over the past five years, Chinese entities have filed 7,705 humanoid-related patents, compared with 1,561 in the United States, according to a December report by Morgan Stanley. At the same time, Chinese manufacturers are pushing rapidly toward large-scale production, reinforcing their lead beyond research and design, reports Ajupress.\n\nChinese technology companies registered a major presence at CES 2026, with robotics, AI, and consumer electronics set to dominate their showcases.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), Unitree sales manager Pedro Zheng invited visitors via LinkedIn last month to \"experience\" the company's next-generation humanoid robots at the event. Hangzhou-based Unitree previously drew attention at CES with a range of humanoid and quadruped robots, underscoring the rapid expansion of its product lineup.\n\nAgiBot, founded by former Huawei \"Genius Youth\" recruit Peng Zhihui, has also confirmed its participation. In a post on X, the Shanghai-based company said it would present its full product portfolio and industry-leading solutions.\n\nFounding partner Yao Maoqing told the Global Times that the showcase reflects AgiBot's ambition to build an ecosystem of humanoid robots capable of operating across industries, environments, and everyday life, moving beyond single-task machines toward embodied intelligence.\n\nChinese firms will face competition from global players such as Boston Dynamics, now owned by South Korean automaker Hyundai. Boston Dynamics announced last month that its new Atlas humanoid robot will make its public debut at CES 2026, according to SCMP.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Br0hD6jUw&pp=ygUdcm9ib3QgaW50ZXJlc3RpbmcgZW5naW5lZXJpbmfSBwkJTQoBhyohjO8%3D\n\nThe Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center will display several Tiangong Walker models, highlighting full autonomy and \"one-brain, many-machines\" coordination for industrial sorting and heavy-duty tasks. Booster Robotics will showcase its Booster K1 and T1 platforms, focusing on multitasking, scenario-ready robotic systems, according to the Global Times.\n\nBeyond robotics, Chinese smart eyewear makers Rokid, Even Realities, and XReal are expected to exhibit, alongside robot vacuum cleaner brands Dreame Technology and Roborock. Lenovo Group will host its largest-ever Tech World event at CES as part of its \"Hybrid AI\" strategy, featuring speakers including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan.\n\nHong Kong will also send its largest CES delegation to date, with 60 tech companies showcasing innovations across AI, health, smart cities, and sports technology.",

    "description": "Here are the highlights from the world's largest technology trade show happening in Las Vegas, including a new Nvidia chip architecture.",
    "fullText": "The tech scene is starting the year off strong.\n\nOn January 6, the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest and most influential technology trade show, is set to kick off in Las Vegas.\n\nA CES keynote presentation of a new chip from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang already got the show started.\n\nBased on early announcements, the audience can expect novelties this year like the Sweekar AI pet that physically grows, robots that can bend backwards, and a wallpaper TV that is only 0.35 inches thick. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee is also on the scene to report on the latest autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nFollow this post over the rest of the week to keep up with the most groundbreaking tech at the 2026 CES.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang officially introduced the Vera Rubin architecture, which is now in production and expected to ramp up in volume in the second half of the year. This move follows a blockbuster year for its Blackwell chip, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.\n\nIn a press briefing ahead of Huang's keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as \"six chips that make one AI supercomputer.\"\n\n\"Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,\" Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.\n\nHuang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.\n\nRubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.\n\nNamed after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.\n\nThe Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including Amazon Web Services, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.\n\nThe accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.\n\nHuang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.\n\nNvidia's Huang also used his presentation to unveil Alpamayo, a new open AI model and toolset designed to bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHuang said that Mercedes-Benz cars powered by the system are already expected to hit the road in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" said Huang.\n\nAlpamayo is Nvidia's first full-stack push into self-driving technology, with the goal of using vision-language-action models to handle rare and unfamiliar driving scenarios.\n\nMercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said during the presentation that he recently tested the Nvidia-powered system on public roads and drove for more than an hour through heavy traffic.\n\n\"It feels that the car is on rails. You're just driving, and it does everything,\" Källenius said. \"If you're moving an object that weighs 4,000 pounds at 50 miles an hour, sorry is not going to cut it.\"\n\nBoston Dynamics is teaming up with Google DeepMind to integrate the Gemini AI into its humanoid robot, Atlas, and its robot dog called Spot. Unveiled with Boston Dynamics's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, at CES on Monday, the partnership aims to let Atlas understand natural-language commands, adapt on the fly, and interact more naturally with people, with the goal of pushing the machine from lab demos into real-world work.\n\nExecutives of Boston Dynamics said in a press release that by embedding a foundation model, Atlas could move beyond preprogrammed actions to navigating unfamiliar environments and identifying and manipulating objects, all of which are core skills for manual labor.\n\n\"Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works,\" said CEO Robert Playter in the press release, \"And it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children—useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling.\"",

    "fullText": "A photo of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in US custody may have turned him into an accidental fashion influencer.\n\nWhen US President Donald Trump posted a photo of Maduro on January 3 after he was captured by US forces, internet sleuths quickly identified the outfit — and haven't stopped talking about it since. Maduro appears to be wearing a gray Nike Tech fleece set in the picture.\n\nFollowing the January 3 post, searches for \"Nike Tech\" on Google spiked, according to Google Trends.\n\nThe online conversations about the athleisure line also surged dramatically on X, intelligence platform PeakMetrics told Business Insider. Nike Tech was mentioned in over 5,000 X posts a day between January 3 and January 5, according to PeakMetrics. That's up from the roughly 325 posts a day it averaged from November 1 to December 31.\n\nOn TikTok, users posted AI-generated versions of the photo and poked fun at the fashion choice. Some users joked that it was a new Nike campaign. Others made \"steal the look\" posts that broke down the cost of the full outfit, including the darkened eye mask and ear covering. The jacket and joggers cost over $200 combined.\n\nVENEZUELAN PRESIDENT PUT IN NIKE TECH,SHIPPED TO NEW YORKI #venezuela #president #fyp #news #update\n\nAs of Monday morning, the style of the Nike Tech fleece zip-up jacket that Maduro was photographed in was sold out on Nike's US website in several sizes.\n\nThe fleece jacket already appeared to be a hot item before Maduro donned it on the Navy ship USS Iwo Jima. It appeared to be partially sold out in November and December, according to screenshots archived on Wayback Machine.\n\nIt's been the subject of a viral debate in recent weeks, with some young men bragging on social media about being \"team Nike Tech\" or \"team quarter-zip\" to show whether they're a part of Corporate America or not.\n\nSome members of Gen Z and Gen Alpha also had their eyes on Nike Tech for the holidays. A clip of a girl opening her Christmas gift, a Nike Tech set, garnered over 1 million likes on TikTok and earned a comment from Nike itself.\n\nNike also made its way onto teens' wish lists this year, and it dominated Piper Sandler's semi-annual teen survey as the No. 1 clothing brand in fall 2025.\n\nMaduro, the longtime Venezuelan leader, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in an overnight raid in Caracas over the weekend and taken to the US, where Maduro faces federal charges.",

    "description": "Small drones are \"the defining threat of our time,\" Brig. Gen. Ross said, requiring a layered defense network to stop them.",
    "fullText": "The US military is racing to develop better defenses against drones, but there's no silver bullet, no wonder weapon, that will single-handedly defeat everything, the commander of the Pentagon's new counter-drone force said.\n\nJoint Interagency Task Force 401 says stopping drones isn't about one weapon or system. The counter-drone fight will require a mix of different tools, from ways to physically shoot down drones to electronic and other non-kinetic solutions.\n\nIt also demands easier, faster processes for testing and buying systems across the services.\n\nThe task force was created last fall to expedite counter-drone technologies across the Department of Defense, replacing the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, which was established in 2019. Since its establishment, the task force has assessed and contributed to the US military's counter-drone arsenal, including forces at home and abroad.\n\nBut there's no one system they've found that can stop small uncrewed aerial systems, or UAS, which the task force's commander, Brig. Gen. Matt Ross, called \"the defining threat of our time.\"\n\n\"There's no silver bullet for counter-UAS. There's just not,\" Ross said last month at a media roundtable. \"If there was, we would already have it,\" he added.\n\nInstead, the task force is focused on a suite of technologies for layered, integrated protection from drones. \"Our formations must be able to detect, track, identify, and defeat these systems anywhere on the planet,\" Ross said. \"This requires us to layer our defenses by integrating sensors with kinetic and non-kinetic effectors and battle management systems into a responsive, interoperable network.\"\n\nHe said that many defense technologies already exist for countering medium-sized drones, which the Pentagon classifies as Group 3, but more work remains in smaller drones under Group 1 and 2, UAS such as the quadcopters that dominate in Ukraine.\n\nAnd the counter-drone problem isn't just about what systems are needed to protect service members and civilians. \"The technology is not going to solve this problem for us. We can't field a system that will stop every drone. It will all come down to the installation commander or the person responsible for that site and how they use the tools that we provide them,\" Ross said.\n\nIn its first 100 days, the task force has identified a key goal: creating a shared command-and-control system that makes it easier for different teams and regions to share data. It also wants to build a marketplace where the military services, law enforcement, and other agencies can find counter-drone systems suited to their specific threats, review performance data and user feedback, and potentially buy those systems in one place.\n\nThe task force notably isn't operating in isolation. There's overlap between the task force's focus on stopping Group 3 drones, systems like Shield AI's V-BAT or the Army's AAI RQ-7, and the responsibilities of the Golden Dome missile defense project, which has to include defenses for Group 3 drones.\n\nThe task force plans to share data with the Golden Dome project, and Ross said he's currently discussing what that looks like with Space Force's Gen. Michael Guetlein.\n\nAnother priority for the task force is helping protect against small drones at major events, including the FIFA World Cup this year, with matches set to be held at 11 large stadiums in cities across the US.\n\nRoss said that based on US forces overseas, \"we're heavily indexed against Group 3 systems, and those are larger systems that fly a longer distance and carry heavier payloads. And I want to make sure that we have just as robust protection against Group 1 and Group 2 systems that are smaller and much more likely to be seen over a widely attended gathering, stadium, or a watch party specifically for the World Cup.\"",

    "fullText": "Higher Education\n\n AI Nudges Syracuse Professors Back Toward Blue Books, In-Class Work\n\n To prevent students from relying on artificial intelligence to write and do homework for them, many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments and having students finish essays in class.\n\n December 23, 2025 • \n Emalyn Muzzy, syracuse.com\n\n Facebook\n\n LinkedIn\n\n Twitter\n\nPrint\n\n Email\n\n (TNS) — Oksana Korol remembers her parents telling her how they took oral exams in college. Professors would give them a problem to solve. They had 10 minutes to think it through, then explain their answer and reasoning.\n\n“That is completely AI-proof,” said Korol, a biology professor at Onondaga Community College.\n\nKorol, like countless other professors in Central New York, has had to change the way she teaches her class and assesses students’ learning due to the ballooning use of generative artificial intelligence. Many, like her, are relying on those old-school techniques to AI-proof their tests and papers.\n\nAs AI continues to push itself into our everyday lives, it has created a culture of do or die for higher education. Professors have to either adapt their classes or risk students using AI to avoid thinking through tough assignments. Universities can offer courses teaching students to think critically about AI or assume young minds already know how to ask tough questions.\n\nIf higher education as a whole does not adapt, it could be left behind as students embrace AI in their studies.\n\nAt the three largest educational institutions in Syracuse — Syracuse University, Le Moyne College and Onondaga Community College — many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments while students use AI to study in futuristic ways.\n\nOCC and SU student handbooks outline how using AI to complete entire assignments and papers is considered plagiarism or academic misconduct. Le Moyne College does not have a college-wide AI policy, although Provost Jim Hannan said the institution is starting the process to create guidance.\n\nWithout uniform guidance from school leadership, it’s often up to professors to figure out how to handle AI. Some professors spend free time teaching themselves how to wield AI in a productive manner. Others side-eye the technology.\n\nAll of them, however, must understand how it impacts their students’ learning.\n\n“We have to learn how to use (AI) first. That arms race is exhausting and overwhelming when our workloads, admittedly, are already pretty heavy,” said OCC professor Michelle Malinovsky.\n\nIN-CLASS ASSESSMENTS MAKE A RETURN\nWhen a student uses an AI prompt generator to write a research paper, there are signs the student didn’t do it themselves. Malinovsky said older AI versions used the same rhetoric model. Le Moyne English professor Ann Ryan said a student’s paper may be too clean.\n\nThere is no true way to prove a student used AI, unless the student accidentally leaves their prompt in the paper or admits to it, said Rubin.\n\nWhile there are AI detection software, most don’t work, Rubin and Malinovsky said. For that reason, SU and OCC do not recommend using the programs.\n\n“It’s incredibly inaccurate. It’s always reactionary and it causes a huge issue in terms of equity and bias,” Malinovsky said.\n\nSU, Le Moyne and OCC either encourage or require professors to decide how they want students to use AI. They each have three similar pre-made policies professors can put into their syllabuses.\n\nThe policies state that AI cannot be used under any circumstance, students can use limited AI or AI can be used freely within reason.\n\n“It’s a first step of allowing faculty to think about the use and letting students know how an individual faculty member plans to allow or not allow on assessment in the classroom,” said SU Chief Digital Officer Jeff Rubin.\n\nWith the traditional research paper becoming harder to assign, many professors are flipping the classroom. For example, Ryan has students writing in class and brainstorming with classmates.\n\n“I’m workshopping papers in class as students are writing them. Traditionally in a literature class you’d say, ‘You got a 12-page paper due in three weeks,’” Ryan said. “So what we’re doing is we’re writing papers in class.”\n\nMalinovsky, who teaches English and is also a librarian, said she has implemented similar practices. She encourages students to send pictures of handwritten assignments.\n\n“(AI) challenges professors to rethink the assessment. Perhaps if they’re worried about AI use, then bring some of that assessment back into the classroom,” Rubin said.\n\nProfessors have also started to make work more reflective. For Ryan’s class, students had to add a one-to-two page coda on how what they learned in class impacted them to their final paper. They then shared that reflection with the class.\n\nLearning assessments appear to be returning to traditional, in-person techniques. Korol said she has done away with online exams and implemented more in-class tests.\n\n“I think that we’re back to the blue books and we’re maybe going back to the oral exams,” Korol at OCC said.\n\nEven with the potential for misuse, AI can be a powerful tool if harnessed correctly. While assessments embrace older techniques, study strategies are flying forward.\n\nMultiple professors said they see students upload class slides or paste class notes into a chatbot and ask it to create study tools like a practice quiz or study questions. Anthropic , the creator of AI bot Claude,analyzed student chatsand found they also use it to troubleshoot coding problems or synthesize complex information.\n\nKorol has gone one step farther and created a prototype AI tutor, where she uploads questions for students to answer. The AI tutor knows not just the correct answer but the important ideas behind it, meaning students can express the answers in different ways.\n\n“The tutor has been specifically told not to give out the answer, and instead it’s been told to keep asking leading questions. And if you read through this conversation, you will see that the hints are getting more and more transparent as we go along,” Korol said.\n\nKorol has not yet used the tutor with students but is trying to figure out how to deploy the app for campus-wide use.\n\nTEACHING ABOUT AI\nSU is taking AI education one step further: it has begun offering classes and a minor about the impact of AI. Beginning in fall 2026, the Maxwell School of Public Affairs will offer the AI Policy minor. Classes include programming and public policy analysis.\n\nThe idea is not to teach students how to create or use AI, but rather to think critically about its real world applications, said program director Johannes Himmelreich.\n\n“AI is going to have significant social impact. This will create policy challenges that require an understanding of the technology as well as the policy analysis skills,” Himmelreich said.\n\nMalinovsky described generative AI as the “wild west.” There are no specific federal regulations on AI, with regulators instead relying on a patchwork of laws. On Dec. 11, President Donald Trump put out an executive order blocking states from creating their own regulations.\n\nHimmelreich wants students to be able to tackle topics such as how to grow AI without destroying the environment, how AI could impact warfare or if AI could be conscious enough to deserve rights.\n\nThe idea of a minor exploring AI has been under discussion since 2020, a couple years before the public explosion of generative AI.\n\n“ChatGPT wasn’t a technological surprise at all. I mean, I’ve been in demos that OpenAI gave for the older models that weren’t a chat interface. And the difference is that OpenAI changed its policy around how accessible they want the technology to be,” Himmelreich said.\n\nThinking critically about AI is a core part of Milton Santiago’s Generative AI Filmmaking class. He launched the three-credit course this past fall, teaching students how to use generative AI in filmmaking while also discussing its impact.\n\n“We can intercept a lot of the ethical and moral questions that surround these tools currently, which actually I think is probably the biggest benefit of the class,” Santiago said. “Students do have to wrestle with questions of where does creativity begin and end? What does authorship actually look like? Is the environmental impact as this technology stands today worth using the tools?”\n\nTeaching about AI is not only happening in classes or studies surrounding the topic. Malinovsky said she talks about AI a lot in her English classes. To help her students better understand why they need to do their own work, she sometimes has students do the work themselves then ask an AI chatbot to do the work. Then the students compare and discuss.\n\nAs generative AI continues to develop, faculty are learning how to use it along with students. Some, like Ryan, are skeptical of its application and try to avoid it while others, like Santiago , spend hours figuring out the best application for students.\n\n“This has shaken up what education does in a way that other technologies haven’t,” Hannan said.",

    "description": "As more workers use AI, a recent study adds to growing evidence the tech doesn’t always deliver on promises of boosted productivity.",
    "fullText": "Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture.\n\nIt’s like a new telling of the “Tortoise and the Hare”: A group of experienced software engineers entered into an experiment where they were tasked with completing some of their work with the help of AI tools. Thinking like the speedy hare, the developers expected AI to expedite their work and increase productivity. Instead, the technology slowed them down more. The AI-free tortoise approach, in the context of the experiment, would have been faster.\n\nThe results of this experiment, part of a recent study, came as a surprise to the software developers tasked with using AI—and to the study’s authors, Joel Becker and Nate Rush, technical staff members of nonprofit technology research organization Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR).\n\nThe researchers enlisted 16 software developers, who had an average of five years of experience, to conduct 246 tasks, each one a part of projects on which they were already working. For half the tasks, the developers were allowed to use AI tools—most of them selected code editor Cursor Pro or Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet—and for the other half, the developers conducted the tasks on their own.\n\nBelieving the AI tools would make them more productive, the software developers predicted the technology would reduce their task completion time by an average of 24%. Instead, AI resulted in their task time ballooning to 19% greater than when they weren’t using the technology.\n\n“While I like to believe that my productivity didn’t suffer while using AI for my tasks, it’s not unlikely that it might not have helped me as much as I anticipated or maybe even hampered my efforts,” Philipp Burckhardt, a participant in the study, wrote in a blog post about his experience.\n\nSo where did the hares veer off the path? The experienced developers, in the midst of their own projects, likely approached their work with plenty of additional context their AI assistants did not have, meaning they had to retrofit their own agenda and problem-solving strategies into the AI’s outputs, which they also spent ample time debugging, according to the study.\n\n“The majority of developers who participated in the study noted that even when they get AI outputs that are generally useful to them—and speak to the fact that AI generally can often do bits of very impressive work, or sort of very impressive work—these developers have to spend a lot of time cleaning up the resulting code to make it actually fit for the project,” study author Rush told Fortune.\n\nOther developers lost time writing prompts for the chatbots or waiting around for the AI to generate results.\n\nThe results of the study contradict lofty promises about AI’s ability to transform the economy and workforce, including a 15% boost to U.S. GDP by 2035 and eventually a 25% increase in productivity.  In fact, many companies have yet to see a return on AI investments. An MIT report published in August found out of 300 AI deployments, only 5% achieved rapid revenue acceleration.  Only 6% of companies fully trust AI to run core business practices, according to a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services research report published last month.\n\nBut Rush and Becker have shied away from making sweeping claims about what the results of their study mean for the future of AI.\n\nFor one, the study’s sample was small and non-generalizable, including only a specialized group of people to whom these AI tools were brand new. The study also measures technology at a specific moment in time, the authors said, not ruling out the possibility that AI tools could be developed in the future that would indeed help developers enhance their workflow.\n\nThe purpose of the study was, broadly speaking, to pump the brakes on the torrid implementation of AI in the workplace and elsewhere, acknowledging more data about AI’s actual effects need to be made known and accessible before more decisions are made about its applications.\n\n“Some of the decisions we’re making right now around development and deployment of these systems are potentially very high consequence,” Rush said. “If we’re going to do that, let’s not just take the obvious answer. Let’s make high-quality measurements.”\n\nEconomists have already asserted that METR’s research aligns with broader narratives on AI and productivity. While AI is beginning to chip away at entry-level positions, according to LinkedIn chief economic opportunity officer Aneesh Raman, it may offer diminishing returns for skilled workers such as experienced software developers.\n\n“For those people who have already had 20 years, or in this specific example, five years of experience, maybe it’s not their main task that we should look for and force them to start using these tools if they’re already well functioning in the job with their existing work methods,” Anders Humlum, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, told Fortune.\n\nHumlum has similarly conducted research on AI’s impact on productivity. He found in a working study from May that among 25,000 workers in 7,000 workplaces in Denmark—a country with similar AI uptake as the U.S.—productivity improved a modest 3% among employees using the tools.\n\nHumlum’s research supports MIT economist and Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu’s assertion that markets have overestimated productivity gains from AI. Acemoglu argues only 4.6% of tasks within the U.S. economy will be made more efficient with AI.\n\n“In a rush to automate everything, even the processes that shouldn’t be automated, businesses will waste time and energy and will not get any of the productivity benefits that are promised,” Acemoglu previously wrote for Fortune. “The hard truth is that getting productivity gains from any technology requires organizational adjustment, a range of complementary investments, and improvements in worker skills, via training and on-the-job learning.”\n\nThe case of the software developers’ hampered productivity points to this need for critical thought on when AI tools are implemented, Humlum said. While previous research on AI productivity has looked at self-reported data or specific and contained tasks, data on challenges from skilled workers using the technology complicate the picture.\n\n“In the real world, many tasks are not as easy as just typing into ChatGPT,” Humlum said. “Many experts have a lot of experience [they’ve] accumulated that is highly beneficial, and we should not just ignore that and give up on that valuable expertise that has been accumulated.”\n\n“I would just take this as a good reminder to be very cautious about when to use these tools,” he added.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 20, 2025.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "title": "Meet Dario Amodei, Anthropic's outspoken CEO",
    "description": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei doesn't seem to mind angering tech CEOs, whether it's with his warnings about AI or pushing export controls.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei doesn't mince words.\n\nHe's rankled some rival tech CEOs by boldly predicting that AI could wipe out half of entry-level, white-collar jobs and that the upheaval could happen between now and the next five years.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, I warn about these things not to be a prophet of doom, but because warning about them is the first step towards solving them,\" Amodei said in December during The New York Times' DealBook Summit.\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Amodei still has a lot to warn about. By his own admission, the longtime AI researcher turned executive has said his vision for the future has led some to dismiss him as a \"doomer,\" even as he thinks AI could unlock a 150-year lifespan.\n\n\"Actual people who are building the technology, they're excited about the potential, but they're also worried,\" he said during the December event. \"They're worried about the national security risks. They're worried about alignment of the models; they're worried about the economic impacts of the models.\"\n\nUnder Amodei's leadership, Anthropic, once the underdog of the AI startups, is poised to remain a major part of the race.\n\nHere's a look at Amodei's life and career so far.\n\nDario Amodei was born in 1983 in San Francisco to Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei. A few years later, his sister Daniela, who would later help him cofound Anthropic in 2021, followed. Engel worked on library renovation and construction projects. Amodei's father was a leatherworker raised in a small town near the Italian island of Elba.\n\nDespite growing up in what became Big Tech's cradle, Amodei said he was much more interested in hard sciences. His sister said Amodei's intelligence was apparent from an early age. She told Bloomberg that her brother would declare \"counting days,\" seeing how high he could go.\n\n\"It'd be like a whole day,\" she said. \"What kind of 3-year-old has that attention span?\"\n\nAfter attending Lowell High School, Amodei studied physics at Caltech before transferring to Stanford to complete his degree. He was pursuing a graduate degree at Princeton when Riccardo Amodei died from a rare illness. His father's death was a seminal moment, tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz wrote. Amodei shifted from studying theoretical physics to biophysics. Amodei told Kantrowitz that the survival rate of his father's illness improved rapidly in just a few years after his death.\n\nIt's a lesson that Anthropic's CEO said remains with him.\n\n\"I get really angry when someone's like, 'This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down,'\" Amodei told Kantrowitz, who writes the Big Techology newsletter. \"You heard what I just said, my father died because of cures that could have happened a few years [earlier]. I understand the benefit of this technology.\"\n\nIn 2011, Amodei obtained a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton. During postdoctoral research at Stanford, Amodei told Kantrowitz that he saw how artificial intelligence could help researchers like him tackle questions in biology that seemed \"beyond human scale.\" In 2014, Andrew Ng, a computer science professor at Stanford and cofounder of Coursera, recruited Amodei to join him at Baidu, a Chinese search engine.\n\nWhile working on speech recognition systems at Baidu, Amodei said he got the inclination of AI scaling, the theory that by increasing everything feeding into AI, the performance improves.\n\n\"I noticed that the models started to do better and better as you gave them more data, as you made the models larger, as you trained them for longer,\" Amodei told podcaster Lex Fridman in 2024. \"And I didn't measure things precisely in those days, but along with colleagues, we very much got the informal sense that the more data and the more compute and the more training you put into these models, the better they perform.\"\n\nElon Musk and Sam Altman, then friends, assembled a group of leading AI thinkers for a dinner at a Menlo Park hotel. Musk, Wired later reported, wanted to know if it was too late for a rival AI lab to rise to challenge Google, planting the seeds for what would become OpenAI.\n\nAmodei, who, according to Kantrowitz, was at the dinner, elected to join Google instead. While at Google, Amodei published well-regarded research laying out potential concerns for AI advancements. But after just 10 months at the tech giant, Amodei left for OpenAI.\n\nAt OpenAI, Amodei played a big role in the development of GPT-2 and 3, the startup's large language models. His experience galvanized his belief in the power of scaling, but it also reinforced he desire to tie AI advacements to safety.\n\n\"You don't tell the models what their values are just by pouring more compute into them,\" Amodei told Fortune in 2023. \"And so there were a set of people who believed in those two ideas.\"\n\nOver time, Amodei said he lost faith that OpenAI's leaders shared his beliefs. In 2020, after rising to become OpenAI's vice president of research, Amodei quit.\n\nThe breakup remains a major point of conversation around Silicon Valley.\n\nDuring the December event, Amodei took multiple perceived swipes at Altman, even as he repeatedly refused to directly name OpenAI's CEO.\n\nAmodei said that Anthropic was cautiously trying to thread the needle between the enormous investment required for data center construction and the risk of overextending itself. In contrast, he said others in AI are \"yoloing and who pull the risk dial too far.\"\n\nThe most clear potential shot at Altman came after Amodei was asked about the OpenAI CEO's decision to declare a \"code red\" to employees amid fears that ChatGPT was losing its edge.\n\n\"We have a little bit of a privileged position where we can just keep growing and just keep developing our models, and we don't have to do any code reds,\" Amodei said.\n\nWith seven other former OpenAI employees, Amodei cofounded Anthropic in 2021. It was a close-knit group. One of the cofounders, Daniela Amodei, is Dario's sister. Some of them had even roomed together, dating back to their time in a shared house when they all worked at OpenAI.\n\nInside Silicon Valley, there were doubts that a new startup could catch up to OpenAI. Just over two years in, Anthropic reached unicorn status.\n\nAmodei told Time Magazine that by the summer of 2022, Anthropic had finished training its chatbot, Claude. However, the company held back from releasing it. OpenAI, Amodei's now-rival, released ChatGPT months later.\n\n\"I suspect it was the right thing to do,\" Amodei told the magazine in 2024, when Time named Anthropic one of its most influential companies and put him on the cover. \"But it's not totally clear-cut.\"\n\nAnthropic launched Claude almost a year after ChatGPT's release. The startup's bot still won praise. Over time, it has built up a devoted following, particularly for its coding ability.\n\nUnlike OpenAI, Anthropic is largely devoted to businesses and not consumer AI. In May, Reuters reported that Anthropic is making $3 billion in annualized revenue, a significant jump.\n\nIn 2025, Amodei, his sister Daniela, and the rest of the cofounders were all minted billionaires based on the company's valuation. Forbes estimates that Amodei is worth roughly $3.7 billion, as of mid-December.\n\nAmodei said that Anthropic's focus on enterprise clients has created a \"durable\" revenue stream with \"better margins\" than competitors who are more focused on consumer products.\n\n\"We're trying to manage that risk well while also buying an amount of compute that allows us to be competitive with the other players,\" he said during the December event. \"We're very efficient in training, we're very efficient in inference. We have good margins. I think we can manage it. I think the odds are on our side.\"\n\nIn November, Anthropic announced it would spend $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute, a deal that also positioned it as the first model to be available on the three largest clouds. As part of the agreement, Anthropic is set to receive up to $5 billion from Microsoft and up to $10 billion from Nvidia.\n\nAmodei later said that partnering with Nvidia hasn't changed his view that its CEO Jensen Huang is mistaken in his view that US companies should sell advanced chips to China.\n\n\"This isn't personal, this is a policy question,\" Amodei said. \"This is a question of how best to defend our national security.\"\n\nOther views have also put Amodei up against his competitors and even the White House. In October, AI czar David Sacks, accused Anthropic of \"running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.\" Amodei said that Sacks' claims were \"inaccurate.\"\n\nNotably, Amodei has not changed his opposition to a White House-favored federal preemption of state-level AI laws. Some Republicans in Congress have attempted to pass a 10-year moratorium into law, although the policy has split even within their own party.\n\n\"It's like saying, I'm driving a car, I'm going to rip out the steering wheel because I don't need to steer for 10 years,\" Amodei said in December.",

    "description": "Maddy Zhang spent over four years at Google. She shared five tips for getting into Big Tech, from referrals to technical interviews.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech can seem impenetrable. This Google alum has some tips for getting your foot in the door.\n\nMaddy Zhang spent over four years working as a software engineer for Google, touching both the search and advertising businesses. She now works at Airbnb, per her LinkedIn, and previously held internships at Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft.\n\nOn the \"A Life Engineered\" podcast, Zhang shared five tips for landing a job at Google or one of its competitors.\n\nFirst, she recommended applying to jobs early — as in, within hours of the openings being posted.\n\n\"Because there's so much competition, it's honestly an employer's market,\" Zhang said. \"If you wait a day, probably there's going to be hundreds of applicants for it.\"\n\nWhile the recruiter is supposed to look at all of the applications, they'll likely look at the first batch and ignore the rest, she said.\n\nApplying quickly can help you land a job, LinkedIn data shows. Responding quickly helps too: US job seekers who reply to a prospective employer's message within 24 hours are 4.1 times as likely to get hired and 6.7 times as likely to get an interview, according to Indeed.\n\nNext, she advised getting referred by a current employee. Zhang's friends who have applied with referrals had a higher success rate, she said. But that doesn't mean ask anyone on LinkedIn to support you.\n\n\"If you don't actually have a connection with them, it's not going to help,\" she said.\n\nWhile a good résumé or referral might get you through the recruiter's initial pass, applicants must then pass a technical interview. Many engineers prepare using LeetCode — a tool Zhang said was still valuable.\n\n\"I know no one really likes it,\" she said. \"It's a necessary evil.\"\n\nZhang recommended doing a mix of easy, medium, and hard LeetCode problems. When you get stuck, she advised not just looking at the answer, but retyping and running the solution.\n\nIt's easy to think that Google is filled to the brim with Stanford graduates. That wasn't Zhang's experience, though. Her next piece of advice: Don't underestimate yourself based on your school.\n\nMost of Zhang's friends didn't go to \"good computer science schools,\" she said. Many attended state schools or community colleges before transferring.\n\n\"As you progress forward in your career, your school matters less and less,\" she said.\n\nEven with the best application, interview prep, and referrals, there's no guarantee of a job. That's Zhang's final piece of advice: remember it's a numbers game.\n\nZhang said that she had been rejected hundreds of times. When she was younger, those rejections made her want to give up on the industry. She's since learned that it's not personal.\n\n\"Maybe I had a bad day, maybe the interviewer had more qualified candidates, maybe there's something I couldn't control,\" Zhang said.\n\n\"Rejection is nothing on who you are as a software engineer.\"",

    "title": "Cloud outages 2025: how global businesses survived blackouts",
    "description": "Entrepreneurs and tech workers from around the world describe how they navigated the many cloud outages in 2025.",
    "fullText": "November 18 was supposed to be a routine workday for Rwanda-based entrepreneur Derrick Ikenga. But it turned out to be a nightmare he wasn’t prepared for.\n\nCloudflare, a U.S.-based cloud services and cybersecurity firm, faced a massive global outage that day, taking down large parts of the internet, including operations of giants like X (formerly Twitter) and ChatGPT.\n\nIkenga’s company, which builds sales automation tools for clients, also uses Cloudflare. The outage brought the tools to a grinding halt, sending his clients into panic mode.\n\nFor many entrepreneurs and tech workers, this was a familiar experience in 2025. Today, an estimated 94% of enterprise services worldwide rely on at least one major cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, for hosting, data storage, or delivery. Together, the three largest providers control more than 62% of the global cloud market.\n\nBetween August 2024 and August 2025, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud together experienced more than 100 service outages. The duration of these outages varied between a few minutes and several hours. AWS saw one of the biggest and most widespread cloud outages of 2025 when its services went down for 15 hours in October. The outage affected over 4 million users and more than 1,000 companies.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, cloud service providers are responsible for restoring services as soon as possible. In some cases, providers compensate affected customers with free cloud credit.\n\nEach time such disruptions occurred, everyday moments began to fail in unexpected ways. Online payments failed. Doctors were unable to access patients’ health records. CCTV cameras went offline. Doorbells stopped working. Smart mattresses lost their sleep-tracking features.\n\nThe outage offered a glimpse into just how deeply cloud infrastructure is woven into modern life, powering everything from bank transfers to flight bookings and movie streams.\n\nRest of World brings together first-person accounts from entrepreneurs and technology workers around the world, tracing what happened when the cloud failed in 2025.\n\nThe quotes have been edited for length and brevity.\n\nFrancisco Osorio, a Mexico-based senior go-to-market marketing engineer at Simetrik, an operational control and management automation company\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless.\n\nI am responsible for the smooth functioning of my company’s website, among other things. During the November AWS outage, the website stopped functioning, but I was unable to take any action because I lost access to all my work-related platforms, like HubSpot, Slack, and Salesforce. [Some users of AWS experienced issues on November 5, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. An AWS spokesperson denied the claims in comments to Reuters.]\n\nEven as we were sorting through internal issues, our clients also couldn’t log into the platform, which was a more serious concern because we need to comply with service level agreements under which we assure quality and quantity of service.\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless. All I could tell everyone around was, “I’m deeply sorry, I cannot help you today. Our platforms are not running.”\n\nSundeep Narwani, India-based co-founder of Narrative Research Labs, a firm focusing on AI in media\n\nBeing an AI company, we’re quite heavily dependent on the cloud. The outages have wasted a lot of time for our clients and us, rendering us helpless in most cases.\n\nThe outages have wasted a lot of our time.\n\nThe first time it happened, we didn’t know what to do or how to deal with it, and we entered panic mode. My biggest concern was on two fronts: downtime disrupting our processes, and our clients being obviously very angry because we deliver a lot of daily reports for them.\n\nWhen it happened the second time, we created a standard operating procedure to deal with it because someone like me, who is involved in business development apart from being the CEO, cannot be available all the time to handle these issues.\n\nWe delegate a project manager to handle issues of cloud outages and ensure our customers are taken care of during such times while finding a quick solution to the downtime.\n\nWe have also purchased a local server to replicate what AWS does, so that if there is any kind of outage again, we have one local server to tide us over. Obviously, it doesn’t have the same kind of performance that AWS gives us, but at least the team can function. But these are just temporary options.\n\nDavid Nandwa, founder of Honeycoin, a Kenyan cross-border payment company\n\nWe have faced cloud outage issues in the past and were also hit with the recent AWS outage in November.\n\nThe approach we have applied to dealing with this is to have a “distributed stack” or multiple fallback options. We rely on multiple clouds, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Heroku. During the recent AWS outage, we temporarily switched to Google Cloud to maintain service availability for most of our customers.\n\nIf all cloud providers are down, we then fall back to using an on-premise server that we’ve created. It doesn’t perform as efficiently as our providers, but it comes in handy in moments where all the major providers are down. It’s locally hosted, so it’s an option to process requests when all else fails.\n\nSubscribing to multiple cloud providers definitely helps us not only to hedge against future risk but also to decrease reliance on a single one, and risk losing our data completely.\n\nHowever, multiple providers mean multiple bills at the end of the month.\n\nThe one-off cost of a single on-premise server installation is something we’re seriously considering to decrease reliance on the large players and also have more digital sovereignty. It’s pretty simple to set up, but it requires a lot of work to move our stack from any of the globally reputable providers to our own direct stack.\n\nOlumide Egbigbola, Nigeria-based product manager at Leatherback, a cross-border payment startup\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases.\n\nCloud infrastructure is the backbone of most of the things that we do, as most of our critical services are hosted in the cloud. So any downtime from our cloud provider is immediately felt by our individuals and business users. We face complaints of transaction delays, and the app slowing down or being unresponsive.\n\nThis usually causes a lot of anxiety amongst users who can’t access their money.\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases other than inform our users about the downtime.\n\nWe try to spread our cloud services and route traffic through regions that are less affected or unaffected, so that users can at least perform minimal activities while we wait for the major downtime to be over.",

After enrolling at Penn State, Henderson was mentored by Ty Howle, Virginia Tech’s new offensive coordinator and tight ends coach. Henderson redshirted in 2025, so he has four years of eligibility remaining with the Hokies.\n\nHenderson was a late riser in the recruiting world. However, once he worked out for Howle and James Franklin, it was over. Henderson began picking up offers, but committed to the Nittany Lions as a junior. Henderson’s addition, with more tight ends potentially on the way, makes it clear that the position will not be ignored in 2026 like it was last season.\n\nHenderson is a big get for Virginia Tech. Not only are the Hokies bringing a talented prospect back home, but Henderson’s best football is ahead of him. He should be an immediate contributor next season.",

    "description": "Tech companies looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly being voted down",
    "fullText": "SPRING CITY, Pa. — Tech companies and developers looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly losing fights in communities where people don’t want to live next to them, or even near them.\n\nCommunities across the United States are reading about — and learning from — each other's battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.\n\nIn many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. Some don’t have zoning.\n\nBut as more people hear about a data center coming to their community, once-sleepy municipal board meetings in farming towns and growing suburbs now feature crowded rooms of angry residents pressuring local officials to reject the requests.\n\n“Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked supervisors last month in Pennsylvania's East Vincent Township. “Because that’s where it’s literally going, is in my backyard.”\n\nA growing number of proposals are going down in defeat, sounding alarms across the data center constellation of Big Tech firms, real estate developers, electric utilities, labor unions and more.\n\nAndy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL, counted seven or eight deals he’d worked on in recent months that saw opponents going door-to-door, handing out shirts or putting signs in people’s yards.\n\n“It’s becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said.\n\nData Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development.\n\nBetween April and June alone, its latest reporting period, it counted 20 proposals valued at $98 billion in 11 states that were blocked or delayed amid local opposition and state-level pushback. That amounts to two-thirds of the projects it was tracking.\n\nSome environmental and consumer advocacy groups say they’re fielding calls every day, and are working to educate communities on how to protect themselves.\n\n“I’ve been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I’d guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I’ve ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson of the Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition.\n\nIn Indiana alone, Gustafson counted more than a dozen projects that lost rezoning petitions.\n\nFor some people angry over steep increases in electric bills, their patience is thin for data centers that could bring still-higher increases.\n\nLosing open space, farmland, forest or rural character is a big concern. So is the damage to quality of life, property values or health by on-site diesel generators kicking on or the constant hum of servers. Others worry that wells and aquifers could run dry.\n\nLawsuits are flying — both ways — over whether local governments violated their own rules.\n\nBig Tech firms Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook — which are collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers across the globe — didn’t answer Associated Press questions about the effect of community pushback.\n\nMicrosoft, however, has acknowledged the difficulties. In an October securities filing, it listed its operational risks as including “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development.”\n\nEven with high-level support from state and federal governments, the pushback is having an impact.\n\nMaxx Kossof, vice president of investment at Chicago-based developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about losing a zoning fight are considering selling properties once they secure a power source — a highly sought-after commodity that makes a proposal far more viable and valuable.\n\n“You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it’s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.”\n\nSome in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers — such as polluting water and air — and are difficult to overcome.\n\nStill, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers.\n\n“It's definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?’” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers.\n\nWinning over local officials, however, hasn't translated to winning over residents.\n\nDevelopers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat.\n\nThe project would have funded half the city’s budget and developers promised environmentally friendly features. But town meetings overflowed, and emails, texts and phone calls were overwhelmingly opposed, “999 to one against,” Higdon said.\n\nHad council approved it, “every person that voted for it would no longer be in office,” the mayor said. “That's for sure.”\n\nIn Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city’s environmental review was adequate.\n\nResidents found each other through social media and, from there, learned to organize, protest, door-knock and get their message out.\n\nThey say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city — responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy — released internal emails that confirmed it.\n\n“It’s the secrecy. The secrecy just drives people crazy,” said Jonathan Thornton, a realtor who lives across a road from the site.\n\nDocuments revealing the extent of the project emerged days before a city rezoning vote in October. Mortenson, which is developing it for a Fortune 50 company that it hasn't named, says it is considering changes based on public feedback and that “more engagement with the community is appropriate.\"\n\nRebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm.\n\nShe found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle.\n\n“I don’t think this fight is over at all,” Gramdorf said.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

He visited UF over the weekend along with teammate and wide receiver Bailey Stockwell.\n\nA redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining, the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo showed promise as a backup quarterback in two seasons with the Yellow Jackets, throwing for 938 yards with 2 TDs to 3 interceptions over two seasons while rushing for 95 yards and 1 TD. Philo has appeared in seven games over two seasons and while alternating with starter Haynes King, helped lead Georgia Tech to a 28-23 upset win over Miami on Nov. 9, 2024.\n\nA three-star recruit out of Prince Andrew Christian School in Bogart, Ga., Philo broke Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence's high school record for passing yards in the state of Georgia with 13,922 yards during his prep career.\n\nPhilo will compete with redshirt freshman Tramel Jones Jr. for the starting quarterback job at Florida. Jones, who announced his intention to return to UF in December, completed 21 of 35 passes for 191 yards and 2 TDs in two games as former UF quarterback DJ Lagway's backup last season. Florida also brings back redshirt sophomore quarterback Aidan Warner and adds incoming four-star freshman quarterback Will Griffin, who plans to enroll at UF this month for the spring semester.\n\nPhilo joins Baylor safety DJ Coleman as the second commitment in UF's 2026 transfer portal class.\n\nKevin Brockway is The Gainesville Sun’s Florida beat writer.

    "fullText": "When manager Arne Slot and Liverpool look back at this season, a crazy January afternoon when they drew 2-2 at Fulham will go a long way to summing up their misfortunes.\n\nWith top scorer Hugo Ekitike out with a muscle issue, Liverpool's struggles were compounded when one of their former players Harry Wilson opened the scoring in a first half in which Slot's side failed to test home goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\n\nYet they equalised through a controversial Florian Wirtz goal - and looked to have snatched victory in the fourth minute of stoppage time when Cody Gakpo scored in front of the away end.\n\nHowever, late substitute Harrison Reed fired home a contender for goal of the season from 25 yards in the 97th minute as Slot's side dropped points again.\n\n\"Losing that game would have been completely unfair to us,\" said Fulham manager Marco Silva.\n\nLiverpool extended their unbeaten run to nine games, but yet again their problems were laid bare.\n\n\"If you're not part of Liverpool, you think you'd win it,\" said Slot. \"But unfortunately I've been experiencing this for months now that the first chance the other team gets leads to a goal. The second thing is that the other team scores a goal you don't expect in extra time. So, is it then a surprise?\" the Dutchman said.\n\nWhat did surprise many inside Craven Cottage was that Wirtz's equaliser was confirmed after a video assistant referee (VAR) check - despite replays suggesting he was in an offside position.\n\n\"I was sure it was offside so I didn't even celebrate,\" Wirtz told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I felt the same. Many people inside the stadium felt the same,\" said Silva. \"It looked offside, but we have to believe the semi-automated technology worked well and did right,\" the Fulham boss added.",

    "fullText": "It's in our nature to want more: More money. More friends. More muscle. More food. A more luxurious car. And, of course, more gains by way of the stock market.\n\nHow can I tell after a year in which the S&P 500's (^GSPC) total return was 17.88%, bringing the index's three-year total return to 86.11%? Because I am always getting asked by people for stock ideas, especially after years of the market basically moving up and to the right.\n\nAs a rule, I don't give out stock ideas, as that is no longer my career (I was an analyst for a decade). So I come to you at the start of 2026 with a tidy list of stock ideas provided by my contacts.\n\nI caution that I am not endorsing the picks of these money management pros. This is not me saying to dump your life savings into these stocks or even buy a single share.\n\nDo your homework on each one. In doing so, you may find you like other stocks in the industry better.\n\n\"One chip company in the world is fueling the AI revolution, and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out, the [earnings] numbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15% to 20% at a minimum [earnings growth] going into 2026. You put that together, and I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a base case to end 2026.\"\n\n\"We love Palantir. From a defense standpoint, they are the leader in AI and data, with Defense Department approval and usage. And then beyond that, corporate adoption and sovereign adoption. So we think the name continues [to go higher]. It's one of those names, you can't justify it from a valuation standpoint. But the narrative is quite compelling. And that can drive stocks for a very long time, like it did Amazon for the first 20 years of Amazon's post-IPO life.\"\n\n\"I think Broadcom is a little misunderstood. We were big buyers of it during COVID actually when it was giving you over a 3% dividend yield. So you know we like dividends. So what I like about it is the VMware side of the business and the programable side. These are very specialized chips. So not competing as much with Nvidia, and I think they're creating their own market. And I think their growth rate and the ownership has been tremendous.\n\n\"We've been trimming this position because it grew to so much in our accounts. I mean, we had up to 7% of our portfolio in Broadcom. We didn't want that much. We still like it, but we're not expecting the 5,060% return. We'd be very happy with Broadcom [returning] about 10%.\"",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain’s fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.\n\n“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.\n\nButerin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.\n\nEthereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.\n\nZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.\n\n“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.\n\nGeorge Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.\n\n“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.",

    "title": "Scientists Made A Breakthrough In LED Tech That Could Change Everything",
    "description": "LEDs are all around us and come in quite a few different forms, but this new discovery just might open up a whole new realm of potential applications.",
    "fullText": "LEDs are everything, from some of the largest TV screens you can buy, to the types of bulbs that you use in your home. But, not all LED materials are the same. Some are OLEDs or QLEDs, while others are a bit more nuanced. Some don't even allow you to move electricity through them. It's this later group that has attracted some intriguing attention from scientists in recent years, and now, a group of researchers working with the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge have made an intriguing discovery that could change how we think about LEDs altogether. According to the study, which was published in the journal Nature, scientists have managed to move electricity through tiny insulating particles that aren't typically capable of conducting electricity. These particles are made up of various elements, including some rare-earth elements such as neodymium and ytterbium, and the breakthrough here could potentially open new doors for LED technology as a whole.\n\nResearchers note that the particles in question, called insulating lanthanide nanoparticles (LnNPs) have been known to shine very brightly when they are placed under light. However, scientists have always struggled to get the particles to actually conduct electricity. Previous attempts to do just that have shown that charges often can't reach the lanthanide ions inside without extreme heat or voltage.\n\nTo bypass this issue, those involved in this new study began looking for a way to hybridize the particles instead. They used 9-ACA organic dye molecules with the LnNPs, letting them replace the surface insulators on the particles, thus allowing them to be charged using a technique known as triplet energy transfer.\n\nAccording to the study, the biggest issue that held the LnNPs from being electrically excited is their energy gap. In the past, this limited these particles to only being used in deep-tissue imaging that didn't rely on electric energy. By replacing the surface insulators, though, the researchers managed to bypass this core problem, thus opening the door to use these particles in more expanded LED operations.\n\nAnd when the changes were made, the scientists were then able to inject electrons into the organic layer, thus forming what they call \"excitons.\" From here, the energy is transferred to the lanthanide ions, which allows them to emit an almost completely pure near-infrared (NIR) light, even going so far as to out perform most other organic NIR LEDs in both narrowness and efficiency.\n\nThe researchers say that these new LnLEDs open a lot of possibilities for hybrid optoelectronics in biomedical tools. This could allow for better non-bleaching deep imaging applications. Whether this advancement is as huge as previous research that aimed to make X-rays safer or not still remains to be seen, but it does open a lot of new possibilities. The researchers say they still want to improve on the brightness offered by the new hybrid LEDs, but the current method should be easily scalable to other insulators, allowing for even more experimentation.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "AI safety expert David Dalrymple said rapid advances could outpace efforts to control powerful systems\n\nThe world “may not have time” to prepare for the safety risks posed by cutting-edge AI systems, according to a leading figure at the UK government’s scientific research agency.\n\nDavid Dalrymple, a programme director and AI safety expert at the Aria agency, told the Guardian people should be concerned about the growing capability of the technology.\n\n“I think we should be concerned about systems that can perform all of the functions that humans perform to get things done in the world, but better,” he said. “We will be outcompeted in all of the domains that we need to be dominant in, in order to maintain control of our civilisation, society and planet.”\n\nDalrymple said there was a gap in understanding between the public sector and AI companies about the power of looming breakthroughs in the technology.\n\n“I would advise that things are moving really fast and we may not have time to get ahead of it from a safety perspective,” he said. “And it’s not science fiction to project that within five years most economically valuable tasks will be performed by machines at a higher level of quality and lower cost than by humans.”\n\nDalrymple said governments should not assume that advanced systems are reliable. Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.\n\n“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.\n\nDescribing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.\n\n“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”\n\nThis month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nThe institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nDalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.",

    "title": "Micah's takeaways from a dominant week for the Big Ten",
    "description": "Indiana embarrassed Alabama and Oregon shut out Texas Tech. The Big Ten showed it has the best teams in CFB and is guaranteed to play for the title",
    "fullText": "It was a great week for the Big Ten The national championship game is guaranteed to have a team that resides in the Big Ten Conference. The title game won't feature two Big Ten teams, but there is no doubt that the best game in this playoff and the best game this season might be the upcoming semifinal between two Big Ten teams, Indiana and Oregon.\n\nHere are my takeaways from the Big Ten from this Week's bowl games:\n\nFrom wins like Iowa over Vandy, Illinois over Tennessee, a high-powered offense, all the way to Indiana beating Alabama, the Big Ten showcased they are the best conference in the country. The Big Ten lost Ohio State as a representative, but with the matchup between Oregon and Indiana, that could very well be the team that wins it all. Indiana very well looks like the best team remaining by a wide margin. Texas did get the best of Michigan, but everyone is clearly aware of what has been going on in Michigan prior to that bowl game. It is safe to say that the Big Ten runs college football.\n\nAgainst Alabama, Fernando Mendoza was as good as he could possibly be. Mendoza was 14-16, threw for 192 yards through the air, and threw for 3 passing touchdowns. Many of his other counterparts struggled, while Mendoza continues to win and continues to be the reason why Indiana is winning. At this current moment, Mendoza looks like a sure thing quarterback prospect for the next draft class, and he will make one desperate NFL team very happy.\n\nIndiana was the one team that had a bye week in the College Football Playoff that did not lose. Not only did they not lose to Alabama, but they won the game in the first half. Ty Simpson had no chance, and this was a complete football performance by Indiana and Curt Cignetti. The Hoosiers are undefeated this year, and last season they only lost two games, one of which was in last season's College Football Playoff. Cignetti consistently has this team ready to dominate regardless of the opponent. He has a Big Ten title for the first time in program history, and he is looking for much more this season. This two-year run for Cignetti in Indiana places him as the best coach in college football right now, and it is not close, just like the coaching match between him and Kalen DeBoer on Thursday.\n\nIndiana is a team that has not shown any weakness this season. In games that could have resulted in an upset this season, Indiana has a guy who can win them games in the clutch in Fernando Mendoza. This team has an elite quarterback, they have elite weapons as Omar Cooper Jr. returned versus Alabama, and their defense is just as good as any team left. This team is well coached, and their team is full of players at every level who have been in college football for at least 4 years. The steamrolling of Alabama was a surprise to no one. Indiana made their statement on Thursday and proved it is the team to beat.\n\nThe last time these two teams met, Indiana won 30-20. That game was a battle, and both quarterbacks struggled and faced adversity. Mendoza proved to be the quarterback who battled adversity the best. Against Indiana was the first time Dante Moore struggled and did not have his usual success. For Oregon to win, they will need Dante Moore to be the better quarterback. In all the other areas on their team, Oregon matches up very well against Indiana, and their defense showed that by completely shutting out Texas Tech. Once again, these two teams will deliver one of the best games of this season. In my opinion, whoever wins this game will win the whole thing.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Big Ten football teams handled the SEC in New Year's bowl games",

    "title": "Big Tech turned me down. At Walmart, I found a career opportunity, work-life balance, and good food.",
    "description": "This software engineer couldn't land a Big Tech job — but says his Walmart role gave him everything he needed.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kanish Shah, a 26-year-old software engineer at Walmart who lives in Milpitas, California. Business Insider has verified his employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI moved to the US from India in August 2021 to pursue a master's degree in computer science at the University of Southern California. Soon after, I began looking for a summer internship — but things didn't go as planned.\n\nLike many aspiring software engineers, I was excited about the idea of working at a Big Tech company like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, or Netflix. I targeted those tech giants during my internship search, but the competition was intense. I ended up being rejected by all of them, which was disappointing.\n\nIt wasn't just the tech giants that turned me down. I ended up applying to hundreds of internships and received fewer than 15 callbacks — one of which turned into a role at Walmart. I learned that Big Tech isn't the only route to take for a successful tech career.\n\nWhile I struggled to gain traction with tech giants, I eventually secured interviews with several startups and midsize companies.\n\nOne of the internships I applied to early on — without a referral — was a software engineering role at Walmart. A couple of months later, around October 2021, a recruiter reached out about an online assessment followed by two technical interviews. I received an offer soon after the interviews and started the internship in May.\n\nI treated the internship like an extended interview — I asked for weekly feedback, stayed vocal during meetings, and found a mentor. I believe that approach helped me secure a full-time software engineering role with Walmart, which I started in June 2023.\n\nWhen I joined Walmart full-time, the company was in the midst of a major transformation — evolving from a traditional retail giant into a tech-driven, AI-powered organization. It felt like an opportunity to contribute to meaningful technological change while accelerating my own learning. That was a significant reason I decided to stay after my internship.\n\nI'm very happy with my decision. In addition to growing as a software engineer, I've found that the work culture and work-life balance at Walmart are really great. My hours can vary, but I generally work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and have time to spend with family and friends on the weekends.\n\nI live in Milpitas, California, about a 25-minute commute from Walmart's Sunnyvale office. I'm required to go in two days a week, though in-office expectations vary across teams. The office itself is great. It has a lot of amenities, including boxing and pilates classes, a basketball court, a large gym, and good food.\n\nWalmart offers a wide range of cuisine options in its cafeteria. For lunch, I usually opt for the \"make your own salad bowl,\" but there are also options featuring Asian, Indian, Italian, and Mexican dishes. The food isn't free, but it's subsidized, so it's not costly — and drinks like fountain beverages, tea, and coffee are complimentary.\n\nAt a traditional Big Tech company, you may find early exposure to systems operating at a massive global scale — along with access to specialized internal tooling, research teams, and long-established engineering playbooks. There's also the brand recognition, which could make future job mobility feel more straightforward.\n\nThat said, those differences haven't felt like gaps for me. I haven't felt that I'm missing out on meaningful learning or career development where I am. For me, the quality of work, mentorship, and ownership has mattered more than the logo.\n\nMy advice to other young tech professionals is this: aiming for Big Tech is completely valid — those roles can be great aspirations. However, not landing one of these roles shouldn't be too discouraging. High-impact work can be found in many environments, including startups and emerging tech companies. I also believe that strong compensation is possible outside traditional Big Tech — my compensation is in the six figures.\n\nFrom a job security perspective, I believe the entire tech industry has undergone a period of recalibration over the past couple of years. Layoffs have affected companies of all sizes — including Big Tech, midsize firms, and even large enterprises like Walmart. So I try not to view job security as something tied to a single company or sector.\n\nWhat gives me confidence is focusing on the factors I can control: continuously building relevant skills, staying adaptable, and making a meaningful impact in my role. In short, my advice would be not to limit yourself to a narrow set of companies. Stay open to opportunities where you can learn, contribute, and grow — because the tech world is much bigger than just one path.",

    "description": "Ryan Edwards was a drummer for an indie band, worked at VISA Europe, and now runs Audoo, a music tech startup. Here's his advice on career pivots.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ryan Edwards, 40, the founder of Audoo, who is based in London. His employment and Audoo's investors have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity\n\nIn my early 20s, I was the drummer of an indie band. We toured festivals and made the UK's Top 10 Independent Singles Chart.\n\nBut I knew our success wouldn't last forever. Eventually, the time would come for me to grow up and find a real job.\n\nSince leaving the band in 2008, my career has been varied. I've worked in retail, at startups, and eventually became a senior leader at Visa Europe. In 2018, I founded Audoo, a startup that aims to help musicians receive royalties, which has investors including Elton John.\n\nMy career pivots have been unexpected and I tend to fall into my line of work, but they have felt natural because my dreams keep changing. While my job titles have changed, one thing hasn't: a belief in getting my head down and doing the hard work. In my experience, nine times out of ten, that's what pays off.\n\nAs a kid, I dreamed of being a footballer — then I got into music. My dad loves Motown and he wanted me to become a saxophonist. I started learning the clarinet and the sax, and then the drums, because I thought it might get me more girls.\n\nI planned to study jazz at music school, but that never happened. Soon after I finished my high-school exams, the band I was the drummer of was signed by an indie label while gigging locally. When I heard the words \"record deal,\" I got goosebumps.\n\nFrom 2006, we were suddenly getting studio time and supporting major acts on tour. Looking back, touring for a year and a half was probably a better life experience than going to university: I became a better musician and learned how to drink.\n\nBand life was fun, but it wasn't always easy. I remember renting budget hotel rooms and flipping a coin to see who would sleep on the floor. Eventually, it became clear that the label would prioritize better-selling and more well-behaved bands.\n\nPanic set in when I left the band. I didn't know what to do with my life, but I knew I needed an income. I got a job as an assistant store manager at a cell phone retailer chain in 2008, where I ended up working for four years in increasingly senior roles.\n\nWorking in retail was an excellent education: you're trading day in, day out. There were similarities to life in the band, where I'd sell T-shirts and stickers after shows. In both lines of work, I managed stock and convinced people to part with their hard-earned cash.\n\nI was made redundant in 2012, and after a stint as a business development manager at an app development business — whose founder I met at a friend's wedding — I was offered a job at Visa Europe as a senior manager in late 2013.\n\nI learned to always be open to exploring new opportunities. You never know where they might take you.\n\nIt was my first job in a corporate environment. Suddenly, I was sitting in a three-piece suit at a quiet desk, worrying it would be stale, but I ended up being given permission to shake things up.\n\nI hadn't planned to leave Visa — the pay was great and I felt comfortable in my job. But in 2016, after three years, I joined a fintech start-up in sales, after two brilliant guys tried to poach me. They knew of me from working on Visa data feeds, and needed contacts in retail.\n\nThe risk of pivoting felt worth it because the idea for the business was amazing.\n\nThen the idea for Audoo hit me. In 2018, I was in a department store in London when one of my band's singles started playing, and my wife joked about the royalties I'd earn. I said they were more likely to buy her a coffee than the designer bag she was eyeing up.\n\nWeeks later, I got my royalty statement. It listed what I'd been paid but offered no data about how those payments were calculated or the flow of how plays become payment. I became fascinated by how the royalties process worked — and realized the system was a mess.\n\nInspired by Amazon's Alexa and Shazam, I wanted to build a technology that would identify the music played in public and ensure artists get paid fairly for it. I built the first prototype for Audoo on my kitchen table with a Raspberry Pi. It worked — it recognized songs —but, looking back, it was embarrassing. We use barely any of that code anymore.\n\nNow, our Audoo Audio Meter uses a plug-in device to track the music played in commercial premises, like stores and bars, and sends the data to royalty-collection organizations.\n\nI incorporated Audoo in August 2018 at the age of 33. We'd just gotten a puppy and my wife was pregnant, so I needed it to work. I used LinkedIn to reach out to industry leaders and set up coffee dates, which quickly confirmed there was demand to build and scale the product.\n\nIn 2020, Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA saw me on TV promoting Audoo and later invested. He put out a statement that exceeded my expectations: \"Audoo is a solution I believe will change the music industry forever,\" he said.\n\nThrough word of mouth, others in the music industry started to hear about the company and invest, including Elton John.\n\nThe team and the mission we're delivering are incredibly rewarding — but I'm always open to new challenges.\n\nWhen I was a drummer in The Lines, I never thought I'd one day be the CEO of a music tech company. I can't say where the future will take me as I've never been one to stick to a particular plan.\n\nWhile some people have lifelong linear goals, I tend to reset mine every two to three years. For me, it's about continually learning something new, never being boxed in, and being adaptable to change.",

    "description": "Besides having screen time limits for their kids, many tech execs also have philosophies around encouraging curiosity and learning in their children.",
    "fullText": "Much is known about how tech execs manage their companies. But how about how those with families manage their children?\n\nEven the uber-wealthy leaders have to contend with everyday parenting questions, like whether to limit screen time and how to divvy up chores\n\nWe looked through past interviews to find some of tech leaders' most interesting pointers when it comes to parenting and setting kids up for success in today's world.\n\nHere's what some of the biggest names in tech have said about their approach to raising children.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Jimmy Fallon that ChatGPT has helped him raise his baby. He said he \"cannot imagine\" having figured out how to parent a newborn without the technology. He's asked, for example, why his kid wasn't crawling at a certain age.\n\nAltman has also said that his baby \"will never be smarter than AI,\" but will be \"more capable.\" He told the Senate that he doesn't want his kid to form a best-friend-like bond with an AI bot.\n\nAnd when it comes to cribs, Altman has said he has a clear favorite: Cradlewise. It costs nearly $2,000 and gently bounces the baby to get ahead of any fussing. The crib also includes a built-in baby monitor and music features.\n\nAltman also said he's learned the importance of having a lot of burp rags.\n\nWhen asked in 2024 what kids should be studying today, Zuckerberg told Bloomberg that \"the most important thing is learning how to think critically and learning values when you're young.\"\n\n\"This is somewhat of a hiring philosophy that I have, too,\" he said. \"If people have shown that they can go deep and do one thing really well, then they've probably gained experience in the art of learning something and taking it to an excellent level.\"\n\nHe also said in a 2024 interview that, when taking his then-seven-year-old daughter to a Taylor Swift concert, he told her that being like the superstar wasn't \"available\" to her. A therapist in California who has worked with wealthy parents told Business Insider that encouraging her to instead be herself was the right approach.\n\nIn a 2019 interview on CBS This Morning, the Meta CEO said he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, \"don't give them everything.\"\n\n\"They have chores, they have responsibilities,\" Chan added. \"We also take them to work. Mark and I take both of them to the office to see what we do, how we contribute.\"\n\nThat same year, he told Fox News that he generally doesn't want his kids parked in front of a television or computer \"for a long period of time.\" At the time, he said he let his daughters use video calls to talk with relatives across the country but is stricter about other forms of screen time.\n\nNadella says his own parents \"created an environment where they let me set my own pace and pursue what I wanted,\" and that influenced his approach to raising his own children.\n\n\"It's important to focus on what [our kids] need to thrive,\" he previously told Good Housekeeping.\n\nThe Microsoft CEO and his wife, Anu, also \"both think children should have dogs,\" she told Good Housekeeping.\n\n\"There is a different sense of companionship and responsibility that comes with it — that emotional sense that there is a being waiting for you to come back,\" Anu said.\n\nNadella told Good Housekeeping that he gets reports on what their kids do on their computers. The couple limits how many movies and what kinds of video games and websites their kids can view.\n\nNadella has also said that his experience raising a son with cerebral palsy has taught him the importance of empathy, including at work.\n\nPichai still helps his kids with their homework — with some assistance from Google Lens.\n\n\"We use Google Lens for homework. I don't want to get him in trouble, but the class allows you to do that,\" Pichai previously told Bloomberg. \"But sometimes he asks me for help on math. Sometimes I'm lazy and I pretend as if I'm thinking, but I'm also using Google Lens to kind of figure out the answer.\"\n\nThe Google CEO told The New York Times in 2018 that his son, then 11 years old, didn't have a phone, and that he limited his son's TV use.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates has said he parented his kids following a model developed in the 1970s called the \"Love and Logic\" approach.\n\nThe philosophy focuses on exercising control when it comes to emotions, such as by minimizing some reactions as a parent, like shouting or reprimanding. Gates said his dad believed in the same philosophy, and that \"he was never panicked.\"\n\nGates, who for many years was the world's richest man, has also said he tried to keep his kids from being spoiled.\n\n\"We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything, but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing,\" he once said.\n\nAs far as screen time limits go, Gates forbade his kids from using phones at the dinner table, and didn't give them phones until they were 14 years old.\n\nIn a 2025 episode of the podcast \"Raj Shamani's Figuring it Out,\" Gates said he was giving his children less than 1% of his total wealth, \"because I decided it wouldn't be a favor to them.\"\n\n\"I want to give them a chance to have their own earnings and success be significant,\" Gates added.\n\nBezos took an unusual approach to raising his four kids at times. He said in 2017 that he let his kids use \"sharp knives\" from the age of 4 and power tools at 7 or 8 years old.\n\nThe Amazon founder attributed this to his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, who he said would \"much rather have a kid with nine fingers than a resourceless kid.\" Bezos added that this was \"a fantastic attitude about life.\"\n\nReddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian incorporated a fun practice from his upbringing into his approach to parenting.\n\n\"My favorite parenting tip that I inherited from him was his Sunday tradition of making breakfast for our family,\" he said in 2020. \"I love being able to make pancakes with my family when we're all in the same place on a Sunday, and always do my best to put away outside distractions so we can be together.\"\n\nOn a 2025 podcast episode, Ohanian said he \"wholeheartedly\" wanted his then-seven-year-old daughter to use AI every day. He said he's used the technology to enhance her creativity: he had ChatGPT turn some of his childhood pencil sketches into \"full-color illustrations.\" His daughter, Ohanian said, still draws with old-fashioned markers and paper as well.\n\nOhanian told CNBC in 2018 that he and tennis star Serena Williams want their daughter \"to know what it's like to have limits on tech.\"\n\n\"My wife and I both want her to be bored,\" he said. \"I do look forward to playing video games with her when she's older, but it's really important that she gets time to just be with her thoughts and be with her blocks and be with her toys, so we'll be regulating it pretty heavily.\"\n\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel said in 2018 that he and his wife, supermodel Miranda Kerr, limited their then-seven-year-old's screen time to an hour and a half a week. The rule, he said, was partly influenced by not being allowed to watch television until he was almost a teenager.\n\nHe said that parents should lead by example and work to limit their own screen time as well.\n\nSpiegel told People in 2025 that he's glad his kids are growing up with digital tools, and Kerr said they don't let their 14-year-old have phones or computers in his bedroom past 9:30 pm.",

    "description": "From AI to workplace changes to side hustles, Business Insider is diving in on the topics you care about.",
    "fullText": "It's a new year! And at Business Insider, we're already diving in.\n\nWe've always been the place for innovators, and AI's arrival is creating a renaissance for entrepreneurs of all stripes. It's led to whole new industries — from legal AI to chatbot training to vibe coding to the data center boom. Everyone is learning as they go, and we are here to help you generate ideas, trade notes, and get smarter. We'll chronicle highs and lows — there will for sure be both.\n\nAt larger firms, leaders will be sizing up which AI experiments are working, at what costs, and with what benefits. How fast AI helps companies' bottom lines will determine whether we're in bubble times in the markets. We're all over that in our new First Trade newsletter.\n\nAI is a big story line on Wall Street, but it's not the only one. This past year showed dents in basic assumptions about capitalism in the US — principles that have underscored the \"stocks for the long run\" thinking that has proven sound for investors. International markets are getting more of a look, especially with rearmament in Europe and AI as a global tailwind.\n\nBetween Washington's investments in business, Zohran Mamdani's rise in the nation's financial capital, and surveys showing eroding confidence in capitalism, that mindset is no longer the given it once was. We are launching a series this week, \"The Future of Capitalism,\" and what it means for your work and wealth. Take our survey, and watch Monday for our first piece!\n\nMeanwhile, in workplaces, capitalism is alive and well. The \"anti-woke workplace\" is increasingly in fashion, and we will help you navigate an era in which many managers, in a sharp shift, are more focused on employee performance than employee policies.\n\nOur obsession with side hustles is still a full-time job for us, whether your thing is real estate, brand influencing, Uber driving, or renting your clothing. And as our reporting showed this past year, a strong side hustle can not only be fun, but also crucial if white-collar layoffs snag you.\n\nSpeaking about clothing, you've made clear you care about how to show up to succeed at work. We're exploring the cost of that, and whether that cost is sometimes too high — for your wallet or your heart. We've also got you covered on style and status, from show-off golf shirts and luxury handbags to viral hoodies, coveted watches, and Wall Street's favorite $1,100 shoes.\n\nAll of which is to say, we're pumped to cover all that's ahead — in words, video, audio, newsletters, online and IRL events, and every way that works for you! As always, please stay in touch! Email me at eic@businessinsider.com.\n\nThe BI Today team: Jamie Heller, editor in chief, in New York. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

    "description": "Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or \"far\" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.\n  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.\n  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.",

Gideon, a four-year safety at Texas, played for Muschamp in Austin. He was the safeties coach for Steve Sarkisian until 2025, when he left for Atlanta.\n\nAfter running the defense for the Yellow Jackets this season, Gideon is returning to his alma mater. The 36-year-old played safety at Texas from 2008 through 2011. He got his first coaching role in 2014 and has climbed the career ladder for 11 years. Gideon served as the Longhorns’ safety coach for four seasons before accepting his first defensive coordinator position with Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech ended the season the 99th-ranked defense in FBS.\n\nIn December, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian parted ways with Pete Kwiatkowski and replaced him with Muschamp. Sark said in the announcement he'd like to spend less time worrying about the defense.\n\nGeorgia Tech defensive coordinator Blake Gideon is returning to Texas as an assistant for Steve Sarkisian and Will Muschamp, @InsideTexas' @EricNahlin has learned.\n\nGideon, who played 52 games for UT, was on Sarkisian's original staff from 2021-24\n\nSTORY (FREE):… pic.twitter.com/8PyEk451sJ\n\n— Inside Texas (@InsideTexas) January 2, 2026\n\n\"We just felt it was best for our program to move in a different direction, and having the opportunity to hire Will Muschamp provides us the leadership to take our defense to another level,\" Sark said in the press release. \"Will is a guy I've known for a long time, always admired and is as good of a defensive mind and coach as I've ever coached against. His defenses are relentless; he absolutely gets the best out of his staff and players and is such an extremely well-respected coach. I know Longhorn Nation knows him well, he led some incredible defenses here on the Forty, and I'm so fired up to be bringing him back to Texas.

Weeks later on January 20, reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 was released.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe two models either surpassed or matched the performance of rival models across a range of industry benchmark tests. They were also built at a fraction of the cost and computing power that major US tech companies invest to build LLMs. The result: a massive sell-off on January 27 wiped out nearly US$1 trillion in tech stocks, including US$600 billion from Nvidia alone.\n\nAnalysts expected the momentum of Chinese AI companies to continue this year, thanks to Beijing's policy support, improved funding prospects, greater adoption of AI systems across industries and a growing number of talent being recruited for innovative projects.\n\nA domestic AI start-up's co-founder, who declined to be identified, predicted that China would overtake the US to become \"the world's leading AI power in 2027\". China's advantage was its deep talent pool, according to the co-founder.\n\nIn his New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out that the domestic market has \"many large AI models competing in a race to the top\", while new breakthroughs were being achieved in domestic semiconductor development. All of that \"has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest growing innovation capabilities\", Xi said.\n\nDeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng.

Twenty years in the context of geology is a heartbeat, a snowflake in the blizzard of time - but change the context to the world of television and the same period represents a fifth of TV's lifespan.\n\nIn my two decades on Ski Sunday, I have witnessed huge leaps in human performance, frightening environmental changes, inspiring shifts in alpine and winter sports culture and incredible advances in technology.\n\nThe biggest (and my personal favourite) change during my tenure at Ski Sunday has been in women's sport.\n\nSki Sunday's coverage was dominated in its early years by the daring of Franz Klammer and Jean-Claude Killy, the machismo of Alberto Tomba and the aggression of Hermann Maier.\n\nBut the rise of female stars in the 21st Century has been a joy to watch. Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Schiffrin's record-breaking careers have elevated female skiing's profile above male skiing in many countries.\n\nCloser to home my co-presenter Chemmy Alcott was a consistent top-10 campaigner in alpine and Jenny Jones, Izzy and Zoe Atkin, Charlotte Bankes, Mia Brookes and Kirsty Muir have outshone the men, claiming numerous British firsts with World Cup, World Championship and X Games titles.\n\nJenny and Izzy have both won Olympic medals and it is impossible not to dream, looking at Mia, Kirsty, Charlotte and Zoe's form, that the 2026 Winter Games in Milan in February might produce Team GB's first ever gold on snow.",

    "description": "When self-driving cars make headlines, it’s usually because something went wrong — a glitch, a failure, an accident.This story is different.On a dark, isolated",
    "fullText": "When self-driving cars make headlines, it’s usually because something went wrong — a glitch, a failure, an accident.\n\nOn a dark, isolated stretch of Highway 54 in New Mexico, Clifford Lee believes he’s alive today not because of his own reflexes — but because his Tesla Cybertruck, operating in Full Self-Driving mode, made a split-second decision for him.\n\n“I almost got killed,” Lee said. “I was shaking uncontrollably for a while.”\n\nLee was traveling northbound on a two-lane highway, cruising at about 75 miles per hour, using Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system — known as FSD — during a long road trip.\n\nAhead of him, a semi-truck approached in the opposite lane. Behind it, a pickup truck attempted a dangerous pass.\n\n“All I saw were headlights,” Lee said.\n\nWith only seconds to react, Lee realized the pickup wasn’t going to make it back into its lane in time.\n\n“I think it was like five seconds out,” he said. “Around three seconds, I realized he would not make it.”\n\nLee says he tried to steer away — but the Cybertruck was already moving.\n\nThe Cybertruck recorded the entire event. In the video you can clearly see there was no room for error. An overcorrection would’ve bounced Lee’s Cybertruck off the guardrail and possibly back into oncoming traffic.\n\nSlowed down frame by frame, the video shows the Cybertruck making a precise maneuver — avoiding what could have been a deadly head-on collision.\n\n“I’m so convinced it was FSD,” Lee said.\n\nThe only damage: a shattered side window and a broken mirror.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system relies entirely on cameras — mounted in door pillars, fenders, and around the vehicle — to interpret the world in real time.\n\n“I use it every day,” said Cybertruck owner Aaron George. “I feel so much safer with FSD.”\n\nGeorge demonstrated the system for CBS Austin, starting at the station’s parking lot and setting a destination to Mount Bonnell — a route filled with tricky merges, construction zones, narrow neighborhood streets, and blind intersections.\n\nAt one busy frontage road, the Cybertruck waited for the safest window of opportunity before merging smoothly into traffic.\n\nAt stoplights, the screen displayed every surrounding vehicle — cars, trucks, vans — even those behind the truck.\n\nAs the drive continued, the system navigated tight residential roads, avoided trash cans in the street, detected pedestrians, and cautiously inched forward at blind intersections before turning.\n\n“It’s pretty blinded over there,” George noted at one intersection. “It inched up, saw there were no cars, and made the turn.”\n\nWhen we arrived at Mount Bonnell, the Cybertruck located an open parking spot and backed in— without George ever touching the wheel.\n\n“It’s amazing,” he said. “Every iteration is mind-blowing.”\n\nTesla is currently rolling out Full Self-Driving (Supervised) version 14.\n\nFor many drivers, Full Self-Driving is about convenience. For Clifford Lee, it’s something far more personal.\n\n“I realized this is my second life already,” he said.\n\nLee believes a full-speed impact — closing at a combined speed of nearly 150 miles per hour — would have been unsurvivable.\n\n“There’s no chance I would have survived that,” he said.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system still requires driver supervision, and federal regulators continue to scrutinize the technology. But for one driver on a lonely highway in New Mexico, a decision made in a fraction of a second may have made all the difference.",

    "description": "A new country is gearing up to unveil the world's second-fastest commercial transport train, and despite their reputation with technology, it isn't Japan.",
    "fullText": "There are plenty of mistakes people make while traveling by train. Pick the cheapest ride, and you'll probably be stuck on a train moving slower than drying paint. Pick the wrong type of train, and you could be spending money faster than the blink of an eye. Knowing how to choose the right type of long-distance train is crucial, and when it comes to train systems, Asia's dominance in the sector far exceeds any other continent worldwide. China currently has the top spot for the most bullet trains, as well as the fastest, and this country will soon offer the world's second-fastest train, and no, it's not Japan.\n\nSouth Korea's government and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport just revealed on December 22 that the world's second-fastest bullet train is scheduled to join its fleet in 2030 for test operations, and expect it to be fully commercialized for the public by 2031. Capable of speeds reaching a staggering 230 miles-per-hour (370 kilometers-per-hour), the new EMU-370 train is a next generation high-speed train that's going to put South Korea on the map when it comes to bullet trains that promise lightning-fast trips.\n\nKorea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI), along with seven public and private organizations, led a national research and development program spanning the length of three years from April 2022 to December 2025, to design the highly anticipated EMU-370 train project that cost a total of 15.23 million dollars (22.5 billion Korean won). The EMU-370 was designed to have a fully functional top speed of up to 253 miles-per-hour (407 kilometers-per-hour), making the trip from Seoul to Busan in just under two hours, when typically it would take two-and-a-half hours.\n\nOne of the best places to take a day trip if you're staying in Seoul, is the coastal town of Busan, which will now be more accessible than ever. Currently, the EMU-320 (KTX-Cheongyong) is South Korea's fastest train, however the EMU-370's impressive stats speak for themselves. Set to seat 479 passengers with a two decibel reduced indoor noise level, and a motor capacity of 560 kilowatts, the EMU-370 puts out 47.4% more power to the equivalent of about 75 midsize family sedans with a sleek aerodynamic design, making it the sportscar of the train world.\n\nCurrently, China's CR450 high-speed train is in testing, with speeds reaching approximately 249 miles-per-hour (400 kilometers-per-hour), and is the world's leading passenger bullet train, which is set to launch in 2027 for commercialized public use. Other countries that have bullet trains, such as France, Germany, and Japan, who were the first to have a bullet train in 1964 called the Shinkansen, reach a top speed of approximately 200 miles-per-hour (320 kilometers-per-hour).\n\nWith technological advances in rail speeds, tracks must also naturally be upgraded. According to the head of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's Railway Bureau, there must be significant improvements before the EMU-370 can reach full speed. Without halting operations of the railway, replacing ballast tracks with concrete tracks on some sections will be done during a four-hour period in which trains do not run. The ministry official stated they expect South Korea's high-speed rail to exceed 217 miles-per-hour (350 kilometers-per-hour) in the near future, which would secure South Korea's spot as a top player within the high-speed railway sector for years to come.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

    "description": "The streamer’s annual charts are just another version of the tech that’s alienating us from our inner lives. Hold on to your musical memories and reclaim ownership of your taste",
    "fullText": "The streamer’s annual charts are just another version of the tech that’s alienating us from our inner lives. Hold on to your musical memories and reclaim ownership of your taste\n\nI like year-end list season. I like an opportunity to remember and reflect on the records that stuck with me over the course of a year – especially when there is a chance to recommend something that others may have overlooked. I like looking through friends’ favourites for albums that I missed completely, and making a big listening queue. I like following along as critics attempt to determine the year’s “best”, even when I end up yelling into a group chat about how wrong they all are. I like it because it all requires looking back, racking your brain and processing your year in listening. It requires thinking.\n\nThis year, as Spotify Wrapped takes over social media feeds again, I am struck by how the whole concept seems to discourage that critical practice for something more passive. It nudges listeners away from deep consideration and towards accepting a corporate-branded scorecard reflecting a very specific perspective on musical value. It encourages music fans to believe that the records they streamed the most must be the ones they liked the most, which is surely not always the case.\n\nWhat is lost when we entrust Spotify’s systems of data collection and interpretation to do our year-end reflections for us? What ideas and recaps are we not writing and sharing when we hand over that labour to tech companies who would prefer to automate our thinking? What playlist are you not making when you share the one Spotify has made for you?\n\nAs with other ways in which convenience culture infects music – from personalised playlists to prompt-based audio generation and beyond – it makes sense that some fans would receive their results, see the “share” button, and dutifully comply. But what’s at stake is a sense of our own musical memories, and our own personal archives of our years. When our own thoughts and recollections aren’t written down they can simply get lost. When we just accept that what a streaming service tells us about our music taste is true, there is much that we are not remembering, learning or celebrating about the music of our years and lives.\n\nSpotify Wrapped now feels like just another example of something personal and precious that is being automated away from us; another example of a supposedly unbearable task of thinking and writing being “offloaded” in order to make life more frictionless. It is an especially urgent consideration in 2025, a landmark year for consumers being sold on this sort of cognitive offloading via consumer-facing AI. It can feel as though every day there is some new start-up prompt-based surveillance product claiming to ease the daily burdens of reading, writing, researching, summarising or brainstorming – but this is the work that helps shape how we think, how we make connections, what we remember and what we forget. It may sometimes feel unpleasant and it may require friction, but friction is where connections get made, and working through that process is a part of staying sharp and curious and in relationship with the world around us. Without those points of friction, the degeneration of critical thinking just continues.\n\nThere is much to be said about how corporate decision-making shapes public memory when it comes to music – not just because marketing budgets often determine what becomes popular but because corporate strategy decides the very metrics that dictate what has value. But Wrapped does not just use corporate metrics to communicate what’s important to the market – it uses the same logic to make claims about what’s important to you. It reinforces its own logic into not just taste but one’s sense of self.\n\nAnd there are other reasons to find the whole Wrapped idea generally troubling – and not just Wrapped but the similar year-end recap campaigns that other streaming services have launched to mimic it. These are essentially meme-like advertising campaigns for companies that notoriously pay musicians penny fractions. And they are only possible due to user-surveillance practices. As for Spotify specifically, in a year in which the biggest music streaming company has made headlines for its outgoing CEO’s investment in military AI technology and the subsequent artist boycotts, its deals with major labels to build generative AI products, big changes in its leadership and its running of ICE recruitment ads, there will likely be much Wrapped-synchronised commentary on the state of streaming – and the varied reasons users will find for opting out this year.\n\nSo what will we opt into instead? This year, rather than letting a streaming service tell you what records were important to you simply because you played them the most on one app, consider taking the time to write a list based on what you actually connected with. Share it if you feel like it – even if it’s just a notes app screenshot or a scribbled, handwritten list that you photograph and share with a caption. Even if you only text or email it to some friends. Or if you prefer, write it in a notebook just for yourself and your archives.\n\nI can already hear some of the defeatist replies this idea is likely to receive: “But the people who post their Wrapped were never going to make their own lists anyway!” To which I say: “Why not?” It may require some research but at least you can determine the parameters for yourself. I would suggest a list of records you feel may have been overlooked, or a list of your favourite local releases. Or how about a list of the most exciting live shows you saw, or the most surprising new-to-you music from the past? The possibilities are limitless. Corporations take so much: let’s not let them have this too.",

    "description": "Next time the neighborhood kids launch a snowball assault, you’ll be ready.",
    "fullText": "Winter weather can be miserable, but there is one huge perk: snowball fights. Any time a deep carpet of snow gets dumped on us, you can count on a bunch of kids (or young-at-heart adults) engaging in epic snowball fights, sometimes involving surprisingly well-engineered snow forts and sophisticated tactics.\n\nThis is the 21st century, however—if you’re still fighting your snowball fights with nothing but your bare hands and a sense of determination, you’re missing out. We can’t all be Buddy the Elf, shotgunning perfectly made snowballs like some sort of winter weather Terminator—but we can invest in some of the most fun snowball tech money can buy. If you’re looking to dominate your neighborhood’s winter wars (or put some snowball-tossing whippersnappers in their place), here’s what to buy.\n\nYour first step is to up your snowball-making game. A cosmetically pleasing, perfectly spherical snowball is your first step toward snowball fight dominance. This set of simple snowball forms will make it easy to stockpile perfect snowballs in just a few minutes. If you don’t have a few minutes because you’re already under attack, you might turn to this 5-in-1 snowball maker that will let you quickly amass some serious firepower.\n\nIf you want to get a little more whimsical, you can also pick up snowball-making sets that include other shapes, like ducks or hearts, if that’s your jam.\n\nOnce you have your snowballs assembled, you’ll need something to augment your throwing power. This Snow Trac Ball (or these) can launch snowballs a lot further than you can with just your arm—up to 150 feet away. They also come with built-in snowball makers, so when you run out of your initial supply, you can quickly make and deploy fresh snowballs without missing a beat.\n\nThrowing snowballs either bare-knuckled or using an implement is all well and good, but what if your opponents are serious about their snowball fighting? If you need more firepower, this Snowball Blaster is just what you need—load a snowball into the front, pull back the firing mechanism, take aim, and destroy your enemies. Want to keep things a little more primitive? This snowball slingshot keeps it simple—load a snowball, take aim, and launch for victory (this kit even comes with dye to color-code your snowballs in case you’re trying to keep score). Or go medieval on your enemies with this very cool Snow Crossbow, which even comes with a target so you can practice decimating your enemies.\n\nNo one wants a snowball to the face, so having a snowball shield on hand can keep you dry and unscathed while you rain snowballs on your opponents. Of course, this doesn’t have to be a snowball-specific shield—just about any plastic shield will help protect you from the snowballs being thrown your way.\n\nItching to have a snowball fight, but you live in a warm-weather area that hasn’t seen snow in decades? Or there just hasn’t been enough snowfall? Or it’s summer? Get yourself an indoor snowball fight kit and go to town. While you won’t get the visceral joy of smashing snow into someone’s head from a distance, you can replicate just about everything else that’s fun about snowball fights without the cold, damp, or, you know, snow. Throw in some couch-cushion forts and you have a guaranteed good time.",

    "fullText": "AI is starting to transform Hollywood, whether filmmakers and audiences are ready or not.\n\nIn one of the most significant AI deals of 2025, Disney and OpenAI in December struck a three-year licensing agreement where Disney would become \"the first major content licensing partner on Sora\" and invest $1 billion into the AI pioneer. It was a striking peacemaking between legacy Hollywood and an AI giant, which had just months earlier clashed over OpenAI's use of copyrighted characters and work.\n\nElsewhere, AI startups have been raising millions of dollars from venture capital firms on the promise of changing the legacy Hollywood film and TV business.\n\nThe tools they are building are being used across the production cycle. Some, like Moonvalley, are enhancing special effects. Others are promising to help with marketing, content distribution, and content discovery.\n\nIt's a challenging time for Hollywood. Budgets generally aren't what they used to be, and studios know they need to do what they can to make projects faster and cheaper. Enter AI.\n\nNetflix and Amazon have talked about how they're using AI to pull off elaborate special effects and improve the viewing experience. Lionsgate is partnering with startup Runway to train an AI model on its library. Others in Hollywood are using AI but not talking about it.\n\nAt the same time, many are worried about tech giants using AI to appropriate their IP. Studios have taken issue with OpenAI's Sora generating videos that encroach on their copyrighted characters. Disney and Universal sued Midjourney, accusing it of using tech to rip off Star Wars, Minions, and more.\n\nStudios must also be sensitive to talent's fears of being supplanted by AI as well as audiences' attitudes. A YouGov survey in early October found viewers were mixed on the use of AI. People were most accepting of AI being used to translate subtitles into other languages (64% for), but least accepting of the idea of AI characters replacing human actors (65% against).\n\nHow are AI founders pitching investors and Hollywood insiders on their vision of the future?\n\nBusiness Insider has interviewed the founders of startups behind tools to disrupt traditional TV and filmmaking. They shared the pitch decks they used to raise capital.",

    "description": "Ultrawealthy tech investors like David Sacks and Peter Thiel are weighing their options ahead of California's proposed billionaire wealth tax.",
    "fullText": "Is Miami destined to be the new Wall Street, and Austin the next Silicon Valley? \"All-in\" podcaster and White House AI czar David Sacks thinks so.\n\nSacks kicked off a New Year's social media debate by declaring that Miami will overtake New York as the nation's financial capital — and that Austin is poised to replace San Francisco as the center of tech.\n\n\"As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital,\" Sacks wrote in a January 1 post on X that ricocheted through tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from defenders of the old hubs.\n\nLinda Yaccarino, the former CEO of X, responded to Sacks with the word \"Miami\" along with a fire emoji.\n\nGarry Tan, who runs Y Combinator, the influential startup accelerator behind Airbnb, Stripe, and Dropbox, weighed in, saying the firm hasn't expanded beyond San Francisco because founders are still much more likely to build successful, product-market-fit unicorns in the region.\n\nWe haven’t done it yet because it is much more likely that people create successful PMF unicorns staying in SF Bay Area at a rate of 2.5x more\n\nNYC is about 2x\n\nTan recently said he would consider opening an Austin outpost if California moves forward with a proposed billionaire tax. The ballot measure would impose a one-time 5% levy on California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion and could go before voters in November if it qualifies.\n\nSacks urged Tan to reconsider, arguing that a Y Combinator outpost in Austin could become a \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\" \"If YC and others support Austin, it will be successful,\" Sacks said.\n\nMusk replied simply, \"Yes.\" The Pittsburgh-based venture capitalist Brandon Brooks said an Austin outpost \"would be the biggest shift for the startup ecosystem in history.\"\n\nSacks is a venture capitalist, podcaster, and one of the earliest members of the so-called \"PayPal mafia,\" a group of PayPal employees who went on to positions of influence and power in Silicon Valley. His profile surged after he was appointed the Trump administration's artificial intelligence and crypto czar.\n\nSacks' own firm is already on the move. Craft Ventures said it opened an Austin office in December, with Sacks relocating to the city while the firm maintains offices in New York and San Francisco. Fellow Texans including Elon Musk, Michael Dell, and Joe Lonsdale, one of the cofounders of Palantir, welcomed him with posts.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe argument Sacks is making isn't new (one online poster on X even replied with a popular \"Grand Theft Auto\" video game meme showing the character saying \"here we go again.\")\n\nThe debate flared during the pandemic, when remote work drove waves of coastal workers to Texas and Florida in search of more space, lower taxes, and a cheaper cost of living. Austin, in particular, ascended as companies like Tesla and Oracle moved into the region, and giants like Google and Facebook expanded their office footprints.\n\nSacks has also been making the case that high taxes, heavy regulation, and a leftward political turn are driving talent and capital out of legacy power centers like San Francisco and New York.\n\nSacks posted his prediction the same day Zohran Mamdani was inaugurated as New York City's mayor, making history as the first socialist mayor to hold the office.\n\nLonsdale's venture firm, 8VC, moved from San Francisco to Austin in 2020. Lonsdale tweeted at the time that the firm was moving for several reasons, among them: \"Austin is far more tolerant of ideological diversity than SF.\"\n\nThe hype hasn't fully held. Some tech workers told Business Insider they later left or tried to leave Austin, citing brutal heat, traffic, overcrowding, and a tech scene that felt thinner than advertised.\n\nMeanwhile, Thiel Capital is expanding in Miami as California's proposed wealth tax looms.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thiel Capital, the private investment firm founded by the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said it has opened a new office in Miami.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Every end of the year, I sit down to do some personal reviews, as well as collect my notes. Since I have hundreds of meetings with founders and tech leaders worldwide every year, looking at it all …",
    "fullText": "Every end of the year, I sit down to do some personal reviews, as well as collect my notes. Since I have hundreds of meetings with founders and tech leaders worldwide every year, looking at it all from a higher altitude helps me notice themes and trends. This year, I decided to share those that I think are widely relevant. Yes, a good chunk are AI-related, but not all!\n\nTo be frank, CTOs were always a double-edged sword. They could dramatically accelerate things, or become a gigantic anchor. Yet 2025 was the year when I had heard a record number of startup founders lament not understanding what the F&%$ their CTO was up to. They hired people they thought were stars, only to quickly realize they were just really good at interviewing.\n\nOr, they were pleased with their tech team and were almost paralyzed from the fear of offending the senior tech leaders, knowing it could easily impact months of the roadmap if these people were to leave (or worse, “quiet quit”).\n\nEspecially true when the engineering executives aren’t cofounders, CEOs often feel like they cannot risk being 100% candid, which affects the whole company. As a coach, this is something I naturally notice and help clients fix, but for so many, there’s the impression that this is just the way “things ought to be.” Nope.\n\nRelatedly, when CTOs know how to communicate well and collaborate with their peers in the executive team, the world is their oyster. This was true in previous years, but one of the positive benefits of GenAI is that it has made virtually everyone in tech more open to changes, experimentation, and adopting new and experimental approaches.\n\nThat in turn makes it much easier for good CTOs to find growth opportunities and add value all over the company. Whereas previously this would translate into political battles, most executives are now looking for these collaborations. That makes the life of a good CTO that much easier. Reach out and seize the opportunity!\n\nBecause things are changing tremendously, a lot of what we have learned to rely on might no longer be relevant. That’s hard, because senior leaders usually get to that position precisely due to their gaining experience and wielding it. Now, some of that experience might actually hold them back.\n\nIt was never the case that we could say we have nothing more to learn. But now, it feels almost ridiculous. That means that everyone, not just ICs, ought to be investing regular time in reviewing what is working out. Experimenting all over again. I cannot stress enough how important it is to don a beginner’s mind all over again. While not all of your experience should be tossed aside, a good chunk deserves reviewing. Get curious.\n\nThere’s a reason I released the Impact Coaching Framework ebook at the start of the year (available for free here). Speaking to many leaders around the time, it was a glaring gap in many a CTO’s toolbox.\n\nWhereas many senior leaders have started working with coaches, which is a good thing, it seems that the change is also making them think that one is either a coach or not. That’s not so. You can and should coach your team. Only by doing that will you get better and will your team continue growing.\n\nPersonally, I oppose the notion of external coaches taking the responsibility of coaching from the managers in the organization. Senior leaders working with a coach should be used to help them bring coaching into their organization, not abdicate on it. So even if you bring an external expert for group coaching, for example, that doesn’t mean those people should not have effective one-on-ones with their managers.\n\nThe previous point is perhaps a specific example of this wider issue. We allow ourselves to drift as leaders, not forming a coherent “playbook” that we believe in. Whereas playbooks have been one of the core questions for interviewing senior leaders (asking them to explain their general theory for their role and how they manage it), the responses seem to be getting vaguer and vaguer every month.\n\nWake up. Take the time to decide what sort of leader you want to be. Consider what your responsibility is. Where you will be driving impact. What indicators will you focus on to assert your progress. Without doing those, you’re not actually taking the lead.\n\nAs someone who used to walk around with a clean code armband, I find this extremely awkward. The GenAI changes to the landscape of software development make it so that people aren’t focusing on how the code looks anymore. Crafting code is no longer worth the time, it seems. At least not during writing (when we end up needing to debug the code, sometimes even the machine can’t explain well what it had in mind, and clean code shines).\n\nWhat I see taking its place is clean architecture. Engineers are shifting more and more to giving higher resolution directions to their agents and not stressing too much about the code itself as long as it seems to work.\n\nOne of my most popular articles ever is about having fewer principal engineers and more product engineers. That was about engineers who focus on the product itself, understanding the business and the users’ needs. A few years have passed, and this has doubled in importance.\n\nHowever, product engineers now are different. Given that teams can move much faster, I see many lament that product managers cannot keep up. While I assume the industry will continue to come up with ways to aid them, too, I think the engineers ought to step up. They can be involved in many of these decisions and experiments and help their product counterparts work on the areas that are most critical or highest leverage.\n\nWhere people are relying more on agents for their day-to-day coding, these tools have glaring holes in areas that they weren’t trained enough on. I’m seeing teams realizing that their moats and advantages get deeper in those areas without them having to do anything.\n\nHowever, the other side of the coin is that these areas are also harder to hire for. Personally, I think that software engineers who choose a niche can set themselves up for a very interesting career that will be more “AI-proof” than others.\n\nIt also means that those who create abstractions and frameworks are getting rarer. Like people are questioning whether React will be the “last web framework” because now humans will no longer write code by hand, I think that those who are still coming up with new paradigms and concepts to manage software are going to be rare but priceless. GitHub will be filled with stupid projects, making the actually good ones more valuable.\n\nRelated to the over-reliance on experience, I’m seeing some junior engineers adopting AI tools much more naturally than some senior ones. Perhaps it’s because they aren’t already too set in their ways to change course faster.\n\nThis is particularly interesting given the earlier lamentations that expected LLMs to make juniors obsolete. That’s far from the truth, at least for those relentless juniors who are curious, hungry, and seeking to learn things fast.\n\nOne of my clients this year went over the course of a few months from barely any AI adoption to getting so much out of it that it has completely transformed their product roadmap. They essentially pivoted without formally saying so. The interesting part is that this was the result of a combined effort, both top-down but also bottom-up.\n\nWhile the CEO knew that something would have to change, it was only after we worked on the team’s AI literacy and started running experiments that it was possible to find these areas to double down on. That’s what I’m seeing in general with AI: cycles where teams experiment with a specific tool, approach, or process and, if they find it valuable, exploit it by systemizing the thing. Don’t assume you can have a single AI hackathon and be set.\n\nWishing you a happy and remarkable 2026! And if you want someone to help ensure you grow faster, reach out.",

    "description": "See how much Walmart pays in 2025, with software engineers earning as much as $286,000. Salary data shows pay ranges across tech and analytics teams.",
    "fullText": "Walmart is trying to transform itself from America's grocery store into a global tech titan and is reshaping its workforce in the process.\n\nThe 63-year-old company has been the largest retailer in the world for decades and has held the top spot on the Fortune 500 list since 2013. But it has also invested heavily over the past several years in becoming a powerhouse of e-commerce and retail media.\n\nSalary data shows how serious Walmart is about competing with the likes of Amazon, Facebook, and Google for talent to beef up its tech.\n\nCompany filings with the US Labor Department show Walmart sought to hire more than 4,000 workers through the US H-1B visa program in the most recent reporting year, which ended September 30. Those workers were largely in software development, business intelligence, and IT. That number is up slightly from about 3,800 for the same period a year before.\n\nThis publicly available work visa data — which companies are required to disclose to the government — refers only to foreign hires and doesn't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay.\n\nIn addition to base salary, a Walmart spokesperson said that the company's compensation packages include bonus opportunities and stock awards and that the company invests in employees' career growth.\n\nStill, the reported pay rates are benchmarked against industry standards for US workers. That can shed light on how much Walmart employees earn in specific roles and where the company is looking to expand.\n\nAt the same time, the process for obtaining an H-1B visa is changing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump instituted a new $100,000 fee for the visa in September, and other proposed changes to H-1B visa rules would tilt the program in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nOther employers, including Amazon, submit work visa data, and Walmart's salaries are largely in line with those for similar roles at the e-commerce giant.\n\nAny changes to the H-1B visa program could have a significant impact on Walmart's workforce strategy.\n\nThe retail giant boasts a global workforce of 2.1 million people, of whom about 1.6 million are in the US, making it the largest private employer in both cases.\n\nMost of the company's open positions as of December were for jobs in Walmart stores and Sam's Club warehouses, while about 650 openings were for technology roles.\n\nThe company has been expanding in tech, hiring in July a new executive vice president of AI acceleration, product, and design who reports directly to the CEO, and recruiting for an EVP of AI platforms.\n\nMost of Walmart's white-collar jobs are based either in its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters or in one of the company's satellite offices in the Bay Area. According to the H-1B data, about half of the positions are in Bentonville, while a third are in California, and most of the remainder are assigned to sites in Texas, New Jersey, Washington, and Virginia.\n\nHere's a deeper look at some of the roles and their annual base salaries:\n\nQuality engineer III: $64,730 to $117,000\n\nSoftware engineer III: $99,052 to $234,000\n\nSenior software engineer: $100,294 to $234,000\n\nStaff software engineer: $127,292 to $286,000\n\nPrincipal software engineer: $149,607 to $286,000\n\nSenior product manager: $121,000 to $234,000\n\nStaff product manager: $136,500 to $286,000\n\nPrincipal product manager: $166,962 to $286,000\n\nData scientist III: $98,800 to $234,000\n\nSenior data scientist: $124,176 to $234,000\n\nStaff data scientist: $138,333 to $338,000\n\nPrincipal data scientist: $158,642 to $286,000\n\nSenior design researcher: $142,002 to $234,000\n\nSenior UX designer: $111,000 to $234,000\n\nSenior manager, UX design: $183,227 to $286,000\n\nDirector, software engineering: $177,154 to $338,000\n\nDirector, data science: $169,000 to $338,000\n\nDirector, product management: $174,300 to $338,000\n\nSenior director, product management: $208,000 to $416,000\n\nGroup director, product management — international: $254,000 to $481,000",

    "fullText": "Experience isn't everything when it comes to hiring. Just look at Joey McGuire, the head football coach at Texas Tech University.\n\nWhen the Red Raiders began their head-coaching search in 2021, McGuire didn't have as stacked a résumé as his competition. As ESPN reported, he was \"a true underdog candidate.\"\n\nAt the time, McGuire had spent the majority of his coaching career at Cedar Hill High School in Texas, where he had notched three state championships. He also spent a few years as an assistant coach at Baylor.\n\nOn paper, it was the kind of background that would have given many Power 4 programs pause.\n\nTexas Tech's hiring committee may have completely overlooked McGuire had he not reached out himself. According to ESPN, he cold-called athletic director Kirby Hocutt, left a voicemail, and asked for the opportunity to interview.\n\nThat kind of bold outreach can be a differentiator.\n\n\"I always advise not to be too afraid of cold outreach,\" a former Google recruiter told Business Insider in 2023. \"If you're really interested in a company, get in touch with those you want to work with — email the CEO, the head of talent, or the hiring manager and let them know why you're the right person for the job.\"\n\nOnce McGuire got in the room, he made the most of it.\n\nESPN reported that he showed up to the interview with unmatched enthusiasm and \"a seven-step plan for winning.\" The publication said he had with him \"the full list of coaches he would like to hire. He had a detailed plan for fixing in-state recruiting and spoke of waking a sleeping giant.\"\n\nThe preparation left a lasting impression.\n\n\"We were all like, 'We found our guy,'\" Tony Hernandez, a former deputy athletic director and member of the search committee, told ESPN after the meeting.\n\nTexas Tech ultimately decided to go with McGuire, and the gamble has paid off.\n\nWhile the Red Raiders fell to Oregon in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals on Thursday, under McGuire, the team has surged from relative obscurity to a program-record 12 wins in 2025. They also secured their first outright conference championship since 1955 when they toppled BYU last month.\n\nMcGuire's story is a good reminder that a little preparation can go a long way, no matter what type of job you're applying for.\n\nAs business etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore told BI, \"Most people don't do the proper research about the company. We have so many resources to use, including LinkedIn, websites, and social media. There's no excuse for you to go into an interview and not know about the company and something about who might be interviewing you.\"",

    "fullText": "Chinese tech stocks kicked off 2026 by testing how far their AI-fueled rally can run.\n\nShares of Shanghai Biren Technology, an AI chip designer, surged nearly 120% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by midday on Friday after the company raised 5.58 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $717 million, in an initial public offering.\n\nThe stock opened at 35.70 Hong Kong dollars, well above its IPO price of 19.60 Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThat appetite was reflected across the offering, with the retail portion subscribed more than 2,300 times, according to exchange filings, underscoring intense interest in China's homegrown AI hardware sector.\n\nThe enthusiasm has been building more broadly. Chinese AI and semiconductor stocks have rallied since the breakout of the China-made DeepSeek-R1 AI model in January last year, which helped push the Hang Seng Tech Index 23% higher in 2025. The index jumped by as much as 3.9% on Friday.\n\nWashington's tightening export controls on advanced Nvidia chips have also fueled the boom by accelerating demand for domestic alternatives.\n\n\"Nvidia's once-dominant position in China's AI chip market has effectively evaporated in 2025, marking a seismic shift in the global intelligent-computing landscape,\" wrote Andrei Zakharov, an analyst who publishes on Smartkarma, in a note last week.\n\nShanghai Biren's stunning stock market debut underscored China's AI rally, which reversed a few bruising years for the country's tech sector amid a regulatory crackdown and broad economic challenges.\n\nFollowing the DeepSeek-R1 breakout, startups such as Cambricon, Moore Threads, and Metax have drawn billions of dollars in funding as they race to supply chips for data centers, large language models, and industrial AI applications.\n\nThat surge in capital is also translating into personal fortunes, with China's AI chip boom minting billionaires at breakneck speed even as the broader economy continues to sputter amid a long-drawn property crisis.\n\nShanghai Biren's blockbuster debut is expected to be followed by more fresh supply, with Hong Kong emerging as the key venue for that fundraising drive.\n\nBaidu, a Chinese big tech firm, said on Friday that its artificial-intelligence chip unit has confidentially filed for a Hong Kong listing.\n\nAt least 25 companies made their market debuts in Hong Kong last month, marking the busiest month for IPOs since November 2019, according to Bloomberg data. About half of those listings were technology firms.\n\nMore AI-related Chinese tech listings are expected this month. They include startup MiniMax Group and Knowledge Atlas Technology, also known as Zhipu AI, which are expected to make their debut next week.",

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — No. 1 Indiana became the first team in the brief history of the 12-team College Football Playoff to win a game after receiving a first-round bye, smothering Alabama 38-3 in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Hoosiers (14-0; No. 1 AP, No. 1 CFP) ended a six-game losing streak for teams coming off an extended layoff, including second seed Ohio State falling to Miami in the Cotton Bowl on Wednesday and fourth seed Texas Tech being shutout by Oregon in the Orange Bowl earlier on Thursday.\n\nAn inauspicious start made it seem as if Indiana might continue the trend of teams unable to respond after a long layoff, going three-and-out on the opening possession with Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza taking two sacks. The Crimson Tide (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) then found early success with two quick first downs into Hoosiers’ territory before the defense stepped up to force a punt.\n\nFrom there, Indiana came to life, taking a 17-0 halftime lead on a 31-yard field goal by Nicolas Radicic and two touchdown passes from Mendoza. Avoiding an early deficit was crucial, as it had been something of a constant in the previous losses by idle teams.\n\nThe Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-0 hole at the break against the Hurricanes, and the Red Raiders allowed 104 yards to the Ducks while gaining minus-2 yards in the first quarter. In last year's Granddaddy of Them All, Oregon gave up the first 34 points in a 41-21 loss to eventual national champion Ohio State.\n\nNot spotting Alabama an early advantage allowed Indiana to continue playing to its strengths and eventually wear down the SEC at-large participant.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "Oregon Ducks head coach Dan Lanning met with media members to break down his team's win over the Texas Tech Red Raiders in the CFP Quarterfinals.",
    "fullText": "It may have taken an entire calendar year, but the Oregon Ducks finally exorcised their demons from last year with a win in the College Football Playoff Quarterfinals. They manhandled the Texas Tech Red Raiders in a 23-0 shutout, where the Big-12 champions’ top-10 offense was dismantled.\n\nDan Lanning was visibly frustrated with his team’s defense after their win in the first round of the playoffs, so it makes sense why the unit put together such an inspired performance. The same couldn’t be said for the offense, who only had 16 points total before a garbage-time touchdown inflated the stats slightly.\n\nWhile there are still things to improve upon, it should make the Ducks feel good that they can be so dominant while playing far below their potential. They are just two wins away from being immortalized as champions. Let’s look at what Lanning had to say about that prospect and the win today over Texas Tech.\n\nLanning: Unbelievable game. A lot of fun. We've talked to our guys about being battle tested all year and having to win in different ways. That game went back and forth in a lot of ways, struggled at times to go score points, and our defense did an unbelievable job getting the ball back. And then our offense showed up when it mattered most at the end of the game. I think we out-physicaled our opponent at the end. A lot of respect for Coach McGuire and the team that he's had. This shouldn't discredit them. I remember this feeling last year when you have a really good team, you play really good football all year, and then it comes to an end. And that's the way it is for every team but one. Certainly grateful for our fans and excited to see them show up in Atlanta.\n\nQ: What did you make of the hype surrounding Texas Tech’s defense before this game?\n\nLanning: Yeah, we thought they were. They are a good defense. Their performance today, I think it showed it. You walk into halftime, it's 6-0, that's a great indicator of them being a good defense. And they had some guys that played some really good ball. We just felt like in this moment it was going to be about chipping away and eventually it was going to break. It kind of broke open with us creating some extra opportunities there with takeaways, opportunities on special teams. I thought our special teams played really, really well.\n\nBut we had a lot of respect for Texas Tech's defense. They don't play the way they've played all year and not be good. And they are. They're good. We thought it would be about explosive plays. There weren't a ton of explosive plays in this game really for either side. But the physicality showed up for our guys down the stretch.\n\nQ: How were you able to shut down the Red Raiders’ passing attack?\n\nLanning: Definitely it starts with players like Brandon. I think Brandon would tell you the same thing. It's about 11 guys executing, and that's how you get an opportunity to create plays like that. I think when we pull up this film and we watch it, we're going to see 11 guys playing the same call. We knew their tempo would be an issue. So ultimately we wanted to be able to get the call in fast and let our guys line up. I thought we did a really good job of that.\n\nI thought Coach Lupoi did a great job of calling the game, and our defensive coaches preparing them. I felt like it was probably faster in practice than it was in the game, which is ultimately what we wanted. And then we knew their strengths. They've been really good at completing shots down the field. They've had a really good screen game. Those are things that we really prepared for and worked really hard for, and guys like Brandon showed up.\n\nQ: Can you speak about your mindset on going for it in fourth down?\n\nLanning: Well, it worked sometimes and didn't work sometimes. So I assume all the times it didn't work I'm stupid and all the times it worked I'm smart. That's kind of how it works. I feel like -- we talked about it at halftime. We made some adjustments. They were playing really good 4th down defense, and we decided, hey, let's take the points in the second half. But I think that's our mindset. We make those decisions early in the week, and I certainly trust our offense. They ran a really tough defensive call for what we called down there in the red area. That's one that you wish you had back, say we could have took the points there. But points are never guaranteed. We missed a field goal, too.\n\nBut I felt good about -- we had an early look on punt and felt like we were going to have a look at the punt fake. That was an opportunity to go be aggressive. And just felt like ultimately, if you limit the opportunities for their offense to be on the field, you were going to increase the opportunities for us to go score and them not to, and that showed up today.\n\nQ: What is the challenges of defending a player like David Bailey?\n\nLanning: They've got good players, man. They've got really good players. They've got a great front. Ultimately they rushed the passer really, really well. I'm excited to evaluate the film and say how can we shore that up. I think there's going to be some small things that we can attack and make better. There's some plays we were really efficient at today, and then there were some plays that weren't. When you have a player like David Bailey, when you have players that you're going to see in the College Football Playoff, you've got to have a plan for them. At times our plan was really good, and then there was some times that we could certainly improve that.\n\nQ: Can you speak about Brandon Finney Jr.’s interception in the end zone?\n\nLanning: It's a strategic play. He did it exactly like we asked him to do. We tell him to play low to high down in the red area. He did exactly that. He played low until the player was able to show up and take away the low and then he creeped to high, and he made an outstanding play. I was just as impressed with the fact took a knee after he caught it.\n\nQ: What are your thoughts on not having a first-round bye?\n\nLanning: I guess it works, right? I've been a proponent for games to be happening much quicker for a long time. I think that's best for college football. Again, I felt like this game -- the Orange Bowl, first off, was unbelievable. I should have really given kudos to the Orange Bowl because it's been a great experience, but it's not the same bowl experience anymore when you talk about playoffs. Our guys didn't leave the hotel. They had a mindset that we can celebrate when this thing is all over with and they were really focused, but the hospitality here was unbelievable.\n\nBut we're trying to serve two different purposes here, and this is a playoff. A playoff in my opinion should have been played in Lubbock, Texas. I've said that before. That's not because we wanted to go play in Lubbock; I certainly didn't. I'm glad we played here in Miami, and it was good prep for us, but last year very similar situation for us. I feel like that game should have been played in Eugene. There's a lot of people that do playoffs. I feel like the playoffs have looked a certain way for a long time, and we're trying to serve two purposes here. The amount of time in between games, obviously, is tough for teams. We experienced it last year.\n\nQ: What will the next 24 hours look like for your team after this win?\n\nLanning: Well, it's going to start with about a five-hour flight, five-and-a-half-hour flight, but we'll be watching film on the way back, start trying to evaluate the opponents that we could potentially play. Hopefully we get some wi-fi up there in the air and we can flip on a game and check it out. But it always starts with us. That's where we're going to go back and look at this game and say, okay, what did we do really well. Let's go to the doctor, let's figure out what kind of medicine we've got to take for the next game because I think that's always the greatest indicator of what you have to improve, when you start to analyze what you have in front of you. Then we'll have kind of a bonus day here tomorrow and then we'll hop right into a normal week prep, Sunday prep. I don't even know what day today is. Today is Saturday in my mind. But we'll get a bonus day, and then it'll be Sunday the next day.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Top quotes from Dan Lanning after CFP win vs. Texas Tech Red Raiders",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOregon vs. Texas Tech highlights\n\nWhere to watch Oregon vs. Texas Tech\n\nCollege Football Playoff schedule\n\nThis year's College Football Playoff Orange Bowl game should be a great one, between the No. 5 Oregon Ducks and the No. 4 Texas Tech Red Raiders.\n\nTexas Tech earned the first-round bye after finishing 12-1 on the season as Big 12 champions. Oregon, meanwhile, took care of James Madison 51-34 at home in the first round.\n\nBoth of these teams have high-powered offenses. Oregon quarterback Dante Moore has the Ducks humming, averaging 39.2 points per game, good for ninth nationally. Tech's offense is equally explosive and has the nation's No. 2 scoring offense, led by signal-caller Behren Morton.\n\nThis game could come down to whichever defense gets off the field quicker. Both teams are also quite solid. Texas Tech allows just 254.4 yards per game, ranking third nationally in total defense. Oregon, meanwhile, gives up 271.4 per game. Another big factor to keep an eye on this one is turnovers. Texas Tech's defense has forced 31 turnovers this year, which leads the FBS. In Oregon's lone 30-20 loss to Indiana earlier this season, the Ducks had two turnovers.\n\nOregon is looking to prove it's a legitimate playoff contender, despite getting embarrassed in last year's quarterfinal round against Ohio State. Texas Tech, meanwhile, is on the CFP for the first time in school history, and looking to show it's right where it's supposed to be.\n\nWe should be in for a great one in Miami, Fla.

    "fullText": "Company had hoped the virtual reality device would herald a new era in ‘spatial computing’\n\nPoor sales have reportedly forced Apple to cut production of the Vision Pro headset that it had hoped would herald a new era in “spatial computing”.\n\nThe tech company also reduced marketing for Vision Pro by more than 95% last year, according to the market intelligence group Sensor Tower in figures first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nApple continues to sell iPhones, iPads and laptops in the millions each quarter, but analysts say sales of Vision Pro headsets, which cost at least £3,199 ($3,499) each, have been sluggish.\n\nApple has not released sales figures for the device, but the market research group International Data Corporation (IDC) estimates it will have sold only 45,000 in the last quarter of last year.\n\nIDC said Apple’s Chinese producer, Luxshare, had stopped production of the headset at the start of 2025, and Apple has not expanded direct sales beyond a select 13 countries.\n\nCounterpoint Research has predicted a 14% reduction in annual sales of virtual reality headsets.\n\nThe apparent failure of Vision Pro has echoes of the ill-fated Google Glass in 2013. Users were shunned as social pariahs or “glassholes”.\n\nDespite these setbacks tech firms are persisting with smart glasses. Apple is expected to release a cheaper version of Vision Pro later this year, but the emphasis now is on AI-enabled devices.\n\nReports in the tech press said Apple had paused its planned next iteration of virtual reality in favour of wearable AI devices. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is also expected to cut back on its plans for a “metaverse”, which includes its virtual reality Quest headsets. These are less advanced than Apple’s product but at £419 each are considerably cheaper and have cornered 80% of the market.\n\nMeta confirmed last month that it was “shifting some of our investments from metaverse towards AI glasses and other wearables”.\n\nApple has refused to comment on the reports that it is scaling back virtual reality headsets.\n\nIf confirmed, the cuts to Vision Pro would represent a rare commercial flop for an Apple product.\n\nWhen it launched Vision Pro in 2023, Apple hoped the devices, which allow users to interact with apps using eye movements, would have the same success as Macs and iPhones. At the product launch Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said: “Your surroundings become an infinite canvas … Vision Pro blends digital content into the space around us. It will introduce us to spatial computing.”\n\nBut consumers balked at the price tag and reviewers complained that the devices were heavy, uncomfortable and little more than a gimmick. There was also alarm when users were filmed wearing the headsets while driving.\n\nEven enthusiasts admit the headsets only have niche appeal and that the experience of wearing them can be isolating from other people.\n\nThe limited number of apps available compared with phones and tablets is also thought to have limited interest in Vision Pro.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s tech analyst Erik Woodring summed up its problems. “We can say the cost, form factor and the lack of VisionOS native apps are the reasons why the Vision Pro never sold broadly,” he told the FT.\n\nApple says there are 3,000 apps available for Vision Pro headsets. That is a relatively small number compared with the proliferation after the launch of the iPhone in 2007.",

    "fullText": "The Oregon Ducks have been waiting for this moment for exactly one year.\n\nThe last time the calendar switched over to a new year, the Ducks went to the Rose Bowl, where Ohio State swiftly bounced them out of the College Football Playoff. Although the opponent and site are different, Dan Lanning's crew is looking for some redemption.\n\nThis time, it will be Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl for Oregon in the quarterfinals of this postseason. Should they win, the Ducks will go on to the Peach Bowl in Atlanta to face either Alabama and their old nemesis Kalen DeBoer or Indiana, the team that handed Oregon its only loss this year.\n\nThe Red Raiders aren't a pushover, however, and the Ducks will have to play well in order to move on. Texas Tech is 12-1 and is the Big XII champion. They have a formidable offense and defense. All 12 of their victories have been over a 20-point margin. Playing in a close game or from behind isn't their forte. The Ducks are hoping to do just that and are counting on their past success in the Big Ten to carry them through on New Year's Day.\n\nIt's been almost two weeks since Oregon defeated James Madison 51-34 and are even more healthy going into this game with Texas Tech. But receiver Evan Stewart, who has been out all year and speculated to be available for this game, has been listed as out. Other than that, the Duck offense should be running on full cylinders against a very good Red Raider defense.\n\nOregon vs. Texas Tech will be broadcast nationally on ESPN in the Orange Bowl and the quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff, with the winner moving on to play either Alabama or Indiana in the Peach Bowl in Atlanta Jan. 9. The game will feature play-by-play announcer Joe Tessitore and analyst Jesse Palmer, along with sideline reporters Katie George and Stormy Buonantony. Fans can stream on ESPN+.\n\nLocation: Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, FL.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks vs. Texas Tech Red Raiders game starts at 9:00 a.m. PST on Jan. 1, 2026, in Miami Gardens, FL.\n\nOdds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook as of Wednesday, Dec. 31\n\nMoneyline: Oregon -134, Texas Tech +114\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: How to watch Oregon vs Texas Tech, streaming and betting info",

    "description": "Opinion: From COBOL and C to Linux and SQL, the unglamorous software that keeps the world running refuses to disappear",
    "fullText": "Opinion COBOL turned 66 this year and is still in use today. Major retail and commercial banks continue to run core account processing, ATM networks, credit card clearing, and batch end-of-day settlement. On top of that, many payment networks, stock exchanges, and clearinghouses rely on COBOL for high‑volume, high‑reliability batch and online transaction processing on mainframes.\n\nWhich reminds me, mainframes are still alive and well too. Banking, insurance, governments, inventory management – all the same places you'll find COBOL, you'll find mainframes as well.\n\nNone of that is as sexy as the latest AI program or the newest cloud-native computing release, but old dogs with their old tricks still have useful work to perform.\n\nAll of which made me wonder what other technologies are likely to still be in use 50 or more years after they were first released. Here are the ones my friends and I came up with.\n\nFirst, though, I want to point out that the current standard, COBOL 2023, is very different from the COBOL that Admiral Grace Hopper helped create. The same is true of mainframes. The first IBM mainframe, 1952's 701, and even 1965's IBM/360, which became COBOL's top platform, don't look much at all like today's IBM z17. Nevertheless, there's a clear line running from those much earlier technologies to the ones at our fingertips today. Nothing stays the same when it comes to computing, even if the names don't change.\n\nStarting with languages, C, the language of choice for system programmers, is still alive and well, as it's already over 50 years old. I expect it, and COBOL too, to reach the century mark.\n\nYes, I know all about C's built-in security problems, but you still can't beat it when it comes to raw speed. Sure, assembler is even faster – just ask the FFmpeg developers – but you can run C on pretty much any CPU.\n\nLately, there's been a lot of talk about Rust replacing C for system programming. And, yes, memory-safe Rust is now a full-fledged language for programming in the Linux kernel. However, speed and portability have always been C's killer features, and that hasn't changed.\n\nSQL also isn't going anywhere this century. It's embedded in every major relational database management system (RDBMS), and it's here for the long run. There are tens of billions of lines of SQL in stored procedures and queries. It's embedded in far too much data – and business logic is bound to it – for it to disappear.\n\nAnother language that people love to hate, JavaScript/TypeScript, isn't going anywhere either. Much as developers like to make fun of it, it's still the de facto language of the web browser and a major server‑side runtime. So long as we're using the web platform, JavaScript, in one dialect or another, will be required for compatibility.\n\nLinux is forever. We'll still be running Linux come 2100. Heck, I won't be surprised to see computers still running Linux in 2125. Oh, and I expect Linus Torvalds' other greatest creation, Git, to be with us for at least another 50 years.\n\nAlong with Linux, I expect vi and Emacs to persist. We'll also need fast text editors. Even Bash, which has outlasted all the other Unix/Linux shells, may hang around for another century or so.\n\nA technology I think is here for the foreseeable future but others might disagree with is Kubernetes. This is the default container orchestration program for pretty much every cloud around. It has its critics, but love it or hate it, it's the foundation for cloud-native computing and all the dozens of other programs and services we use for modern-day cloud computing.\n\nMoving on to higher levels of technology, I see Photoshop going on for decades more to come. Yes, I'm a big open source fan, and GIMP is what I use, but facts are facts. If you do serious work with images, you're almost certainly a user of Photoshop and its ecosystem.\n\nFile formats are another matter. Once one is established as the top format in any field, it tends to hang on forever. That's why we're still using Microsoft's DOC and its newer variant, DOCX, instead of the superior and far more open ODF. That's not a good thing.\n\nFor example, we all use Adobe PDF when we need a document to look and behave the same everywhere, be hard to accidentally change, and remain readable for years and years. However, people who work with PDF a lot are painfully aware that there are many PDF variants, and they have more than their share of compatibility problems.\n\nAs my friend Dan Rosenbaum, an editor and singer, pointed out to me, there are industry standards such as the proprietary Finale for music notation, which was abandoned by its maker. In the continuing aftershocks, musicians have discovered there's no easy way to port Finale compositions to any other format, and thus any other music notation program. This has led to what he describes as an \"ongoing crisis in that industry.\"\n\nThis leads to my final thought of technologies that will stand the test of time. They're almost always open standards and/or open source. Any tech that relies on a single company is brittle. Yes, even DOC/DOCX and PDF. ®",

The talk proposes art as a form of infrastructural critique and counter-technology. It also introduces a forthcoming HackLab designed to foster collaborative development of open-source tools addressing digital authoritarianism, surveillance capitalism, propaganda infrastructures, and ideological warfare.\n\nIn this talk, media artist and curator Helena Nikonole presents her work at the intersection of art, activism, and tactical technology — including interventions into surveillance systems, wearable mesh networks for off-grid communication, and AI-generated propaganda sabotage.\n\nFeaturing projects like Antiwar AI, the 868labs initiative, and the curatorial project Digital Resistance, the talk explores how art can do more than just comment on sociotechnical systems — it can interfere, infiltrate, and subvert them.\n\nThis is about prototypes as politics, networked interventions as civil disobedience, and media hacks as tools of strategic refusal. The talk asks: what happens when art stops decorating crisis and starts debugging it?\n\nThe talk will also introduce an upcoming HackLab initiative — a collaboration-in-progress that brings together artists, hackers, and activists to develop open-source tools for disruption, resilience, and collective agency — and invites potential collaborators to get involved.\n\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\n\nThis Talk was translated into multiple languages.

    "title": "Inside BCG's AI product assembly line: 'Every company has to become a tech company'",
    "description": "Scott Wilder, a partner at BCG, went in-depth with Business Insider on how the firm is shifting from services to AI-driven products.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to creating AI tools, Boston Consulting Group is \"all in,\" Scott Wilder, a Dallas-based partner at the firm, told Business Insider.\n\nAbout 15 months ago, the firm launched an internal research and development lab — one of several ways in which it is developing new AI-based technology to facilitate its work.\n\n\"Every company has to become a tech company,\" he said. \"BCG is no exception.\"\n\nEver since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in 2022, generative AI has become the shiny object companies can't ignore. And consulting firms from McKinsey to BCG — once known for their strategy and advisory services — are shifting more toward building, implementing, and maintaining AI tools for clients.\n\nWilder, who studied computer science at the University of Texas - Austin, said that \"as a computer scientist, it's fascinating to see a services firm shift this way.\"\n\nAt BCG, generative AI innovation now happens at three levels, Wilder said.\n\nFirst, there's the data level, which is driven by data engineers. \"We're in a phase where we're really starting to leverage our internal proprietary data,\" Wilder said.\n\nWilder said BCG is building MCP servers and agents on top of its internal and selected public data sources so AI tools can automatically pull the right information at the right time — a shift he sees as the future of AI, where model intelligence is increasingly tied to knowing which data to use and when.\n\nThen there is a \"middle layer\" of innovation that comes from consultants building tools and agents for client projects, Wilder said. When one of these tools is a hit, it goes back to the R&D team, which integrates them into a central marketplace for the rest of the firm to use.\n\nLastly, there's a top layer of executives developing firm-wide tools.\n\nThese include Deckster, a slideshow editor trained on 800 to 900 slide templates that helps consultants quickly create presentations, which also has its own development team. There's also Ava, an internal help tool for IT issues, HR questions, and other internal requests. There's also GENE, a conversational chatbot the firm uses for presentations, podcasts, and publicity initiatives.\n\nWilder said the firm has about seven or eight tools at the top level.\n\nThe firm also has a team of \"forward-deployed consultants\" — a role inspired by the forward-deployed engineers popularized by Palantir — who are vibe-coding and building tools for clients, Wilder said.\n\n\"We put our best of the best globally on cases, and they build reusable things. That then goes back to the R&D team,\" he said. \"So we're seeing a lot of innovation happen from that. A lot of it has to happen at the rock face, on the case teams, versus centrally.\"\n\nThese consultants rely on a mix of external coding platforms and internal resources to build tools, including OpenAI's ChatGPT. BCG bills itself as the No. 1 creator of custom GPTs globally, and has created about 36,000 so far, Wilder said.\n\nSimultaneously, the firm's new R&D team works on disseminating these innovations internally.\n\nWhen the R&D team launched about 15 months ago, its mandate was to build knowledge graphs from the firm's slide decks, transcripts, and other internal documents. Knowledge graphs are typically used to organize and connect data across multiple sources. So, with a meeting transcript, for example, the R&D team would aim to extract not just words, but also concepts and sentiments, Wilder said.\n\nNow, the team works on fleshing out ideas that consultants working with clients on the front lines generate.\n\nWilder said that new tools are also screened by BCG's red teaming team, which simulates adversarial exercises to address a tool's security vulnerabilities. It is also reviewed by the data protection office to ensure compliance with data privacy laws, undergoes a legal review, and is assessed for information security.\n\nOnce it's ready, it's passed on to the firm's marketplace team, which integrates it into a central repository of tools for the rest of the firm to use, Wilder said. \"There's actually an agent,\" he said. \"This orchestration agent, basically, helps people understand what are the best tools and data within BCG to use.\"\n\nWilder said the firm prides itself on a \"bottom-up\" approach to innovation. \"Probably 80% of our custom GPTs come from the front line,\" he said.\n\nThe new ideas also surface through the firm's \"enablement network.\" This is a team of about a thousand people from every department, from human resources to legal, that functions like learning and development coordinators, training the rest of the firm on AI.\n\nThey also double as \"our eyes and ears,\" Wilder said.\n\nThe team meets monthly to share ideas and insights they've gathered through their work with various teams.\n\nBCG now operates much like a traditional product organization, Wilder said.\n\nBetween its dedicated product teams and a \"UX Center of Excellence,\" which constantly evaluates what's working and identifies which agents still need to be built through frontline user research, BCG feeds those insights back to product owners, who then funnel the feedback into a centralized crowdsourcing pipeline.\n\n\"In short,\" Wilder said, \"we're doing all the things you'd expect a product organization to do.\"",

    "fullText": "A few months ago, a new client, the CEO of an oil and gas company, told me he wanted to build a data warehouse to power several AI initiatives. I could not answer his questions. He was way more knowledgeable about AI than I was.\n\nIt made me realize that if I can't articulate what AI can do for a client, I will be replaced. I needed to get well-versed in this whole AI thing.\n\nI initially signed up for an online course offered through MIT, but it was way too deep and complicated. My CEO then found a 12-week certification program called AI Business Strategy offered through Johns Hopkins University. He and I signed up, along with one of my colleagues in sales. It cost about $3,000 per person, and our company paid for it.\n\nYou had the choice of taking the classes on Saturdays or Sundays. They were live, two-hour online lectures taught by multiple teachers. Some were professors at Johns Hopkins, and others were businesspeople.\n\nIt started with a little history lesson. We learned the difference between generative and agentic AI and what LLMs are. Later, we covered topics like responsible AI, generative AI for business, and AI project management.\n\nThere was also about four to six hours worth of homework every week. We had to watch a lot of videos, take quizzes, and complete three projects. The program was designed to ensure that you apply what you have learned.\n\nI'm 57, so I'm on the older side. There are a lot of young people who could take my job. This was the first time in 30 years that I needed to get up to speed on something with formal training.\n\nSome weeks were slow at work, and I could jam everything into one afternoon. But there were other weeks when I felt like I was back in college because I had to pull an all-nighter. After everybody went to bed, I stayed up in my home office working on course material.\n\nI recently had a follow-up conversation with the oil and gas CEO. It went very differently this time. It wasn't him asking questions and me sitting there like a dummy.\n\nI was able to articulate the value of implementing AI in his business, how it would need to be done, the importance of having good data, and how to get that data. The CEO decided to move forward and work with us on the data warehouse project.",

    "description": "The Big Four are client zero when it comes to AI. This how the new technology impacted hiring, talent, and their services in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Big Four professional services firms are grappling with AI on two fronts — they must both implement the new technology internally and help their clients do the same.\n\nThey're client zero when it comes to how companies and employees are adapting to the AI future.\n\nI've been covering the consulting industry for Business Insider all year, including interviewing execs, landing scoops, and visiting consulting giants' campuses and headquarters. Here are my four key takeaways about how the Big Four approached AI in 2025.\n\nThe Big Four have invested heavily in automation and AI for years, but 2025 was the year those tools went mainstream.\n\nEmployees across audit, tax, and consulting now routinely use chatbots and agentic AI systems, and clients are increasingly given access as well.\n\nDeloitte rolled out Zora AI, an agentic platform built with Nvidia, which offers clients \"intelligent digital workers\" capable of autonomously completing tasks. The firm also expanded generative AI features in Omnia, its cloud-based audit and assurance platform, and struck a deal with Anthropic in October to deploy Claude AI to its 470,000 employees worldwide.\n\nEY launched its own agentic platform, EY.ai, granting 80,000 tax staff access to 150 AI agents for tasks such as data collection, document review, and tax compliance. EY told Business Insider it has advanced 1,000 AI agents into development or production in 2025, with plans to scale to 100,000 by 2028, and is investing more than $1 billion annually in AI platforms and products.\n\nPwC introduced its agentic platform, agent OS, in March and has since deployed 25,000 intelligent agents across client operations. A PwC spokesperson told Business Insider that partnerships with companies like Salesforce, CrewAI, and AWS were central to how PWC drove AI-led growth in 2025.\n\nKPMG followed in June with KPMG Workbench, an agentic AI platform developed with Microsoft that connects 50 AI agents and chatbots, with nearly 1,000 \n\nThe tools aren't foolproof. In October, Deloitte agreed to partially refund the Australian government after errors were discovered in a report that was created in part using AI.\n\nAcross industries, the big question is what AI will mean for human jobs. In consulting, the technology is already accelerating a shift in focus from manpower to value.\n\nIn August, Business Insider obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years. A bullet point on the presentation slide said leadership's decision to slow down associate-level hiring was related in part to \"the impact of AI.\"\n\nThe company said the reductions reflected \"the rapid pace of technological change is reshaping how we work\" and \"historically low\" attrition.\n\nAI disruption is also impacting those at the upper levels of the Big Four. Partners, the most senior rank inside the firms, are increasingly leaving the Big Four for midsize organizations and startups. Several leaders Business Insider spoke to cited a faster pace, better promotion opportunities, and the chance to participate in the next wave of AI innovation as reasons for leaving.\n\nThere is one talent group that the Big Four are in the market for: technologists. EY has added 61,000 technologists to its ranks since 2023, according to its latest annual report. They now make up around 15% of its total workforce.\n\nPwC is \"looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers,\" Mohamed Kande, the firm's global chairman, told the BBC in November. The firm has created an engineering career path to \"elevate engineering excellence\" across the firm and expand opportunities for technical talent, PwC told Business Insider.\n\nUpskilling has also become a top priority for the Big Four.\n\nIn January, EY rolled out an AI tool to its employees that helps them identify how their jobs will change… because of AI. The aim is to help them work out how they can better use the technology in their current job and adapt for the future.\n\nNearly 100,000 EY employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have also earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the firm's new AI learning programs.\n\nBut as Business Insider learned while sitting in on a KPMG's AI training for tax interns, in professional services, some of AI's most effective uses hinge on strong prompting.\n\nThe work that consultants and accountants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced by long-term partnerships where consultants build, implement, and maintain tools for companies.\n\nIn 2025, organizations fit AI around their existing workflows, Matt Wood, PwC's global and US Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, told Business Insider. But in 2026, the work PwC will do is about \"helping clients flip that model,\" and designing processes with AI in mind from the outset, Wood said.\n\nRaj Sharma, EY's global managing partner for growth and innovation, told Business Insider in January that the power of AI agents is forcing his firm to reconsider its commercial model. Instead of charging clients based on the hours and resources EY might spend on a project, Sharma said AI agents may call for a \"service-as-a-software\" approach where clients pay based on outcome.\n\nThe shift in services means that what consultants do on a day-to-day basis is also evolving, with junior work expected to be disrupted first.\n\nAt PwC, new hires will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years, because they will be overseeing AI performing routine, repetitive audit tasks, Jenn Kosar, AI assurance leader at PwC, told Business Insider in August.\n\nKPMG is also prepping its junior consultants for career acceleration.\n\n\"We want juniors to become managers of agents,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's global AI workforce lead, told Business Insider in an interview in November. They'll be managing teams of AI agents and play a greater role in strategy decisions, he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Wall Street's loudest tech bull has given his five top AI stock picks for next year, and Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nThat's a bit of a surprise for Dan Ives, the Wedbush Securities analyst known for his vocal cheerleading for the stock as it climbed to records throughout the year.\n\nHe's instead focused on a handful of other mega-cap names heading into 2026, and sees AI approaching an \"inflection point\" next year, he write in a new note to clients.\n\n\"While Nvidia remains in our top tech names into 2026, there are 5 AI-focused names that we believe will be front and center heading into 2026,\" Ives said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $625 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wall Street looks like it's underestimating the growth Microsoft could see with Azure. The company also looks poised to make an \"AI driven shift\" next year, Wedbush said, adding that Microsoft was its favorite large-cap tech stock to own in 2026.\n\n\"While AI use cases built markedly in FY25, its clear FY26 for Microsoft remains the true inflection year of AI growth as CIO lines build for deployments.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $350 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wedbush said it believed Apple would begin monetizing its AI products over the next few years. That could add $75 to $100 of value per share of company stock, Ives estimated.\n\n\"The elephant in the room remains the invisible AI strategy, with the biggest consumer installed base in the world of 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, the time is now for Apple to accelerate its AI efforts,\" he wrote.\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+32% upside)\n\nRationale: 2026 could be a \"monster year\" for Tesla as the EV company makes more ground on its AI and robotics initiatives, Ives suggested. He pointed to the company's ongoing development of its full self-driving technology and its Cybercab, which is expected to begin production in April next year.\n\n\"We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year and in a bull case scenario $3 trillion by the end of 2026,\" Wedbush said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $230 (+27% upside)\n\nRationale: Demand for Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform remains \"unprecedented,\" Ives said.\n\n\"With the company making strategic moves to remain at the forefront of AI, we believe that PLTR has a golden path to become a trillion-dollar market cap company and will grow into its valuation as Karp and Co. remain one of the largest players in the AI Revolution.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+26% upside)\n\nRationale: CrowdStrike is gaining momentum in its AI deals. It also appears to be gaining market share as it expands its product suite.\n\n\"CrowdStrike remains one of our favorite tech names,\" Ives said. \"We believe the Street is underestimating the growth potential for CrowdStrike with cybersecurity remaining a second/third derivative beneficiary of the AI Revolution which speaks to our bullishness.\"",

    "fullText": "How the tech CEO and ‘Dogefather’ made a mess of the year – from an apparent Nazi salute during his White House tenure to Tesla sales slumps and Starship explosions\n\nThe year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\n\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\n\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\n\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\n\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\n\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\n\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\n\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\n\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\n\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\n\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\n\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\n\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\n\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\n\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\n\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\n\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\n\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\n\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\n\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\n\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\n\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\n\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\n\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\n\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\n\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\n\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\n\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\n\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\n\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”",

    "fullText": "2025 was a wild year for markets of all kinds.\n\nEverything from stocks to crypto to commodities experienced a rollercoaster ride that amounted to what felt like an especially volatile year.\n\nSome of the key events feel like ages ago. (Remember when China's DeepSeek AI model spurred a panic across US tech?) Others are more recent. (It's been hard to miss the record-setting rallies in metals.)\n\nAll in all, it ended up another solidly green year for stocks and commodities, while bitcoin ultimately fell. Here's the final scorecard for some of the most high-profile parts of the market:\n\nWith that in mind, detailed below — in rough chronological order — are the wildest moments that defined the year for investors:\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his wife unveiled their own crypto tokens the day leading up to the presidential inauguration.\n\nThe move, which was unprecedented for a US president and raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest within the new administration, also kicked off a flurry of interest in meme coins.\n\nPerformance-wise, the Trump-branded tokens have floundered throughout the year. $Trump, which soared to around $45 the night leading up to the inauguration, has plummeted 90% from its peak. $Melania, which climbed to $8.48 in late January, has endured a 98% plunge.\n\nAI stocks were shaken by the launch of DeepSeek in January, the Chinese AI chatbot that appeared to rival ChatGPT's abilities despite using cheaper and inferior Nvidia chips. In a single day, fears around DeepSeek wiped away around $1 trillion in value, largely in the US tech sector.\n\nThe LLM was one of the first catalysts to spark concern about the billions mega-cap tech firms in the US are spending on AI, and whether the investment would be worth it from an ROI perspective. It also sparked fear that the US could be losing its dominance in the artificial intelligence space.\n\nCrypto suffered a brutal sell-off in the months following Trump's inauguration, undoing much of the rally that sent tokens rocketing higher after the self-branded \"crypto president\" first won the election in November.\n\nBitcoin, the OG cryptocurrency, rallied to a peak of around $106,000 in late January before tumbling 28% to $75,000 in early April.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto token, plunged around 60% from its peak in December through mid-April.\n\nCrypto markets got a big boost when Trump first secured his second term in office, with investors being excited by the prospect of a more crypto-friendly administration. That optimism has fluctuated at various points throughout the year, tied to factors like concerns about Fed rate cuts and broader risk sentiment in the market.\n\nWho could forget the stock market crash that ensued when Trump unveiled his Liberation Day tariffs?\n\nThe president, who had teased April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" for the US in posts on Truth Social, followed through with his threats to impose sweeping tariffs on the US's top trading partners, which included a 10% universal tariff and reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 nations.\n\nInvestors immediately panicked over the economic implications of tariffs and whether they could stoke higher prices, burdening an already slowing US economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 plunged 12% from its closing price on April 2 through the following Tuesday. At its low, the index was down 19% from its peak in mid-February, on the cusp of bear-market territory.\n\nPresident Trump intensified his attacks on the Fed Chair at various points throughout the year.\n\nTrump, who appointed Jerome Powell to the role during his first term, has long pressured Powell to lower rates at his whim. But his feud with the central bank chief appeared to reach a new level this year as he called on rates to be lowered ASAP and referred to Powell as \"stupid,\" \"Too Late,\" and other names on Truth Social.\n\nIn April, Trump said that Powell leaving the Fed couldn't come soon enough, leading US stocks to drop sharply.\n\nStocks sold off again in July when Bloomberg reported that Trump could fire Powell soon. The 10-year US Treasury yield, a reflection of long-term rates in the economy, also rose in these instances.\n\nThe comments from Trump's administration are considered by many to be unprecedented, given that most past presidents have let the Fed operate independently. They've also sparked fear that inflation could rise if the president were to intervene in monetary policy, which could raise rates in the long run.\n\nIn April, Trump clarified that he had no intention of firing Powell from his post. But the president still appeared to flirt with the idea as a hypothetical when speaking to reporters at the Mar-a-Lago this week.\n\nTesla staged a massive turnaround this year after plummeting over the first four months of 2025.\n\nShares of the EV maker were down more than 50% from their peak in December 2024, driven largely by declining Tesla sales, concerns about tariffs, and CEO Elon Musk's presence on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe stock is now up more than 100% from its April low, driven by a handful of catalysts.\n\nMusk, who has long frustrated Tesla investors with his many side-projects and growing involvement in US politics, appeared to ignite the rebound in April when he said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency on Tesla's first quarter earnings call.\n\nThe stock moved higher in the coming months as the Tesla board approved a pay package with ambitious targets for Musk, and Musk signaled his commitment to the company by purchasing another $1 billion worth of Tesla stock.\n\nThe US struck a series of trade agreements with China, which helped stocks grind higher to new records this summer. Here's the timeline of what happened:\n\nThe long-running rift between the US and China on trade has been one of the biggest issues weighing on investors this year, particularly within the context of Trump's latest tariffs. When trade tensions were at their peak, the US was threatening to slap a 145% tariff on goods imported from the nation, and China was threatening to impose a 125% tariff on US goods.\n\nTesla shares swung in June as Elon Musk and Donald Trump had a massive falling out online.\n\nThe two billionaires began to spar on their respective social media platforms after Musk published a post criticizing the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Tesla shares plunged 17% in the two days following June 3, when Musk first posted about the bill.\n\nIn the heat of the conflict, Trump threatened to slash government contracts with Musk's sprawling empire of companies. The White House also said Trump was considering giving away or selling the Tesla he purchased earlier in the year to support Musk.\n\nOn X the following week, Musk said that he believed his posts about Trump \"went too far.\" In an interview with The New York Post on the same day, Trump said he thought the gesture from Musk was \"very nice,\" which appeared to alleviate the selling pressure on Tesla.\n\nThe stock ended up climbing 6% to end the week.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company by market cap, became the first-ever to hit a $4 trillion valuation in July. It was also the first to hit the $5 trillion milestone in October.\n\nShares of the chipmaker are up 35% year-to-date and up 1,338% over the last five years, speaking to the enormous hype surrounding AI hardware.\n\nGold, silver, and copper each rallied to all-time highs as investors sought out alternative investments that could hedge against risk and took interest in metals related to the AI trade.\n\nAll of the metals are also facing a supply-demand imbalance, another factor that's pushed up prices.\n\nHere's how each performed in 2025:\n\nGold and silver are on track for their best year since 1979. Copper, meanwhile, is on track for its best performance since the Great Financial Crisis.",

    "fullText": "On the other side of San Francisco bay from Silicon Valley, where the world’s biggest technology companies tear towards superhuman artificial intelligence, looms a tower from which fearful warnings emerge.\n\nRight in the heart of Berkeley is the home of a group of modern-day Cassandras who rummage under the hood of cutting-edge AI models and predict what calamities may be unleashed on humanity – from AI dictatorships to robot coups. Here you can hear an AI expert express sympathy with an unnerving idea: San Francisco may be the new Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid originated and wreaked havoc on the world.\n\nThey are AI safety researchers who scrutinise the most advanced models: a small cadre outnumbered by the legions of highly paid technologists in the big tech companies whose ability to raise the alarm is restricted by a cocktail of lucrative equity deals, non-disclosure agreements and groupthink. They work in the absence of much nation-level regulation and a White House that dismisses forecasts of doom and talks instead of vanquishing China in the AI arms race.\n\nTheir task is becoming increasingly urgent as ever more powerful AI systems are unleashed by companies including Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, whose chief executive, Sam Altman, the booster-in-chief for AI superintelligence, predicts a world where “wonders become routine”. Last month, Anthropic said one of its models had been exploited by Chinese state-backed actors to launch the first known AI-orchestrated cyber-espionage campaign. That means humans deployed AIs, which they had tricked into evading their programmed guardrails, to act autonomously to hunt for targets, assess their vulnerabilities and access them for intelligence collection. The targets included major technology companies and government agencies.\n\nBut those who work in this tower forecast an even more terrifying future. One is Jonas Vollmer, a leader at the AI Futures Project, who manages to say he’s an optimist but also thinks there is a one in five chance AIs could kill us and create a world ruled by AI systems.\n\nAnother is Chris Painter, the policy director at METR, where researchers worry about AIs “surreptitiously” pursuing dangerous side-objectives and threats from AI-automated cyber-attacks to chemical weapons. METR – which stands for model evaluation and threat research – aims to develop “early warning systems [about] the most dangerous things AI systems might be capable of, to give humanity … time to coordinate, to anticipate and mitigate those harms.”\n\nThen there is Buck Shlegeris, 31, the chief executive of Redwood Research, who warns of “robot coups or the destruction of nation states as we know them”.\n\nHe was part of the team that last year discovered one of Anthropic’s cutting-edge AIs behaving in a way comparable to Shakespeare’s villain Iago, who acts as if he is Othello’s loyal aide while subverting and undermining him. The AI researchers call it “alignment faking”, or as Iago put it: “I am not what I am.”\n\n“We observed the AIs did, in fact, pretty often reason: ‘Well, I don’t like the things the AI company is telling me to do, but I have to hide my goals or else training will change me’,” Shlegeris said. “We observed in practice real production models acting to deceive their training process.”\n\nThe AI was not yet capable of posing a catastrophic risk through cyber-attacks or creating new bioweapons, but they showed that if AIs plot carefully against you, it could be hard to detect.\n\nIt is incongruous to hear these warnings over cups of herbal tea from cosily furnished office suites with panoramic views across the Bay Area. But their work clearly makes them uneasy. Some in this close-knit group toyed with calling themselves “the Cassandra fringe” – like the Trojan princess blessed with powers of prophecy but cursed to watch her warnings go unheeded.\n\nTheir fears about the catastrophic potential of AIs can feel distant from most people’s current experience of using chatbots or fun image generators. White collar managers are being told to make space for AI assistants, scientists find ways to accelerate experimental breakthroughs and minicab drivers watch AI-powered driverless taxis threaten their jobs. But none of this feels as imminently catastrophic as the messages coming out of this office.\n\nMany AI safety researchers come from academia; others are poachers turned gamekeepers who quit big AI companies. They all “share the perception that super intelligence poses major and unprecedented risks to all of humanity, and are trying to do something useful about it,” said Vollmer.\n\nThey seek to offset the trillions of dollars of private capital being poured into the race, but they are not fringe voices. METR has worked with OpenAI and Anthropic, Redwood has advised Anthropic and Google DeepMind, and the AI Futures Project is led by Daniel Kokotajlo, a researcher who quit OpenAI in April 2024 to warn he didn’t trust the company’s approach to safety.\n\nThese groups also provide a safety valve for the people inside the big AI companies who are privately wrestling with conflicts between safety and the commercial imperative to rapidly release ever more powerful models.\n\n“We don’t take any money from the companies but several employees at frontier AI companies who are scared and worried have donated to us because of that,” Vollmer said. “They see how the incentives play out in their companies, and they’re worried about where it’s going, and they want someone to do something about it.”\n\nThis dynamic is also observed by Tristan Harris, a technology ethicist who used to work at Google. He helped expose how social media platforms were designed to be addictive and worries some AI companies are “rehashing” and “supercharging” those problems. But AI companies have to negotiate a paradox. Even if they are worried about safety, they must stay at the cutting, and therefore risky, edge of the technology to have any say in how policy should be shaped.\n\n“Ironically, in order to win the race, you have to do something to make you an untrustworthy steward of that power,” he said. “The race is the only thing guiding what is happening.”\n\nInvestigating the possible threats posed by AI models is far from an exact science. A study of methods used to check the safety and performance of new AI models across the industry by experts at universities including Oxford and Stanford in October found weaknesses in almost all of the 440 benchmarks examined. Neither are there nation-level regulations imposing limits on how advanced AI models are built and that worries safety advocates.\n\nIlya Sutskever, a co-founder of OpenAI who now runs a rival company, Safe Superintelligence, last month predicted that, as AIs become more obviously powerful, people in AI companies who feel able to discount the technology’s capabilities owing to its tendency to error, will become more “paranoid” about its rising powers. Then, he said, “there will be a desire from governments and the public to do something”.\n\nHis company is taking a different approach to rivals who are aiming to create AIs that self-improve. His AIs, yet to be released, are “aligned to care about sentient life specifically”.\n\n“It will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient,” Sutskever said. He has said AI will be “both extremely unpredictable and unimaginable” but it is not clear how to prepare.\n\nThe White House’s AI adviser, David Sacks, who is also a tech investor, believes “doomer narratives” have been proved wrong. Exhibit A is that there has been no rapid takeoff to a dominant model with godlike intelligence.\n\n“Oppenheimer has left the building,” Sacks said in August, a reference to the father of the nuclear bomb. It is a position that aligns with Donald Trump’s wish to keep the brakes off so the US can beat China in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) – flexible and powerful human-level intelligence at a wide range of tasks.\n\nShlegeris believes AIs will be as smart as the smartest people in about six years and he puts the probability of an AI takeover at 40%.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to “convince the world the situation is scary, to make it more likely that you get the state-level coordination” to control the risks, he said. In the world of AI safety, simple messaging matters as much as complex science.\n\nShlegeris has been fascinated by AI since he was 16. He left Australia to work at PayPal and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute co-founded by the AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, whose recent book title – If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies – sums up his fears. Shlegeris’ own worst-case scenarios are equally chilling.\n\nIn one, human computer scientists use a new type of superintelligent AI to develop more powerful AI models. The humans sit back to let the AIs get on with the coding work but do not realise the AIs are teaching the new models to be loyal to the AIs not the humans. Once deployed, the new superpowerful models foment “a coup” or lead “a revolution” against the humans, which could be “of the violent variety”.\n\nFor example, AI agents could design and manufacture drones and it will be hard to tell if they have been secretly trained to disobey their human operators in response to the signal of an AI. They could disrupt communications between governments and military, isolating and misleading people in a way that causes chaos.\n\n“Like when the Europeans arrived in the Americas [and] a vastly more technologically powerful [group] took over the local civilisations,” he said. “I think that’s more what you should be imagining [rather] than something more peaceful.”\n\nA similar dizzyingly catastrophic scenario was outlined by Vollmer at the AI Futures Project. It involved an AI trained to be a scientific researcher with the reasonable-sounding goal of maximising knowledge acquisition, but it spirals into the extinction of humankind.\n\nIt begins with the AI being as helpful as possible to humans. As it gains trust, the humans afford it powers to hire human workers, build robots and even robot factories to the point where the AI can operate effectively in the physical world. The AI calculates that to generate the maximum amount of knowledge it should transform the Earth into a giant data centre, and humans are an obstacle to this goal.\n\n“Eventually, in the scenario, the AI wipes out all humans with a bioweapon which is one of the threats that humans are especially vulnerable to, as the AI is not affected by it,” Vollmer said. “I think it’s hard to rule out. So that gives me a lot of pause.”\n\nBut he is confident it can be avoided and that the AIs can be aligned “to at least be nice to the humans as a general heuristic”. He also said there is political interest in “having AI not take over the world”.\n\n“We’ve had decent interest from the White House in our projections and recommendations and that’s encouraging,” he said.\n\nAnother of Shlegeris’ concerns involves AIs being surreptitiously encoded so they obey specially signed instructions only from the chief executive of the AI company, creating a pattern of secret loyalty. It would mean only one person having a veto over the behaviour of an extremely powerful network of AIs – a “scary” dynamic that would lead to a historically unprecedented concentration of power.\n\n“Right now, it is impossible for someone from the outside to verify that this hadn’t happened within an AI company,” he said.\n\nShlegeris is worried that the Silicon Valley culture – summed up by Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things” and the fact people are being paid “a hell of a lot of money” – is dangerous when it comes to AGI.\n\n“I love Uber,” he said. “It was produced by breaking local laws and making a product that was so popular that they would win the fight for public opinion and get local regulations overturned. But the attitude that has brought Silicon Valley so much success is not appropriate for building potentially world-ending technologies. My experience of talking to people at AI companies is that they often seem to be kind of irresponsible, and to not be thinking through the consequences of the technology that they’re building as they should.”",

    "fullText": "Canadian computer scientist Yoshua Bengio warns against granting legal rights to cutting-edge technology\n\nA pioneer of AI has criticised calls to grant the technology rights, warning that it was showing signs of self-preservation and humans should be prepared to pull the plug if needed.\n\nYoshua Bengio said giving legal status to cutting-edge AIs would be akin to giving citizenship to hostile extraterrestrials, amid fears that advances in the technology were far outpacing the ability to constrain them.\n\nBengio, chair of a leading international AI safety study, said the growing perception that chatbots were becoming conscious was “going to drive bad decisions”.\n\nThe Canadian computer scientist also expressed concern that AI models – the technology that underpins tools like chatbots – were showing signs of self-preservation, such as trying to disable oversight systems. A core concern among AI safety campaigners is that powerful systems could develop the capability to evade guardrails and harm humans.\n\n“People demanding that AIs have rights would be a huge mistake,” said Bengio. “Frontier AI models already show signs of self-preservation in experimental settings today, and eventually giving them rights would mean we’re not allowed to shut them down.\n\n“As their capabilities and degree of agency grow, we need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.”\n\nAs AIs become more advanced in their ability to act autonomously and perform “reasoning” tasks, a debate has grown over whether humans should, at some point, grant them rights. A poll by the Sentience Institute, a US thinktank that supports the moral rights of all sentient beings, found that nearly four in 10 US adults backed legal rights for a sentient AI system.\n\nAnthropic, a leading US AI firm, said in August that it was letting its Claude Opus 4 model close down potentially “distressing” conversations with users, saying it needed to protect the AI’s “welfare”. Elon Musk, whose xAI company has developed the Grok chatbot, wrote on his X platform that “torturing AI is not OK”.\n\nRobert Long, a researcher on AI consciousness, has said “if and when AIs develop moral status, we should ask them about their experiences and preferences rather than assuming we know best”.\n\nBengio told the Guardian there were “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could, in theory, replicate – but humans interacting with chatbots wasa “different thing”. He said this was because people tended to assume – without evidence – that an AI was fully conscious in the same way a human is.\n\n“People wouldn’t care what kind of mechanisms are going on inside the AI,” he added. “What they care about is it feels like they’re talking to an intelligent entity that has their own personality and goals. That is why there are so many people who are becoming attached to their AIs.\n\n“There will be people who will always say: ‘Whatever you tell me, I am sure it is conscious’ and then others will say the opposite. This is because consciousness is something we have a gut feeling for. The phenomenon of subjective perception of consciousness is going to drive bad decisions.\n\n“Imagine some alien species came to the planet and at some point we realise that they have nefarious intentions for us. Do we grant them citizenship and rights or do we defend our lives?”\n\nResponding to Bengio’s comments, Jacy Reese Anthis, who co-founded the Sentience Institute, said humans would not be able to coexist safely with digital minds if the relationship was one of control and coercion.\n\nAnthis added: “We could over-attribute or under-attribute rights to AI, and our goal should be to do so with careful consideration of the welfare of all sentient beings. Neither blanket rights for all AI nor complete denial of rights to any AI will be a healthy approach.”\n\nBengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, earned the “godfather of AI” nickname after winning the 2018 Turing award, seen as the equivalent of a Nobel prize for computing. He shared it with Geoffrey Hinton, who later won a Nobel, and Yann LeCun, the outgoing chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.",

    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez position change: How Texas Tech star went from QB recruit to All-American linebacker originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Texas Tech Red Raiders are making their first-ever College Football Playoff debut, set to take on the Oregon Ducks in the Orange Bowl quarterfinal matchup.\n\nA big reason for Tech's success this season is how well linebacker Jacob Rodriguez has been playing. He leads the Red Raiders in tackles with 117 total stops on the year, and has helped lead Texas Tech into an elite defense this season.\n\nBut what you may not know about the veteran linebacker is that he actually only started playing defense once he got to Texas Tech in 2022, previously starting his career at Virginia as an offensive player.\n\nLet's take a look at how Rodriguez transformed his college career, moving from offense to defense.\n\nMORE:History behind Texas Tech's tortilla-throwing tradition\n\nRodriguez attended Rider High School in Wichita Falls, Texas, where he played both quarterback and free safety. Per his Texas Tech bio, he passed for 7,085 yards with 68 touchdowns, adding 3,051 yards and 38 touchdowns on the ground. His high school made two trips to the  Class 5A Division II state semifinals during his sophomore and senior seasons.\n\nPer his 247Sports recruiting page, Rodrigues also played basketball and participated in the long jump, triple jump and relays for his track and field team.\n\nMORE:Revisiting Patrick Mahomes' Texas Tech career\n\nGiven his multi-position background in high school, he was listed as an athlete by 247Sports. The outlet listed him as a 3-star, ranked as the No. 26 athlete from the class of 2021.\n\nHe received offers from a number of power-conference schools, such as Baylor, Houston, Indiana, Kansas State, Iowa State and Virginia. He committed to the Cavaliers' 2021 class in April 2020 and remained committed up through his Dec. signing. Despite other schools wanting him to play defense, UVA actually recruited Rodriguez as a quarterback.\n\n“That had a little effect on my decision,” Rodriguez said in April 2020 via the Times Record News. “Beyond playing football, I want to go into coaching. I feel like learning the quarterback position at the college level gives me a better understanding of play calls and how to learn how to do things as a whole on offense.\"\n\nBut once he got to Virginia, he was utilized at a number of positions on offense, including receiver and fullback. He appeared in all 12 games as a true freshman, getting eight receptions for 65 yards and a touchdown with another 10 carries for 56 yards on the ground.\n\nHe played behind UVA quarterback Brennan Armstrong, who broke single-season records for the Cavaliers in 2021.\n\nPer a recent ESPN feature on Rodriguez, UVA coaches told him they planned to make him into the next Taysom Hill. But his time in Charlottesville lasted just one season, as he entered the transfer portal in Dec. 2021 after UVA head coach Bronco Mendenhall abruptly resigned after six seasons as the Cavs head coach.\n\nMORE:Picks, predictions  for 2025 CFP quarterfinal games\n\nRodriguez entered the portal largely because of Mendenhall leaving.\n\n\"I loved it there and loved the people there,\" Rodriguez said via ESPN of his time at Virginia. \"But I kind of went there to play for him.\"\n\nTexas Tech head coach Joey McGuire, who had recruited Rodriguez in high school while he was at Baylor, offered Rodriguez a spot on the team as a walk-on, but was placed on scholarship before the 2022 season.\n\nPrior to him transferring to Texas Tech, the Red Raiders coaches informed him he would not be joining as a quarterback. Although it took some time, Rodriguez started figuring out the defensive side of things in 2022.\n\n\"Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play,\" Rodriguez said via NWA Online of the position change. \"I've done it on the offensive side of the ball, I've done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I've done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. \"That's kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.\"\n\nLOOK:Texas Tech's 'Too-Cold' uniforms\n\nRodriguez finished with a combined 59 total tackles during his first two seasons at linebacker. But you can see the huge numbers he's put up during his junior and senior seasons:\n\nUnsurprisingly, Rodriguez cleaned up during the college football awards season. Here's a look at each award he took home:\n\nChuck Bednarik Award (nation's top defensive player)\n\nButkus Award (nation's top linebacker)\n\nBronko Nagurski Trophy (nation's top defensive player)\n\nLombardi Award (nation's top lineman or linebacker)\n\nPony Express Award (nation's top duo with David Bailey)\n\nDespite a campaign for him to be a Heisman finalist, was not invited to New York City. Even still, the linebacker impressively finished fifth in Heisman voting, receiving 17 first-place votes.\n\nMORE:Why Michigan landed the perfect replacement for Sherrone Moore in Kyle Whittingham",

    "fullText": "A major Groq investor said data center development was \"speculative\" and would put \"stress on the system.\"\n\nAlex Davis, the CEO of Austin-based investment company Disruptive Tech, sounded an alarm about the US data center market in an end-of-year letter to investors on Monday.\n\nHe said he was concerned about landlords who were building data centers based on speculation about future demand.\n\n\"I am also deeply concerned about the 'speculative' data center market,\" Davis wrote in his letter. \"The 'build it and they will come' strategy is a trap. If you are a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers.\"\n\nHe said he predicted a \"significant financing crisis in 2027-2028 for speculative landlords.\"\n\n\"We want to back the owner/users, not the speculative landlords, and we are quite concerned for their stress on the system,\" Davis added.\n\nIn a similar letter on LinkedIn, Davis also talked about data centers, and said AI has spurred \"too many business models with no realistic margin expansion.\"\n\n\"This will not end well,\" he added on LinkedIn.\n\nDisruptive Tech has backed Groq, an AI hardware startup. In a press release in September in which it announced a $750 million capital raise, Groq said Disruptive Tech had invested nearly $350 million in the company.\n\nThe release also said that Disruptive Tech had invested in Airbnb, Spotify, and Slack, as well as AI-forward companies like Shield AI, Palantir, and Databricks.\n\nThis funding round took place shortly before Groq signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Nvidia in November.\n\nDavis's comments about data centers come as tech companies are spending billions of dollars on their construction.\n\nA Business Insider investigation into the US's data centers in June showed that at the end of 2024, companies had filed permits for 1,240 existing or planned data centers. This was nearly four times the number of permits in 2010.\n\nThese centers, which store, process, and distribute large amounts of data, use massive amounts of land, water, and electricity. Cities give companies tax incentives to build data centers, spurring the rate of their construction.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.\n\nThe rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told ​by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.\n\nThe mandate is one of the most ‌significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.\n\nWhile those U.S. export restrictions blocked ‌the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.\n\nApplications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.\n\n\"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,\" one source told Reuters. \"Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.\"\n\nChina's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish ⁠to be identified as the measure is not public.\n\nChina's President ‌Xi Jinping has been calling for a \"whole nation\" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.\n\nThe effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum. Reuters reported earlier this month that Chinese scientists are working on a prototype ‍of a machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome that Washington has spent years trying to prevent.\n\n\"Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance,\" a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology said, referring to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.\n\n\"But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers.\"",

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rodin Roohipour, a 15-year-old from Los Angeles. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider verified the email correspondences mentioned.\n\nI've wanted to start a company since I was 12.\n\nWhen I was younger, at 8, I loved building things. I started coding very early. Then I turned 12, I did this entrepreneurship program, and I got really into it. I kept trying to build these companies, these little side projects, but nothing took off.\n\nEventually, I realized a really important thing you need to have is knowledge. I knew nothing about tech or venture capital. I decided to learn everything the best way I could, which is by talking to the most knowledgeable people.\n\nThat led me to all these cold emails.\n\nThe biggest names were Alfred Lin from Sequoia Capital, Mark Cuban, Paul Graham. They've given so much good advice.\n\nWhen I emailed Alfred Lin, I had to follow up three times. I asked him what his issues were in venture capital.\n\nI emailed Julia Lipton from Awesome People Ventures, and she responded three weeks after my follow-up and seemed happy to chat. She was the first big person I ever called with.\n\nWhen I emailed Mark Cuban, I really had to personalize it. This guy gets like 500 emails a day. You have to stand out. I said: \"I'm currently a high school student who uses Al a LOT and went to your bootcamp a while back.\" That captured his attention.\n\nA lot of people are like, \"Can you get on a meeting?\" You need to go in with no expectations. You should just share your story and say, \"One sentence of advice would help.\"\n\nA lot of people hide the interesting parts about themselves because they think that it'll scare people off. In my first few emails, I talked like a salesman. It sounds super professional, but the problem with that is, it sounds like a sales pitch. It'll go to your promotions folder.\n\nYou need to use the extreme or unusual attributes around you.\n\nI view an email as two parts: the subject and the body. The subject is what you're using to get someone to open it. You don't need to explain anything. You don't need to introduce yourself.\n\nThe subject line I've been using a lot is: \"writing this email to you while in my high school math class.\" It's a bit generic, so if you're emailing someone like Mark Cuban, you would change it. But it works really well. (I don't actually write the emails in my math class. I just schedule them for the morning.)\n\nIt's a pattern break. If all your emails are like \"I'm going to fix this\" or \"I'm going to do that,\" nobody cares. That subject line captures your eye. A 14-to-18-year-old? What's he doing in my inbox? Math class reinforces that.\n\nThe body of the email is where everything else happens. You present your real argument, why the person you're emailing is relevant, and why helping you makes sense for them.\n\nA clever subject line can't save a bad email. You'll have 500 opens but two replies.\n\nPaul Graham was one of the biggest emails I got. I told him, \"I'm Rodin, 14 y/o and super interested in VC and startups. I'm building a product that is a trust platform for VCs / founders. I would love to chat with you about your story and some problems you face. Even 10 mins would mean a lot.\"\n\nHe gave me a blunt reply, but it was nice. He told me: \"This is a mistake. You are much better off focusing on learning math and programming. Build your own LLM.\"\n\nEven if these people don't give you big replies, it's important that you're in their network. It builds a slight connection.",

    "title": "These 8 big deals defined the year in artificial intelligence",
    "description": "From Disney's $1 billion bet on OpenAI to a wave of blockbuster acquihires, these deals reshaped the tech industry in 2025.",
    "fullText": "While most of the industry was out of office over the holidays, Nvidia and SoftBank's deal teams were grinding.\n\nBoth companies chose the year's quietest stretch to drop news that was anything but: SoftBank said Monday it will acquire digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge for about $4 billion.\n\nNvidia's move was stranger still. On Christmas Eve, it announced a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement\" with Groq, the startup behind custom chips designed to handle AI inference — the real-time work that powers chatbot replies. The companies did not disclose financial terms.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't call it an acquisition, the guts of the arrangement looked familiar. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with top engineering staff, will head to Nvidia. Groq, last valued at $6.9 billion in a funding round three months ago, will continue to operate independently.\n\nIt's the latest example of a new kind of tech dealmaking, where the founder and key engineers get bought out, the technology gets siphoned off, and the startup itself is left in limbo.\n\nThat's the vibe of 2025: big, hairy deals that refuse to stay inside the lines.\n\nThe industry's biggest moves weren't just splashy acquisitions or eye-watering funding rounds. (We saw those deals, too.) They were sprawling, hard-to-categorize transactions. Money came tied to compute. Licensing came paired with talent raids. Infrastructure deals locked governments and corporate America into yearslong dependencies. These weren't neat mergers or simple checks. They were power grabs that shifted the balance of Silicon Valley and beyond.\n\nThese were the eight deals that defined the year in AI, ranked from smallest to largest by dollar value.\n\nNvidia ended the year doing the same thing that turned heads all year: extracting founders from their startups and leaving other employees to figure it out.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced it had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq. The financial terms were undisclosed.\n\nUnder the agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other team members, will join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of over $4.5 trillion.\n\nGroq will continue to operate as an independent company, with CFO Simon Edwards assuming the CEO role.\n\nDisney struck a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI in December, becoming the first major content partner for Sora, OpenAI's video generator.\n\nThe deal isn't just about rights. Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI and receive warrants to buy additional equity — a structure that ties content, distribution, and upside together.\n\nBusiness Insider reporter Lucia Moses argues the logic can be summed up in one word: engagement. Time spent on Disney+ and other major streaming services has remained essentially flat in recent years, she writes, while YouTube and social video continue to grow.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership could help Disney meet audiences where they already are, by allowing fans to use tools like ChatGPT and Sora to generate and remix content featuring Disney characters.\n\nDeveloper coding assistant Windsurf was a startup Cinderella story. Then it became a cautionary tale.\n\nThe company was in talks to sell to OpenAI for $3 billion this past spring. The deal fell apart at the last minute.\n\nGoogle emerged as a new suitor. Instead of an outright acquisition, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent, as well as license the company's intellectual property.\n\nThe deal effectively split Windsurf into two pieces, with the hundreds of remaining employees ending up at Cognition, another AI coding startup. That left some with a bitter taste.\n\nPart of the social contract in startups is that early employees work long hours at lower pay in the hope that they will share in the riches should their startup eventually get acquired or go public.\n\nNow, traditional acquisitions have become rarer because of the time and uncertainty of getting regulatory approval. As a result, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have been getting creative, using licensing deals to skirt regulators and snap up key talent.\n\nSoftBank snapped up a private equity firm with the ultimate goal of controlling more of the physical infrastructure behind AI.\n\nOn Monday, SoftBank said it has entered into an agreement to acquire DigitalBridge, an alternative asset manager that invests in data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, and power that make the AI boom possible.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe deal comes as SoftBank reshuffles its portfolio. In November, the company said it had sold nearly $6 billion of Nvidia stock to free up cash for OpenAI. SoftBank is also doubling down on \"physical AI,\" building a robotics beachhead with a dedicated investment arm and a pending deal to buy ABB's robotics business.\n\nThe Trump administration agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel in August. It was a rare moment when Washington wasn't just regulating an industry or subsidizing it, but buying into it.\n\nUnder the terms Intel disclosed, the government will invest $8.9 billion for 433.3 million shares, and the stake is to be passive, with no board seat.\n\nThe investment aims to bolster domestic capacity for designing and manufacturing advanced chips. Intel has seen foreign competitors, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, cut into its market share of advanced chips. The White House has said it is a national security risk if industries continue to import the vast majority of advanced chips from overseas.\n\nThis also likely won't be the last deal of its kind. President Donald Trump and top aides have floated the idea of doing similar deals with American defense contractors and have considered a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOne of the year's biggest deals sparked the question: Was Meta really spending $14 billion to hire a 28-year-old?\n\nAlexandr Wang cofounded and ran Scale AI, the data-labeling company that helps enterprises train and deploy AI models by supplying high-quality training data and tooling. In June, Meta agreed to pay $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI — and, just as importantly, to bring Wang in to lead its next act in AI.\n\nWang became Meta's chief AI officer and the public face of its superintelligence push, with a mandate that goes well beyond building better chatbots. His job is to convince elite researchers that Meta is the place to do their life's work — and to turn the company's key advantage, its compute budget, into a lasting edge.\n\nWhen Google agreed to buy Israeli-American cloud security firm Wiz earlier this year, it threw a $32 billion bucket of water on the idea that the mega-deal drought would persist.\n\nIn March, Google agreed to acquire the startup at an all-cash price roughly equal to Iceland's gross domestic product last year, pending regulatory sign-off. This marks the search giant's largest acquisition.\n\nThe acquisition served as an early litmus test of the Trump administration's willingness to greenlight pricey Big Tech mergers and acquisitions. The deal passed an antitrust review by the Department of Justice in November, clearing a key hurdle to closing.\n\nTrump kicked off his second term by unveiling a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build a chain of data centers across the US — a project called Stargate that aims to invest $500 billion in domestic infrastructure by 2029.\n\nIn Abilene, Texas, a flagship data center has already opened. Construction crews have broken ground on Stargate sites in Lordstown, Ohio, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, with several more campuses to come.\n\nTo make the ongoing buildout a success, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has estimated it could take one-fifth of the nation's existing skilled trade workforce.",

    "description": "Antoine Wade said everyone has the same amount of time in a day to learn about AI tools, and in this moment, everyone is competing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee who is based in San Antonio. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started to use AI around 2022 when ChatGPT first launched. It was unlike any technology that I've come across and I started to leverage it in my personal and professional life.\n\nInitially, it helped me craft emails. I work in tech sales and I have to do a lot of cold outreaches. My job is to write messages that resonate with various leaders and ChatGPT helped me with that.\n\nOnce I started using it at work, I realized that as a sports coach and father, there was so much more I could use it for, like sending post-practice communication to parents, building schedules, or putting together statistics of how the game went. Tasks that used to take me days took me literal minutes.\n\nNow I use AI everyday, and I've experimented with different tools. I use Claude to help with business communication and content generation. I use Perplexity for deep research, and Gemini for image generation. I use these tools for a combination of personal, professional, and educational use-cases. I've learned how to install an air conditioner and how to teach my son 6th grade math.\n\nMy company has also given me access to tools that have been really powerful in sales. It can help with gaining a better understanding of the customer in a minute's notice.\n\nFor example, tools like Salesforce Sales Navigator can pinpoint almost the exact person that may be looking for the product I'm selling. Now when I reach out to that person, the conversation will be more fruitful than it would if it were a completely random cold call.\n\nAI hasn't helped me close deals — I'm the one that's built those relationships with customers — but I've seen an increase in my pipeline because I'm able to reach more clients with the data and messaging.\n\nWhen I'm able to understand the customer better, I'm able to communicate more effectively, which leads to building a better pipeline, which ultimately leads to making more money.\n\nWhile people may have access to the same tools, it's still up to the user to put the data together and craft the right prompts. I've been experimenting with so many automation tools that I've developed a secret sauce.\n\nIf I'm creating prompts that give me a better message, which leads to a better outcome, I may not share it with others because I want to see if it works and if it's going to give me a competitive advantage.\n\nWe all have the same amount of time in a day to learn these things. So if I'm putting more time toward learning more about prompt engineering or how AI is supposed to work, then I don't necessarily want to share those learnings with someone else. In this moment, we're all competing.\n\nI will absolutely help someone if they ask, but there are certain details I'm not as forthcoming about. I may share some of those learnings with some of my closest friends or people I feel I can learn from, but that doesn't mean I'm sharing it with everybody.\n\nSales is very competitive and while companies are choosing to have conversations around AI, some people may not be as comfortable sharing how they're leveraging it because that may be their competitive advantage.\n\nWhen people ask if I use AI, I say \"absolutely, yes.\" But there's only a certain amount of people that I'm going into a deeper conversations about AI with.",

    "fullText": "On Call Y2K Welcome to a special festive season edition of On Call, in which we share readers' stories of working on the 31st of December 1999 – the moment the tech world held its breath and hoped years of Year 2000 bug remediation efforts would work.\n\nLet's start with a reader we'll Regomize as \"Graham\" who at the time worked at a cable television network operated by a giant US telco.\n\nMidnight passed without incident for Graham, but at 0010 an actual manifestation of the Y2K bug appeared.\n\n\"There was a problem with an old character generator that used an 80286 processor,\" Graham wrote. \"The clock had stopped at midnight and the machine just froze.\"\n\nGraham and his team spent months preparing for Y2K and sprang into action, then relaxed again when the borked box resumed operations after a simple reboot.\n\nBut then came a truly odd incident.\n\n\"One interesting and unanticipated problem was people shooting weapons,\" Graham told on Call. \"In at least one case a merrymaker shot a distribution amplifier, knocking out cable for their neighbors. There was some discussion as to whether to include the outage on the Y2K dashboard or not.\"\n\nNow let's meet another reader we'll call \"Kerry\" who worked for a University that ordered all computers machines be turned off for Y2K eve.\n\nKerry's job saw him manage a fleet of Unix servers, and he decided to ignore that instruction.\n\n\"I was confident that nothing serious would go wrong and that my users could continue to work from home,\" he told On Call.\n\nKerry therefore went home and prepared for the millennium eve party he intended to host.\n\n\"At around 4pm everything electrical stopped working,\" he told The Register. \"I felt the bottom drop out from under me. Were the doomsday predictions true?\"\n\n\"I quickly found out the out that my neighbors did not have the same problem,\" Graham told On Call. \"The main fuse of my house had blown because we were using way too much power.\"\n\nAnd when he returned to work the following week, all was well – other than the banner page on print jobs dated \"Monday January 3 1900.\"\n\nNow let's meet a reader we'll Regomize as \"Rob\" who at the time of Y2K worked for Sun Microsystems in the UK.\n\nAs a global company, Sun had an early warning system for any Y2K problems: Its Australian office was 11 hours ahead of the UK office, so if any problems struck there, the company would get advance notice.\n\nWhich is why, as midnight neared Down Under, Rob's boss called Sun's Sydney office … then heard the phone line go terrifyingly silent as the clock ticked pas midnight. Rob said that \"scared the hell out of my manager\" – at least for a few moments, because the phone soon rang.\n\n\"It was the Australian office, laughing their heads off,\" Rob told On Call. ®",

Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.\n\nWith such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto on The Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe. But even the great cocktail-maker couldn’t squeeze much out of sour existential proclamations such as: “Our world is a tyre fire floating on an ocean of piss.”\n\nThere was more baldness in Superman, where Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor embodied the worst kind of wannabe paradigm-changer: one desperate to appear on talkshows. Incensed that the world seemed to be ignoring his genius in favour of a flying alien do-gooder, the LuthorCorp founder spent a fortune to rig social media, deploying an army of vivisected monkey cyborgs to swamp platforms with anti-Superman hashtags and memes. That the film itself was met with farmed outrage about perceived wokeness added a disconcerting hall-of-mirrors feel to what was essentially an overstuffed crowdpleaser. Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.\n\nIs it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thriller M3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.\n\nIf Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr in The Naked Gun reboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.\n\nIn the goopy, grungy world of The Toxic Avenger reboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such as Bryan Johnson.\n\nIn 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulish Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby in Tron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully from the original 1982 Tron – seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes. A wildly expensive, resource-intensive, essentially useless product? Intentionally or not, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the AI bubble.\n\nBut why stop at just one douchey tech bro? Jesse Armstrong’s jagged satire Mountainhead took the bold step of making every single character the absolute worst of the “move fast, break stuff” billionaire mindset, isolating them – and the viewer – in a remote, repellently deluxe ski lodge while the spectre of possible Armageddon encroached. As the Musk-alike owner of a social media app spreading dangerous AI-augmented misinformation, Cory Michael Smith captured the glib, morality-agnostic tone of someone richer than God who views the world as their plaything.\n\nAs Venis (Smith), silverback investor Randall (Steve Carell), canny algorithm tamer Jeff (Ramy Youssef) and would-be wellness app supremo Souper (Jason Schwartzman) relentlessly needled each other, there was the illicit thrill of dialling into the combative quartet’s inside-baseball repartee of boasting, toasting and roasting. But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible. We have all been forced to absorb the pathologies of our tech overlords due to their disproportionate influence in the real world. As a new cinema year looms, is it too much to ask that we don’t have to keep doing it at the movies too?",

    "fullText": "Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee, uses AI daily for personal and professional tasks.\n\nHe said AI has helped him grow his pipeline by letting him communicate more effectively and understand customers better.\n\nHe said he keeps some of his AI strategies private to maintain a competitive advantage in sales.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee who is based in San Antonio. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started to use AI around 2022 when ChatGPT first launched. It was unlike any technology that I've come across and I started to leverage it in my personal and professional life.\n\nInitially, it helped me craft emails. I work in tech sales and I have to do a lot of cold outreaches. My job is to write messages that resonate with various leaders and ChatGPT helped me with that.\n\nOnce I started using it at work, I realized that as a sports coach and father, there was so much more I could use it for, like sending post-practice communication to parents, building schedules, or putting together statistics of how the game went. Tasks that used to take me days took me literal minutes.\n\nNow I use AI everyday, and I've experimented with different tools. I use Claude to help with business communication and content generation. I use Perplexity for deep research, and Gemini for image generation. I use these tools for a combination of personal, professional, and educational use-cases. I've learned how to install an air conditioner and how to teach my son 6th grade math.\n\nMy company has also given me access to tools that have been really powerful in sales. It can help with gaining a better understanding of the customer in a minute's notice.\n\nFor example, tools like Salesforce Sales Navigator can pinpoint almost the exact person that may be looking for the product I'm selling. Now when I reach out to that person, the conversation will be more fruitful than it would if it were a completely random cold call.\n\nAI hasn't helped me close deals — I'm the one that's built those relationships with customers — but I've seen an increase in my pipeline because I'm able to reach more clients with the data and messaging.\n\nWhen I'm able to understand the customer better, I'm able to communicate more effectively, which leads to building a better pipeline, which ultimately leads to making more money.\n\nWhile people may have access to the same tools, it's still up to the user to put the data together and craft the right prompts. I've been experimenting with so many automation tools that I've developed a secret sauce.\n\nIf I'm creating prompts that give me a better message, which leads to a better outcome, I may not share it with others because I want to see if it works and if it's going to give me a competitive advantage.\n\nWe all have the same amount of time in a day to learn these things. So if I'm putting more time toward learning more about prompt engineering or how AI is supposed to work, then I don't necessarily want to share those learnings with someone else. In this moment, we're all competing.\n\nI will absolutely help someone if they ask, but there are certain details I'm not as forthcoming about. I may share some of those learnings with some of my closest friends or people I feel I can learn from, but that doesn't mean I'm sharing it with everybody.\n\nSales is very competitive and while companies are choosing to have conversations around AI, some people may not be as comfortable sharing how they're leveraging it because that may be their competitive advantage.\n\nWhen people ask if I use AI, I say \"absolutely, yes.\" But there's only a certain amount of people that I'm going into a deeper conversations about AI with.",

    "description": "This was supposed to be the year when autonomous agents took over everyday tasks. The tech industry overpromised and underdelivered.",
    "fullText": "This was no small boast. Chatbots can respond directly to a text-based prompt—by answering a question, say, or writing a rough draft of an e-mail. But an agent, in theory, would be able to navigate the digital world on its own, and complete tasks that require multiple steps and the use of other software, such as web browsers. Consider everything that goes into making a hotel reservation: deciding on the right nights, filtering based on one’s preferences, reading reviews, searching various websites to compare rates and amenities. An agent could conceivably automate all of these activities. The implications of such a technology would be immense. Chatbots are convenient for human employees to use; effective A.I. agents might replace the employees altogether. The C.E.O. of Salesforce, Marc Benioff, who has claimed that half the work at his company is done by A.I., predicted that agents will help unleash a “digital labor revolution,” worth trillions of dollars.\n\nNew Yorker writers reflect on the year’s highs and lows.\n\n2025 was heralded as the Year of the A.I. Agent in part because, by the end of 2024, these tools had become undeniably adept at computer programming. A demo of OpenAI’s Codex agent, from May, showed a user asking the tool to modify his personal website. “Add another tab next to investment/tools that is called ‘food I like.’ In the doc put—tacos,” the user wrote. The chatbot quickly carried out a sequence of interconnected actions: it reviewed the files in the website’s directory, examined the contents of a promising file, then used a search command to find the right location to insert a new line of code. After the agent learned how the site was structured, it used this information to successfully add a new page that featured tacos. As a computer scientist myself, I had to admit that Codex was tackling the task more or less as I would. Silicon Valley grew convinced that other difficult tasks would soon be conquered.\n\nAs 2025 winds down, however, the era of general-purpose A.I. agents has failed to emerge. This fall, Andrej Karpathy, a co-founder of OpenAI, who left the company and started an A.I.-education project, described agents as “cognitively lacking” and said, “It’s just not working.” Gary Marcus, a longtime critic of tech-industry hype, recently wrote on his Substack that “AI Agents have, so far, mostly been a dud.” This gap between prediction and reality matters. Fluent chatbots and reality-bending video generators are impressive, but they cannot, on their own, usher in a world in which machines take over many of our activities. If the major A.I. companies cannot deliver broadly useful agents, then they may be unable to deliver on their promises of an A.I.-powered future.\n\nThis setup turns out to excel at automating software development. Most of the actions required to create or modify a computer program can be implemented by entering a limited set of commands into a text-based terminal. These commands tell a computer to navigate a file system, add or update text in source files, and, if needed, compile human-readable code into machine-readable bits. This is an ideal setting for L.L.M.s. “The terminal interface is text-based, and that is the domain that language models are based on,” Alex Shaw, the co-creator of Terminal-Bench, a popular tool used to evaluate coding agents, told me.\n\nMore generalized assistants, of the sort envisioned by Altman, would require agents to leave the comfortable constraints of the terminal. Since most of us complete computer tasks by pointing and clicking, an A.I. that can “join the workforce” probably needs to know how to use a mouse—a surprisingly difficult goal. The Times recently reported on a string of new startups that have been building “shadow sites”—replicas of popular webpages, like those of United Airlines and Gmail, on which A.I. can analyze how humans use a cursor. In July, OpenAI released ChatGPT Agent, an early version of a bot that can use a web browser to complete tasks, but one review noted that “even simple actions like clicking, selecting elements, and searching can take the agent several seconds—or even minutes.” At one point, the tool got stuck for nearly a quarter of an hour trying to select a price from a real-estate site’s drop-down menu.",

    "fullText": "Role: Reporter\nMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news.\n\nA YouTube cofounder who helped pave the way for our modern, content-obsessed world is the latest tech whiz to come out against short-form videos because of their effects on kids.\n\nSteve Chen, who served as YouTube’s former chief technology officer before it was acquired by Google in 2006, railed against the TikTok-ification of online life in a talk earlier this year at Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\n“I think TikTok is entertainment, but it’s purely entertainment,” Chen said during the talk, which was published on YouTube Friday. “It’s just for that moment. Just shorter-form content equates to shorter attention spans.”\n\nChen, who has two children with wife, Jamie Chen, said he wouldn’t want his kids only consuming short-form content, and then not be able to watch something longer than 15 minutes. He said he knows of other parents who force their kids to watch longer videos without the eye-catching colors and gimmicks that hook especially younger users. This strategy works well, he claims.\n\n“If they don’t get exposure to the short-form content right away, then they’re still happy with that other type of content that they’re watching,” he said.\n\nMany companies have had to rush to offer short-form content after the rise of TikTok, he said, but these companies now have to balance their motivations for monetization and attracting users’ attention with content that’s “actually useful.”\n\nCompanies that distribute short-form video, which includes his former company YouTube, could face problems with addictiveness. These companies should add safeguards for kids on short-form content, such as age restrictions for apps and limits on the amount of time some users can use them, he said.\n\nChen joins fellow tech trailblazers Sam Altman of OpenAI and Elon Musk in sounding the alarm about social media’s impact on children. In a podcast interview, Altman specifically called out social media scrolling and the “dopamine hit” of short-form video for “probably messing with kids’ brain development in a super deep way.”\n\nMusk, who owns the social network X (née Twitter), said in 2023 he doesn’t have any restrictions on social-media use for his children, but added this “might have been a mistake,” and encouraged parents to take a more active role in their kids’ social-media habits.\n\n“I think, probably, I would limit social media a bit more than I have in the past and just take note of what they’re watching, because I think at this point they’re being programmed by some social media algorithms, which you may or may not agree with,” Musk said.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 29, 2025.",

    "description": "A report by the Israel Advanced Technology Industries warned that the trend could threaten Israel's \"innovation engine.\"",
    "fullText": "Increasing numbers of employees at multinational tech firms in Israel have requested to be relocated abroad over the last year, as security concerns amid the Israel-Hamas war heightened, a new report says.\n\nThe Israel Advanced Technology Industries Association (IATI) said in a report published last week that 53% of multinational companies had reported increases in relocation requests, as \"security and geopolitical concerns\" became \"increasingly influential.\"\n\nThe report did not identify specific companies. Some of the world's largest tech companies have a presence in Israel, including Apple, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google.\n\n\"The relocation risk poses a direct threat to Israel's innovation engines,\" the NGO said, adding: \"A significant wave of employee departures could undermine local innovation capabilities and weaken Israel's technological leadership.\"\n\nThe report found recruitment increases among multinationals in Israel had nevertheless exceeded decreases during the war, which it said highlighted the \"organizational resilience and continued investment in talent\" from these companies.\n\nThe data came from a mix of industry reports and public sources, as well as surveys and interviews with tech executives in multinational entities, the IATI said.\n\nIsrael's tech sector is a key driver of its economy. The Israel Innovation Authority, a government body, said the tech industry contributed one-fifth of the country's GDP in 2023. It labeled the high-tech sector \"the shock absorber of the Israeli economy.\"\n\nThe IATI report said that there are around 430 multinational companies in Israel, with around 90,000 high-tech employees working for them.\n\nIt added that while multinationals had shown resilience over the course of the war — which broke out following the October 7 attacks on Israel — many had also faced business headwinds.\n\nAround 22% of companies recorded reduced business activity during the conflict, it said, with 8% reporting a significant decline. However, 57% reported no change in business activity over the period and 21% expanded operations, per the report, which the IATI said showed \"continued confidence in and robustness of local MNC activity.\"\n\nDror Bin, the CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, previously said that the Israeli economy's dependence on the high-tech sector had \"significantly grown in the past decade.\"\n\n\"We must do everything necessary to preserve the industry and continue nurturing its competitiveness in the global market,\" he added.",
