    "fullText": "Sandy Ciric, senior director of news photography at Getty Images, told Business Insider that the 2025 news cycle was \"unrelenting.\"\n\n\"From the first days of the new year when devastating wildfires swept through Los Angeles, every week brought a barrage of breaking stories — including the death of a US president, a newly elected Pope, tariff wars, terror attacks, migration, starvation, hostages, plane crashes, floods, heat waves and in addition to all that, political turmoil and upheaval from the US to Nepal and beyond,\" Ciric said.\n\nAs the year comes to a close, the team at Getty Images curated 100 of the most powerful news photos of the year taken by its photojournalists around the world, highlighting the defining moments of 2025.\n\n\"Through it all, Getty Images photojournalists faithfully covered all of these stories and indelible moments with expertise, empathy, and creativity,\" Ciric said.\n\nHere are 30 images from the collection of the best news photos of the year.\n\nCarter died at the age of 100 at his home in Plains, Georgia.

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Imran Ahmed says US companies are ‘corrupting the system’ of politics by seeking to avoid accountability\n\nA British anti-disinformation campaigner told by the Trump administration that he faces possible removal from the US has said he is being targeted by arrogant and “sociopathic” tech companies for trying to hold them to account.\n\nImran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), is among five European nationals barred from the US by the state department after being accused of seeking to push tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nAhmed lives lawfully in Washington DC with his American wife and daughter, meaning he is at risk of deportation. Late on Thursday a court granted him a temporary restraining order to block any attempt to remove him from the US or detain him.\n\nAhmed told the Guardian he believed he had been singled out for his work seeking greater accountability and transparency for social media and AI firms, which has led to Elon Musk’s X unsuccessfully suing CCDH.\n\nAhmed, who is a friend of Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, said it was another attempt to deflect accountability and transparency.\n\n“This has never been about politics,” he said, adding that his organisation had worked successfully with the first Trump administration and would do so again if asked.\n\n“What it has been about is companies that simply do not want to be held accountable and, because of the influence of big money in Washington, are corrupting the system and trying to bend it to their will, and their will is to be unable to be held accountable,” he said.\n\n“There is no other industry, that acts with such arrogance, indifference and a lack of humility and sociopathic greed at the expense of people.”\n\nAs well as Ahmed, the state department has barred the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accused the five people of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.\n\nSarah Rogers, an official at the state department, posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”\n\nThe sanctions are being seen as the latest attack on European regulations that target hate speech and misinformation. Campaigners in the UK have said the British government could be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.\n\nAhmed, who began his career working with Labour politicians in Westminster, said he had not yet formally received any notification from the US government, and that he believed its case against him was unfounded. “I’m very confident that our first amendment rights will be upheld by the court,” he said.\n\nThe next court hearing, due on Monday, is expected to confirm the protective order that prevents the US government from detaining him, said Ahmed, who spent Christmas away from his wife and infant daughter amid the legal battle.\n\nHe said this was “a rational thing for us to do, given that in every other case to date where someone has had a green card withdrawn in the last few months, they have been arrested and detained and often spirited hundreds or thousands of miles away from their friends, family and support networks.”\n\nThe CCDH has previously angered Musk over reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took it over. Musk tried unsuccessfully to sue the CCDH last year before calling it a “criminal organisation”.\n\nMore recently, the CCDH released a report warning about harmful answers produced by the latest version of ChatGPT when asked about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.\n\n“We’ve seen that social media and AI companies are increasingly under pressure as a result of organisations like mine,” Ahmed said. “No one likes being exposed as mendacious or hypocritical, but they call their friends in government or they call their pitbull litigation lawyers and start suing.”\n\nAhmed said it was particularly jarring to be targeted given that hate speech and misinformation was increasingly a bipartisan issue, raised as a concern by some Republican politicians as well as Democrats.\n\nHe said he was nonetheless ready to respond with a swift legal response when he heard the news. “When you take on the world’s biggest corporations and when you’ve had the experiences we’ve had, being sued by the world’s richest man, you dissociate and compartmentalise immediately.”\n\nThere had been a cost already, he said. “Nothing I’m going through compares to any of the parents I sit with who’ve lost their children,” Ahmed said. “I chose to take on the biggest companies in the world, to hold them accountable, to speak truth to power. There is a cost attached to that. My family understands that.\n\n“The only time I felt any sadness at all is last night when my wife told me that our child said her sixth word, and then I cried a bit.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "title": "American LGBTQ+ athletes struggle to find money in current social, political climate",
    "description": "LGBTQ+ athletes are finding it increasingly difficult to land corporate sponsorships and endorsement deals amid the political climate in the United States.",
    "fullText": "Conor McDermott-Mostowy would like to compete at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games. And he certainly has the talent, desire and ambition to do so.\n\n“You could definitely reach six figures,” David McFarland, McDermott-Mostowy’s agent, said of what the speedskater needs annually to live and train while chasing his Olympic dream.\n\nIn the last year, finding that money has been increasingly difficult because McDermott-Mostowy is gay. Since President Trump returned to the White House in January, bringing with him an agenda that is hostile to diversity, equity and inclusion, sponsors who once embraced LGBTQ+ athletes and initiatives have turned away from the likes of McDermott-Mostowy, with devastating effect.\n\n“There’s definitely been a noticeable shift,” said McFarland, who for decades has represented straight and gay athletes in a number of sports, from the NFL and NBA to professional soccer. “Many brands and speaking opportunities that previously highlighted LGBTQ athletes are now being pulled back or completely going away.”\n\n“And these aren’t just symbolic partnerships,” he added. “They’re vital income opportunities that help athletes fund training, fund their competition and their livelihoods.”\n\nThe impact is being felt across a wide range of sports where sponsorship dollars often make the difference between winning and not being able to compete. But it’s especially acute in individual sports where the athletes are the brand and their unique traits — their size, appearance, achievements and even their gender preferences — become the things that attract or repel fans and financial backers.\n\n“What’s most frustrating is that these decisions are rarely about performance,” McFarland said. “They’re about perceptions in the LGBTQ community. And that kind of fear-driven retreat harms everyone involved because, beyond the human costs, it’s also very short-sighted. The LGBTQ community and its allies represent a multitrillion-dollar global market with immense buying power.”\n\nTravis Shumake, the only openly gay driver on the NHRA circuit, ran a career-high five events in 2022 and said he once had deals with major brands such as Mission Foods, Procter & Gamble and Kroger while using a rainbow-colored parachute to slow his dragster.\n\nKroger is the only one whose support has yet to shrink and as a result, Shumake had to keep his car in its trailer for the final eight months of the year.\n\nAnd when he did race, his parachute was black.\n\n“It was looking very optimistic and bright,” said Shumake, who spends about $60,000 for an engine and as much as $25,000 for each run down the dragstrip. “Being the only LGBTQ driver would have been very profitable. I ended last season with plans to run six to eight races. Great conversations were happening with big, big companies. And now it’s, I did one race, completely based on funding.”\n\n“When you’re asking for a $100,000 check,” he added, “it’s very tough for these brands to take that risk for a weekend when there could be a large backlash because of my sexual identity.”\n\nA sponsorship manager for a Fortune 500 company that had previously backed Shumake said he was not authorized to discuss the decision to end its relationship with the driver.\n\nDaniel T. Durbin, director of the Institute of Sports, Media and Society at the USC Annenberg school, said there could be several reasons for that. A shrinking economy has tightened sponsorship budgets, for example. But there’s no doubt the messaging from the White House has had a chilling effect.\n\n“It certainly makes the atmosphere around the issue more difficult because advertising and promotion tied to social change has come under fire by the Trump administration,” Durbin said.\n\nIn addition, corporate sponsors that once rallied behind diversity, whether out of conviction or convenience, saw the election results partly as a repudiation of that.\n\n“We may be pissing off 50% of the population if we go down this path. Do we really want to do that with our brand?” Durbin said of the conversations corporations are having.\n\nBacking away from causes such as LGBTQ+ rights doesn’t necessarily mean those corporations were once progressive and are now hypocritical. For many, the only color of the rainbow they care about is green.\n\n“You’re trying to give people a philosophy who don’t have a philosophy,” Durbin said. “And even if they believe in causes, they’re not going to self-destruct their company by taking up a cause they believe in. They’re going to take it up in part because they think it’s positive for the bottom line.\n\nAs a result, others have had to step up to try to help fill the funding gap. The Out Athlete Fund, a 501(c)(3) organization, was recently created to provide financial assistance and other support to LGBTQ+ athletes. McDermott-Mostowy was the first to get a check, after a November event in West Hollywood raised more than $15,000.\n\n“We’re here to help cover their costs because a lot of other people aren’t doing it,” said Cyd Zeigler, a founding board member of the group and co-founder of OutSports, a sports-news website focused on LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nThat kind of retrenching, from deep-pocketed corporate sponsors to individuals giving their spare change, is threatening to derail the careers of athletes  such as McDermott-Mostowy, who relies on his family and a modest U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee stipend for most of his living and training expenses. And since he’ll turn 27 before the Milano Cortina Olympic Games open in February, he may not be able to wait for the pendulum to swing back to have another chance at being an Olympian.\n\n“I’m 99% sure I qualify for [food] stamps,” said McDermott-Mostowy, who medaled in the 1,500- and 500-meter events in October’s national championships, making him a strong contender for the U.S. heading into the Olympic long track trials Jan. 2-5 in Milwaukee. “What really saves us every year is when we travel. Almost all of our expenses are paid when we’re coming [with] the team.\n\n“If I didn’t make the World Cup one year, I would be ruined.”\n\nMcDermott-Mostowy’s past success and his Olympic potential are what he pitches to sponsors, not that he’s gay. But that’s what makes him stand out; if he qualifies for Milano Cortina, he would be one of the few gay athletes on the U.S. team.\n\n“I have always been very open about my sexuality. So that wasn’t really a debate,” he said.\n\n“I have definitely heard from my agent that, behind closed doors, a lot of people are like ‘Oh, we’d love to support queer athletes. But it’s just not a good time to be having that as our public face.'”\n\nThe debate isn’t a new one, although it has evolved over the years. Figure skater Amber Glenn, who last year became the first out queer woman to win the U.S. championship, remembers gender preferences being a big topic of discussion ahead of the 2014 Games in Russia, where public support for LGBTQ+ expression is banned.\n\n“At that point I wasn’t out, but I was thinking, ‘What would I do? What would I say?’” Glenn said. “Moving forward I hope that we can make it where people can compete as who they are and not have to worry about anything.\n\n“Figure skating is unique. We have more acceptance and more of a community in the queer space. That’s not the case for all sports. We’re definitely making progress, but we still have a long way to go.”\n\nIn the meantime, athletes such as McDermott-Mostowy and Shumake may have to find ways to re-present themselves to find new sources of support.\n\n“It’s not like I’m going back in the closet,” said Shumake, who has decided to rent out his dragster to straight drivers next year rather than leave it parked and face bankruptcy. “It’s just that maybe it’s not the main storyline at the moment. I’m trying a bunch of different ways to tell the story, to rebrand.”\n\n“It’s been weird to watch,” added Shumake, who once billed himself as the fastest gay guy on Earth. “I know it will swing back. I also fear, did I make the right choices when I had a partnership with Grindr and I had rainbow parachutes? Like did I come on too strong?\n\n“I’ve chosen to go the gay race car driver route and it’s just a little bit of a slowdown. I don’t think I need to blame myself. It’s just a fear people are having at the moment.”\n\nA fear that’s proving costly to the athletes who can least afford to pay.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "SHANGHAI - Japanese-themed manga and anime have been barred from one of China's largest comic conventions about a week before the show begins in late December, Hong Kong media reported, amid a continuing diplomatic row between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nThe decision was notified to participants last Friday ahead of the two-day Comicup convention scheduled to be held next weekend in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou near Shanghai, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nExhibitors and visitors were informed by the event's organizers that there would be a \"full-scale adjustment\" of content toward \"a new Chinese style\" theme across the venue due to the \"current social environment and our cultural obligations,\" the Hong Kong newspaper said Tuesday.\n\nThe exhibition areas themed around American and European content did not seem to be affected at the event featuring some 7,000 booths, which has become a massive marketplace for creators of derivative works based on various anime, comics, and game fan groups, according to the report.\n\nWhile the notification did not name Japan, several dozen exhibitors featuring Japanese anime and other themed content said on social media that their booths had been cancelled for reasons \"well-known to all\" and \"factors beyond control,\" the SCMP said.\n\nA similar comic convention held in Shanghai in October drew hundreds of thousands of visitors. The paper quoted a woman whose booth was supposed to have featured artwork of the Japanese manga \"Let's Go Karaoke!\" as saying, \"I am feeling utterly helpless and sad.\"\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the two Asian neighbors stems from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's parliamentary remarks last month that suggested an attack on Taiwan could constitute a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Japan, prompting possible involvement of the Self-Defense Forces.\n\nBeijing has since ramped up its retaliatory measures, including urging its citizens not to visit Japan, suspending seafood imports from the neighboring country and canceling cultural events featuring Japanese artists.\n\nMeanwhile, manga and animation events scheduled for January in such Chinese cities as Shenzhen in Guangdong Province and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province were postponed due to \"force majeure,\" according to organizers.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a March presidential memorandum to revoke the security clearance of prominent Washington attorney Mark Zaid, ruling that the order — which also targeted 14 other individuals — could not be applied to him.\n\nThe decision marked the administration’s second legal setback on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court declined to allow Trump to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area, capping a first year in office in which President Donald Trump’s efforts to impose a sweeping agenda and pursue retribution against political adversaries have been repeatedly slowed by the courts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington granted Zaid's request for a preliminary injunction, after he sued the Trump administration in May over the revocation of his security clearance. Zaid's request called it an act of “improper political retribution” that jeopardized his ability to continue representing clients in sensitive national security cases.\n\nThe March presidential memorandum singled out Zaid and 14 other individuals who the White House asserted were unsuitable to retain their clearances because it was “no longer in the national interest.” The list included targets of Trump’s fury from both the political and legal spheres, including former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Joe Biden and members of his family.\n\nThe action was part of a much broader retribution campaign that Trump has waged since returning to the White House, including directing specific Justice Department investigations against perceived adversaries and issuing sweeping executive orders targeting law firms over legal work he does not like.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration said it was revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials. Ordering the revocation of clearances has been a favored retributive tactic that Trump has wielded — or at least tried to — against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials in his second term.\n\nZaid said in his lawsuit that he has represented clients across the political spectrum over nearly 35 years, including government officials, law enforcement and military officials and whistleblowers. In 2019, he represented an intelligence community whistleblower whose account of a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped set the stage for the first of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.\n\n\"This court joins the several others in this district that have enjoined the government from using the summary revocation of security clearances to penalize lawyers for representing people adverse to it,\" Ali wrote in his order.\n\nAli emphasized that his order does not prevent the government from revoking or suspending Zaid’s clearance for reasons independent of the presidential memorandum and through normal agency processes. The preliminary injunction does not go into effect until January 13.\n\nZaid said in a statement, “This is not just a victory for me, it’s an indictment of the Trump administration’s attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",

    "fullText": "This week’s episode moved forward while looking back.\n\n on December 24, 2025 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead.\n\nAnother week, another episode of Fallout. This week saw lots of use of Lucy’s (Ella Purnell) “Golden Rule” and a look into the politics of the Brotherhood of Steel. In many ways this episode felt like a significant step forward for the series, but it also took its time to honor Fallout’s past. From iconic locations to lore deep cuts , there was no shortage of callbacks. Let's take a look at what “The Golden Rule” had to offer.\n\nThis week’s episode showed us a flashback of Shady Sands in its prime. While we saw the bombed city in the first season, this season gave us a look at what life was like in the New California Republic settlement before it was destroyed. Longtime fans will recognize Shady Sands as one of the first locations you can visit from the original 1997 Fallout game. Since the series is canon to the video games, its destruction is the city’s eventual fate.\n\nShady Sands meets its fate when a mind controlled stranger enters the city with an armed atom bomb. When confronted by Maximus’ father, the stranger keeps muttering a single phrase over and over: “Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.” Fans of Fallout: New Vegas will recognize this line as one used by New California Republic NPCs that didn’t have meaningful dialogue. It’s in-game use is also used to represent their mundane duties and boring patrols, which has led to the phrase being meme’d into oblivion online.\n\nMaximus (Aaron Moten) and his Brotherhood of Steel chapter gained a new base of operations this week in the form of Area 51. Though this base hides numerous old world artifacts for the Brotherhood to use , chief among them is an icebox housing an alien corpse. The alien is specifically a Zetan, whose most notable appearance is in the Fallout 3 DLC “Mothership Zeta.” Did you know that you can also encounter them in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas, too? If you have the Wild Wasteland trait selected, there’s a possibility that a spacecraft with two Zetan’s aboard will spawn. , If not, you’re left wanting to believe.\n\nWhen Norm (Moisés Arias) wakes up all of the Vault-Tec Junior Executives in Vault 31, he convinces them that it's Reclamation Day to get all of them to follow him. Reclamation Day, in Fallout lore ,is the designated day when the Vaults open up, permitting all their inhabitants to return to the surface to reestablish society. This is most notable in the game Fallout 76, where players create a resident from Vault 76, the first vault to open up after The Great War and whose inhabitants explored and settled in Appalachia.\n\nThroughout the episode, various chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel conspire to stand together against the chapter from The Commonwealth, despite it potentially causing a civil war. Fallout 4 fans will recognize The Commonwealth as the Boston-inspired setting of that entry. The Brotherhood of Steel chapter of that game was led by Elder Arthur Maxson, who was driven mad with power and sought to bring conflict and destruction to The Commonwealth by using the Brotherhood’s freedom enforcing robot, Liberty Prime.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s nemesis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, has registered the highest approval rating among current political leaders, a new poll has revealed.\n\nA Gallup survey shows that Powell—whom Trump has long berated while demanding interest-rate cuts—is more highly regarded by Americans than the president, members of Trump’s Cabinet, and leading Democratic figures.\n\nThe poll shows Powell’s approval rating at 44 percent, compared with Trump’s second-term low of 36 percent. The president’s current approval is only slightly above his all-time low of 34 percent, recorded in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is the only other political figure in the poll to break 40 percent, with an approval rating of 41 percent.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (28 percent) and Senate GOP Leader John Thune (34 percent) post the lowest ratings, with Vice President JD Vance (39 percent), Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (36 percent), House Speaker Mike Johnson (35 percent), and embattled Attorney General Pam Bondi (36 percent) also registering uninspiring numbers.\n\nTrump is likely to be particularly irritated by how Americans view Powell. The president has repeatedly called for Powell to resign—at times even suggesting he could fire him as chair of the U.S. central bank—while unleashing a steady stream of insults.\n\nTrump has spent months attacking Powell as “stupid,” a “dummy,” and a “knucklehead” for refusing to slash interest rates to offset the president’s economically damaging tariff policies. The president was so blinded by rage at Powell’s refusal to bow to his demands that he appeared to have forgotten that it was he who appointed him in the first place.\n\n“He’s a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in July, despite nominating Powell in 2017.\n\nThat same month, the pair’s fractured relationship had an excruciating moment when Powell corrected Trump to his face after the president falsely claimed that renovation costs at the Fed’s Washington, D.C., headquarters totaled $3.1 billion.\n\nTrump suggested the figure had “just come out” when Powell questioned its source. After reviewing a piece of paper Trump handed him, Powell pushed back and explained that Trump was “adding a third building” to the total that “was built five years ago.”\n\n“It’s part of the overall work,” Trump insisted, prompting Powell to reply again: “It’s not new.”\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026, has since cut interest rates three times this year as the central bank attempts to kick-start a struggling economy during Trump’s second term.\n\nThe most recent cut of 0.25 percentage points occurred on Dec. 10, lowering the benchmark rate to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance posted glossy photos of his personal training session with Navy SEALs—but the beachside stunt immediately drew mockery and accusations of political tone-deafness.\n\nThe 41-year-old former Marine, who served in Iraq before entering politics, had joined the Navy’s special-operations community for an early-morning workout at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California, a longtime hub for SEAL selection and training.\n\nFrom the official @VP account, Vance shared images on Monday of himself sprinting along the surf, hauling a log with helmeted operators whose faces were blurred, scrambling up a cargo net, and riding in a small boat punching through the waves.\n\n“Vice President Vance trains with @USNavy Seals at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado,” the caption read. On his personal account, Vance gushed that he had “just finished PT with the Navy SEALs for 90 minutes.”\n\nHe added, “They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train. So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!”\n\nCritics were unimpressed. “Nice cosplay as a Navy SEAL,” one user wrote, adding: “Leadership isn’t about photo ops, it’s about fixing the mess at home.”\n\nOther critics photoshopped the infamous meme of Vance with a cartoonishly puffy face onto the soldiers he was working out with, using “GI Jello” as a punchline.\n\nAnother commenter sneered that it was a “desperate photo op for a Vice President who cares more about his military ‘aesthetic’ than actually governing.”\n\nDigital strategist Mike Nellis jabbed: “Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks.”\n\nAnd Democratic strategist Christopher Hale wrote on X, “It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL.”\n\nVance’s made-for-camera workout follows a Trumpian trend of the president’s inner circle engaging in theatrics. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, 45, marked the D-Day anniversary and his birthday in June by leading a filmed PT session with troops on Omaha Beach before delivering a speech at the Normandy American Cemetery, a spectacle that also drew scrutiny as self-promotion.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly been mocked as “ICE Barbie” for using federal law enforcement as props in a string of stylized photo ops, from tactical-gear raids to glossy fitness clips.\n\nThis is also not the first time Vance has tried to curry favor with the military. Ahead of Thanksgiving, he delivered a comedy skit to troops at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the vice president’s office for comment.",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "fullText": "KISS legend Gene Simmons said his relationship with President Donald Trump is “terrific” as he slammed Americans for caring too much about one another’s political beliefs.\n\n“I don’t really care what people say,” Simmons said in an interview with CNN’s Manu Raju that aired Sunday. “Life has always been like that.”\n\n“Not everybody loves Jesus, but you can certainly say the following: he was a duly elected president of these United States, perhaps overwhelming by the popular vote, as well as the Electoral College. End of story,” he continued.\n\nSimmons went on to say that it’s “nobody’s damn business who you support.”\n\n“Nowadays, people engage in, so, are you pro or — and my first question is ‘Who the f--- are you? Who are you?’\" Simmons said. “Since when does who I support or not support is the business of anyone except my conscience?”\n\nWhen asked to evaluate the MAGA movement within the Republican Party, Simmons said “some of it makes sense and some not.”\n\n“But literally, have a sense of humor,” he added. “Take a pill, shut up and stop worrying what your next-door neighbor believes or doesn’t believe. It’s their America, too.”\n\nSimmons, who was recognized at the Kennedy Center Honors with KISS earlier this month, joined CNN on Capitol Hill, where he is pushing for the passage of the American Music Fairness Act. The bill, which was introduced in the House in January, would require radio corporations to pay artists royalties for playing their music over AM/FM airwaves.\n\nSimmons and music executives recently testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of the legislation. In February, hundreds in the music industry — including Stevie Nicks, Celine Dion and Aerosmith — called on Congress in a letter to pass the bipartisan measure to fix what they characterized as an “inequity” that harms U.S. artists at home and abroad.\n\n“If you are against this bill, you are un-American,” Simmons said during his testimony.\n\nDuring the interview with CNN, Simmons responded directly to critics of the bill.\n\n“Radio stations last year made something like $14 billion,” he said in comments recorded on Dec. 9. “Artists, who you heard on the radio stations made zero. Your favorite artist, whether it’s a classic artist or a new artist, made zero. And that is inexcusable.”",

    "description": "The new head of CBS News has been immersed in politics since she started. So of course her call to hold a story will be viewed from a political lens.",
    "fullText": "Ever since Bari Weiss arrived as the head of CBS News, people inside and outside the company have been waiting to see whether her politics — and those of CBS owner David Ellison — would show up in the journalism.\n\nThis weekend, they may have gotten their answer. Or they may not have.\n\nAnd that uncertainty is the problem.\n\nIt's possible Weiss had legitimate editorial concerns about a \"60 Minutes\" segment on the Trump administration's use of El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. CBS pulled the segment abruptly before it was scheduled to air on Sunday evening. News organizations do periodically delay or spike stories.\n\nBut the reported details around this decision make it hard to take the explanation entirely at face value. And Weiss's position — and the politics surrounding her appointment — mean that editorial calls like this one will always be read for hints of political bias.\n\nThe segment, reported by Sharyn Alfonsi, had been promoted by CBS ahead of Sunday's broadcast and, according to multiple accounts, had cleared the network's standard internal processes. A few hours before airtime, CBS News announced that the segment needed additional reporting and editorial work.\n\n\"In my view, pulling it now — after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one,\" she wrote in a note to her co-workers. \"We are trading 50 years of 'Gold Standard' reputation for a single week of political quiet.\"\n\nWeiss, meanwhile, told her staff Monday morning that she held the story because \"it did not advance the ball,\" and because it didn't include on-camera comment from the Trump administration, which had sent hundreds of Venezuelans to the prison, where many were reportedly tortured. She had previously sent a memo to \"60 Minutes\" producers complaining that the report they'd made didn't provide viewers with \"the full context they need to assess the story.\"\n\nThere are two big problems with those arguments: 1) Making them so late in the process of a long-running investigation, shortly before the air date, is guaranteed to raise eyebrows. And 2) arguing that a story about the Trump administration can't air without on-camera participation from the Trump administration leads to a chilling endpoint: If the Trump administration doesn't want a story to run on \"60 Minutes,\" it can kill it by not showing up on camera.\n\nNow, add in the environment Weiss stepped into. She arrived at CBS News through a deal engineered by Paramount's owners, the Ellison family, at a moment when the Ellison family is deeply enmeshed with the Trump administration.\n\nDavid Ellison's father, Larry, who funded his son's acquisition of Paramount, controls Oracle — which just got approval to acquire part of the US operations of TikTok, in a deal the Trump administration negotiated with the Chinese government. And the Ellisons are also trying to get Trump to favor their bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery — a deal that would require approval from the Trump-controlled Department of Justice, as well as other regulators.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has already been complaining about \"60 Minutes\" under Ellison's ownership. \"For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called 'takeover,' than they have ever treated me before,\" he posted on his Truth Social platform last week.\n\nNone of which proves that politics drove Weiss' decision. And it's understandable if the way \"60 Minutes\" used to work isn't the way Weiss wants it to work — she's the new boss, and she has spent much of her career complaining about big media institutions like \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nBut it explains why people are wondering if Weiss' call was directly, or indirectly, influenced by her owner and his political status. I've asked Weiss for comment; a Paramount rep declined to comment.\n\nWhat we do know is this: The decision was made inside a system where the people who own the newsroom need things from a president who wants leverage over the press.\n\nIn that world, suspicion isn't paranoia. It's a rational response to how power works. And it's not something Weiss can fix, explain away, or out-communicate.",

    "fullText": "This year has brought us many brilliant video games – but as wealth continues to concentrate, and games are used to exert economic and political influence, we need to keep an eye on the top players\n\nI love playing video games, but what interests me most as a journalist are the ways in which games intersect with real life. One of the joys of spending 20 years on this beat has been meeting hundreds of people whose lives have been meaningfully enhanced by games, and as their cultural influence has grown, these stories have become more and more plentiful.\n\nThere is another side to this, however. A couple of decades ago, video games were mostly either ignored or vilified by governments and mainstream culture, leading to an underdog mentality that has persisted even as games have become a nearly $200bn industry. As their popularity has grown, so have their political and cultural relevance. And the ways in which games intersect with real life are now coloured by the economic and political realities of our times.\n\nWhen I look back on this year’s happenings in the world of games, I see a lot of positives. A theme of the past few years has been comparatively small-scale games outperforming expensive blockbusters: the best examples this year have been the now multi-award-winning Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and Hollow Knight: Silksong, which has sold seven million copies. Despite year-long discussions over the finer points of what counts as “indie” and how many people really contribute to games made by “tiny” teams – a lot of them use contractors, who deserve to be acknowledged – the point remains that it is very possible to make brilliant and creative games to extremely high standards without a $100m budget, and that is something to be celebrated.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 was also (finally) announced and released this year, and has been very well received despite Trump’s best efforts to scupper its launch with tariff drama. Having a new console to enjoy tends to revive one’s enthusiasm for games, and though the Switch 2 didn’t feel enormously different from the original Switch, when I go back to my old machine now I really feel the difference.\n\nBut the broader story of 2025 is of a games industry reckoning with the same late-capitalist, techno-feudalistic forces that are threatening every creative industry. Wealth continues to concentrate at the top, while workers continue to face huge instability: more than 5,000 games industry jobs have been lost this year, and have several studios, including Monolith Productions. AI disruption is everywhere, meanwhile, as companies try to force their workforces to justify immense investments in the as-yet-unprofitable technology. AI-generated artwork and voiceovers have made their way into some of this year’s more successful games, and the pushback has been vociferous.\n\nAll this has led to much greater visibility for video game workers’ unions. In March, United Videogame Workers formed in the US and Canada, part of the Communications Workers of America. (They could be found protesting outside the Game Awards earlier this month.) In the UK, the firing of 30 staff from Rockstar Games pushed the UK’s IWGB Game Workers Union into the spotlight. Unionisation is slowly becoming more common even in the US, where there is not a strong culture of workplace organisation.\n\nAnother theme of the past few years has been consolidation: when Microsoft acquired Activision in 2023, it made me feel very uneasy about the concentration of economic power. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying its way into the games industry for years via esports partnerships and companies such as Savvy Games Group and Scopely, but this year it was kicked into high gear by a $55bn deal for EA. The Saudis also bought Niantic, makers of Pokémon Go, in March. (If you are wondering why the PIF is quite so ethically troubling, and how these video game investments form part of a strategy to whitewash the country’s image and that of its royal family, Eurogamer’s interview with Human Rights Watch from earlier this year is an essential read.)\n\nWhat we see here is money and power concentrating in the video game world in the same way as in the wider world. And games have immense power to influence people’s thoughts and attitudes: the most powerful people in the world have started to realise this. (Even Elon Musk sees the value of appropriating game credibility: he was discovered to be a fake gamer in January after boasting about his Path of Exile 2 character online.) Why else would the Trump administration be tweeting AI-generated images of the president as Halo’s Master Chief? Or using Pokémon and Halo memes to recruit for ICE? Why else would rightwing agitators continue to feed culture war spats over a black samurai in Assassin’s Creed, or a non-binary actor in a PlayStation game?\n\nI don’t pretend to be neutral on any of these things. Earlier this year, after I wrote about the Saudi acquisition of EA, I got an email from a reader asking if “some of this stuff is more editorial opinion rather than fact/news”. The answer to that is: it’s both. I will never report anything here that isn’t true, but I also won’t shy away from delivering my informed opinion on the things that go on in the gaming world. Unsurprisingly for a Guardian journalist, my values are inclusive, left-leaning and somewhat sceptical of corporate power, and of course that informs what I write in Pushing Buttons. I think that those values are vital context in these times.\n\nPlaying games is something a lot of us do for escapism, and a lot of people still react defensively if you talk about their relevance to real-world politics. Don’t we play games to get away from this stuff? Can’t we just concentrate on the hundreds of fantastic games that come out every single year, from creatively fired-up developers and artists all over the world? But games are inextricable from what’s happening in the real world. All art is. As if to symbolise this, this year’s Summer Game Fest – a showcase of forthcoming games held in LA in June – was interrupted by city-wide LA protests against ICE.\n\nIt matters, who has power. Games feel so exciting because they often give so much power to their players, to carve their own paths though their worlds. As players we leave an impression on games, and they leave an impression on us. In an ideal world, players and developers would be the people who held the power in the video games industry, too. If we enjoy video games, it is worth keeping an eye on the biggest players.",

    "fullText": "DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of people attended the funeral Saturday of a leading Bangladeshi activist who died of gunshot wounds sustained in an attack in Dhaka earlier this month, as political tensions gripped the country ahead of elections.\n\nSharif Osman Hadi, who took part in last year’s political uprising that ended former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule, died in a hospital in Singapore on Thursday after being shot Dec. 12 in Dhaka.\n\nPolice said they had identified suspects and that the shooter had most probably fled to India, where Hasina has been in exile. The development sparked a new diplomatic squabble with India and prompted New Delhi this week to summon Bangladesh’s envoy. Bangladesh also summoned the Indian envoy to Dhaka.\n\nSecurity was tight in Dhaka on Saturday as the funeral prayers were held outside the nation’s Parliament complex.\n\nHadi’s body returned on Friday night, and Saturday was declared a national mourning day.\n\nHadi was a spokesperson for the Inqilab Moncho culture group, which said he would be buried on the Dhaka University campus beside the country’s national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam.\n\nMourners carried Bangladesh flags and chanted slogans, such as “We will be Hadi, we will be fighting decades after decades,” and “We will not let Hadi’s blood go in vain.”\n\nThe news of his death on Thursday evening triggered violence, with groups of protesters attacking and torching the offices of two leading national dailies. The country’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, has urged the people to stay calm.\n\nHadi was a fierce critic of both neighboring India and Hasina, who has been in exile since Aug. 5, 2024, when she fled Bangladesh. Hadi had planned to run as an independent candidate in a major constituency in Dhaka in the next national elections in February.\n\nBangladesh has been going through a critical transition under Yunus in a bid to return to democracy through the upcoming elections. But the government has been Hasina’s Awami League party, which is one of two major political parties. ,\n\nHasina’s archrival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party is the other key party, which hopes to forms the next government. The Jamaat-e-Islami party, the country’s largest Islamist party with a dark history involving the nation’s independence war in 1971, is leading an alliance to carve out a bigger political space in the absence of Hasina’s party and its allies.\n\nHasina has been sentenced to death on charges of crimes against humanity, but India's has not responded to repeated requests by the Yunus-led government for her extradition.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. But it has come at a steep cost: as he enters the New Year and midterm elections loom, his once unshakeable hold on Republicans is slipping, say historians ​and analysts.\n\nBack in January, as Trump triumphantly returned to the White House for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much ‌of U.S. cultural life. He delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.\n\nLike all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the inevitable waning of power in his second ‌year. But he also begins the New Year with an erosion in political support.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are rebelling, and opinion polls show a growing number of voters are unhappy with the high cost of living, an aggressive immigration crackdown and a sense that Trump has pushed the boundaries of presidential power too far.\n\nTrump's approval rating slipped to 39% in recent days to nearly its lowest level of his current term as Republican voters soured on his handling of the economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nNow, Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, threatening Trump's domestic agenda and raising the ⁠specter of a third impeachment by Democrats if they win control ‌of the House of Representatives.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said lowering inflation - which he blamed on former Democratic President Joe Biden - has been a priority for Trump since his first day back in office.\n\n\"Much work remains,\" Desai said, adding that Trump and his administration will continue to focus on the issue.\n\nMOST ‍POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s\n\nIn his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce, dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.\n\nHe has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies, canceled or restricted access to some ​vaccines, and attacked universities, law firms and media outlets.\n\nDespite promising to end the Ukraine war on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace ‌deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.\n\nAll modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.\n\nThe conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.\n\n\"Donald Trump has wielded power with fewer restraints in the last 11 months than any president since Franklin Roosevelt,\" said presidential historian Timothy Naftali.\n\nIn ⁠the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, ​which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support ​for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.\n\nAnalysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with rising living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.\n\nTrump hit the road this month ‍to promote his economic agenda and kick off ⁠what aides say will be multiple speeches next year to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.\n\nBut his meandering 90-minute address to supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month - in which he riffed on a range of subjects unrelated to the economy and derided the issue ⁠of \"affordability\" as a Democratic \"hoax\" - alarmed some Republican strategists.\n\nA Republican with close ties to the White House conceded that Trump faces headwinds on the economy heading into the New Year and the public mood on the rising cost of living has \"become ‌a persistent drag.\"\n\n\"We have to remind voters they need to give the president a full four years,\" said the Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity to more ‌freely discuss internal discussions.",

    "fullText": "MAGA women are fleeing D.C. in droves.\n\nNew York congresswoman and MAGA darling Elise Stefanik shocked the political world on Friday when she announced that she’s quitting politics. Less than 30 minutes earlier, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis had done the same thing.\n\nStefanik’s announcement is the more surprising of the two. The 41-year-old congresswoman was a rising star in MAGA circles and was seen as a lock to win June 2026’s GOP primary in New York’s gubernatorial race.\n\n“While spending precious time with my family this Christmas season, I have made the decision to suspend my campaign for Governor and will not seek re-election to Congress,” she wrote in a lengthy X post.\n\nStefanik indicated she was stepping out of politics to spend more time with her 4-year-old son, Sam.\n\n“While many know me as Congresswoman, my most important title is Mom,” she said. “I believe that being a parent is life’s greatest gift and greatest responsibility. I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness—particularly at his tender age.”\n\nStefanik has represented New York’s 21st district, which covers the state’s heavily Republican upstate area, since 2015.\n\nThough she initially was elected as a moderate Republican, she swung hard to the right during her time in Congress to become one of Trump’s most ardent supporters.\n\nShe was endorsed by Trump in 2021 to replace Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference Chair. She held the position until January 2025, when Trump nominated her to become the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. In March, Trump withdrew his nomination, saying that he needed her in the House of Representatives, where Republicans held a slim majority.\n\nIn November, Stefanik announced that she would run for governor of New York, bidding to unseat incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul. According to a December Siena poll, she held a huge lead over the other Republican in the race, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, but trailed Hochul by 19 points in a potential head-to-head.\n\nStefanik’s announcement comes three days after the release of that poll.\n\nTrump, 79, mourned the loss of one of his champions on Truth Social.\n\n“Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!” the president wrote.\n\nIn contrast, Lummis’ retirement is less surprising—and did not merit a Truth Social sendoff from the president.\n\nLummis, 71, said in her announcement post that she decided not to seek re-election because she felt she did not have “six more years” in her. She will have served one term in the Senate when her seat goes up for election in 2026. Before her time as Senator, she served from 2009 to 2017 in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nOnce a free speech absolutist, Lummis changed her tune after the death of Charlie Kirk and the subsequent yanking of Jimmy Kimmel off the air for his comment that MAGA was desperate to paint Kirk’s assassin, Tyler Robinson, as non-MAGA.\n\nLummis didn’t even have a half-hour in the spotlight before Stefanik upstaged her.\n\nStefanik and Lummis are the latest Republicans to drop out of Congress after the shocking resignation of longtime MAGA loyalist-turned-foe Marjorie Taylor Greene. In the weeks following Greene’s announcement, an anonymous senior GOP lawmaker warned that more surprising departures would follow.\n\n“More explosive early resignations are coming,” said the lawmaker in November. “It’s a tinder box. Morale has never been lower. Mike Johnson will be stripped of his gavel, and they will lose the majority before this term is out.”",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

    "description": "People were outraged by the president's recent use of this particular expression. Experts in political science and mental health say the term tells quite the story.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump recently leveled one of his commonly used terms in a statement attacking iconic actor and director Rob Reiner shortly after he and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead at their home on Sunday.\n\nThe president took to his Truth Social platform on Monday to seize on the opportunity to slam Rob Reiner, who was a critic of Trump, and for baselessly attributing the Hollywood filmmaker’s death to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a phrase Trump and his supporters often use to attack those who criticize the president, his policies and his rhetoric.\n\nLife: Psychologists React To THAT Post From Trump About Rob Reiner's Death\n\n“Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote in part on the social media platform.\n\nTrump’s vile post about Reiner garnered wide condemnation, with many on social media describinghis remarks as“disgusting.” Rocker Jack White took to Instagram to slam the president, writing: “Trump you disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child. Neither he nor any one of his followers can defend this gross, horrible insult to a beautiful artist who gave the world so much.”\n\nThe president also garnered a rare rebuke from many MAGA supporters and a number of the president’s most loyal advocates. He was further criticized when he doubled down on his attacks on Reiner while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office hours later.\n\nThe concept of a so-called “derangement syndrome” has been used against critics of past presidents before. But Trump has a history of frequently using the phrase against his naysayers himself. He had also used the expression against those who opposed him during his first term as president.\n\nLife: How To Do That 'Defying Gravity' Riff Without Murdering Your Voice\n\nAlexandra Cromer, a licensed professional counselor with Thriveworks, believes that Trump’s habit of leveling the phrase “Trump Derangement Syndrome” reveals a lot about his leadership style.\n\n“It reveals that he is not a leader that values, welcomes, or is willing to receive feedback,” she told HuffPost. “This also is a behavior pattern that we see in people with narcissistic tendencies; projection of perceived criticism onto someone else.”\n\nCromer explained that by Trump calling his critics “deranged,” he’s essentially seeking to undermine “the authenticity of the feedback.”\n\n“This reveals that his leadership style is very rigid and very one-dimensional. He is the one to give directions and all others must comply,” she said. “This is a tremendously unhealthy way to receive criticism or any other form of feedback. Psychologically, we know that feedback is critical to not only growth [and] prosperity, but overall health and wellness.”\n\nLife: The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Dec. 6-12)\n\nShe later continued, “shutting down criticism by engaging in stereotyping and blaming of the source can also be viewed as abusive behavior — that is, behavior that attempts to inflict psychological harm and maintain power structures.”\n\nHallie Kritsas, a licensed mental health counselor and therapist with Thriveworks who specializes in self-esteem, workplace issues and anxiety, told HuffPost that she believes the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is “polarizing and emotionally activating.”\n\n“It comes across as a threat and will more than likely increase stress and divide groups in two different ones versus unifying them,” she said.\n\nJacob Neiheisel, associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that he thinks Trump’s frequent use of the phrase is “meant to be dismissive of his opposition” and intended to “give his followers cover for dismissing similar criticisms that they might hear.”\n\nLife: The Most Popular Dog Names Of 2025\n\n“I think his use of the term reflects his deep-seated disdain for dissent,” he said. “Trump’s leadership style is certainly not one that is welcoming of a ‘team of rivals’ type of approach, but rather one that demands loyalty and a willingness to do political combat on his behalf.”\n\nNeiheisel thinks that the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” phrase has caught on with so many Trump supporters because it “allows them to adopt a similar orientation toward dissent in their own social environments.”\n\n“Simply dismissing the opposition as having a form of mental illness allows them to protect their own attitudes and beliefs, inoculating them against any negativity directed toward Trump,” he added.\n\nNeiheisel thinks that Trump’s attack on Reiner after his death hit “a new low.”\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\n“Republicans had the moral high ground in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder and were able to use the negative things said about Kirk after his death to attack Democrats,” he said. “With Trump’s response, that high ground is gone. I think that’s why we saw a number of Republicans condemning Trump’s remarks.”\n\nKritsas believes that Trump’s statements about the iconic director “violated what some might view as a time to grieve and have decency in a moment of loss.”\n\nCromer said that Trump’s harsh words for Reiner was likely particularly upsetting to so many people because the filmmaker was a “universally liked person.”\n\n“While Rob was not a perfect person (because nobody is), he demonstrated consistent prosocial behavior patterns and centered his personal values at the forefront of his personal and professional life,” she said.\n\n“Further, Trump’s remarks state a belief that someone was murdered because they didn’t like Trump; an assertion that can be viewed as narcissistic by inserting himself into a situation that had nothing to do with him in any contextual way,” she continued.\n\nCromer later added that overall, Trump’s remarks about Reiner “communicates a lack of respect for psychological and personal boundaries for those affected by this incident.”\n\nMedical Examiner Report States Rob And Michele Reiner’s Cause Of Death\n\n2 Of Rob Reiner's Children Release Statement On Parents' Deaths\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post",

    "fullText": "Locals band together in David v Goliath battle against facility they say would jack up bills, increase pollution and destroy area’s character\n\nA who’s who of the nation’s most powerful politicians and tech tycoons are forcing through a proposal for a massive data center in rural Michigan as locals from across the political spectrum have come out in force against it, with one calling it “uniquely evil”.\n\nSaline Township, Michigan, residents fear the $7bn center would jack up energy bills, pollute groundwater, and destroy the area’s rural character. The 1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help derail Michigan’s nation-leading transition to renewable energy.\n\nResponding to resident pressure, Saline Township’s board of trustees in September voted down the plans, but the data center’s powerful backers – including Donald Trump, Open AI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, utility giant DTE Energy, and Stephen Ross, the real-estate billionaire and Trump donor who owns Related Co – fought back.\n\nRelated Digital sued, and, vastly outgunned, the township board quickly folded and reversed its decision over strong resident objections. Now the project’s backers are trying to avoid minimal regulatory scrutiny on energy costs and pollution.\n\nThe controversy over the data center is representative of the David v Goliath fights playing out across the US, pitting working- and middle-class residents against the interests of billionaires and the political establishment.\n\n“This is part of an experience that America and the world is having around tech billionaires who are seizing power and widening the gap between those have much too much … and the working and middle classes,” said Yousef Rabhi, a former Democratic state legislative leader and clean energy advocate who opposes the plans.\n\n“That’s what these data centers are symbolic of, and they’re the vehicle for is the furtherance of this divide,” Rabhi added.\n\nThe proposal is part of the broader “Stargate” project composed of five data centers backed by the Trump administration, which granted $500bn in federal subsidies for them. It’s the largest project in Michigan history in terms of investment, and it also received subsidies on taxes that could have gone to roads and schools, among other uses, Rabhi said.\n\nThe plan’s supporters say the center would provide essential AI infrastructure, in part for national security, and create a few hundred jobs. Huge sums of money are at stake for the tech and utility companies.\n\nRoss’s Related Digital is the data center’s developer, while OpenAI, which produced ChatGPT, and Oracle will use the center to house its AI infrastructure.\n\nIn a statement, Related Digital alleged company the township’s decision violated zoning laws, and the spokesperson stressed the suit was filed jointly with three Saline Township property owners who are selling their property to Related.\n\n“Thankfully, we were able to reach a settlement agreement with the township to allow this project to move forward,” the spokesperson said. They noted Related is also making about $14m in donations to local causes.\n\nSaline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor. The Stargate project is one of around a dozen data center proposals in Michigan over the last year that are strongly opposed at the local level. It’s one of four proposed near Ann Arbor – last week, plans for a second a few miles away in a neighboring town surfaced.\n\nSome municipalities have been successful in derailing plans, while others have lost the fight.\n\nIn Saline Township, former US marine Kate Haushalter and her husband are raising five children in a farmhouse next to the data center site. They bought and renovated the once-dilapidated home so they could live in a bucolic area, and Haushalter said she was not about to cede ground even though the township did.\n\n“Maybe because I was in the Marine Corps, but I would rather stay and fight,” Haushalter said. “I’m sure the chances are slim, but it’s worth fighting for, and I don’t want to teach my kids to roll over.”\n\nBig tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Open AI, which often own data centers, typically have enough political support at the state and federal levels that inexperienced local leaders who are comparatively poorly resourced are left on their own to defend their town from the centers.\n\nSaline Township supervisor Jim Marion conveyed that challenge when he told angry residents during a contentious November discussion that the township’s “hands were tied”.\n\n“This township doesn’t have the money to fight these big companies. You got to understand that,” Marion told the crowd. “We were dealt the cards we were dealt.”\n\nSome municipalities have utilized zoning laws to block the centers. Beyond that, there’s little local officials can do, and state and federal level regulations on the centers are virtually non-existent.\n\nStill, residents are growing more organized. A first protest on 1 December drew about 200 people, who Rabhi described as “truly a cross-section of American society”. The next week, 800 people participated in a state-level public input session, and organizers are pressuring state environmental regulators to hold up the project’s required wetland permits.\n\nAmong residents leading the pushback is Josh LeBaron, whose home sits about 500 yards from the site, where crews have broken down.\n\nHe characterized the project as “uniquely evil” because of the environmental risks, and because, he and others allege, the companies and government have been secretive about their plans. In response to questions about accusations of nimby-ism leveled against local residents by the project’s supporters, LeBaron said he would not be opposed to other developments.\n\nHe noted that Michigan is full of former industrial sites that would be more appropriate for the 575-acre property.\n\n“I would be at home reading a book if it were a subdivision,” LeBaron said.\n\nA Related spokesperson told the Guardian the company “explored sites across Michigan before deciding on this site, which is ideal as it’s a contiguous flat area”, and is set close to a major road and transmission lines.\n\nLocal opponents’ best hope for holding up the project lies in the arcane utility regulatory process on the massive amount of power the data center would require.\n\nDTE Energy claims the data center’s power demands and need for expensive new infrastructure will not increase residential electricity prices.\n\nBut it doesn’t want to show its math.\n\nDTE filed a petition with the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC), the state agency that regulates utilities, asking the MPSC to fast-track the plan’s approval. DTE’s request for an “ex parte” case requires limited scrutiny of its claim that the center won’t destroy the climate laws, or increase electricity bills.\n\nIn response, Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel and consumer advocacy groups filed a legal petition with the MPSC, calling for a “contested case” that would require much closer regulatory review of DTE’s claims.\n\nThe MPSC is helmed by Whitmer appointees, and the governor has strongly backed the project, raising suspicions among opponents that the agency will approve the ex parte request.\n\nStudies from across the country have shown data centers often increase rates, and DTE and regulators “cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence”, said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the regulatory battle.\n\nIn a statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “To be clear, these data center customer contracts will NOT create a cost increase for our existing customers.”\n\nDTE has said the project won’t derail Michigan’s transition to clean energy, but state data and DTE’s plans suggest otherwise.\n\nMichigan, in late 2023, passed nation-leading climate laws that require utilities to transition to renewable energy by 2040. But the law included an “off-ramp” that allows utilities to continue running or building fossil fuel plants if renewable sources cannot handle the energy grid’s load.\n\nAt its peak, DTE’s grid already demands about 9.5 gigawatts of power, while the grid’s capacity is 11gw.\n\nIn July, DTE told investors it is in negotiations with big tech companies to provide 7gw of power for several proposed data centers.\n\nThe Saline center’s 1.4gw may not cause an exceedance of the 11gw threshold, especially because DTE is planning to build battery storage. But the Saline center along with any of the other proposed centers likely would trigger the off-ramp.\n\nDTE appears to be planning for that likelihood: DTE Energy executives said the company would likely need to build new gas plants to accommodate the data centers’ demand.\n\nHaushalter’s kids were born in the renovated farmhouse and are homeschooled there.\n\nShe and her husband try to teach the kids to respect nature. The family manages beehives, watches the geese and plant trees for wood to use in their wood-burning stove. At night, they take the kids outdoors for bonfires to look at the stars. “We’re not a big screen family,” Haushlater said.\n\nThe noise, light and air pollution is already disrupting the life the family built over 13 years. The center, if it is fully built, would fully destroy it, Haushalter said.\n\n“We are really passionate about nature and teaching our kids about it and I can’t believe the biggest construction project in Michigan is landing literally in my backyard, and there’s no recourse for the little guy,” she said. “It’s going to crush us.”",

    "fullText": "Growth in the US economy – and the president’s political survival – rest on AI. The EU must use its leverage and stand up to him\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

    "description": "The Pentagon is policing troops' speech in ways experts call an \"abuse.\" Some service members are self-censoring and scrambling to scrub social media.",
    "fullText": "Pentagon leadership's intensifying scrutiny of speech that is critical of conservatives and the Trump administration is fueling anxiety in the ranks and has some service members scrambling to protect their careers.\n\nIn interviews with Business Insider, troops and legal advisors detailed how behavior has changed amid the recent crackdown, which has some facing administrative actions that can end a career without a court-martial.\n\n\"I had to take my pronouns off my LinkedIn. I've scrubbed everything that has ever mentioned or supported\" LGBTQ causes, the Marine sergeant told Business Insider. She said her mentor warned that Pentagon officials may be looking for \"anything that could be construed as contrary to the vision that the current administration has.\"\n\nThese individual acts of self-censorship mirror a broader chill sweeping the ranks, especially as the crackdown has burst into the open at the highest levels. Tensions flared again this week as the Defense Department said it was launching a command investigation of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly after a preliminary review of his video urging troops to defy unlawful orders.\n\nThe Trump administration says it has a prerogative to police speech it deems offensive or inappropriate, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the administration's policies are intended \"to rip out the politics\" from the services. Some experts on military law say the scrutiny and its repercussions are an abuse of the military's authority.\n\nOne of the flashpoints has been the September murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Top Pentagon leaders have said it's \"unacceptable\" for troops \"to celebrate or mock\" the killing.\n\nAfter Kirk's killing, some service members said things online like \"glad he's dead.\" Others criticized his rhetoric or, more broadly, complained about Trump administration policies or conservatives. In one case, a colonel was suspended for lamenting to friends the angry arguments that followed Kirk's death.\n\nMore than 120 service members have been investigated for political comments since Kirk's death, according to a tally reported by The Washington Post.\n\nNearly a dozen military-law experts told Business Insider the punishments generally wouldn't hold up in a military courtroom because they lack the elements of speech crimes, such as \"contemptuous\" words against an elected leader, or because the comments were unrelated to the military and not said in uniform.\n\n\"What we're seeing now is abuse of speech restrictions,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a Southwestern Law School professor and retired Air Force JAG who is an expert on military speech.\n\n\"Our service members understand that their rights are more restricted within the military. Now they're being chilled into giving up the rights they actually do have,\" she said. \"It's unprecedented.\"\n\nMilitary leaders have disclosed that they are tracking \"unprofessional\" social media use. An October message from the Navy secretary encouraged sailors and Marines to \"refrain from social media engagement\" about official government or military policies.\n\n\"This is more than just policing manners,\" said Frank Rosenblatt, a professor at the Mississippi College School of Law and a retired Army JAG. \"A wider muzzling of the military seems to really serve what they're trying to do — identify these deep state people who are not politically trustworthy.\"\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice imposes some restrictions on troops, criminalizing speech that disrespects officers and civilian leaders, or that undermines the obedience necessary to carry out orders. Troops retain many First Amendment protections; hate speech, for instance, is lawful unless it has a military connection, such as if it was uttered on a base or warship.\n\nThe hunt for speech crimes is fueling suspicion and distrust among some. The field-grade officer who shut down her Facebook said she now worries that a casual remark could brand her as liberal and thus politically suspect.\n\nShe has begun scrutinizing parts of her career she never imagined — where her office is located, who works nearby, whether to respond to articles shared in group chats, and even whether to travel with coworkers she doesn't know well.\n\n\"It just takes one person to flag you as disloyal to end your career — or worse,\" said the officer, who asked for anonymity to avoid official retaliation.\n\nDon C. King, a civilian defense attorney, said he got a call recently from a worried service member. They'd written a social media post critical of the Trump administration's lethal attacks on suspected drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela. Someone at their command saw it and told them, \"'Hey, you better be careful with your social media.'\"\n\n\"I've been in the military my entire adult life, over 30 years, and I've never seen any of the services or DoD scout social media for what it considers to be inappropriate speech,\" said King, who retired as a Navy JAG in 2022 and owns the King Military Law firm specializing in military clients.\n\nThe allegations against rank-and-file troops are unfolding in the military's administrative system, which can discipline troops and end careers outside of public court proceedings.\n\n\"These cases are early, and both the government and the affected individuals are figuring out how they want to fight,\" said Eugene R. Fidell, an influential military law expert and senior research scholar at Yale. \"The simple wear and tear of having to defend and try to overturn one of these administrative sanctions is itself a punishment.\"\n\nFirst Amendment restrictions on troops stem from the military's apolitical role and its reliance on obedience to orders. Officers can face criminal penalties for \"contemptuous\" words about the president, as can all personnel for disrespecting a senior officer. However, troops can comment politically, donate to a campaign, or display bumper stickers. Their protections are strongest when their comments are in a personal capacity, made out of uniform and without any hint of official endorsement.\n\nSocial media can amplify a service member's comments far beyond a bumper sticker, regardless of intention. That poses higher risks that the military as an institution could be seen as backing a political party or objective, said Peter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University who authored a 2023 book, \"Thanks For Your Service,\" about how high confidence in the military has depended on beliefs about its competence and its avoidance of partisan politics.\n\n\"The military is becoming combatants in the culture wars,\" he said. Part of the way to change that, he said, \"requires the military not to sound like they're culture warriors.\"\n\n\"So you may have a right to say it, but it wouldn't be right to say it,\" he added.\n\nMilitary law criminalizes conduct that disgraces an officer or damages good order and discipline; however, case law has set a high bar when the conduct at issue is purely private speech otherwise protected by the First Amendment.\n\nBrent Sadler, a defense expert at a leading conservative think tank, said speech monitoring is justified to enforce the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\n\"The issue is more about professionalism and protecting any appearance of the military interfering with political-civil control,\" said Sadler, a retired Navy captain and senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"I do think numerous conservatives in the military have been persecuted legally and professionally,\" he said, pointing to the 8,000 troops kicked out for refusing the COVID vaccine mandate before the Pentagon rescinded it in 2023.\n\nMark Jensen, a former Army JAG who retired earlier this year, said the Pentagon's policing has expanded over the past few months from \"despicable\" speech about Kirk, to rebukes of his politics, to advocacy for transgender people, to criticism of the Trump administration.\n\nJensen represents four military clients and a civilian who face punishment for their speech. The fact that some of the allegations are public is the result of an anti-\"woke\" online army that publishes hearsay and leaked comments on sites like X.\n\nOn top of being \"smeared,\" Jensen said, these troops undergo the stress of an investigation, a relief if they're in leadership, a poor evaluation, a reprimand by a general, and face a review that can reduce their rank.\n\n\"It's like a 1-2-3-4-5 punch,\" Jensen said. \"All of it with minimal due process.\"\n\nKelly is not the only veteran to unexpectedly face punishment. In one recent case, an ex-soldier on the inactive reserve — a roster of those who can be reactivated in a national emergency — told a civilian attorney he was investigated by military officials for a private social media post, the attorney said.\n\n\"Even when people are in the normal reserves, the regulations are pretty clear that conduct in a civilian capacity shouldn't be punished in a military capacity,\" said Cody Harnish, a private defense attorney and former Army JAG who specializes in UCMJ cases.\n\n\"They're way out of their depth here.\"\n\nStaff writer Kelsey Baker contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: More than 150 anonymous channels using cheap AI tools to spread false stories about Keir Starmer, study finds\n\nYouTube channels spreading fake, anti-Labour videos have amassed more than a billion views this year, as opportunists attempt to use AI-generated content to profit from political division in the UK.\n\nMore than 150 channels have been detected in the last year that promote anti-Labour narratives, as well as outright fake and inflammatory accusations about Keir Starmer.\n\nA study seen by the Guardian has found the channels have accumulated 5.3m subscribers and have created more than 56,000 videos, with a total of almost 1.2bn views in 2025. The network of anonymous channels includes alarmist rhetoric, AI scripts and British narrators to attract hits.\n\nStarmer is personally targeted. The prime minister was either named in the video title or description 15,600 times.\n\nReset Tech, the non-profit group that produced the research, said the channels were part of a global trend to produce synthetic propaganda on the platform. It pointed to the proliferation of cheap AI tools that could be deployed to make a quick profit from divisive topics.\n\nOne channel called Britain News-night talked about Starmer and Reeves facing arrest. Another, TheUKPoliticalBrief, touted videos on the “explosive truth” about immigrant crime and marches on Westminster.\n\nThe UK NewsCore channel focused on how Nigel Farage was ousting Starmer, and claimed the prime minister was “sacked live” and thrown out of parliament.\n\nOther videos featured bizarre, fabricated stories about a row between the royal family and the government. One channel, Gold Up!, said the dispute had left Starmer “melting down on live TV”.\n\nSome of the videos and channels were removed by YouTube’s checks. However, all 150 were taken down when the platform was approached by the Guardian. Reset Tech said some channels had created tens or hundreds of similar videos without being deplatformed.\n\nThe research found similar channels operating in German, French, Spanish and Polish, targeting other politicians or political issues. In total, it mapped 420 problematic channels operating in Europe. Reset Tech said Russian-speaking creators operate some of the channels.\n\nIt is believed channels aimed at the UK were being driven by opportunistic creators trying to monetise political division over issues like immigration, rather than overseas political actors. However, it said their presence still posed a risk to public trust.\n\nThe content has caused concern inside Labour. “The rise of fake news online is a serious threat to our democracy,” a spokesperson said. “The public will be rightly alarmed that democratically elected leaders and institutions are being undermined by bad faith foreign state actors and those seeking to profit from misinformation.\n\n“We’ve already seen attempts from overseas to influence fair elections and manipulate public opinion both here and abroad.\n\n“The government is stepping up its efforts to work with online platforms to tackle this scourge on free and fair democracy. But it’s important that tech bosses take this threat seriously and live up to their obligations to remove this type of content wherever it’s found.”\n\nDylan Sparks, UK director of Reset Tech, called for YouTube to take swifter action. “Malicious actors are permitted by YouTube to spread synthetic ‘news’ that disrupts political debate in the UK, while also earning revenue from it,” he said. “This AI-generated, low cost content spreads across the platform undetected, revealing clear weaknesses in YouTube’s monetisation and content moderation systems.\n\n“This specific network focuses on the prime minister and Labour government, but the same loopholes could be exploited by any hostile actor to push an agenda. Because social media platforms profit from engagement, their business model creates an in-built tension between enforcing their own policies and reducing the spread of malicious content that drives revenue.\n\n“The rapid spread of AI has also introduced new risks to the online environment, and platforms need to move faster and invest more to address them.”\n\nA YouTube spokesperson said: “Spam and deceptive practices that try to take advantage of the YouTube community are not allowed on the platform, which is why the channels flagged by the Guardian have all been removed.\n\n“We enforce our policies consistently, regardless of political viewpoint expressed, or how the content is generated. Our teams work around the clock to monitor for harmful content, taking swift action as needed.”\n\nYouTube is now working with Reset Tech over its findings. The platform said its systems prominently feature authoritative news content on the YouTube homepage, in search results, and through recommendations. It has removed more than 2.1m channels for violating its community guidelines.\n\nMinisters have already formed an online advertising taskforce to see what action can be taken to address the advertising-based monetisation of harmful and misleading content.",

    "fullText": "Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville accused Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) of breaking the “first rule of politics” following her announcement that she’s running for Senate.\n\nOn the Politics War Room podcast on Thursday, Carville and co-host Al Hunt expressed some hope for Democrats in the red state of Texas, but Carville laid out his problems with Crockett.\n\n“First of all, it seems like she’s well-educated. It seems like she’s got a lot of energy. But she, to me, she violates the first rule of politics, and that is, in politics, you always make it about the voters and never about yourself,” Carville said.\n\nListening to Crockett, he argued, it’s clear that it’s “a lot more about herself than it is the voters.”\n\nCarville added that Crockett can still be successful in her Senate run and recommended she collect the support of Democrats who have favored voting Republican.\n\n“You can get all the hits. You can get all the clicks. You can get on all of the TV shows. You can get in as long as you’re polemic, but you’re not helping very much,” he said.\n\nCarville still cautioned that “talking incessantly” about yourself is not what wins elections, and he hasn’t been impressed with Crockett’s “framing” and “understanding where people are coming from” on issues.\n\n“We know what wins elections. We just do,” he said. “And what wins elections is not sitting there talking incessantly about yourself. Winning elections is not how many clicks you get or how much overnight fundraising you do. Winning elections is being part of framing issues and understanding where people are coming from, and I don’t think [Congresswoman] Crockett is very good at that. I’ll be very frank.”\n\nCrockett, running with the slogan of “Texas Tough,” said she’s running for the Senate seat currently held by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) because Democrats need a “bigger voice.” She vowed to focus on issues like affordability.\n\n“There are a lot of people that said, ‘You gotta stay in the House. We need our voice. We need you there,” she told supporters this week. “And I understand. But what we need is a bigger voice.”\n\nThe post James Carville Blasts Fellow Democrat Jasmine Crockett for Violating ‘First Rule of Politics’: ‘I’ll Be Very Frank’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Platform fighting world-leading ban on grounds it contravenes implied freedom of political communication in...",
    "fullText": "Platform fighting world-leading ban on grounds it contravenes implied freedom of political communication in constitution\n\nWill Australia’s social media ban survive a high court challenge?\n\nReddit has filed a challenge against Australia’s under-16s social media ban in the high court, lodging its case two days after implementing age restrictions on its website.\n\n The company said in a Reddit post on Friday that while it agreed with protecting people under 16, the law “has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences”.\n\nReddit said there was an “illogical patchwork” of platforms included in the ban.\n\n“As the Australian Human Rights Commission put it, ‘There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights.’”\n\nReddit argued it was a forum primarily for adults without the traditional social media features the government has “taken issue with”.\n\nReddit was challenging the law on the grounds it infringed on the implied freedom of political communication. It was also seeking to challenge whether Reddit could be considered an age-restricted social media platform under the legislation.\n\nIt said it was not seeking to challenge the law to avoid compliance, and had implemented age-assurance measures since Wednesday.\n\nThe company said the vast majority of Redditors were adults, and advertising wasn’t targeted to children under 18. The Apple app store age rating for Reddit is 17+.\n\n“Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark on actually protecting young people online,” Reddit said. “So, while we will comply with this law, we have a responsibility to share our perspective and see that it is reviewed by the courts.”\n\nReddit’s challenge is separate from one filed by New South Wales Libertarian MP John Ruddick’s Digital Freedom Project group. The next court appearance for Digital Freedom Project group is late February, and Reddit expects it will be heard sometime next year, if the high court takes up the case.\n\nProf Sarah Joseph, from Griffith university’s law school, said she believes there was a strong case against the ban.\n\n“I do believe the legislation has cut off the main source of political information for people under the age of 16, in terms of their receiving and giving information. Whilst that is not the intention of the legislation, that is one of its many effects,” she said.\n\n“Whilst other sources remain open, they operate in very different ways and do not provide the same means to communicate one’s opinions, and the same variety of opinions.”\n\nBut Joseph said she believed the high court case was more likely to fail, as with most challenges to legislation on implied freedom of communications grounds.\n\n“The freedom is engaged in most cases, but the high court goes on to find the law to be proportionate. In reality, the constitutional freedom is quite weak due to the way that it has been interpreted and applied.”\n\nA law that has the effect of reducing the overall volume of political communication in Australia will be invalid unless it is proportionate to a legitimate purpose, constitutional law professor Luke Beck wrote in the Guardian on Thursday.\n\n“[But] the social media account ban only slightly reduces the overall volume of political communication in Australia,” the Monash University academic said.\n\n“The law does not ban teenagers from using the internet or having online group chats. It’s likely that in the [Ruddick] social media account case … the government will succeed.”\n\nThe Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Reddit had argued to the eSafety commissioner in September that it should be excluded from the ban.\n\n“The sole or significant purpose of our platform is to provide knowledge-sharing in timely, context-rich conversations; interaction between end-users is simply an incidental step to enabling this primary purpose,” Reddit said in the letter obtained under freedom of information laws.\n\n“It is not in keeping with Reddit norms for users to use their real names or identities on Reddit, as communities are not centred around real-time social networking among young people.”\n\nReddit does not promote real-time presence, friend requests or activity feeds that drive ongoing engagement, the company said. It said it was committed to collecting minimal personal information from users to preserve pseudonymity on the platform.\n\nReddit was a “pseudonymous platform organised around sharing information in topic-based communities rather than personal profiles or social networks,” the platform said.\n\nThe 10 platforms the government announced were covered by the ban – Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit – had all implemented measures to comply by Wednesday.",
