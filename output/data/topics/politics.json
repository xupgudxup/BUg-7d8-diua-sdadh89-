    "fullText": "Listen and \n\nAnthony Scaramucci quickly exited stage left from his communications role during the Trump 45 administration, but he isn't mincing words.\n\n\"If we could stay the course, not blow ourselves up, [and] have some decent, predictable political policies, the economy will recover,\" the Skybridge Capital founder told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi in a new episode of the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast.\n\nIn addition to a short stint during Trump's first term — chronicled in his book \"From Wall Street to the White House and Back\" — Scaramucci's résumé includes an early career at Goldman Sachs before co-founding alternative asset manager Skybridge in 2005.\n\nRecently, markets have wavered amid news related to AI's growing power and Washington's political dysfunction. In D.C., \"unrest and uncertainty\" have become an issue, according to Scaramucci, who added that markets prefer \"evenness, predictability, and stability,\" while the \"on-again, off-again knee-jerking with tariffs is a mistake.\"\n\n\"I think it's hurting the markets,\" he continued. \"We could be doing way better if we had sound policies without capriciousness and uncertainty.\"\n\nThis conversation comes as once popular \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, such as Microsoft (MSFT), are experiencing pullbacks.\n\n\"Twenty stocks are holding up the market,\" Scaramucci said, adding that bitcoin's 50% correction is notable. \"Bitcoin is a leading indicator, so you're probably going to have a lot of roll-off in the stock market.\"\n\nCurrent market performance is also worth a look. Year to date, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down 24.43%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has inched up 1% in 2026, the Russell 2000 (RTY=F) is up 6%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is down 1%.\n\nScaramucci sees any market downturn as temporary. \"I don't think it's going to be overly hellish, because you've got a lot of firepower from the Federal Reserve,\" he said.\n\n\"I still think [Fed chair Jerome] Powell, who is a data-dependent guy, will start cutting rates, particularly [if he sees weakness] in the overall marketplace,\" he said.\n\nScaramucci also intends to keep calm and carry on. \"Would I change my investment thesis because of this short-term stuff that's going on?\" he asked. \"I would not, and I would encourage people not to.\"",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nThe cost-of-living crunch has become a persistent pressure point in the U.S., with housing affordability weighing heavily on many households. But according to one TikTok creator who “fled” the country for Canada, the financial strain hasn’t eased north of the border — far from it.\n\nNope Brigade (@nopebrigade0), a TikTok creator with more than 140,000 followers, recently posted a video explaining their situation.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nMost Americans earn a dismal 0.39% APY on their cash at big banks. Unlock up to 4.05% APY and pay $0 in account fees instead with a Wealthfront Cash Account\n\n“I'm a scholar of the far right who has fled the United States to Canada and I need help,” they said (1). While they declined to reveal their name or academic institution, their YouTube channel description states that they are a Ph.D. candidate in sociology (2).\n\nIn the video, Brigade described the situation in Canada as “absolutely dire,” pointing specifically to housing costs as the biggest challenge.\n\n“For Americans who don't know, the housing crisis here is worse than in the United States. I lived in LA for six years and I have not faced rent as bad as here,” they said.\n\nTo be sure, the region they chose is among the most expensive in the country.\n\n“When my partner, our cat and our dog fled the United States, we headed north, with the goal of being close to where our families are located, which is on the West Coast. So we are now in British Columbia. More specifically, we are in the Sea-to-Sky Highway in the Greater Vancouver area,” they explained.\n\nVancouver is widely regarded as one of the most expensive cities in Canada — and among the priciest in the world in terms of housing and overall cost of living (3).\n\nTheir financial situation is further complicated by their immigration status. Brigade said they and their partner are in Canada on visitor visas, which do not allow them to work.\n\n“So we are currently surviving off of what savings we could get together before we fled the United States and that's not terribly much,” they said.\n\nBrigade also made a direct appeal for assistance from viewers.\n\n“Because there are two adults, a cat and a dog, we are looking for more than a room, but one bedroom, two bedroom for free or below market rates,” they said, adding “If we can't find housing, we're going to have to leave and I don't know where we'll go.”",

    "fullText": "As Barcelona’s presidential campaign gathers pace, Lionel Messi’s name continues to surface, despite the player having no desire to be part of the political noise surrounding the club.\n\nIn fact, a recent report from MARCA reveals that banners and indirect references to the Argentine legend are being used by candidates without his knowledge or consent.\n\nFurthermore, according to sources close to Messi, he has not held conversations with any of the presidential hopefuls and does not intend to do so while the electoral process is ongoing.\n\nThe irony is striking, as Messi has become one of the most talked-about figures in the campaign, yet he has actively chosen to remain on the sidelines.\n\nFrom the very beginning, he did not want to influence or be associated with any candidacy.\n\nOne of the clearest examples came from Marc Ciria, who displayed a banner in Barcelona carrying the phrase “Looking forward to seeing you again.”\n\nAlthough the message avoided directly naming Messi or showing a clear image of him, the meaning was obvious to supporters.\n\nThe gesture created buzz, but it reportedly took Messi’s camp by surprise.\n\nThere was also movement from Victor Font. It is said that attempts were made to connect with individuals close to the Argentine.\n\nThose efforts, however, did not lead to direct contact. Font has since explained that any past communication occurred years ago and not with Messi personally.\n\nMeanwhile, the last club president, Joan Laporta, has publicly discussed his relationship with the former captain.\n\nLaporta has spoken about Messi’s departure and the possibility of a testimonial, stating that the final decision rests with the player. For now, though, only Laporta’s perspective has been aired publicly.\n\nAs such, Messi’s entourage continues to repeat the same message that there will be no involvement, either openly or quietly.\n\nEven if certain developments in the campaign have not pleased him, he will not intervene.",

People are so negative out there and they are just trying to find a reason to put people down and make something out of almost nothing.”\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nThe women’s team also captured gold against Canada in a dramatic overtime days earlier in Milan but was insulted by Trump in his congratulatory phone call to the men’s team where he proffered the invite.\n\n“And we have to — I must tell you — we’re going to have to bring the women’s team,” the president said to to laughter from the players. ”[If I don’t] do that, I do believe I probably would be impeached, OK?”\n\nPolitics: Longtime Trump Supporter's Husband Detained By ICE, Says President 'Ruined Our Life'\n\nUSA Hockey declined on the women’s behalf. “We .. deeply appreciate the recognition of their extraordinary achievement,” the statement went.\n\nBut the dismissive reaction of Trump and the players generated criticism online, and even calls for the U.S. men’s team to reject the White House offer.\n\nHughes insisted all was well between the men’s team and the women’s team.\n\n“I think we are so tight with their group,” he told the tabloid. “After we won the gold medal we were in the cafeteria at 3:30 a.m. in the morning with them and we go from there, pack our bags and we’re on the bus.”\n\nPolitics: Texts Show GOP Rep Asked For ‘Sexy Pic’ From Now-Deceased Aide\n\n“People are so negative about things,” he continued. “I think everyone in that locker room knows how much we support them, how proud we are of them and we know the same way we feel about them, they feel about us.”\n\nHughes, who plays for the New Jersey Devils in the NHL, wasn’t apologizing for visiting Trump.\n\n“We’re athletes,” he said to the Daily Mail.

    "fullText": "Life is complicated. Regardless of what your beliefs or politics or ethics are, the way that we set up our society and economy will often force you to act against them: You might not want to fly somewhere but your employer will not accept another mode of transportation, you want to eat vegan but are at some point in a situation where the best you can do is a vegetarian option.\n\nSometimes it’s not even our hand being forced but us not having the mental strength or priorities to do something: I could just not use WhatsApp because it is owned by Meta but my son’s daycare organizes everything through WhatsApp and do I really want to force my belief on all those very busy parents and caretakers or should I just bite the bullet and use the tool that seems to work for everyone – even though it’s not perfect?\n\nThere are no one-size-fits-all solutions for this: Sometimes a belief or ethic you hold is so integral to you that you will not move. Sometimes they are held loosely enough to let go under certain conditions. There’s a multitude of factors and thoughts that go into those kinds of decisions and at some point you just gotta make a call based on what’s in front of you and your priorities.\n\nWhat I am saying is: We are all doing things we know are not ideal, are either morally questionable or do not align with our values. That’s life. I for example know that consuming meat is problematic for ethical and ecological reasons, I still do it sometimes. I reduce as much as I can but I am far from perfect. Just one of the many examples of my actions not being perfectly and purely aligned with my beliefs.\n\nAnd I am 100% sure each and every reader will have similar experiences. We are imperfect and messy beings. In the end all you can do is actually try to make good decisions based on your values, try to learn from your actions and ideally do better – or at least understand what were the forces that go you to act against your values.\n\nCory Doctorow, probably one of the most influential writers about digital technology and culture celebrated the 6th anniversary of his personal blog pluralistic – congratulations! Cory is quite the phenomenon, I know nobody with his amount of output and his consistency of publication. It is scary just how consistently he writes and published while also churning out books. I do admire his work ethic tremendously.\n\nBut one thing in his celebratory post rubbed me the wrong way and I think it’s worth pointing out. Not for the one specific case but because it highlights a problematic way of thinking that I see a lot in current tech discourse that stands in the way of us actually improving the world.\n\nSo Cory outlines his process of how he publishes to his blog (and then pushes the same writing out to other places). He describes how one QA step in his process is piping his writing through an LLM (using the Ollama software, it’s unclear which open weight LLM he uses) to check for typos and small grammar mistakes. He then points out how some readers might find that problematic:\n\n“Doubtless some of you are affronted by my modest use of an LLM. You think that LLMs are “fruits of the poisoned tree” and must be eschewed because they are saturated with the sin of their origins. I think this is a very bad take, the kind of rathole that purity culture always ends up in.”\n\nUsing LLMs isn’t always popular with the cool crowd, Cory knows that. And he wants to defend his (quite modest) use, which I understand: Nobody likes their problematic behavior being pointed out to them. But as outlined: Life’s complicated. Cory could just have said “I know there are many critiques of LLMs, but right now that is the best way for me to enable my work, I try to limit the problematic aspects by using a small open weight model and checking the results in detail.” and have moved on. But he needed to make a stand. And that stand lead him into the problematic train of thought that I wanted to point out here. Because many, many people listen to him and basically take his word as the gospel. So great power, great responsibility and such.\n\nThe whole argument is based on a strawman. Let’s look at Cory’s words:\n\nLet’s start with some context. If you don’t want to use technology that was created under immoral circumstances or that sprang from an immoral mind, then you are totally fucked. I mean, all the way down to the silicon chips in your device, which can never be fully disentangled from the odious, paranoid racist William Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the silicon transistor\n\nCory is right in pointing out that almost any technology we have has been touch by problematic figures. Racists, fascists, sexists, rapists. You name it. Anything you touch will have some research or engineering or product work by a person you despise in it.\n\nThe strawman is his claim that people who criticize LLM usage are doing that for some form of absolutist reasons. That they have a fully binary view of the world as separated into “acceptable, pure things” and “garbage”. Which is of course false. Because they are using a computer, using warm water that’s probably heated through the use of fossil fuels etc.\n\nHe attacks a ridiculous made-up figure to deflect from specific criticism of LLM use (that many probably wouldn’t even apply that strongly to his use case). But that’s not where criticism of LLMs comes from: It’s mostly specific focusing on the material properties of these systems, their production and use.\n\n“Refusing to use a technology because the people who developed it were indefensible creeps is a self-owning dead-end. You know what’s better than refusing to use a technology because you hate its creators? Seizing that technology and making it your own. Don’t like the fact that a convicted monopolist has a death-grip on networking? Steal its protocol, release a free software version of it, and leave it in your dust:”\n\nHere again Cory is misrepresenting the LLM-critic’s argument: Sam Altman is a scam artist and habitual liar, but that’s not one of the first 10 to 20 reasons people criticise OpenAI’s products. Sure, basically every leading figure in the “AI” space seems to be unpleasant at best but that’s true for most of tech TBH. People criticise LLMs for their structural properties, their material impacts, for the way they make it harder to learn and grow, for the way they make products worse while creating massive negative externalities in the form of emissions, water use and e-waste. For the way these systems can only be build by taking every piece of data – regardless of whether the authors consent or even explicitly refuse – and how the training needs ungodly amounts of harmful, exploitative labor done mostly by people in countries from the global majority. How it materially harms the commons.\n\nEven if OpenAI was run by decent, ethical, friendly, trustworthy people (which would then of course make them not work on the products OpenAI has, but it’s just a thought experiment) their products would need to be criticized for what they are and what they do. It’s really not about these few dudes running the companies.\n\nCory misrepresents the arguments (well basically hides them) in order to not have to face any material criticism and turns them into “you just don’t like these people” which frames the criticism as emotional and not rational. As if it was about not liking a bunch of rich men.\n\nHe then goes into how the path forward is to “steal the protocol”. His following paragraph goes into detail:\n\n“That’s how we make good tech: not by insisting that all its inputs be free from sin, but by purging that wickedness by liberating the technology from its monstrous forebears and making free and open versions of it”\n\nAnd here we are coming to the core of the problematic argument. Because Cory implicitly argues that technology is neutral and that one can just change its meaning and effect through usage. But as Langdon Winner argues in his famous essay “Do artifacts have politics” artifacts have built-in politics deriving from their structure. A famous example is the nuclear power plant: Due to the danger of these plants, their needs with regards to resources as well as security, power plants imply a certain form of political arrangement based on having a strong security force/army and a way to force these facilities (and facilities to store the waste in) upon communities potentially against their will.\n\nArtifacts and technologies have certain logics built into their structure that do require certain arrangements around them or that bring forward certain arrangements. The second aspect is often illustrated by how ships are organized: Because ships are sometimes in dangerous situations and sometimes critical decisions need to be made, the existence of ships implies the existence of a hierarchy of power relationships with a captain having the final say. Because democracy would be too slow at times. These politics are built into the artifact.\n\nUnderstanding this you cannot take any technology and “make it good”. Is a torturing device “good” if the plans on how to build it are creative commons? Do we need to answer the existence of the digital torment nexus by building an open source torment nexus? I’d argue we need to destroy it – regardless of what license it is released under.\n\nThat does not mean that it is impossible to take certain technologies or artifacts and try to reframe them, change their meaning. In some way computers are one such example: They were first used by governments, banks and other corporations to reach their goals but where then taken and reframed as devices intended to support personal liberation. It’s a bit more complicated (for why, dive into the late David Golumbia’s “The Cultural Logic of Computation”) but let’s give that one to Cory. Sure, sometimes it is possible to take something originally built for nefarious purposes and find better uses for it. But is that true for everything? Very obviously not.\n\nLet’s just look at the embedded politics of LLMs: In order to train a capable system you need data. Lots of it. AI companies keep buying books to scan them, they download everything from every legal or illegal source claiming “fair use” (a doctrine that only applies to the US by the way) or that “scraping is always okay”. Capable LLMs require a logic of dominance and of disregarding consent of the people producing the artifacts that are the raw material for the system. LLMs are based on extraction, exploitation and subjugation: To produce these systems – even if you release the end result as open weights for people to use at home – you need to take cultural works, personal writing etc. from people who not only not consented but actively reject that notion. The politics of LLMs is violence. How does one “liberate” that? What’s the case for open source violence?\n\nHe uses a so-called “open source LLM” and that’s very much how he presents his values but open-source LLMs do not really exist. You can download some weights but cannot understand what went into them or really change or reproduce them. Open source AI is just marketing and openwashing.\n\nCory shows his libertarian leanings here: If everything is somehow “free and open” then we have won. But “free and open” in this context usually means that “certain privileged groups have easy access to it and are not limited in what to do with it”. That’s one of the core problems with the whole “open Source” movement: That it reduces all struggle to if one can get their hands on the tools and has any restrictions to using them.\n\nThis also shines through in Cory arguing that we need to “liberate” technology. What a strange idea: Technology doesn’t need liberation, people do. Technologies are tools, not what we actually care about. Sure, sometimes technologies can play a role in liberating people but just as often “freeing” a technology does quite the opposite to people: Ask the women who have massive amounts of nonconsensually created sexualized images and videos generated of them whether they think that the “liberation” of stochastic images generators is liberating them? Technology doesn’t need to be free. It cannot be free because freedom as a concept applies to people.\n\nAnd freedom is not the only value that we care about. Making everything “free” sounds cool but who pays for that freedom? Who pays for us having for example access to the freedom an open weight LLM brings? Our freedom as users rests on the exploitation of and violence against the people suffering the data centers, labeling the data for the training, the folks gathering the resources for NVIDIA to build chips. Freedom is not a zero-sum game but a lot of the freedoms that wealthy people in the right (which I am one of) enjoy stem from other people’s lack thereof.\n\n“Purity culture is such an obvious trap, an artifact of the neoliberal ideology that insists that the solution to all our problems is to shop very carefully, thus reducing all politics to personal consumption choices:”\n\nCory labels people’s values and their prioritization as “purity culture” (referring back to the black and white strawman the started this part of his post with) and then pulls a really interesting spin here: Many people criticizing LLMs come from a somewhat leftist (in contrast to Cory’s libertarian) background. Cory intentionally frames those leftist thoughts that put politics based on values as “neoliberal ideology” that reduces “all politics to personal consumption choices”. This is clever narratively: Tell those stupid leftists that they are just neoliberals, the thing they hate! Awesome.\n\nBut the argument against using LLMs is not about shopping and markets at all. My not using LLMs does not influence anything in that regard, Microsoft will just keep making the data center go BRRRRRRR.\n\nIn a way this framing shows more about Cory’s thinking than about that of the people he criticises: Cory is focused on markets and market dynamics and in that world it’s about purchasing. But moral choices only sometimes relate to markets. They do when I for example choose only to buy fairly produced garments. But when I for example refused conscription (when I was young Germany still forced every young man to learn how to kill) that was not a shopping decision. That was politics as well as leading an ethical life.\n\nPeople do not believe that “not using LLMs” will solve the issue of OpenAI etc all existing. They do no want to build on, use products with so clearly defined harms and negative externalities. Because they believe it to be wrong. Sure, there might be a utilitarian argument for “the thing exists anyways and if it saves you time, that’s good, right” but many people are not utilitarians. They want to lead a life where they feel their actions align with their values. In a way that is a path to freedom: To having the freedom to make the decisions one feels are right are in alignment with one’s values.\n\nWhich Cory actually also believe and acts upon when it’s about his values: He has refused to create a Bluesky account in spite of wanting to be there cause his friends are there for (good!) ideological reasons: Because Bluesky was back then and honestly is still today mostly centralized with the Bluesky corporation having a central chokepoint to control the network. Cory believes that one sometimes needs to make decisions based on one’s values. He just does not think that your values as someone not wanting to use LLMs matter.\n\nI mean, it was extraordinarily stupid for the Nazis to refuse Einstein’s work because it was “Jewish science,” but not merely because antisemitism is stupid.\n\nEverybody hates Nazis. Implying that one is in any way like the Nazis is just a killer argument. But let’s talk about Nazis for a second. The Nazis did a lot of psychological and medical research. On people they interned and later killed in concentration camps. There actually was a massive debate within especially psychology whether using the results of that kind of research is ethically possible. Utilitarianism of course argues that if it’s there one should use it but especially when your whole discipline is focused on understanding how our psyche works in order to for example help people in trauma just taking research that has been created through unthinkable violence and torture feels wrong. Feels contrarian to what your whole discipline is there for. This reminds me of Ursula K. Le Guin’s story “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas“: Omelas is an almost perfect city. Rich, democratic, pleasant. But it only works by having one small child in perpetual torment. Okay, but if that kid is already suffering because those other people chose to, should you walk away? Of just reap the fruits of that suffering?\n\nSometimes you need to walk away.\n\nCory then repeats the strawmen we already talked about and lands here:\n\n“It’s not “unethical” to scrape the web in order to create and analyze data-sets. That’s just “a search engine””\n\nAgain, he twists the argument in the way that the AI corporations like to do it as well: Search engines scour the web so AI companies should be allowed the same. It’s the same technology! But what’s the purpose?\n\nA search engine scrapes pages to build an “index” in order to let people find those pages. The scraping has value for the page and its owner as well because it leads to more people finding it and therefore connecting to the writer, journalist, musician, artist, etc. Search engines create connection.\n\nAI scrapers do not guide people towards the original maker’s work. They extract it and reproduce it (often wrongly). “AI”‘s don’t point out to the web for you to find other’s work to relate to, they keep you in their loop and give you the answer cutting off any connection to the original sources.\n\nWhile the technology of scraping is the same, the purpose and material effects of those two systems is massively different. Again, Cory misrepresents the critique and tries to make it look unreasonable by making it just a conversation about tech without regarding how that technology affects the world and the people in it.\n\nI appreciate a lot of work Cory Doctorow has done in the last decades. But the arguments he presents here to defend his usage of LLMs for this rather trivial task (which TBH could probably be done reasonably well with traditional means) are part of why the Internet – and therefore the world – looks like it does right now. It’s a set of arguments that wants to delegitimize political and moral actions based on libertarian and utilitarian thinking.\n\nTechnologies are embedded not only in their deployment but also in their creation, conceptualization. They carry the understanding of the world that their makers believe in and reproduce those. A bit like an LLM reproduces the texts it learned from: It might not always be a 100% identical replica but it’s structurally so similar that the differences are surface level.\n\nIn order to build an Internet and a world that is more inclusive, fairer, freer we need to move past the dogma of unchecked innovation and technology. We need to re-politicize our conversations about technology and their effects and goals in order to build the structures (technological, political, social) we want. The structures that lead to a conviviality in harmony with the planet we all live on and will live on till the end of our days.\n\nThat path is paved with discussions about political and moral values. Discussions about how certain technological artifacts do align with those values or not.\n\nI do agree with Cory that demanding perfect purity lead nowhere. We are imperfect people in an imperfect world. I just do not think that this means to go all accellerationalist. Just turning the “open source” dial up to 11 does not stop the apocalypse. It’s a lot harder.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.",

    "description": "In nearly sixty years of nonfiction filmmaking, Wiseman passionately probed the nodal points of political and social power and connected them in a cinematic universe of his own.",
    "fullText": "In 1963, Wiseman, a law professor at Boston University with an interest in movies, produced “The Cool World,” an independent feature directed by Shirley Clarke. He was so dissatisfied with the process that he realized that he, too, could—and, indeed, should—direct. (One of the marks of greatness is to take only what one needs; Clarke’s film is actually original and engrossing, but Wiseman needed to push it aside in order to clear his own path.) He wanted his law students to learn experientially, to visit places and witness activities related to the legal process. So that his students could observe the consequences of law enforcement and the ways that it might affect their future clients, he brought them to the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane; then he filmed a documentary there. That film, “Titicut Follies,” completed in 1967, reveals the harsh conditions that patients endured, and holds up the state’s medical and legal complex to scrutiny. It was banned by a Massachusetts judge on grounds that Wiseman considered a pretext for censorship.\n\nWiseman’s response was to dig ever deeper into coercive social forces. He planned a series of films on institutions and their official exertion of power—whether by law or knowledge, by physical discipline or administrative abstractions. The distinctive scope and focus of his rapidly growing œuvre can be seen in these films’ titles, which, by 1971, included “High School,” “Hospital,” “Law and Order,” and “Basic Training.”\n\nThe story of Wiseman’s filmmaking career is itself a Wiseman-like subject, a story of a sort that he could have told on film (and which he freely discussed in interviews, including with me). Quantity, of course, matters less than quality; Wiseman’s universe is one of the most distinctively personal ones that the American cinema has to offer, and it’s unified by a tightly bound set of ideas, styles, and methods. That fact is all the more extraordinary because all but three of his films are—may he forgive me, I was about to use the word “documentaries,” which he disliked—works of nonfiction, which he managed to turn into a form of quasi-literary exploration. Quantity and quality are connected nonetheless: the very extensiveness of Wiseman’s cinematic world (along with its intensiveness) is one of the most personal aspects of his work. Wiseman came to view the concept of an institution broadly—not only the closed spaces, early in his career, of a research facility (“Primate”), a military facility (“Missile”), and a city office (“Welfare”) but also a series of interlocking institutions unified by a theme (“Domestic Violence”), a neighborhood (“In Jackson Heights”), a town (“Monrovia, Indiana”).",

    "description": "Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, has responded to Trump's calls for the company to fire Susan Rice from its board as it bids for Warner Bros.",
    "fullText": "The head of Netflix has responded publicly for the first time to President Donald Trump's calls for it to remove Susan Rice from its board.\n\n\"This is a business deal. It's not a political deal,\" Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, told the BBC's Today program on Monday, referring to the company's bid to buy Warner Bros. \"This deal is run by the Department of Justice in the US, and regulators throughout Europe and around the world.\"\n\nIn a Saturday Truth Social post, Trump called on Netflix to fire Rice, a former US ambassador and national security advisor in the Obama and Biden administrations, from its board of directors.\n\nTrump was responding to comments Rice made in a podcast about corporations that \"take a knee to Trump,\" warning that they could face retribution from a future Democratic administration.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC how big a deal it was for the president to weigh in on Rice, Sarandos said: \"He likes to do a lot of things on social media.\"\n\nIt comes at a delicate time for Netflix, which is battling Paramount to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. A deal would require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump had said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal. But that changed over the weekend, with the president writing that Netflix should remove Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka called Trump's demands an \"extraordinary use of power\" and said it's a reminder that the White House would be involved in the future of Warner Bros., regardless of what Trump is saying at any given moment.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Sarandos said his pitch to Trump for Netflix's Warner Bros. bid is \"growth in the economy.\"\n\nHe said that Netflix's deal is a \"vertical merger\" in which the company is buying assets it doesn't already have, and so it will be \"adding to the market.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is seeking to buy Warner Bros. streaming and studio assets, Paramount is looking to buy all of the company.\n\nThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery earlier gave Paramount a seven-day window to submit a new offer, which expires at the end of Monday.\n\nOn February 17, WBD told shareholders that \"a senior representative\" from Paramount said the company would pay at least $31 per share for WBD, and that the bid wasn't the company's \"best and final\" proposal. The company's previous bid in December was for $30 per share.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "Wayne Gretzky is on hand for the men's gold medal game between the United States and Canada on Sunday.\n\nYou would think that it would be obvious that Gretzky, the Chosen One, would be rooting for Canada. Gretzky was born and raised in Canada. He's widely considered the greatest hockey player of all-time. But in recent years, Gretzky has been friendly with President Trump, who has threatened Canada and suggested that it could become America's 51st state.\n\nGretzky was asked who he'll be rooting for on Sunday. He's making it clear he's rooting for Canada.\n\n“I’m a hockey player. I’m a Canadian, a true Canadian. I want Canada 🇨🇦 to win a gold medal. I’ve never wavered from that. I’ve been friends with prime minsters and presidents. Somehow there’s been a little bit more tension than normal. At the end of the day, Canada and the US are like brothers and sisters, they’re gonna fight and argue but eventually they’ll come together. That’s the way I see it,\" he said.\n\nGretzky has faced criticism for his friendship and relationship with President Trump, amid the ongoing U.S.-Canada tensions.\n\nBut while Gretzky has faced criticism, he hasn't backed down.\n\n“People are going to say and believe what they want,” Gretzky said on an episode of the “100% Hockey” podcast co-hosted by Darren Millard and John Shannon. “The bottom line is, I know in my heart I’m Canadian, I’ve stayed Canadian and I’m a Canadian for life.”\n\nGretzky has been booed by some Canadians, which he's glad his late father hasn't been around to see.\n\n“You’ve got to take the good with the bad,” Gretzky said. “I’m glad he didn’t have to see it.”\n\nWhile Gretzky has been friendly with President Trump, he claims he's not really into politics.\n\n“I’m Canadian,” Gretzky said. “I can’t vote in the U.S. because I live in the U.S. and I’m Canadian. I can’t vote in Canada because I don’t live in Canada.\n\n“I’m not into politics. And so I can’t stop the prime minister from saying something. I can’t stop the president from saying something.

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — The first female president in the International Olympic Committee’s 132 years got a proper stress test in the first games of her history-making leadership.\n\nKirsty Coventry was widely seen as having good overall success at the Milan Cortina Winter Games that also gave a taste of challenges set to be tougher running into the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\n“An incredible games, and an incredible experience for me as my first in this role,” she told IOC colleagues Sunday.\n\nCoventry insisted in Milan pre-games that “our game is sport,” yet playing politics was inevitable.\n\nShe started the Winter Games building “very good chemistry” with U.S. Vice President JD Vance — who was booed at the opening ceremony — and had seemed likely to close it with U.S. President Donald Trump, who she has not yet met. He did not travel as many expected for Sunday's men’s ice hockey final that the U.S. won.\n\nIn between, political pressure on Coventry was intense during the days-long drama of the Ukraine skeleton racer’s helmet memorializing athletes and coaches killed in the Russian military invasion.\n\nCoventry’s face-to-face, trackside meeting with Vladyslav Heraskevych early Feb. 12 that failed to avert his disqualification has helped define her leadership style.\n\nHer tears in a subsequent meeting with international media is a powerful image of her presidency — though Heraskevych himself wasn't impressed.\n\nThe next day, at a news conference in Milan, a list was detailed to Coventry of IOC issues with its own finances, plus future Olympic hosts, their officials and governments.\n\n“It’s a job only a woman could do,” she said with relish, “and I’m looking forward to continuing to do it.”\n\nThe Ukrainian political strategy had been “a baptism of fire” for the new president, the former IOC marketing director Michael Payne told The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nCoventry going directly to engage Heraskevych in sports diplomacy was a shift from her predecessors Thomas Bach and Jacques Rogge, who also were Olympic athletes.\n\nAt age 42, having swum for Zimbabwe as recently as the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Coventry is just 13 months older than a huge star at these games, Lindsey Vonn.\n\n“We saw at these games her values and her humanity,” IOC member Tricia Smith, a silver medalist in rowing for Canada at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, told The Associated Press. “And I think that’s exceptionally positive for the Olympic Movement as we move forward.”\n\nThe 72-year-old Bach sat next to Coventry again Sunday at the IOC’s meeting: He in suit and tie, she in smart casual knitwear that is becoming her signature look.\n\nThe generational change is clear for the Olympics, which wants and needs to stay relevant with athletes who are increasingly their own tech-savvy brands.\n\nAfter seven years as sports minister in the government of Zimbabwe, Coventry was no management rookie.\n\nOne of her four IOC vice presidents, Pierre-Olivier Beckers, said in Milan that people who had thought she was too young to lead were wrong.\n\n“I think she’s maturing at an incredible pace,” Beckers told reporters, adding she was “a joy for people like me to work with. Her ability to surround herself, to listen to people, all advisors, to make up her mind quickly, is just astonishing.”\n\nOne aspect of Coventry's management style that drew negative reactions, online and in Milan, was criticizing staff in her last set-piece media event Friday.\n\nCoventry is one of the more transparent leaders among the Olympic sports bodies mostly based in Switzerland. She had four scheduled news conferences in Milan within 20 days, plus an impromptu media session after meeting Heraskevych.\n\nOn Friday, she publicly lost patience when asked about news developments that she said she was unaware of — on the topics of Russian doping, an Olympic bid from Germany, and FIFA president Gianni Infantino attending Trump's Board of Peace launch Thursday.\n\nClearly frustrated, Coventry eventually said “maybe someone needs to be dismissed because I’m not aware of that either” and asked of her media team: \"What happened guys? Where are we?”\n\nCoventry has a big 2026 with signature policy to be decided under the “Fit for the Future” banner. Reviews are ongoing into how the IOC picks games hosts, Olympic sports and sponsor programs, plus protecting female sports.\n\nKey meetings are in the IOC's Swiss home city Lausanne on June 24-25 with more likely late in the year.\n\nThe next Olympics is a constant focus. There is a pressing issue around L.A. Games organizing chief Casey Wasserman, that was persistent in Milan over news of his historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend, and Coventry will soon need to meet Trump.\n\n“She can leave (Milan) with a massive sigh of relief. The brand is in robust health,” Payne said Sunday.\n\nHe warned of more politicization of Olympic sports worldwide before the next Olympics in the United States. The IOC winning the appeal brought by Heraskevych will help set limits on how athletes express views.\n\n“L.A. will be a completely different dimension,” Payne said. “It’s going to be complicated, to put it mildly.”\n\nAP Winter Olympics coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "While some billionaires threaten to relocate over the threat of higher taxes, the Oracle of Omaha is proudly writing checks to the IRS — big ones.\n\nWarren Buffett has never been one to hide behind tax shelters or complain about what he owes Uncle Sam. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in 2024, the then-CEO — and who remains chairman — made a striking statement about corporate taxation. It wasn’t a political speech or a carefully rehearsed soundbite. It was vintage Buffett: straightforward, grounded, and backed by numbers that are hard to argue with.\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nPut professional stock research to work in a single ETF — explore Motley Fool Asset Management's factor-based funds.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, he told the assembled shareholders, sent a check for over $5 billion to the U.S. federal government the previous year. And if just 800 other companies had done the same? “No other person in the United States would have had to pay a dime of federal taxes,” he said. “Whether income taxes, no Social Security taxes, no estate taxes — up and down the line.”\n\nIt was the kind of line that makes an arena full of shareholders applaud — not because it was rehearsed, but because it was true.\n\nBuffett has long been transparent about how he views the relationship between profitable companies and the government. At the meeting, he framed it in characteristically simple terms. “The federal government owns a part of the earnings of the business we make,\" he said. \"They don’t own the assets, but they own a percentage of the earnings. And they can change that percentage any year.”\n\nTrending: This ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction\n\nThe current corporate tax rate sits at 21%, established under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But Buffett made clear he doesn’t expect that number to stay put. With the national deficit ballooning and political appetite for spending cuts remaining limited, he suggested that higher rates are “quite likely.” The government, he said, “may decide that someday they don’t want the fiscal deficit to be this large” and “may decide they’ll take a larger percentage of what we earn.”\n\nHis response to that possibility was remarkably unbothered: “We’ll pay it.”\n\nThere was no talk of restructuring, relocating, or lobbying for loopholes. Just a plainspoken acceptance that taxation is part of the deal — and one he considers fair.",

    "fullText": "Milan-Cortina 2026 has been one of the most eventful Winter Olympics in history – in sporting and political terms - so it is appropriate that the final medal event could be the most enticing of all.\n\nCanada and United States have been the two best teams in the men's ice hockey competition, and they will duke it out at Milano Santagiulia Arena on Sunday at 13.10 GMT.\n\nFor two of the most storied nations in the sport, however, they have very different Olympic histories.\n\nCanada are aiming to be the first nation to earn 10 men's ice hockey gold medals, most recently winning the title in 2014.\n\nUSA meanwhile have not claimed the men's title since 1980 - the 'Miracle on Ice' triumph over Soviet Union in Lake Placid - and have not beaten Canada in a men's final since 1960.\n\nCanada have beaten the American men in their past two Olympic final meetings - Salt Lake City 2002 and Vancouver 2010. But the USA are looking for a double in Milan after their women's side defeated the Canadians on Thursday.\n\nThe two teams did not have a totally smooth skate to this point. Both needed overtime to win their quarter-finals, while Canada had to come from 2-0 down to beat Finland 3-2 in Friday's semi-final on Friday, scoring the winner with 35 seconds on the clock.\n\nThe Canadians also have fitness issues. They could be without captain Sidney Crosby, who was forced off in their last eight win over Czech Republic with a knee injury and missed the Finland semi. Canada are hopeful to have him for Sunday, but he certainly will not be 100% fit.\n\nThe squad has also been afflicted by a sickness bug, which dramatically revealed itself in the quarter-final when Nathan MacKinnon threw up while sat on the bench.\n\nBut even when impacted by injury and illness, Canada still have the strongest team.\n\n\"In Connor McDavid you have the best player on the planet by a million miles,\" ice hockey commentator Seth Bennett told BBC Sport. \"He was averaging three points a game going into semi-finals.\n\n\"McKinnon is another superstar offensive player. Defensively, Cale Makar is the best defenceman in the world and a gamechanger. All will be judged against him.\n\n\"You mix them up and it's like if you have a computer game and you put all the best players on one team.\"\n\nThey also have some of the best up-and-coming talents in the game, such as 19-year-old Macklin Celebrini who has already scored the most points by a teenager in an Olympic competition.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nUSA meanwhile have stars of their own, but don't have the attacking gifts of the Canadians.\n\n\"The Tkachuk brothers [Brady and Matthew], and Jack Eichel, that attacking line has worked well together,\" Bennett said.\n\n\"What they have not had is much scoring from captain Auston Matthews, he has not yet taken any of the games by the horns. They are OK, but not more than that.\"\n\nHowever, the Americans have the best defenceman at the Games in Quinn Hughes, who scored the crucial winner against Sweden.\n\n\"He might be the best three-on-three player in the world,\" said Bennett. \"He loves to keep possession, and is always looking to make an exciting play.\"\n\nIt sets up a mouth-watering finale of an Olympic ice hockey competition which has benefitted hugely from the return of National Hockey League (NHL) players for the first time since 2014.\n\nThe attendance of players from the top North American league was in doubt for a time over concerns about the ice quality at the unfinished Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, but they have been a major boon for the Games.\n\n\"This is the highest level of hockey we have ever seen at an Olympics,\" said Bennett. \"The NHL players have made it a different world.\n\n\"At the last two Olympics, games have been good but have missed the quality in the final third, the big moments. Players didn't have the skillset to break a game, so saw a lot of tight, dull games\n\n\"Some of what the players have been doing here has been mind-blowing. One of the goals scored for Canada, McDavid saucered this pass from the back door [behind the goal], it lands as McKinnon is shooting, on the half-volley. That's when you recognise it.\n\n\"I have been getting phone calls from people in the hockey world, all they have been saying is, this is so good. There have been periods where Kent [Simpson, BBC co-commentator] and I have just been sat watching, smiling, laughing.\"\n\nCanada have won gold in three of the five Olympics when NHL players have featured and will fancy their chances in a game on Sunday which could be as fascinating in the stands as it is on the ice.\n\nIt is highly likely that Canadian prime minister Mark Carney will be in Milan for the game.\n\nNot only is Canada as a country hockey-mad, but so is Carney - when working as governor of the Bank of England, he would play for a recreational team in Haringey, north London.\n\nThe big question is whether his American counterpart will also be in Italy.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe BBC understands that, as of Friday afternoon, Donald Trump is scheduled to remain in Washington DC - but that could now change.\n\nIt would be a logistical and security nightmare for the International Olympic Committee should he attend, and it would add a major frisson to an already charged game.\n\nTrump's vice president JD Vance attended a USA group stage game, and the Olympic opening ceremony at San Siro where he was loudly booed when he appeared on the stadium's big screen.\n\nAnd the presence of Trump - who previously said he will impose tariffs on imported goods from Canada, while also floating the idea of their northern neighbours becoming the US's 51st state - would turn the Santagiulia Arena into a political cauldron.\n\nHis impact was seen in February 2025, when the Four Nations match between the United States and Canada descended into chaos with three fights breaking out between players in the first nine seconds.\n\nThe crowd at Montreal's Bell Centre for that game loudly booed the US national anthem pre-game - an issue which will be avoided in Milan. What happens after the game depends on the victor.\n\nAnd Bennett thinks the heightened stakes and occasion will mean a less pugilistic occasion.\n\n\"There won't be a repeat of the fights with a gold medal on the line,\" he said. \"They will be at each other though; in every break in play, there will be a cross-check, a word, a push, a scrum.\n\n\"Then when they fly back, they will fly on the same private jets because the NHL will put on transport.\n\n\"For example, you have Matthew Tkachuk for USA and Brad Marchand for Canada, who are both rink rats, they will go head-to-head 100%. Then they will be on the same flight, they are Florida Panthers teammates and will try to win the Stanley Cup together.\"\n\nThe crowd may also be less tense due to the likelihood of more neutrals buying tickets for an Olympic spectacle, rather than a potential grudge match.\n\nSo, if you are a neutral going to the game, who does Seth think you should support?\n\n\"Canada going for their 10th gold, so usually the neutral will go with the underdog,\" he says. \"But that is USA.\n\n\"Canada are a bit arrogant too, but they have all the favourite players. How do you not love a team with all those players?\n\n\"But how do you not love a USA team who are having this much fun?\"",

CEO overconfidence is often associated with bold moves and strong performance, but it can also lead to misjudgments and make it harder to change course, as leaders remain committed to familiar trajectories even as the context changes. If you’re looking to convince a reluctant CEO or other senior leader of the merits of adopting a strategic approach, you need to position it as an advantage, not a distraction.",

    "description": "Hess found himself in the middle of a firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics after comments he made regarding representing the U.S. in the current political climate.",
    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy — Hunter Hess, the American freestyle skier who unexpectedly found himself in the middle of a social media and political firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics, said he has emerged from “probably the two hardest weeks of my life” after being called a “loser” by President Donald Trump.\n\nHess, who essentially went underground after the controversy exploded, spoke after halfpipe qualifying on Friday. He qualified in fifth place and will be one of four Americans in the 12-person final.\n\n“I worked so hard to be here. I sacrificed my entire life to make this moment happen,” Hess said. “I’m not going to let a controversy like that get in my way. I love the United States of America. I cannot say that enough. In my original statement, I felt like I said that, but apparently people didn’t take it that way. I’m so happy to be here, so happy to represent Team USA and ride as much as I can.”\n\nHess was one of several American athletes who were asked prior to the Opening Ceremony how they felt representing the U.S. given current domestic political climate and the ICE raids in Minneapolis and violent clashes with protestors dominating news coverage at that time.\n\nHess acknowledged “mixed emotions,” saying there was “obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of” and talked about representing his values and the things he believes in when he wears the Team USA uniform.\n\n“Just because I wear the flag, it doesn’t mean I represent everything that is going on in the U.S,” he said.\n\nThough Hess wasn’t the only American athlete to make comments in that vein, his framing inflamed certain sectors of social media and cable news commentators. Hess acknowledged the backlash in an Instagram post but had not spoken to reporters until Friday about what it’s like to have the president come after you as you prepare to compete in the Olympics.\n\nAfter becoming far more famous than he expected, Hess and some members of the halfpipe team left to train in Switzerland.\n\n“It was pretty distracting,” he said. “I had a week that was pretty challenging. Luckily my family was there to support me and help me get through it. There was a lot of noise and I've never been subject to that type of criticism. But with my family's help, I was able to get through it. And skiing has saved my life, time and time again, and it seems to have done so again.”\n\nAsked if he would have made the same comments with the benefit of hindsight, Hess said: “I stand with what I said. I love the United States of America. I cannot reiterate that enough.”",

    "description": "Piers Morgan is certain that UK Prime Minister Starmer is a \"political dead man walking\" thanks to Epstein revelations.",
    "fullText": "Following former Prince Andrew’s arrest in connection to the Epstein files on Thursday, and the resignation of several political players for the same reason, Piers Morgan says U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is “a political dead man walking.”\n\nAppearing on Fox News on Thursday morning, Morgan called the arrest of the former royal “an absolute bombshell,” but one that was “not completely surprising” given the tone of the statement by King Charles III last week in which he said police would have the crown’s full cooperation. Morgan then speculated that the arrest could be “an existential threat to the monarchy itself.”\n\nSo, the “Fox & Friends” hosts wondered what it means for the rest of the government, considering people like Ambassador Peter Mandelson and the Chief of Staff who recommended him are now out of their jobs over Epstein ties. Specifically, they wondered if Prime Minister Starmer will stay in office, or if he’s run out of good will.\n\nWatch the Fox News segment below:\n\n“Yeah, I think he’s a political dead man walking,” Morgan said. “And it’s all centered around what happened with Lord Mandelson.”\n\nMorgan explained the timeline of when Starmer appointed Mandelson, noting that Starmer admitted he knew about Mandelson’s ties to Epstein when he appointed the man, despite Mandelson saying he cut off Epstein after he was convicted of sex crimes.\n\n“So, I think Starmer is in serious trouble,” Morgan said. “I would be astonished if he is still Prime Minister in two to three months. We have the local elections in May. It’s very likely that Labor will get an absolute shellacking then. And I think that will be the tipping point for Starmer.”\n\nYou can watch Piers Morgan’s full appearance on “Fox & Friends” in the video above.\n\nThe post Piers Morgan Says UK Prime Minister Is ‘Dead Man Walking’ After Former Prince Andrew Arrest Over Epstein | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Even if a company doesn't cite a reason for relocating, experts say the change can signal financial, political, or other motives.",
    "fullText": "When a company moves its headquarters, it's making a statement — whether leadership spells it out or not.\n\nThat's the case with Palantir's surprise announcement Tuesday that it has relocated its home base to Florida from Colorado.\n\nThe defense-tech contractor disclosed the change in a one-sentence press release citing a new address just outside Miami. Palantir, led by cofounder and CEO Alex Karp, didn't provide a reason or say what it means for employees.\n\nThe lack of details has left many observers speculating on the motive.\n\n\"This seems like a pretty obvious attempt to put both Karp and Palantir in friendlier territory,\" said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\nThough Karp backed Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign, he has more recently praised the Trump administration's immigration and national security policies.\n\nOn a November earnings call, Karp called for tougher border policies and highlighted Palantir's work with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Israel. Palantir, which relies heavily on government contracts, has also faced protests in Colorado in recent years. Colorado is a blue state, Florida is red.\n\n\"Not only will the company receive a more welcoming reception and more eager labor pool in Florida, but Karp and his top deputies will probably be more comfortable spending time there than they do in Colorado,\" said Pozner.\n\nPalantir didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the reason for the headquarters shake-up or the move's impact on employees.\n\nPalantir was founded in California's Silicon Valley region in 2003 and moved to Colorado in 2020. At the time, Karp cited an \"increasing intolerance and monoculture\" in Silicon Valley. Karp owns property in Colorado.\n\nSome leadership experts point to Florida's more tax-friendly policies as a reason why Palantir has a new ZIP code.\n\n\"To me, this is dollars and cents,\" said Zack Kass, a former OpenAI executive who now advises companies and governments on leading in today's AI-centric business world. \"If building a better company meant Karp moving the business to Alaska, he'd probably do it.\"\n\nA number of finance and tech heavyweights have planted flags in Florida in recent years, including Citadel, Thiel Capital, and Thoma Bravo. In January, venture capitalist David Sacks proclaimed that Miami will soon replace New York City as America's financial capital.\n\n\"I'm grateful for the leadership of the state of Florida,\" said Citadel's Ken Griffin at the America Business Forum in Miami in November. \"This is a great place to call home.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees, though, as others have noted that Miami's social scene hollows out in the summer and the city lacks a major university to pipe in tech talent.\n\nWhatever the incentives are behind Palantir's change of address, headquarters moves in general are rarely about real estate, said Jeff LeBlanc, a management professor at Bentley University. Instead, they often speak to the kind of identity leaders want for their companies.\n\n\"In a world where so much work is hybrid or distributed, the HQ is often more symbolic than operational,\" he said. \"Geography communicates. It says something about who you want to attract, who you align with, and what kind of company you believe you are.\"\n\nLeBlanc pointed Elon Musk's decision to move some of his companies' headquarters from California to Texas for political reasons as an example. In 2024, the billionaire lashed out at California for being the first state to outlaw schools from having to notify parents if a child changes their name, pronouns, or gender identity at school, calling the move the \"final straw.\"\n\n\"Particularly in founder-led companies, those moves often reflect worldview as much as strategy,\" LeBlanc said. \"Geography has become part of executive messaging.\"",

    "title": "Rick Perry says his political group will spend “whatever we need” to support John Cornyn in Senate primary",
    "description": "The former Texas governor chairs the Lone Star Freedom Project, a group that has already spent almost $18 million boosting Cornyn against Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt.",
    "fullText": "Stumping with Sen. John Cornyn in Austin on Tuesday, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said the political group he chairs, called the Lone Star Freedom Project, would spend “whatever we need” to see Cornyn through his bruising Republican primary, on top of the almost $18 million it has spent on his behalf.\n\nCornyn, who is serving his fourth term in the U.S. Senate, is battling to keep his seat against challenges from Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt of Houston, in a contest that looks destined to go to a May runoff.\n\nOutside groups, Senate Republican leadership and Cornyn’s own fundraising committees have spent tens of millions of dollars to support the incumbent senator and attack his GOP rivals. The Senate race in Texas became the second-most expensive in the country Tuesday, according to AdImpact, with $98.2 million in total ad spending. Some three-quarters of the cash on the GOP side has come from pro-Cornyn sources — and yet, recent public polling has shown Paxton leading the contest.\n\nPerry’s group has spent more than all but one other group among Cornyn’s several outside backers, who along with the senator’s campaign have dropped nearly $60 million on the race, per AdImpact. The former governor made clear that would continue into the runoff if Cornyn makes it past the March 3 election.\n\n“We are committed to John, and we will spend whatever we need to spend for him to be successful,” Perry said when asked if he thought that level of fundraising and spending would continue.\n\nCornyn, kicking off a 10-stop statewide tour on the first day of early voting, warned that Republicans would see an “Election Day massacre” in November if he loses out on the Senate GOP nomination to Paxton.\n\n“Republicans up and down the ticket will pay the price of having an albatross like the corrupt attorney general hung around their neck,” Cornyn said at a Tex-Mex restaurant alongside Perry and other supporters, where he further argued that Paxton’s nomination could threaten the new red congressional seats Texas Republicans drew last summer to pad their slim House majority. “We haven’t lost a statewide election in Texas since 1994, but we could this year if the wrong person is at the top of the ticket.”\n\nThe senior senator has argued throughout the campaign that he would keep moderate and swing voters in the GOP tent who would otherwise be turned off by Paxton’s ethical baggage — a history that includes indictment, impeachment and federal investigations that the attorney general has all largely withstood.\n\nPaxton, meanwhile, is arguing in his campaign that Cornyn is a relic of the establishment GOP and ideologically out of step with President Donald Trump and his MAGA movement. The third-term attorney general has long been trailed by a list of legal and ethical woes — including securities fraud charges and impeachment by the GOP-controlled Texas House on bribery and abuse of office allegations — from which he has emerged largely unscathed. More recently, Paxton’s wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, filed for divorce on “biblical grounds” after she accused him of cheating on her.\n\nIn a statement, Paxton adviser Nick Maddux said, “Character matters in this race, and that’s why the people of Texas overwhelmingly support Ken Paxton. They know that he is a conservative warrior who will always fight for us and our freedoms, even in the face of the Left trying to tear him down.”\n\nMaddux added that Cornyn “is just like every other career politician who talks tough during election season, but then does the exact opposite in D.C. and betrays Texas by repeatedly pushing gun control and amnesty.”\n\nTrump on Monday declined to make an endorsement in the primary, telling reporters, “They’ve all supported me, they’re all good and you’re supposed to pick one. So we’ll see what happens, but I support all three.”\n\nIn response, Cornyn said Tuesday that he would be “proud” to have Trump’s endorsement.\n\n“I appreciate his kind words, referring to me as a friend and calling me a good man,” Cornyn said. “The president knows he can trust me to be there to support him and his agenda, and I appreciate that. But it’s going to be up to him to make that call. I think he kind of likes a good fight, and he’s going to see one right here in Texas.”\n\nIn his remarks, Perry praised Cornyn’s work on border security and other conservative causes over his four decades in public office. The two were flanked by representatives from the National Border Patrol Council, which has endorsed Cornyn for reelection.\n\n“The people of the state of Texas know John Cornyn,” Perry said. “They know that character counts. They know that this man is going to go back to Washington, D.C., and day in and day out, deliver for them. What you have is a vanity campaign on the other side and a corrupt campaign on the other side.”\n\nIn a statement, Hunt spokesperson James Kyrkanides accused Perry of parroting talking points from Cornyn’s supporters in Senate GOP leadership and noted how much Cornyn-aligned groups have spent against Hunt.\n\n“If Hunt’s candidacy wasn’t a threat, why would [Perry] spend his own money attacking Wesley?” Kyrkanides said. “On March 3, Texans are going to prove that they’re tired of gutter politics and establishment games. They’re ready for a new generation of leadership.”\n\nAsked if he believed “character” still mattered in a Republican primary contest, Perry said, “We’re fixing to find out. If winning with a corrupt candidate is okay, then it ain’t the Republican Party that I joined in 1989.”\n\nThe Senate primary is Perry’s latest foray into a smashmouth GOP contest in his home state, after he campaigned for then-Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan in 2024 and helped the Beaumont Republican narrowly overcome a hardline challenger backed by Paxton. Perry also published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal ahead of Paxton’s impeachment trial in which he implied that state senators should reject Paxton’s efforts to dismiss the case.\n\nPaxton is also embarking on a get-out-the-vote tour during early voting, planning up to nine rallies across the state to “engage conservative voters, drive early voter turnout and build momentum statewide,” according to Lone Star Liberty PAC, a group backing Paxton and sponsoring the tour.\n\nTexas Rep. James Talarico, who is seeking the Democratic Senate nomination, also launched a “Take Back Texas” tour across the state Tuesday, featuring 12 rallies, in addition to stops at local restaurants and cultural landmarks, ahead of March 3.",

    "description": "Prime minister says outcomes of consultation on social media ban should be implemented quickly as technology minister says Australia-style ban is not inevitable\nIn his Q&A with journalists, Keir Starmer was also asked to respond to a report by the BBC’s James Landale saying he is looking at plans to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP by the end of this parliament. In the past Starmer has just said that he would like to do this at some point in the next parliament.\nIn his reply, Starmer said that at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend he was arguing that the UK, and Europe as a whole, needs to “step up”.\nWe want a just and lasting peace, but that will not extinguish the Russian threat, and we need to be alert to that, because that’s going to affect every single person in this room, every single person in this country, so we need to step up.\nThat means, on defence spending, we need to go faster.",

But he said he was “open-minded” about whether this would include a full, Austalian-style ban.\n\nStarmer suggested that one option will be to limit the technology that allows “doomscrolling”. He said:\n\nWe’ve taken the powers to make sure we can act within months, not years.\n\nWe also need to act very quickly, not just of the age concern, but on the devices and applications that make the sort of auto-scrolling, the constant glueing to the machine that you can never stop scrolling.\n\nIn a post on his Substack account, Starmer said out in more details the options that could be implemented as a result of the consultation being carried out. He said:\n\nWe will be going to parliament for new government powers, enabling us to act on the findings of the social media consultation where the evidence suggests we need to. This could include:\n\n-Setting a minimum age limit for social media: unlike the Tories, who took years to pass the Online Safety Act, we will take powers that would allow us to implement a minimum age for social media in a matter of months to prevent kids from accessing harmful social media.\n\n-Restricting specific functionalities: that are detrimental to kids’ wellbeing and keep them hooked to their screens like endless scroll or autoplay\n\n-Limiting VPN access for kids: to make it harder for kids to get around age limits of services or certain functionalities.\n\nThis is all designed to put the wellbeing of children first.",

    "description": "After weeks of debate about whether Pakistan's fixture against India would go ahead at the T20 World Cup, the action failed to deliver and it left the rivalry feeling more political than sporting.",
    "fullText": "Colombo awoke to its greyest sky of the week come Sunday morning. A portent, perhaps, of the weather forecast which briefly caused a scare prior to India's dominant win over Pakistan later that evening.\n\nIt certainly mirrored the cloud lurking over the build-up to cricket's most-charged derby. Pakistan relented on their original decision to boycott the fixture in solidarity with Bangladesh, who had to forfeit their place in this T20 World Cup when refused dispensation to play their games outside of India.\n\nArguably more interest stemmed from the pageantry of Sunday's game than from the actual cricket. Plenty were on handshake-watch given recent history between these two. Polite formalities did not return at the toss, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nTo be ready for the myriad cameras capturing the flip of the coin, both captains have to be in place a good two minutes before getting on with the ceremony. When mired in such awkwardness, it seems an eternity.\n\nEnough time for a detail-oriented TV producer to spot that Salman, Pakistan's skipper, sported a kink in his collar. The scruffy schoolboy-look was rectified by an anonymous figure inadvertently stealing the situation's authority. It certainly detracted from the attempted strong-man image projected by stubborn leaders.\n\nAs did the behaviour of the ex-pros off the pitch. On the ICC broadcast, Rohit Sharma and Wasim Akram warmly greeted before walking the tournament trophy onto the field. Away from the cameras, Harbhajan Singh, Misbah Ul-Haq and Ramiz Raja were spotted in cordial conversation in the media area.\n\nThe stadium certainly felt different to earlier World Cup matches at this venue. A perimeter was set multiple blocks from the ground. Bags were inspected long before the entrance. And again upon arrival. The Sri Lankan special task force, previously unseen at this tournament, was out in force, automatic weapons on full display.\n\nEven the price of a fake jersey among street vendors shot up amid India-Pakistan inflation. Local entrepreneurs were delighted the fixture went ahead. As were the swarming hotels. Such was the influx in India's accommodation that Mohammed Siraj could not squeeze into the lift on his morning commute.\n\nThe backdrop reflected the magnitude of the occasion, but not necessarily any tension. That didn't come until the toss. Albeit there were some murmurs of discontent at the choice of pre-match music. Indian rapper Hanumankind performed with his dance troupe and pyrotechnics aplenty.\n\nHe appeared on the soundtrack to Dhurandhar, a movie released last year, the political undertones of which were not well received in Pakistan where the film is banned. Shortly after Sunday's performance concluded, the call to prayer could be heard from a local mosque. The cricketing gods have a sense of humour.\n\nBoth camps were reluctant to really delve into the off-field narratives. \"In these games the emotions are always going to be high but we need to deal with that,\" said Salman.\n\n\"We have played enough cricket and games like this. You have to see the bigger picture and win our next game to qualify for the Super 8s.\"\n\nKishan goes crazy as India hammer Pakistan\n\nOnce the cricket finally started, Ishan Kishan's belligerent hitting delighted the Indian-heavy crowd - which, it should be said, was not at capacity. Usman Tariq's curious action, his pause akin to Jorginho's jump when taking a penalty, dominated pre-match chat. He failed to remain the protagonist of the contest itself, albeit he did cheekily bow towards Suryakumar upon dismissing the man who was filmed mimicking his ways during Indian net sessions.\n\nAt the mid-innings break, some dared to think we could have a chase on our hands with Pakistan needing 176. India's dominant powerplay, taking four wickets and conceding just 39 runs, put a swift end to such notions.\n\nThe scoreline in this match-up at T20 World Cups now reads 8-1 in favour of India. This rivalry has become political, rather than a sporting one. As tedious as the interference is, it offers more to discuss than one side consistently outclassing the other.\n\nAs if aware of this, in a lull during Pakistan's inevitable defeat, the ICC replayed the cordial exchange between Wasim and Rohit prior to the match. Aren't we all getting along just fine? Just not to the extent that players shook hands once India wrapped up their shellacking. That sign of respect continues to feel some way off.\n\n\"We see them as a team - we are not thinking about this as a rivalry or whatever,\" said India's Axar Patel.\n\n\"We are playing against one team and we are focusing on cricket. Whenever I'm playing, I'm not thinking about whatever, I treat it as one match and opponent.\"\n\nAfter the final wicket, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube did not feel they had hit their desired workloads. The former bowled three overs in the match, the latter was not required. Out came bowling coach Morne Morkel to catch extra work with his baseball mitt. Opposition resoundingly dealt with yet more reps needed.\n\nAn apt reflection, not that it was required, of this contest's non-existent relationship with the sort of jeopardy required to make us all forget the politics.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?",

    "fullText": "As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going\n\nTech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).\n\nThe phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.\n\nGavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.\n\nRather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.\n\n“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”\n\nUnlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.\n\nRobert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.\n\n“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”\n\nThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.\n\nWhen the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.\n\nSome opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.\n\nThiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.\n\n“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”\n\nTech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.\n\nJust this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.\n\nAdding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”\n\nJoining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.\n\nMcCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.\n\n“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”\n\nMeta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.\n\nThe social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.\n\nThe crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.\n\n“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”\n\nWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.\n\nThe California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.\n\nSingleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.\n\nBut then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.\n\nMahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.\n\nMahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.\n\nGoogle’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nAs political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That’s for sure.”",

    "description": "Snowpack levels across a wide swath of western US states are among the lowest seen in decades, even as regulators struggle to negotiate water rights in the region.",
    "fullText": "western US are facing record low snowpack levels in the middle of the winter season. The snowpack crisis, which could mean a drier, more wildfire-prone summer, is coming as states are racing unsuccessfully against a deadline to agree on terms to share water in the Colorado River Basin, the source of water for 40 million people across seven states in the West.\n\n“Barring a genuinely miraculous turnaround” in the remainder of the winter, says Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, the low snowpack “has the potential to worsen both the ecological and political crisis on the Colorado Basin, and then also produce really adverse wildfire conditions in some parts of the West.”\n\nData provided by the US Department of Agriculture show that as of February 12, snowpack was at less than half its normal level in areas across nine Western states—some of the lowest levels seen in decades. It’s common for a particular basin or small area of the West to have low snowpack at this time of year. What’s worrisome, Swain says, is how widespread the snow drought is, stretching in a swath from the bottom of Washington to much of Arizona and New Mexico, and touching as far east as Colorado.\n\n“The numbers are really, really bad,” Swain says. “If this were November, they might be less meaningful. We're not in November—we're heading toward mid-February. The normal numbers are pretty high. To be at half of them means that, in absolute terms, the deficit is large.”\n\nAs much of the East Coast has frozen in the first weeks of the year, many Western states are experiencing some of their warmest winters on record: Parts of Colorado saw temperatures close to 80 degrees Fahrenheit at the start of this week. While precipitation has remained steady in many states—parts of Washington even saw disastrous flooding in December—it’s simply not cold enough in many areas for snow to fall or stay in snowpack.\n\nA study released last year by researchers at Dartmouth found that climate change has led to a reduction in snowpack levels across the northern hemisphere over the past 40 years. A snowpack deficit has some worrisome implications for the West for the rest of the year. Forests with low snowpack dry out faster, and are less resilient against wildfire when the hot season comes. (Wildfire-ravaged forests may also, in turn, be less prepared to keep snowpack around; some recent research has shown that in areas that have recently been burned, snow melts faster than other places.)\n\nMuch of the water supply for the West, including the crucial Colorado River Basin, is set during the winter. Snowpack that accumulates in the cold months melts in the spring; in years with healthy snowpack levels, that water makes its way into streams and reservoirs. Current conditions pose a threat to this dynamic.\n\n“In some places, we don't have a traditional drought—what we've got is a snow drought, where precipitation has been near or above average, but where record warmth has really been driving just a complete decimation of the existing snowpack,” says Swain. The warmth in other areas, he says, has “caused the precipitation that has fallen—which in some cases has been reasonably abundant—to fall as rain, even at 7,000 and 9,000 feet elevation.”\n\nSwain says it’s still early enough in the season that there could be some significant storms to help replenish snow levels in some areas. “The problem is that we've accumulated such a large deficit right now—even if we have near or somewhat above average snowfall for the next few weeks, that might just sort of keep pace with the usual accumulation for the rest of February, without really erasing the accumulated deficit,” he says.",

    "fullText": "Apple is caught in the Trump administration's crosshairs — this time over its news app.\n\nFederal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson issued a letter to CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday, citing recent reports from right-leaning media watchdog Media Research Center that said Apple News promoted \"left-wing \"publications over conservative outlets.\n\nFerguson questioned whether Apple was acting in line with its terms of service with its curation of featured articles on the Apple News app.\n\n\"As an American citizen, I abhor and condemn any attempt to censor content for ideological reasons,\" Ferguson said in the letter, which he published. \"Such efforts, whether taken to appease overzealous activists, at the behest of foreign governments, or simply to advance the political views of Silicon Valley elites, stifle the free exchange of ideas, manipulate the public discourse, and are inconsistent with American values.\"\n\nToday I sent a letter to Tim Cook expressing my concerns about allegations that Apple News has, unbeknownst to its users, systematically promoted news articles from left-wing news outlets and suppressed content from conservative publications. pic.twitter.com/xXCxNgRbpc\n\nWhile he said the FTC doesn't police speech and can't require the company to promote one ideology over another, the FTC Act is meant to protect consumers from deceptive acts or practices by companies.\n\nFerguson urged Apple to conduct a \"comprehensive review of Apple's terms of service\" to ensure it isn't in violation of the FTC Act.\n\nApple and the FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nFerguson is no stranger to taking on Silicon Valley. Before he was appointed by President Donald Trump as FTC chair in 2025, he vowed to \"end Big Tech's vendetta against competition and free speech.\"\n\nThe FTC warning is the latest snag in Cook's political tightrope walk. The iPhone maker took a hit last year from the Trump administration's tariff policies, though smartphones, computers, and some other electronics were exempt from the most aggressive tariffs.

    "description": "Anthropic and OpenAI now have their own well-funded political groups that will square off in the midterm elections over artificial intelligence safety and regulation.",
    "fullText": "Silicon Valley’s dueling artificial intelligence start-ups now have dueling super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, the safety-focused A.I. company formed by former OpenAI executives, said on Thursday that it was putting $20 million into a new super PAC operation that will be in opposition to super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors.\n\nThe donation effectively kicks off a new conflict between the rivals, with this year’s midterm elections as the battleground. At the heart of the disagreement between the companies is whether to regulate the artificial intelligence industry with more safety guardrails around the powerful technology. Anthropic generally favors politicians who are more pro-regulation than OpenAI does.\n\nThe New York Times reported in November that the group Anthropic donated to, Public First Action, was in talks with the company to fund its effort to help ensure that OpenAI did not amass too much political power. The regulation-skeptical super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors are called Leading the Future.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, Anthropic did not name OpenAI but warned that “vast resources have flowed to political organizations that oppose” A.I. safety efforts.\n\n“The A.I. policy decisions we make in the next few years will touch nearly every part of public life,” the company wrote. “We don’t want to sit on the sidelines while these policies are developed.”\n\nAnthropic’s funding will supercharge an effort to elect federal lawmakers who favor more extensive A.I. regulation, a position at odds with the Trump administration.\n\nPublic First is a dark-money nonprofit, which means it is not required to disclose its donors but can air television ads on behalf of candidates. On Thursday, it said it would begin a television ad campaign “thanking” Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is running for governor in her state, for her work on tech policy.\n\nPublic First also funds two allied super PACs. One, Defending Our Values PAC, said it would begin an ad campaign on behalf of Senator Pete Ricketts, Republican of Nebraska, who faces re-election in 2026 and has also been outspoken on A.I. safety.\n\nThe Public First effort was started as a rejoinder to the Leading the Future super PACs backed by OpenAI leaders and investors, which have publicly reported raising over $50 million so far. About half of that came from the OpenAI investor Andreessen Horowitz and about half from the family of Greg Brockman, president and co-founder of OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI, which was until recently a traditional nonprofit, has not been allowed to make direct political contributions. But the company has mounted an aggressive Washington policy push over the last several years, which now includes an expressly political component through its aligned super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, by contrast, is making a contribution in its own name. The San Francisco-based company had spent at least five months “actively working” on a super PAC strategy, said Jack Clark, a co-founder, in September, as part of a broader effort to find its way in Washington.\n\nAnthropic’s $20 million contribution carries some political risks. While OpenAI has been largely embraced by the Trump administration, Anthropic and its chief executive, Dario Amodei, have been perceived as a thorn in the White House’s side. Administration officials such as David Sacks, the White House’s A.I. chief, have regularly and publicly criticized Anthropic. Mr. Sacks said in October that the company was promoting a “state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the start-up ecosystem.”",

In 2024, he told Business Insider about his love for Zyn.\n\nNow, he's leaving it all behind — or, rather, he's bringing it all to the world of politics.\n\nMoran is launching a bid for Senate in Virginia, running as a Democrat against incumbent Mark Warner. He'll try to build off the online popularity he's generated in recent years as a Wall Street culture personality.\n\nAfter stints at investment banking like Lazard and Centerview Partners, Moran first gained notoriety after being selected as a contestant on HBO's Fboy Island reality dating show in 2021. He then became the first employee of the popular financial meme account Litquidity before launching his own investor relations firm, Equity Animal, in 2022.\n\nDespite being a prominent face for millennials in finance, the 33-year-old said his experience is fueling his move away from the industry and into politics.\n\nHe ended up leaving his first two jobs because of moral issues he had with some of the deals he worked on. Now, Moran, who calls himself a populist, is running on a platform that, in many ways, is a rebellion against his old line of work.\n\n\"I'm like, wait, these people are the quote-unquote titans of the universe?\" he told Business Insider, reflecting on his first impressions of working on Wall Street.\n\nOne of his proposals is to ban corporations from owning single-family homes, similar to an executive order President Donald Trump recently signed to curb home ownership by institutional investors.\n\nAnother proposal is to reform campaign finance laws to keep Wall Street and corporate money out of politics.\n\n\"We have a captured legislative branch,\" he said. \"I'm very much against the control that Wall Street has been able to have over politicians.\"\n\nMoran also wants to take on a Wall Street darling right now: AI data centers, which are fueling the AI buildout that's helped drive the S&P 500 up by 94% since late 2022.\n\nHe's proposing a tax on data centers that would fund community colleges.\n\n\"Someone is gonna come in, pay for the campaign of a Republican who's quote-unquote business-friendly, and they're gonna give designation as critical infrastructure to win our war of AI against China — which I want to happen, but the people are not going to get anything in return,\" Moran said.\n\n\"If we were to put a compute tax on the data centers, over the next 10 years, that could be $100 billion, if not more,\" he continued. \"That would be enough to entirely change the community college system to make it so that we could have universal community college.\"",

Carbon in the atmosphere stores energy, which becomes thermal potential.\n\n2) Definition of facts – the framing of facts into a discrete 'event.'Example: Human industrial activity has released a large amount of previously captured carbon, meaning there's far more atmospheric carbon than would have organically ended up there through natural forces.\n\n3) Interpretation of facts – the declaration of quality on the established events.Example: Human industrial activity is threatening human safety by causing climate change that is detrimental to the long-term survival and sustainability of current lifestyles, which is bad because humans don't like dying.\n\n4) Response – the understanding of how these events pertain to us and our actions.Example: Humans need to make drastic changes to industrial activity to mitigate the climate impacts and attempt to repair existing damage.\n\nA person who doesn't believe anthropogenic carbon release exists (Layer 2) can't debate someone who believes industrial activity needs to be curbed (Layer 4), because the Layer 4 position is predicated on a Layer 2 presumption that isn't shared by both parties. The person making the Layer 4 argument is taking something for granted that the person making the Layer 2 argument doesn't, and so they fundamentally can never agree on a Layer 4 argument predicated on a Layer 2 prerequisite they don't agree with.\n\nTaking a moment to ascertain whether you're both on the same layer can be very helpful to diagnosing these situations where you feel like you're talking past each other.\"\n\nAlso in In the News: Gavin Newsom's New, Brutal Nickname For Trump Is Going Viral, And It May Be His Best One Yet\n\nAlso in In the News: \"The Male Loneliness Epidemic Is Entirely Self-Inflicted\": 24 Brutal, Brutal, Brutal Political Tweets Of The Week\n\nAlso in In the News: Gavin Newsom Came Up With A Nickname For JD Vance, And This One Is Definitely Going To Stick",

    "fullText": "TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japan's volatile financial markets must now contend with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi firmly in the driver's seat after her decisive victory on Sunday, which hands her an electoral mandate to reflate the economy.\n\nThe question for investors is whether ​Takaichi's electoral momentum will prompt her to expand her stimulus ambitions or if it lends her the political leeway to proceed more ‌cautiously.\n\nHow has the Takaichi trade impacted Japanese markets?\n\nWhy are investors concerned about Japan's debt burden?\n\nHow might Takaichi's electoral victory affect policy direction?\n\nWhat are Takaichi's key economic stimulus policies?\n\nSince she began her rise to become the nation's first female premier in October, the \"Takaichi trade\" has pushed domestic shares to record highs while causing a precipitous selloff in Japanese government bonds ‌and the yen.\n\nVoters braved heavy snowfalls in Tokyo and other parts of Japan to deliver what exit polls indicated to be the most decisive win for Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party since 1996.\n\n\"The stock market is a true believer in Takaichi, so the big win is going to be good news for equities when the markets open on Monday,\" said Chris Scicluna, the head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe.\n\nTakaichi, a devotee of the \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies of the late premier Shinzo Abe, has ⁠pledged a proactive fiscal policy funded largely through bond ‌issuance.\n\nShe came to office at a low point in power and popularity for her Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-World War Two period, forcing her to bargain with opposition parties with even more liberal fiscal ‍platforms.\n\n\"The administration's foundation will become much more stable, making it easier for expectations to build around advancing economic policy,\" said Kota Suzuki, a strategist at Nomura Asset Management. \"Because there will no longer be a need to actively seek the opposition's cooperation, there will be less pressure for giveaway-style fiscal expansion.\"\n\nWith polls already indicating a decisive LDP win, Japan's benchmark ​Nikkei 225 Index set an all-time high of 54,782.83 on Tuesday. Big winners of late include sectors like defence, artificial intelligence and chips that ‌have been singled out by Takaichi for targeted investment.\n\nBut prospects for more government outlays have unsettled investors already concerned about Japan's debt burden, the largest in the developed world. Those worries came to a head on January 20, when rates across the JGB yield curve shot to multi-decade or even record highs after Takaichi called for the snap election and embraced suspending the sales tax on food.\n\nThe yen has also been punished, losing about 6% against the dollar since Takaichi's selection as prime minister in October and plumbing record lows against the euro and Swiss franc. Only threats of joint currency market intervention with the United ⁠States have arrested the yen's slide.",

    "description": "Indiana Rep. Sheila Klinker, 87, says this is her last election. She faces Republican Tracy Brown in a race that apparently defies political bitterness.",
    "fullText": "LAFAYETTE, IN — It hasn't been uncommon for longstanding state Rep. Sheila Klinker to face the occasional challenger through her 44 years of elections to represent Lafayette at the Indiana Statehouse. But this year she faces Tracy Brown, a Republican challenger with a long history of election victories.\n\nKlinker, a Democrat who had been a state representative since 1982, says this is her last election. Absolutely her last, the 87-year-old Lafayette representative insisted Friday.\n\n\"I thought maybe I might be able to do one more time without anybody running after me,\" Klinker joked.\n\nBrown is a candidate, but before he faces Klinker, he'll have to win the GOP primary in May, where he faces Oscar Alvarez, who ran against Klinker two years ago. Klinker defeated Alvarez by capturing more than 61% of the vote.\n\nWith eight years as Tippecanoe County sheriff and 12 years as Tippecanoe County commissioner, Brown has worked with lawmakers.\n\n\"What goes on in Indianapolis does impact us here locally,\" Brown said. \"That makes the work done by our local delegation really, really important.\"\n\nPlans to take his experiences of law enforcement and experiences as policy making as a commissioner to Indy.\n\n\"I want to use the perspective I've gained to serve this district,\" Brown said.\n\nKlinker and Brown have been friends for decades and worked together in their roles as public servants.\n\n\"If I had to have an opponent, I would rather it would be Tracy Brown than somebody else,\" Klinker said. \"Tracy and I have been friends for a long time. I feel like we're still friends even though we're opponents.\"\n\n\"This is something that I've pondered and thought about for years,\" Brown said, noting he's discussed it with Klinker.\n\nBrown, 63, declined to comment whether Klinker has the stamina to serve another two years.\n\n\"I've learned things from Sheila over the years. The way she shows up. The way she recognizes people,\" Brown said. \"Those are all things you expect of your elected officials.\"\n\nAsked whether she had the endurance for another two years of public service, Klinker said, \"The folks will tell you that I am at places where the others are not. I go to everything.\"\n\n\"I like what I do, so I work hard at it,\" she said. \"I still really enjoy it.\n\n\"I'll run this time, and then that will be it,\" she said, admitting some have said she said swore off running in 2024. \"I mean it this time.\n\n\"I do have the energy to do it,\" she said. \"I have been blessed with good health.\"\n\nIf Klinker and Brown square off in the fall election, don't expect snarky partisan sniping.\n\n\"I want to show you can do this in the right way,\" Brown said, \"and it doesn't have to be bitter, and it doesn't have to be hateful.\"\n\nThat's the Tippecanoe County way of governance between Democratic and Republican public officials.\n\n\"We get work done on a done on a daily basis together,\" Brown said.\n\n\"It's been an interesting career,\" Klinker said. \"The nice thing about it is it's not like Washington, D.C. We all get along very well.\"\n\nReach Ron Wilkins at rwilkins@jconline.com. Follow on Twitter: @RonWilkins2.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lafayette Journal & Courier: Indiana Rep.

    "description": "No, SendGrid isn't adding a \"Support ICE\" link to your company's emails.",
    "fullText": "I'm just a humble immigrant, but as a mere (legal!) guest in the U.S., I can't help but notice that the country is rather, shall we say, politically divided these days (sorry if pointing that out seems rude). It seems international scammers have also noticed—and are taking advantage in subtle ways.\n\nRecently, investor Fred Benenson blogged about a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting SendGrid users. Phishers sent emails claiming the company was going to add a large \"Support ICE\" button at the bottom of every outgoing email unless users opted out. The emails also featured a large blue button promising to help you disable the message, which, when clicked, naturally led to a fake version of SendGrid that would allow the scammers to steal login information.\n\nAs scams go, it's not a bad play: Phishing emails work best when they induce a sense of panic—that way you're less likely to think critically about them, and just act. It's not hard to imagine this particular email being effective, given the political climate right now. Say you're running a fair trade coffee company—you wouldn't want a giant \"Support ICE\" button below your signature at this moment in history.\n\nBut the trick didn't just target left-wing organizations: Variations on the theme claimed the company was going to add pro-LGBT+ and Black Lives Matter banners as well. The differing political messages aren't really the point of the scam, you see—the point is to get business owners to panic about projecting the \"wrong\" values so that they will click the link and give away their login information. Scammers rely on psychological tricks to rope in their victims, all of them designed to get you to stop thinking rationally. Exploiting America's political divide seems to be an excellent way to do that.\n\nThis is just the latest example of a scam that uses politics as a tool. Back in 2020, a fake Black Lives Matter voting campaign spread malware by pretending to be from a county official looking for feedback on the then-exploding political movement. People on both side of the partisan divide ended up clicking through and getting infected.\n\nAnd then there are the campaigns where people pretend to be politicians and beg for donations: Back in 2024 Lifehacker reported on a rash of political donation scams that popped up during the presidential election cycle. That trend is still growing, according to Stacey Wood, a fraud expert writing for Psychology Today. \"What is especially challenging for consumers and voters is that legitimate campaign operatives use many of the same common persuasion techniques employed by scammers,\" she writes.\n\nAll of which is to say that international scammers have equal access to American media outlets, are aware of our political divides, and are effective at using them to exploit your emotions in order to steal your money.\n\nWhat can you do to protect yourself? First, be aware of the tricks that scammers use, and always approach your email inbox with skepticism. Before you click any link from an unfamiliar sender or in an unsolicited email, hover over it to see if it's going to a website that looks legit. Even better: Avoid clicking links altogether, and head to the website for a given service directly by typing it into your browser.\n\nRemember, it's easier to fall for a scam than you think, so it pays to be skeptical, especially when you encounter a call to action designed to get you to react in a panic.",

    "description": "Hikaru Fujita, who’s running in Sunday’s parliamentary election, is a standout in a country where expectant mothers rarely enter national politics.",
    "fullText": "For weeks, Hikaru Fujita, a candidate in Japan’s parliamentary elections on Sunday, wrestled with a secret. She was pregnant with her first child — a joyous milestone for her and her husband.\n\nBut Ms. Fujita, 35, a Harvard-educated former diplomat, worried that publicizing her pregnancy could hurt her campaign. In late January, she set aside her fears, announcing on social media that she had been “blessed with new life.”\n\n“I wanted to show that even pregnant women could run,” Ms. Fujita, from Nagano Prefecture, said in an interview. “I wanted to send a message to the younger generation.”\n\nOn social media, many people celebrated Ms. Fujita’s news, while others suggested that she should pursue a career as a housewife instead, and that a maternity leave would be a waste of taxpayers’ money.\n\nWith her revelation, Ms. Fujita, who is running for a seat in the powerful House of Representatives as a candidate for the governing Liberal Democratic Party, is testing Japan’s patriarchal system. She is one of a record number of women running for parliamentary seats on Sunday; 313 out of 1,285 candidates, or almost a quarter.\n\nDespite the election last fall of Sanae Takaichi as prime minister — the first woman to serve in that role — women remain significantly underrepresented in Japanese politics. They occupy only about 16 percent of seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nExpectant mothers rarely enter national politics; only a handful have run in local elections over the years. Many point to rampant workplace discrimination against young mothers. There is even a Japanese word for it: matahara, or maternity harassment.\n\nMs. Takaichi, a hard-line conservative from the same party, has avoided speaking out in public on gender issues. But she traveled to Nagano this week to campaign for Ms. Fujita. She is hoping the Liberal Democrats can pick up enough seats in the election to gain a majority and push through her agenda.\n\n“There is no one more incredible than her,” Ms. Takaichi said in Nagano. “Please give her strength.”\n\nMs. Fujita previously worked on issues like economic security and North Korea’s missile program for Japan’s foreign affairs ministry; she has also worked as a consultant for McKinsey & Company. She said she was motivated to run after watching homes and fields in Nagano empty out as people left for cities. She also feels that Japan’s political system has become too fragmented and bureaucratic.\n\nOn the campaign trail, she has offered policies aimed at winning over women and families, including addressing gender pay gaps and expanding child care. She has also made a point of taking time to rest. Her campaign slogan is “Trying her best without overworking herself.”\n\nShe has frequently deployed her husband, Tomohiro Fujita, as her surrogate; he has taken time off from his job as a physics professor to help lead the campaign. He often appears alongside her, wearing a white beanie emblazoned with a Japanese word for husband.\n\nMs. Fujita said the negative comments about her candidacy were “discouraging, disappointing.” But she said she was trying to tune them out.\n\n“It affects me a little bit,” she said in the interview. “But at the end of the day, all these comments are invisible.”\n\nStill, she has occasionally encountered traditional attitudes on the campaign trail. Men often do not make eye contact with her during meetings, she said, instead looking at her husband.\n\n“I didn’t feel comfortable about it, but I also feel that they don’t do it on purpose — they do it unconsciously,” Ms. Fujita said.\n\nHer husband said that men appeared to be “nervous sitting in front of a powerful woman — they are uneasy.”\n\n“They feel more comfortable talking to me,” he said.\n\nMs. Fujita said she hopes her campaign can help challenge conceptions about who can wield power in Japanese society.\n\n“If I fail, I worry there will be fewer opportunities for younger women,” she said. “My job is to run a strong campaign but also to stay healthy and safe.”\n\nHisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.",

    "fullText": "A routine fuel stop turned into a national political flashpoint after a gas station employee refused service to federal immigration agents, igniting a debate that now reaches far beyond politics and squarely into the automotive and fuel retail space.\n\nThe incident unfolded at a Speedway gas station in Minneapolis when Border Patrol agents attempted to refuel government vehicles during official operations.\n\nAccording to video footage that quickly spread online, a man identifying himself as the store’s manager denied service and stated bluntly that he did not support ICE, adding that no one at the store did either. The agents were told to leave without being allowed to purchase fuel.\n\nWithin hours, the encounter became a lightning rod. Critics accused the business of politicizing a basic commercial service, while supporters framed the refusal as a form of protest.\n\nBut for the automotive and fuel industries, the episode raises deeper questions about neutrality, safety, and the evolving role of gas stations in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nFuel stations occupy a unique position in American infrastructure for the simple fact that they aren’t simply retail outlets. They are essential service points relied upon by private motorists, commercial fleets, emergency responders, and, yes, government agencies like ICE.\n\nDenying fuel is not equivalent to refusing a cup of coffee or retail merchandise. Vehicles without fuel do not operate, and in the case of law enforcement or emergency services, that reality carries serious implications.\n\nIndustry experts note that while private businesses generally retain the right to refuse service, gas stations historically operate under an expectation of political neutrality. Fleet contracts, fuel cards, and government supply agreements are built on reliability, not ideology.\n\nOnce a station is perceived as selectively serving customers based on political or occupational identity, that reliability comes into question.\n\nThe fallout for Speedway and its parent companies has been swift. Calls for boycotts surfaced almost immediately, with critics warning that the brand risks alienating everyday drivers who view fuel access as nonpartisan.\n\nOthers warned of reputational damage that could ripple across franchise networks, where individual store decisions can reflect on national brands regardless of corporate policy.\n\nThere is also a safety dimension that automotive analysts are watching closely. Federal agents often refuel during active operations or long-distance deployments. Forcing vehicles to reroute in search of fuel introduces delays and unpredictability.",

    "fullText": "A Louisville business is facing criticism after the owner told employees to \"leave religion and politics at the door” when she received a note from a customer who said he was treated disrespectfully because he was a member of law enforcement.\n\nPlease & Thank You owner Brooke Vaughn told The Courier Journal that she sent the message to her management team Feb. 3 after receiving an email from a man, who identified himself as a police officer, saying he had been treated disrespectfully. In the email, the man said he was “greeted by a rude person” and got “evil looks from all of the employees.”\n\n“REMINDER to leave your religion and politics at the door when you come to work for PLEASE & THANK YOU,” the message reads. “If you discriminate against anyone inside our shops, you are not meant to be a DAY MAKER and should consider a career elsewhere.”\n\nA screenshot of the message was posted to Reddit around 1:30 p.m. Feb. 3, with the post saying it was sent after Vaughn received an email from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Vaughn said the officer who complained to her wrote that he was in uniform during his visit, but did not confirm if the man was an ICE agent.\n\nWithin hours of the message being posted to social media, Vaughn said she and other staff members started receiving several complaints, adding that she was forced to turn off the comment feature on the business' Instagram page due to ongoing arguments.\n\n“People are showing up at shops and calling our employees ‘fascists,’” she said.\n\nVaughn added that the store's media accounts have also gained followers since the message was posted, but she was unsure if they were following to support the business or to \"see [them] fail.\"\n\nThe criticism comes after two U.S. citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis, sparking nationwide protests. Thousands of federal immigration officers were previously sent to Minnesota in December, and President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan announced Feb. 4 that 700 immigration enforcement personnel would be leaving the state.\n\nMetro columnist Joe Gerth contributed.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Please & Thank You owner facing backlash after memo posted online",

    "fullText": "The most popular mom content tends to be rightwing tradwife propaganda or not political at all – pushing progressive creators out of the algorithm\n\nFor someone who doesn’t have a marble island in their kitchen I spend a disproportionate amount of time staring at marble kitchen islands, slack-jawed, brain turned half off. That’s because I consume a lot of videos from mommy bloggers, mom influencers, and the like. In kitchen “closing shift” videos, they wipe down their islands and reset by lighting luxury candles, the glow accentuating their respectable cosmetic procedures. Other times I watch them waltz through their morning routines: getting kids out the door, sweating it out in boutique fitness classes, showing off Amazon hauls, or explaining their children’s matching holiday photoshoot outfits.\n\nFor better or worse, this is how I have chosen to spend my one wild and precious life: consuming blissfully low-stakes motherhood content on my phone. It is domestically competent ASMR that also satiates my desire to peek into everyone’s bathroom cabinets. I nod in unsolicited approval as a TikTok mom I follow shares her green juice order. Fascinating. I should drink something like that. Another posts timestamps of her baby’s night-time sleep schedule. I, who lives between walls that have never heard the wail of an infant, ingurgitate the entire video.\n\nBut occasionally, when my cerebrum is not completely smoothed over by a beautiful woman beckoning me to “get ready” with her, an anxiety starts to creep in. What, I wonder, are this woman’s politics? Has she ever given us a hint? Is she registered to vote? Is there any chance she, like me, is outraged by ICE raids, book bans, our government’s comparatively dismal maternal support system or slippery slide into fascism? Does she know there are midterms this year? Mama, blink twice!\n\nIn my ideal algorithm, I would get served posts to assuage my doubts. I would watch nursery hauls of a mother whose progressiveness I did not doubt. I would know that she dreads the realities of the climate crisis. I would listen to a parent describe her weekly meal prep for a family of four and not wonder if she was politically aligned with the men in government stripping food safety regulations. Maybe tips on how to get your daily steps in with a newborn would include showing up at protests or delivering mutual aid groceries. Because in real life, I was raised by and hope to be a mother who is both fluent in the chaotic and comforting mundanity of domesticity and enraged by the systems that diminish and destroy families and livelihoods. I just don’t see that much of it in my online spheres.\n\nInstead, the most popular motherhood and lifestyle content lands somewhere on the short spectrum between conservative tradwife propaganda and extraordinarily apolitical, considering the paralyzing polycrisis we find ourselves in. I’m increasingly suspicious: was that sourdough starter “how to” video actually funded by the Church of Latter-day Saints? Hannah Neeleman AKA Ballerina Farm, one of the most-followed motherhood lifestyle content creators across platforms, has not ever explicitly divulged her political views – but do followers know she graced the cover of Evie magazine, described by one of its founders as “conservative Cosmo”?\n\n“The right in the United States has really won the family,” said content creator Kate Glavan. This past summer, Glavan posted a TikTok saying she would “happily watch ‘stay-at-home mom’ content if it emphasized the reality of being a mom in America”. More than 1,200 commenters chimed in on her video, captioned “We need leftist mommy blogger content”, in agreement. Some politely promoted their own accounts, or offered reasons they felt leftist mommy blogger content doesn’t lend itself to virality. “Leftist moms are often working,” one commenter wrote. “Every time I even HINT at my true political beliefs on here I get absolutely destroyed in my comments section,” wrote another. A number of people also expressed their unwillingness to put their children on camera due to privacy concerns and big-tech mistrust, which undoubtedly does not please the algorithmic gods.\n\nI asked Glavan, who does not have children of her own, what led her to make the video. “I don’t see enough examples of how I could do [motherhood] as someone who is left of center and advocates for certain politics,” she said. She believes that “being a mom is so political”, with the realities of motherhood in the US overwhelming even the twentysomething child-free influencer. “You are navigating through the healthcare system, you are probably not getting paid leave. You’re probably not getting any sort of benefits, the cost of diapers …” she lamented before trailing off.\n\nGlavan is pretty much right about, well, the right. The Venn diagram of anti-feminist Trump administration officials and hangers-on, and pronatalist enthusiasts – a movement concerned with women having more babies – has a worryingly chunky midsection. In an NBC poll from this past summer, women aged 18-29 who voted for Donald Trump in 2024 prioritized “having children” as a six out of 13 in their definition of personal success. Women of the same age who voted for Kamala Harris ranked it 12 of 13, prioritizing instead certain financial goals, community building and emotional stability.\n\nThe left’s skepticism or outright rejection of the traditional nuclear family – you know, white picket fence, two-and-a-half kids, general suburban phantasma – is not unique to this presidency. Throughout history, women’s domesticity has been held in tension against their autonomy. Marxist feminists in the 1970s demanded “family abolition”, arguing that the bourgeois family structure upholds the patriarchy and exploits wives as “instruments of production”. Around the same time, the grassroots campaigns Wages For Housework and Black Women for Wages for Housework aimed to raise the visibility of the economic contribution of women’s domestic labor, the latter movement asserting that welfare is a wage, not a charity.\n\nNo need to dive into complex social theory though, just visit any gift shop and pick up a magnet, greetings card or wine glass satirizing the lobotomized housewife and you will get the gist. But with motherhood content sitting at the crux of domestic life, gender politics, and consumerism (many creators aim to monetize views via sponsorships and paid product placement), it simply is not an ideal breeding ground for left-leaning thought leaders. (Though, could one argue that current-day monetization of the performance of labor in momfluencing is an extension of these mid-century feminist crusades? Perhaps!)\n\nMust I reckon with the reality that good politics and pilates arms routines might be at odds with one another? Motherhood content can and is often aesthetically aspirational, but can it also be ideologically so?\n\nIf you buck the algorithm and go searching, you will find creators whose identities fall outside the cookie cutter content farms both in makeup – queer moms, solo moms by choice, blended families – and substance. Moms who focus on gender-imbalanced workloads, like She Is A Paige Turner, or how special needs parenting is impacted by politics, like Eres_rara, or the dissonance of parenting at a time when ICE is separating children from their families and communities, like Bri motherhood. YouTuber Tiffany Ferg has a vlog titled: Why Motherhood Should Radicalize You. It’s all informative, it’s engaging, and it doesn’t quite scratch the itch because it can feel more like a lecture (albeit one I fully endorse) than the habitual mom content I tend to seek out.\n\nEarly attempts to ideologically curate my feeds and rid them of conservative-coded creators also led me to following mothers who romanticize their humble, though devotedly aesthetic, homes and natural fiber-forward lifestyles in back-to-the-earth settings like Mendocino or mid-coast Maine. But I was hoodwinked by their Democratic zip codes and unkempt curtain bangs. Handsome walnut cutting boards might have replaced antiseptic marble islands, but I was also increasingly watching haul videos not of Costco-sized tubs of Tylenol but raw milk to treat preventable illness. What did I expect? It’s Maha-mania out there, and mom influencers are all in.\n\nAround the time I watched Glavan’s video, I also watched a TikTok in which fashion and trend analyst Mandy Lee felt the need to clarify to her followers that her preconception health journey, which she chose to discuss online, was not going to lead her down the Maha or “alt-right” pipeline. Later she clarified she planned to rely on “real science, not Facebook science” in her fertility journey. She did not want to risk that wanting “a child and to have a family would make people assume that [she is] conservative”, which “could not be further from the truth”.\n\nHer disclaimers reminded me of another motherhood movement turned toxic: the forum Mumsnet, which provided moms in the UK with community and support but quickly veered into anti-trans rhetoric and Terfiness.\n\nLast year, motherhood and lifestyle content creator Lisa Miller started incorporating her political beliefs into her videos, after making the move with her family of five from eastern Tennessee to Brooklyn. “With the climate of politics now and having this major platform that I do – really it’s not a major platform compared to some creators, but to me, it is – it’s so important for me to speak out on things that I’m passionate about and that matter,” she said. That wasn’t always the case. Miller was raised by a Mexican American mom with left-leaning views in Detroit before being put in foster care in conservative parts of Virginia. “I just learned very early on to keep my opinions to myself and I didn’t want conflict.”\n\nBut the idea of conflict became less daunting as she witnessed a handful of parenthood creators, such as New York dad Jose Rolon (whose bio pitches his content as “relatable parenting to all families”), seamlessly incorporate politics into their platforms. Between family vacation vlogs and his recaps of his kids’ sports games are videos endorsing Zohran Mamdani and calling on fellow Latino creators to speak up about ICE raids.\n\nNow Miller posts videos that begin with her saying: “Get ready with me to lose a bunch of followers,” in which she discusses her thoughts on gun violence, ICE raids and raising a child on the autism spectrum in RFK Jr’s America as she does her multistep makeup routine and fixes up her hair. I find the series to be an ingenious blend of comforting daily ritual – like your typical momfluencer video – and straightforward political candor. The itch – it’s scratched!\n\nMiller’s defiant stance is common among the minority of mom creators who are vocally left-leaning – an acknowledgment of the apolitical or conservative mommy content they’re competing against. Many will use meme formats to clarify that they are not a tradwife SAHM (stay at home mom) but a “household who believes in science and equal rights”-type SAHM. (Bread and crosses emojis indicate the former, microscopes and rainbow flags the latter.) I’ve also seen a number of videos along the lines of this one, which reads: “POV you’re a progressive mom trying to figure out someone’s [presumably a new mom friend’s] vibe.” (Another way to check a TikTok creator’s politics is to peek at who they’re digitally endorsing in the “reposts” tab.) I have scrolled past many that share a sentiment along the lines of “I might not get invited back to book club, but at least they know where I stand on Palestine.” Since federal agents shot and killed VA nurse Alex Pretti and mom of three, Renee Nicole Good, and detained five-year-old Liam Ramos in Minneapolis, my feed has seen an uptick in videos of moms, some self-proclaimed “wine moms”, posting about how they are engaging with their children or shielding them from the enormity of these indignities.\n\nIt’s corny, but there is some pride that comes with being a conscious content consumer. “When you find out that someone is not a Trump supporter, you’re like, ‘OK, now I trust you, and I want to support your paid brand deals and comment on them and say, get your bag,’” Glavan said. It goes two ways. For Miller, being clear where she stands politically has helped a new and appreciative audience find her. “I found it so freeing and really healing to find like-minded people,” she said. “It certainly was empowering to connect with a community that believes in things like human rights and equality and women’s rights and Black Lives Matter.”\n\nMiller, who has worked with a number of lifestyle brands popular among moms, hasn’t seen a dip in deals with them since sharing her political views. “I’m not using my platform in a negative way and I think that would be different if I were, you know, being negative or being ugly or being hateful,” she said.\n\nI know that watching “day in my life” routines, hoping they will reflect on ways to look out for your neighbors or speak out against the current administration, is sort of like hoping the NFL might pause the Super Bowl to meaningfully address violence against women. But occasionally, you stumble upon something close. And though it might not be aspirational the way a perfectly sliced toddler snack plate is, it is aspirational in the sense it showcases my reality: not only do motherhood and left-leaning outrage coexist, the former often informs the latter.\n\nTo loosely and lazily (my favorite way to scroll) bastardize Marxist theory, there might not be any ethical consumption under motherhood content, but there are certainly some creators I’m hoping “get their bag”.",

Recent deadly shootings by ICE and Border Patrol agents in Minnesota have pushed some CEOs, from big names in tech to small business owners, to comment publicly on politics again.\n\nGriffin, one of the GOP's biggest donors, was also asked about whether he has plans to run for public office, Griffin said that he hasn't ruled it out. \n\n\"I'd like to believe at a future point in my life I will be involved in public service,\" adding that it was unlikely in the next few years.\n\nIn terms of others' public service, Griffin praised Trump's pick for Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, calling the nomination a \"powerful assertion that the Fed will maintain needed independence in policy decision-making.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s approval rating polls released at the start of 2026 indicate a gradual decline in public support for the President. One year into his second term, the data suggest that voter confidence has softened, even as his presidency continues to provoke strong reactions on both ends of the political spectrum.\n\nThe polling data from early 2026 shows a decline in support for President Donald Trump as midterm elections near. Multiple surveys conducted in late January reveal a consistent trend: more Americans now disapprove of his job performance than approve.\n\nTrump’s approval rating is currently mired in the upper 30s to low 40s, while his disapproval consistently registers above 50%. This negative shift comes after a year of big policy moves and political upheaval. This includes a protracted government shutdown and aggressive federal budget cuts, as well as the controversial domestic deployment of U.S. troops (via Democrat & Chronicle).\n\nA New York Times survey puts his support at 41%, with 56% opposed. The Economist shows a similar 38% to 56% split. Meanwhile, pollsters like Rasmussen and Morning Consult show a slightly tighter race, with approvals at 46%. Others, like Pew Research Center and American Research Group, report a starker deficit, with unfavorable ratings reaching 61% and 63%, respectively. This broad spectrum of Donald Trump’s approval rating polls points to a challenging political environment for the White House.\n\nAnalysts suggest this dip is rooted in more than just policy disputes. A detailed Pew Research Center study from late January probed deeper into public trust, finding widespread skepticism. According to their report, “more Americans express little or no confidence in Trump than say they are extremely or very confident in him.” This deficit of confidence spans critical areas, including his leadership, mental fitness, selection of advisors, and commitment to democratic values and ethics.\n\nThe post Donald Trump’s New Approval Rating Polls Show Major Changes appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny's historic Grammy win for \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" highlights the intersection of art and politics amid ongoing immigration protests.",
    "fullText": "We expect political statements when they're delivered on podiums or with policy briefs. This one arrived with a golden gramophone.\n\nOn Sunday at the 2026 Grammy Awards, the Recording Academy bestowed its highest honor on Bad Bunny's \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos,\" the first all-Spanish album in history to win album of the year.\n\nAs the Los Angeles crowd erupted in applause, Bad Bunny appeared overcome with emotion, hunching in his chair and shielding his teary eyes with his hand. The lyrics to \"DTMF,\" a song about seeking refuge in community, reverberated through the venue.\n\nIt was a historic moment, but it was also, quite plainly, a political one. Voters chose to celebrate a musical love letter to Puerto Rico during a period of peak anti-immigrant messaging from the US government. President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts have disproportionately targeted Latino communities, a recent UCLA analysis found, and in September, the Supreme Court lifted restrictions on racial profiling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now, simply speaking Spanish in public, or even speaking English with an accent, is grounds to be stopped and even detained for questioning.\n\nFor a proud Latino artist and native Spanish speaker to become the biggest winner on \"music's biggest night\" — and for him to make his acceptance speech largely in Spanish — is in itself an implicit yet firm protest. Even so, Bad Bunny did not stop at implicit. He called out ICE while accepting the award for best música urbana album earlier in the ceremony, pointedly doing so in English for maximum impact. \"We're not savage. We're not animals. We're not aliens,\" he said. \"We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\nThere has always been a significant swath of Americans who insist that politics has no place in art, and that artists like Bad Bunny should stick to song and dance. Some fans and conservative pundits claimed Taylor Swift ruined her career after she publicly endorsed Democratic candidates in 2018. Back in the early aughts, The Chicks were blacklisted in Nashville for criticizing then-President George W. Bush; a documentary about the band released in 2006 is titled \"Shut Up and Sing.\"\n\nEven some artists feel this way. After winning three awards on Sunday, country star Jelly Roll side-stepped questions about the political climate: \"I can tell you that people shouldn't care to hear my opinion,\" he told reporters in the press room.\n\nJust a few days before the Grammys, Sydney Sweeney expressed a similar sentiment, arguing that her work as an actor exempts her from civic engagement.\n\n\"I'm not a political person. I'm in the arts,\" she told Cosmopolitan. \"I'm not here to speak on politics. That's not an area I've ever even imagined getting into.\"\n\nPerhaps Jelly Roll, Sweeney, and their like-minded contingent would have preferred Bad Bunny to steer clear of political statements on the Grammys stage. Yet his very presence on that stage neutralizes such a preference. Even if all he said was a quick thanks, he'd be accepting an award with political implications.\n\n\"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" is a body of work that deliberately engages with some of the most urgent and contentious questions of our time — questions of identity, belonging, American imperialism, and cultural preservation. Bad Bunny told The New York Times that in making this album, he aimed to use his platform for more than just selling records and topping charts; he wanted to \"plant a seed,\" especially for young people in Puerto Rico, to think critically about their roots, their heritage, and the forces that threaten to consume them.\n\nOf course, you can enjoy \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" without analyzing the lyrics or even understanding the language. That still doesn't mean you can appraise these songs (or the man who sings them) in a pure, apolitical vacuum. What the Grammy voters heard, judged, and justly rewarded was art informed by the world around it.\n\nIndeed, Toni Morrison's famous quote rings true: All good art is political. But in the same interview from 2008, the Nobel Prize-winning author went on to make an equally important point: That even the most shallow, avoidant, vapid-sounding artists are making political statements without meaning to.\n\n\"All of that art-for-art's-sake stuff is BS,\" Morrison said. \"What are these people talking about? Are you really telling me that Shakespeare and Aeschylus weren't writing about kings? All good art is political! There is none that isn't. And the ones that try hard not to be political are political by saying, 'We love the status quo.'\"",

    "description": "A top economist says Kevin Warsh is a solid choice for Fed chair — but his legacy will depend on keeping politics out of interest rate decisions.",
    "fullText": "Kevin Warsh checks a lot of boxes that Federal Reserve watchers care about.\n\nBut the top economist at Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi, says the real test is whether Warsh can keep politics out of interest rate decisions.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is a reasonable choice for the next Federal Reserve chair. His obvious strength is his previous stint on the Fed during the Global Financial Crisis. He knows the institution and everyone in global central banking circles,\" Zandi wrote in an X post on Sunday.\n\n\"But the critical question is whether he will be strong enough to ensure that interest rates are set based on the economy, and not politics,\" he added.\n\nZandi said this will not be an easy feat, given that President Donald Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates.\n\nTrump also hopes the next Fed chair will consult him over future interest rate decisions, The Wall Street Journal reported in December.\n\n\"Warsh's ostensible views on the use of the Fed's balance sheet or its data dependency are quirky, even odd, but his legacy as Fed chair will be determined by how much of the Fed's independence he is able to preserve,\" Zandi said.\n\nWarsh spent his early career working at Morgan Stanley before becoming an economic advisor to President George W. Bush in 2002.\n\nHe served on the Fed's Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, after being nominated by Bush. His time there also overlapped with the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nZandi said these credentials show \"he is well-versed in financial markets, which is especially important when markets go off the rails, which they will almost surely do some time during his four-year term.\"\n\nWarsh's Wall Street and Fed credentials have earned him respect with many other leading figures in business and economics.\n\nThe renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian said the former Wall Streeter would bring \"deep expertise\" as chair, while Alan Howard, the billionaire founder of macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, praised Warsh's \"depth of experience.\"\n\nOthers echo Zandi's emphasis on the importance of Warsh preserving the Fed's independence.\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Friday that the Fed's independence is \"always something that we need to protect.\"",

    "fullText": "The Department of Justice released the latest batch of files pertaining to the crimes and communications of Jeffrey Epstein this past Friday afternoon, and while everyone was more than prepared to see the names of various celebrities and prominent political figures, almost no one was expecting to discover a direct tie between Epstein and the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft.\n\nAs Kraft’s team continues to prepare for their championship outing against the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl LX on February 8th, the 84-year-old American businessman finds himself in the midst of a potential legacy-shattering scandal, which allseems to stem from his 2019 misdemeanor charge for solicitation of prostitution.\n\nIn an email exchange between Epstein and Jack Goldberger, a notable criminal defense attorney, Goldberger wrote, “See, Kraft got arrested. Should take local news away from us.” Epstein responded by simply stating, “Yes. I’m trying to have him hire you.” The exchange is dated as February 22nd of 2019, and just six days later, on the 28th, ESPN reported that the Patriots’ owner had hired Goldberger as one of his attorneys.\n\nThe history between Epstein and Goldberger is that the defense attorney once helped the late s*x trafficker reach a non-prosecution deal with the Miami U.S. Attorney’s office in 2008 to end an investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse of 40+ victims. In an unfortunate turn of events, however, this doesn’t appear to be the only instance in which Kraft seemingly followed the advice of Epstein.\n\nIn a separate text exchange, Goldeberger, who was saved in Epstein’s phone as “Jack,” informed Epstein about the ongoing formation of Kraft’s legal team.\n\n“Many people advising him, but after call, he called back and said he wants me and my Quinn Emanuel guy to handle it. The other guy trying to weasel in was Dan Conley. Don’t know anything about him, but having a Boston guy come down and trying to overpower these line assistants would be a huge mistake, and Kraft got it.”\n\nJust a few days later, in early March of 2019, it was reported by Yahoo Finance and Law.com that Kraft had brought on William “Bill” Burck, the co-managing partner in Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan’s Washington, D.C., office, to assist with his then-ongoing legal troubles. Although the real concern lies within Epstein’s response to Goldberger’s text, which simply stated, “You need to know about a past issue with Kraft that may come to light.”\n\nTo make matters even worse for the NFL, it turns out that Kraft wasn’t the only owner who was mentioned throughout the three million records that were released. The New York Giants’ Steve Tisch, the Carolina Panthers’ David Tepper, the Washington Commanders‘ Josh Harris, and several others were all mentioned in the latest release as well.\n\nWith their largest event of the year being just around the corner, it’s safe to say that this bombshell couldn’t have come at a worse time for the league, which will now have to spend its celebratory media week explaining away these various issues.\n\nThe post DOJ Files: Jeffrey Epstein Urged Patriots Owner Robert Kraft to Hire Jack Goldberger in 2019 Case appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "title": "The Safer Bowl: With tensions running high, Super Bowl advertisers avoid politics and play for laughs",
    "description": "This year's Super Bowl advertising formula is comedy plus celebrity for many brands taking part in the big game's commercial breaks.",
    "fullText": "In a charged political climate where even small missteps can spark a brand backlash, many of this year's Super Bowl advertisers are sticking with the safest bet in the playbook: comedy and celebrities.\n\nMuch like last year's Super Bowl, the vast majority of the big game ads released so far are playing it safe. Advertisers hope that A-list stars will be a shortcut to attention in the crowded field of commercials, and that humor will leave audiences feeling uplifted and warm toward their brand.\n\n\"In general, advertisers want to play it safe,\" said Peter Daboll, head of North America at the creative testing platform DAIVID. \"There's a high anxiety level here in the US, and people are probably very afraid of triggering anything.\"\n\nViewers aren't in the mood to be preached to, he added, and even heartwarming ads that might have performed well in Super Bowls past could come across as too \"syrupy\" and fall flat.\n\nThere's one week to go until the Patriots-Seahawks showdown, but plenty of brands have already released their ads, or teasers, ahead of game day.\n\nOf the 15 Super Bowl LX ad previews the TV measurement platform iSpot tested with a consumer panel so far, 12 triggered \"funny\" reactions from viewers. The highest \"funny\" score went to Instacart, whose vintage-style ad features actor Ben Stiller and singer Benson Boone in a high-energy— and ultimately calamitous — musical performance about choosing the perfect banana.\n\nOther ads hoping to raise a chuckle:\n\nThe cast of celebrities in the commercial breaks will range from Sabrina Carpenter for Pringles to Emma Stone for Squarespace and Guy Fieri for Bosch.\n\nMark Gross, cofounder of the ad agency Highdive, which has produced several Super Bowl campaigns over the years, said the Hollywood landscape had changed and that celebrities are now more open to appearing in commercials than in previous years.\n\n\"It's the job of us at ad agencies and marketers to tell great, original stories that stand out without just hiring the celebrity first and expecting that to do the work for you,\" he added.\n\nHighdive worked on a Super Bowl commercial for Lay's this year.\n\nThe Super Bowl remains one of the last mass-reach media advertising destinations. Last year's Super Bowl averaged a record-high US audience of 127.7 million viewers, per Nielsen, the TV ratings company.\n\nThe average price for 30 seconds of airtime during Super Bowl LX was $8 million, with some spots selling for more than $10 million, according to this year's big game broadcaster, NBCUniversal. Then there are the millions of dollars spent on talent fees, production, and media buys to amplify the ad after the game ends.\n\n\"CMOs are under so much pressure,\" said Kerry Benson, SVP of creative strategy at the data and analytics company Kantar.\n\n\"They have to prove ROI in these ads,\" she said, referring to return on investment.\n\nThe rewards can be handsome if brands play their Super Bowl strategies right.\n\nIn 2024, Kantar found that Super Bowl ads delivered an average return on investment of $8.60 for every $1 spent, making them 20 times more effective than regular TV ads. Benson said this reflects the size of the audience during the game and all the supporting activity and discussion around a Super Bowl campaign.\n\nNot every brand is adopting the comedy-and-celebrity playbook.\n\nToyota's \"Superhero Belt\" ad attempts to tug at the heartstrings, telling the story of a grandfather taking his grandson for a drive and showing their roles reversed decades later. Elsewhere, Hims & Hers' \"Rich People Live Longer\" spot strikes a provocative tone about US healthcare inequality, featuring a couple of characters that resemble Jeff Bezos and the biohacker Bryan Johnson.\n\n\"When you are challenging a system that has been broken for generations, the work cannot feel familiar or safe,\" said Hims & Hers chief design officer, Dan Kenger. \"The creative has to feel disruptive because that's what is needed to change the status quo of healthcare.\"\n\nAnselmo Ramos, creative chairman at the advertising agency GUT, is nostalgic for ads that didn't lean on celebrity as a shortcut to success — Apple's \"1984,\" Budweiser's frogs, the Geico caveman, and the E-Trade baby. He's also hoping to see more bold, anthemic spots in the sea of comedic commercials.\n\n\"I'm missing executions with a brand purpose, with a clear point of view,\" Ramos said. \"We need them more than ever.\"",

Academic Dishonesty, Political Selection, and Institutional Performance in China\n\n Zhuang Liu, \n\n Wenwei Peng \n\n & Shaoda Wang \n\n Working Paper 34747\n\n DOI 10.3386/w34747\n\n Issue Date January 2026\n\nHonesty is perceived as fundamental to societal functioning, motivating education systems worldwide to enforce strict oversight and heavy penalties for dishonest behavior. Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe thank Ying Bai, Yiming Cao, Yunchien Chang, Chiman Cheung, Ruben Durante, Ray Fisman, Edward Glaeser, Guojun He, Andrew Kao, Muhammad Yasir Khan, Jonathan Klick, James Kung, Bingjing Li, Vincent Pons, Jesse Shapiro, Uta Schoenberg, Michael Song, Yongxiang Wang, Jaya Wen, Yanhui Wu, David Y.

    "description": "In the second part of our series on digital politics, we look at how online provocateurs have advanced extreme political ideas – and watched them seep into the...",
    "fullText": "The internet has totally changed the way in which politics is conducted. As established in the first piece in our series, liberals have totally failed to grasp this fact. The right, however, are thriving in this new world. Future historians studying the role that fringe online ideas played in the US republic’s demise will be spoiled for choice. One episode in particular comes to mind: Tucker Carlson, a former primetime speaker at a Republican convention, inviting a white supremacist livestreamer, Nick Fuentes, on to his YouTube show in 2025 for a chat in which he talked about the influence of “organised Jewry” in the US.\n\nCarlson spent years echoing white nationalist talking points on his Fox News show, but Fuentes’ style – combining Nazi salutes with cheeky grins – places him beyond the pale for broadcast television. However, under the logic of YouTube, the meeting of these two major influencers is almost inevitable. Platforms incentivise audience cross-pollination, which is why Fuentes routinely livestreams with figures such as Adin Ross and Andrew Tate, who are known more for their homophobia and misogyny than their thoughts on ethnostates.\n\nEstablishment politicians have denounced Carlson, but despite – or perhaps because of – the backlash, his subscriber account continues to climb steadily after hosting Fuentes, who was rewarded for his appearance with more than 100,000 new X followers. For every corporate advertiser that pulls out, another selling, say, seed-oil-free beef tallow crisps will find a new market of people looking to resist establishment corruption with something natural and authentic.\n\nBut this is not just about follower counts. It is also about harnessing online engagement and turning it into a worldview. If you can cultivate online engagement, you can create new political styles and advance even the most extreme political ideas, such as total remigration. Only a year ago, this call to deport anyone with a migrant background – potentially even naturalised citizens – was too toxic for far-right parties to embrace openly. Now, the US Department for Homeland Security posts calls for remigration on X, and Alice Weidel, leader of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – the second-largest party in the Bundestag – has incorporated remigration into the party’s official platform.\n\nReform UK – not so much a party as a corporation orbiting an influencer – understands the power of this politics well. When LBC’s Nick Ferrari recently tried to pin Nigel Farage down over Donald Trump’s dubious suggestion that paracetamol causes autism, Farage framed it as a question of national sovereignty, saying the important thing is not to cede ground to the World Health Organization, which “now seem to want to take some extraordinary powers that would allow them to lock us down in the future”. A large audience could interpret this as a reference to the “great reset” conspiracy, a vague conspiracy theory that encompasses the loss of civil liberties and the creation of a new economic system.\n\nThis theory remains a touchstone years after the pandemic because it joins the dots between the upheaval of lockdown and the political and economic instability that has followed. This is why Joe Rogan and Tate were quick to link Labour’s digital ID scheme to the “great reset”. Reactionary digital politics tells a compelling story: a nebulous they have gone too far and must be resisted. This niche online view then helps to shape a wider worldview that can influence voters during elections. Once ideas such as remigration or worries over the “great reset” find a mainstream audience, they exist alongside debates about cutting taxes and funding the NHS, and their extremist origins get buried.\n\nAs well as the ability to influence public opinion, there is also the chance of earning cold hard cash for enterprising posters. The since-deleted X account @EuropeInvasions helped spark the July 2024 riots with a post claiming the Southport attacker was a “Muslim immigrant”. The post was viewed nearly 7m times. Over the next month, the account’s relentlessly Islamophobic posts attracted almost 240m views. X’s ad revenue-sharing programme is opaque, but based on other users’ stated earnings, in August 2024 @EuropeInvasions would have earned roughly $2,000.\n\nThis convergence of monetary incentives with ideologically charged engagement produces a kind of ambient extremism in contemporary politics. Far-right ideas, memes and tropes that were once confined to the fringes of 4chan and Telegram now circulate as part of mainstream discourse, where they no longer stand out as extreme. In the span of a few weeks in the summer of 2024, Jordan Peterson interviewed Farage, Tommy Robinson and Elon Musk. Robinson’s rants about grooming gangs did the best numbers. Soon after, Musk began calling Starmer “two-tier Keir” adopting one of Robinson’s favoured phrases, which Reform also adopted.\n\nRobinson’s blunt-force communication style wears thin, but the secret of his current success is his ability to tie his far-right project to the playfulness of meme culture and the self-help discourse of reactionary gurus such as Peterson. Musk welcoming him back to X has been a massive boon as well. As an influencer, he is in a far better position to shape British politics than he was as leader of the English Defence League. He can let the currents of the attention economy carry him along.\n\nThere are risks involved: as Trump has learned, as his QAnon posting comes back to bite him with the Jeffrey Epstein debacle, many can feed online attention, but none can control it. Nor can they satiate it. Robinson first claimed victory for Labour’s hardline asylum reforms and then described the home secretary as a “Pakistani” who has “welcomed the invaders”. Musk has suggested that there could be civil war in the UK. Scenes from the US of masked agents nabbing people off the streets – and even from daycare centres – and shooting civilians is a grim reminder that what starts online can end in real-life violence.\n\nRobert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London",

    "description": "Find out more about King Charles' reaction to Prince Harry calling out Donald Trump following his claims about NATO allies on SheFinds.com",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump recently made claims that British soldiers stayed “off the front lines” during the war in Afghanistan, and his comments struck a chord, especially with Prince Harry, who served for over a decade in the British Army. The 41-year-old didn’t waste any time calling out the United States president, but his father, King Charles, reportedly wishes his son reacted differently. Keep reading \n\nAccording to Royal reporter Rob Shuter, Harry's very public reaction to Donald Trump's claims has put King Charles in a \"deeply uncomfortable\" position, especially ahead of King Charles and Queen Camilla's upcoming trip to the United States. Shuter reported that Charles \"understands the emotion, but he's horrified by the timing.\"\n\n\"This is diplomacy—not podcast politics,\" an insider told Shuter. \"Harry's comments make an already sensitive situation far trickier. The King can't clap back—even if he agrees.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Donald Trump questioned if the NATO allies would \"be there\" if the United States \"ever needed them.\"\n\n\"I've always said, 'Will they be there, if we ever needed them?' And that's really the ultimate test. And I'm not sure of that. I know that we would have been there, or we would be there, but will they be there?\" he questioned.\n\n\"We've never needed them,\" he continued. \"We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did—they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"\n\nThese claims from Donald Trump angered many members of the NATO alliance, including England. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Trump's claims \"insulting and frankly appalling,\" and even Prince Harry had more than a few words to say about it.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Prince Harry released a statement on the topic. \"In 2001, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first—and only—time in history,\" he said, referencing the mutual defense clause that was activated following the September 11, 2001 attacks. \"It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call.\"\n\n\"I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,\" he continued. \"The United Kingdom alone had 457 service personnel killed. Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost.\"\n\n\"Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defense of diplomacy and peace,\" he finished. Prince Harry has long since been a supporter and defender of British veterans, having founded the Invictus Games in 2014, an international, Paralympic-style event for wounded, injured, and sick military service personnel and veterans.",

    "title": "Trump's political threat to 'decertify' thousands of Canadian-made aircraft risks aviation safety, industry watchers say",
    "description": "Trump's threat to \"decertify\" Canadian aircraft has stirred safety concerns among analysts who caution against politicizing aircraft certification.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's threat to \"decertify\" Canadian-made aircraft — the backbone of many US carriers' regional jet fleet — is a threat to aviation safety, industry watchers said Friday.\n\nThe president also doesn't have the authority to unilaterally declare planes unworthy to fly in the US, Henry Harteveldt, an aviation industry authority and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told Business Insider. That authority belongs to the FAA.\n\nThe trade spat — another in a continuing back-and-forth between Trump and Canada — comes after Canada hasn't fully certified newer US-made Gulfstream jets to fly in its skies. (It has certified older models.) Gulfstream planes are used almost exclusively by private aviation companies, governments, and the ultrawealthy.\n\nTrump said on Thursday night, in a Truth Social post, that he would \"decertify\" Canada-made Bombardier jets until Canada approved the Gulfstream models. He also threatened a 50% tariff on \"any and all\" Canadian aircraft sold in the US until the situation was corrected.\n\nBombardier said in a statement that it's in contact with the Canadian government. The FAA referred Business Insider to the White House. A White House official said decertification would not immediately affect aircraft already in operation; it would apply only to new deliveries.\n\nThat would be a relief for US airlines like American, Delta, and United, whose regional affiliates operate Bombardier CRJ aircraft to cities across the country.\n\nStill, any move to decertify these more than 2,000 passenger airliners and private jets — part of almost 5,550 Canadian-made aircraft and helicopters certified in the US, according to Cirium — could trigger thousands of flight cancellations a day. A 50% tariff would likely raise airline ticket prices.\n\nAviation analysts said Trump's threat posed a safety risk in itself.\n\n\"Anything that intrudes on the turf of safety regulators coming from politics, trade issues, or personal grievances is a very, very bad idea,\" Richard Aboulafia, managing director of the aviation consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory, told Business Insider.\n\nAboulafia said aircraft certification is intentionally non-political for a reason: Regulators are meant to evaluate risk, not respond to trade threats. Once certification becomes a political weapon, trust in the system erodes for manufacturers, operators, and the flying public, he contended.\n\nIn Canada's case, the delay in certification is likely not obstructionism but the result of independent regulatory decisions.\n\nFor the Gulfstream G700 and G800, Canada hasn't completed its own certification, while the FAA has granted Gulfstream a temporary exemption from certain fuel‑icing rules designed to ensure aircraft engines and systems operate safely in extreme cold.\n\nThe FAA waiver means Gulfstream has until the end of this year to meet those requirements — meaning the aircraft is operating under essentially conditional certification in the US, despite being allowed to be delivered.\n\nThese waivers are not unusual and are typically granted to allow new aircraft to enter service while completing certain technical tests and paperwork, rather than because the planes are unsafe.\n\nStill, history shows what can sometimes go wrong when thorough certification and safety protocols are deprioritized. The most consequential example was the Boeing 737 Max, which suffered two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 due to systemic design issues, killing 346 people.\n\nMore recently, in early 2024, a door plug separated on another 737 Max due to quality-control issues at Boeing's Washington factory, further exacerbating scrutiny of production and certification. No one died in that incident.\n\nPart of the reason the 737 Max issues slipped past regulators is that, for decades, global authorities often relied on reciprocal approvals, effectively rubber-stamping each other's certifications to speed aircraft to market.\n\nThe Max disasters exposed the risks of that approach. Today, regulators — including those in Canada — are expected to conduct their own full assessments rather than automatically rely on approvals from foreign authorities.\n\nThe FAA itself is taking extra precautions before certifying the Boeing 737 Max 7 and 10, as both aircraft have technical problems that could lead to engine overheating. Boeing initially asked for a waiver but rescinded it amid the scrutiny.",

    "fullText": "There was a surprising lack of \"MAGA red\" at the premiere of Melania Trump's new movie.\n\nThe first lady, her husband, and their political allies walked the red carpet at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on Thursday night to support the film, \"Melania,\" which hits theaters Friday.\n\nThere were no \"Make America Great Again\" hats or vibrant red suits in sight, though. Instead, attendees arrived in a mix of understated looks, American flag pins, and, most interestingly, blue ensembles.\n\nHere's a closer look at what attendees wore.\n\nDonald Trump posed outside the premiere in a navy suit, wearing an American flag pin on his lapel and a burgundy tie.\n\nMelania, on the other hand, chose an all-black ensemble from Italian fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana. It comprised a straight skirt, a buttoned blazer with a thin belt, and pointed leather heels.\n\nThe outfit fit her subdued style, which she's worn throughout this presidential term. Her hair, now gold and brown, was styled in her signature waves.\n\nHe paired his pinstriped set with a white button-up shirt and an extra-skinny tie.\n\nThe latter was blue and printed with a pattern of small red crab shapes.\n\nDr. Oz and his son, Oliver, matched in blue satin suits, black dress shoes, and red ties.\n\nThe women of the family took the same approach, but with a different color palette. Lisa Oz wore a brown satin dress with gold heels and matching earrings, while Daphne Oz donned a glittering brown dress with velvet boots and a diamond necklace.\n\nHer $9,900 off-the-shoulder gown from Schiaparelli featured a floor-length skirt, all-over ruching, and a keyhole-shaped cutout down its bodice.\n\nShe wore it with dangling earrings and thick gold arm cuffs. The rapper's hair was styled in a sleek, straight look with bangs.\n\nPete Hegseth wore an ocean-blue suit with a white button-up shirt, a polka-dot tie, and brown leather dress shoes.\n\nHis wife, Jennifer, however, took a more glitzy approach. She wore a sequin-covered pantsuit with short sleeves, a V-neckline, and a black belt.\n\nShe wore the purple-and-blue ensemble with black heels and a matching clutch.\n\nThe current Secretary of Education was photographed at the movie premiere wearing a blue knee-length dress beneath a faux-fur white coat.\n\nShe also sported a silver necklace, diamond earrings, and navy loafers.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) criticized Vice President Vance Thursday morning, calling comments he made about the other senator from Illinois, Tammy Duckworth (D), “low.”\n\n“I have learned over many years in office that politics ain’t beanbag. But JD Vance’s attack and insult of my colleague, Tammy Duckworth, is low and beneath the dignity of a Vice President,” Durbin said in a post on social platform X.\n\n“Senator Duckworth has never backed away from a fight, even with a Vice President. She has fought for and won a seat in the Senate where she fights for veterans, those with disabilities, and the people of our state,” Durbin added, lauding his fellow Prairie State senator.\n\n“J.D. Vance should focus on repairing the chaos his President has created, not on a Senator who has earned the respect of the Senate for her courage and effectiveness.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Duckworth slammed Vance after the vice president bashed her line of questioning at a Senate hearing. He compared her to the fictional character Forrest Gump, who was portrayed as having a physical and intellectual disability.\n\n“Forrest Gump ran toward danger in Vietnam. Your boss ran to his podiatrist crying bone spurs,” Duckworth wrote on X, noting President Trump’s medical draft deferments.\n\n“Petty insults at the expense of people with disabilities won’t change the fact that you’re risking troops’ lives to boost Chevron’s stock price,” she added. “It’s my job to hold you accountable.”\n\nVance had posted earlier on X, “Watching Tammy Duckworth obsessively interrupt Marco Rubio during this hearing is like watching Forest Gump argue with Isaac Newton.”\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Vance’s office for comment.",

    "fullText": "Under Donald Trump, the White House has filled its social media with memes, wishcasting, nostalgia and deepfakes. Here’s what you need to know to navigate the trolling\n\nIt started with an image of Trump as a king mocked up on a fake Time magazine cover. Since then it’s developed into a full-blown phenomenon, one academics are calling “slopaganda” – an unholy alliance of easily available AI tools and political messaging. “Shitposting”, the publishing of deliberately crude, offensive content online to provoke a reaction, has reached the level of “institutional shitposting”, according to Know Your Meme’s editor Don Caldwell. This is trolling as official government communication. And nobody is more skilled at it than the Trump administration – a government that has not only allowed the AI industry all the regulative freedom it desires, but has embraced the technology for its own in-house purposes. Here are 10 of the most significant fake images the White House has put out so far.\n\nThe first AI image posted by the White House X account sets the tone for Trump’s second presidency – marking a turning point in which the shitposting that had been associated with the far-right online culture that brought Trump to power moved from fringe message boards, such as 4chan and Reddit, to mainstream platforms.\n\nThe image was posted alongside an announcement of the repeal of New York City’s congestion pricing, and leant into fears that Trump would govern as a king. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, held up the image at a press conference when she announced that she would defy attempts to block the congestion charge: “New York hasn’t laboured under a king in over 250 years. We sure as hell are not going to start now.” The congestion charge remains in effect.\n\nIn another post on Truth Social in October, the president posted an AI video depicting himself as a president-king, crown on head, flying over “No Kings” protesters in a jet fighter and dumping faeces on them. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, defended the post, saying: “The president uses social media to make a point. You can argue that he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that. He is using satire to make a point.”\n\nOpenAI’s Studio Ghibli-inspired meme generator became a sensation in March 2025, with its uncanny ability to translate any image into the beloved anime studio’s house style (without Studio Ghibli’s permission or approval).\n\nThe White House applied it to a woman in tears as she was arrested by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents before being deported. The original photograph, and the woman’s name and alleged crimes, are also included in the post.\n\nFor Caldwell, this demonstrated just how up to date the White House is with online trends. “They’re hopping on brand-new, fresh memes,” he says. He suspects White House staffers might be regular visitors to Know Your Meme. “The Studio Ghibli meme trend kicked off on March 25 on X; we covered it the following day; and then the White House covered it the day after that.”\n\nThis image is proof of Trump’s willingness and ability to insert himself into any conversation, even ones that have nothing to do with him, and shows how effective that can be.\n\nPredictably, the image went viral, made global headlines and was met with outrage from Catholic groups and politicians. “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,” wrote the New York State Catholic Conference. “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.”\n\nAs so often happens with such shitposting, those who ​took offence were accused of lacking a sense of humour. “They can’t take a joke?” Trump said soon after at a press conference. “You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media … the Catholics loved it.”\n\nTrump has been the subject of flattering fan art throughout his political career (remember the digital Trump trading cards?), but AI has made the job a whole lot easier. On 4 May, the White House crashed Star Wars fans’ special day with this image of the president as a jacked Jedi, lightsaber in hand, garlanded by flags and eagles. Who cares if his lightsaber is the wrong colour (the good guys’ are blue), or that the White House’s claim to be the Rebellion not the Empire rang laughably hollow? This was pure fantasy art.\n\nIn 2022, one of Trump’s trading cards clumsily grafted his headshot on to a superhero body; last July he was slightly less clumsily grafted on to the body of Superman, to gatecrash the launch of the new movie. The same month, the White House portrayed a besuited Trump heroically striding into the Colosseum. Fans and allies have generated reams of similar content themselves.\n\nWhy did the White House choose to put the Democratic house leader Hakeem Jeffries and the senate leader Chuck Schumer in sombreros and have them holding plates of tacos? It doesn’t matter. They look a bit silly, and it’s provocatively offensive, and once again, the world’s attention is colonised.\n\nThe image illustrates how difficult it is to respond to this type of content. It’s part of a running joke, stretching back to a deepfake video Trump posted a month earlier, which slapped a crude sombrero and moustache filter over Jeffries. That video was roundly condemned as offensive and racist , not least by Jeffries himself (who replied by posting a genuine image of Trump with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein) . The Trump administration then doubled down, playing the video on a loop on screens in the White House briefing room for several hours and creating more images in a similar vein, which kept the trolling going.\n\nFew people outside the Trump administration believe the US is in a “golden age”, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating the claim. In January, the White House posted an AI video of a golden White House facade behind a shower of gold coins with the text “The White House? She’s in her Golden Age”, backed by Bruno Mars’ track 24K Magic.\n\nEven if Trump’s Midas touch is more a figment of his imagination, this type of wishcasting is more effective than it appears. According to one paper by the academics Michał Klincewicz, Mark Alfano and Amir Ebrahimi Fard – who coined the term “slopaganda” – “neural representations of information that were shown to be false continue to influence people’s beliefs and reasoning after being corrected”. In other words, even when you know it’s fake, your brain still kind of believes it.\n\nOn the face of it, this seems like a straightforward “Trump wants Greenland” post. However, it has a much darker message.\n\nAgain, the post is riffing on a popular meme, Caldwell explains: the “dramatic crossroads” image originated with the manga series Yu-Gi-Oh!, and started gaining traction online around 2021.\n\nThe slogan “Which way, Greenland man?” seems to reference a 1978 neo-Nazi text titled Which Way, Western Man?, in which the white supremacist author William Gayley Simpson called for violence against and the deportation of Jews and Black people, and argued that Hitler was right.\n\n“It’s absolutely shocking to see such images being deployed by this administration,” said Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, which monitors US neo-Nazi groups. “The idea appeals to racists and white supremacists who think only white people should be in positions of power.”\n\nIn August, the Department of Homeland Security posted a mock recruitment advert for ICE with an image of Uncle Sam at a crossroads and the slogan: “Which way, American man?” Earlier this month, the US Labor Department posted an image with the slogan: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage”. Critics pointed out that it had overtones of Hitler’s “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer” (“One people, one realm, one leader”).\n\n“AI is very good at constantly reiterating images from the past, so it can create this nostalgic imagery of traditionalism,” says Daniel de Zeeuw, an assistant professor in digital media culture at the University of Amsterdam. Thus the extremist messages of the present – such as ICE’s militarised policing – can be inserted into more reassuring and familiar graphic styles, such as patriotic recruitment posters, 80s action-movie posters or 1950s public information campaigns (as with a recent image of Trump as a friendly milkman).\n\nAI is inherently backward-looking, says de Zeeuw, as it is fed on historical images. This aesthetic is in keeping with the Make America Great Again movement, which is constantly evoking a “better” past. Another stark example was the Department of Homeland Security’s chilling post from last December: an image of a vintage car at a deserted, palm-fringed beach with the slogan “America After 100 Million Deportations”. Ironically, the original was painted by a Japanese artist, Hiroshi Nagai, who complained that it had been used without his permission.\n\n“It’s not going to be on Twitter,” said the agent filming the Minneapolis civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, one of the city’s most prominent activists, as she was arrested last Thursday. Within hours, though, it was: the Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem posted a still from the video, in which Armstrong seems composed and shows little emotion.\n\nHalf an hour later, the White House X account posted a significantly altered version of the same image: this time, Armstrong is exaggeratedly upset, tears streaming down her face. Her skin tone also appears to have been darkened. The image was captioned: “Arrested: far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.” In fact, Armstrong was demonstrating at a church service led by an allegedly ICE-affiliated pastor, and was later released without charge.\n\nUntil this moment, the White House’s AI-generated output had been conspicuously outlandish: there was little danger of mistaking it for reality. This image purports to be an authentic photograph – or at least omits to mention that it is not. It is not so much AI-generated trolling as an AI-assisted deepfake.\n\nAs with Musk’s recently shared Grok tool, which removed women and children’s clothing without their consent, there is also something abusive about it: AI has been used to attempt to humiliate a woman by manipulating her image, to make her look weaker and more distressed than she actually was.\n\nThe fact that the deepfakery is not all that convincing is part of the point, de Zeeuw thinks. “What is being communicated here is the falsification itself: you’re showing your ability to falsify images, to falsify evidence.”\n\nAfter the fakery had been called out, the White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr posted the response: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”\n\nIn response to this image of Trump and a penguin walking towards a Greenland flag, some observers pointed out that penguins actually live at the south pole. But that’s missing the point of these types of post, says Robert Topinka, a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London. “People continue to interpret them as if they’re meant to be a legitimate claim, or an argument or a piece of evidence, but they’re emotional hooks.” Their purpose is to stir up the base. “White House staffers have said they use AI because it’s the fastest way to get content out. It’s not the fastest way to say something that’s true; it’s the fastest way to push their propaganda.”\n\nTo those in the know, this is a riff on the “nihilist penguin” meme, which has gone viral on TikTok in the past few weeks. It’s based on a scene from Werner Herzog’s 2007 documentary Encounters at the End of the World, in which one penguin inexplicably separates from the colony and wanders off towards the Antarctic interior, and certain death. “But why?” Herzog wonders. Many have asked the same of Trump’s quixotic attempts to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe image resonates with what Naomi Klein and ​Astra Taylor ​christened “end times fascism”, says De Zeeuw, where tech industry leaders and their enablers are almost willing the end of the world as we know it, striding towards oblivion like Trump and his penguin companion. “It’s like they know they’re moving toward the end, but they do so joyfully.”",

    "description": "Amid political pressures, Jerome Powell announced the Fed will hold rates steady.",
    "fullText": "The first Federal Reserve meeting of 2026 is in the books, and Chair Jerome Powell stayed tight-lipped on the central bank's biggest controversies.\n\nFrom the job market to political tensions, here are Business Insider's biggest takeaways from the January call to hold rates steady.\n\nThe Fed appeared more optimistic about the economic picture on Wednesday. While recent Fed press releases after interest rate decisions included a warning of \"downside risks to the labor market,\" that comment was removed in January's release.\n\nPowell said that the central bank's dual mandate — stable prices and maximum employment — is becoming more balanced than it was for much of last year. The unemployment rate is relatively low with minimal changes, even as labor market demand and hiring remain stagnant. He added that consumer spending has remained \"resilient\" and inflation rates are in a solid position, aside from tariff impact.\n\nAs for AI, Powell speculated that new technology is likely to have a positive effect on both companies and their employees.\n\n\"Every technological wave will eliminate some jobs and create other jobs,\" he said. \"It's always been the case. If you look back, wave after wave after wave, there will be some disruption. But ultimately, technology increases productivity, which is the basis for rising wages. It may not all happen immediately, but over time, it's what enables incomes to rise.\"\n\nThe central bank has long been known for making uniform policy decisions, but the current FOMC has seen split votes in every meeting since July.\n\nThere were two dissenters in the January 28 meeting — Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller hoped for a quarter-point rate cut. This is down from three dissents in the December meeting, which was the most since September 2019.\n\nPowell said there was \"broad support\" on the FOMC for holding today, including among non-voters, although \"there are different views on the committee\" over which side of the dual mandate takes priority when data is ambiguous.\n\nThe chair did not say whether the Fed plans to cut rates next month — or whether that move would be supported within the FOMC. \"Policy is not a preset course,\" he said. \"We make decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis.\"\n\nThe Fed has been in the news more than usual lately, as the Trump administration continues to put pressure on central bank leadership. The president has been vocal about his desire for bigger, faster rate cuts. And, with Powell's term as chair ending in May, Trump will be able to choose his successor.\n\nPowell did not comment on any of the Fed chair frontrunners or provide further detail on the ongoing Department of Justice probe over construction at the bank's Washington, DC, buildings. He also dodged a question about Governor Lisa Cook's mortgage fraud case, which was heard by the Supreme Court last week. However, Powell emphasized the importance of Fed independence. It's \"hard to restore the credibility of the institution\" if the neutrality from political independence is lost, he said.\n\nThe Fed chair did have a piece of advice for his successor.\n\n\"Stay out of elected politics,\" he said. \"Don't get pulled into elected politics. Don't do it.\"",

    "description": "Bari Weiss was grilled by CBS News staffers in an all-hands meeting and said she's not \"a mouthpiece for anybody\" when asked about political bias.",
    "fullText": "CBS News employees put top editor Bari Weiss in the hot seat during an all-hands meeting on Tuesday, asking about her vision and standards for the nearly century-old broadcast network.\n\nThe first question in the Q&A part of her town hall asked how she would respond to criticism that CBS News is turning into \"a right-wing network\" under her leadership.\n\n\"I'm here to do one thing. It's not to be a mouthpiece for anybody. It's simply to be a mouthpiece for fairness and the pursuit of truth,\" Weiss said at the all-hands meeting, according to a recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nWeiss, who became the editor in chief of CBS News in October after Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison bought her opinion site The Free Press, asked staffers to examine the coverage since her appointment.\n\n\"There's a lot of noise out there, but I would just urge anyone who suggests that to look at our work and judge for yourself,\" she said.\n\nWeiss was then asked how the network's news-gathering standards had changed since she took over.\n\n\"I don't think our standards have changed,\" she said, adding that the network was \"in very capable hands\" regarding editorial standards.\n\nWeiss caused a stir in December for a late-hour decision to delay a \"60 Minutes\" segment about the Trump administration deporting migrants to the CECOT prison in El Salvador. Critics questioned her commitment to hard-hitting journalism and wondered whether Paramount leadership was influencing editorial decisions at CBS News — a notion that Weiss strongly denied on Tuesday.\n\n\"I want to just say this as plainly and clearly as possible. I was not pressured by David Ellison or anyone else,\" Weiss said during the town hall. Weiss acknowledged that it was bad timing to delay the segment after commercials promoting it had already aired.\n\n\"I didn't know the screening schedule for every single thing, that specific logistical nightmare,\" she said. \"That's never going to happen again. So please rest assured that nothing of that kind is ever going to happen again. You have my promise.\"\n\nThat said, she added that \"asking \n\n\"I felt it was important to do our best to try and get a voice from the administration, and I'm always going to be pushing for that,\" Weiss said.\n\nWeiss had little experience in traditional TV before joining CBS News. Instead, she became known in 2020 for her dramatic exit from The New York Times, during which she alleged anti-conservative bias. Her next move, starting The Free Press, turned out to be lucrative when Ellison bought it for $150 million in October.\n\n\"Loving America is not about jingoism. It's not about blind patriotism,\" Weiss told employees. \"It's about vociferous defense of the principles and values that have made this country exceptional and that allow us to do the work that we do. And so anyone that disagrees with that, I'd love to have a conversation with you.\"\n\nWhen asked whether \"CBS Mornings\" would undergo another shake-up, Weiss noted that it had already undergone a major change, with longtime anchor Tony Dokoupil moving to the evening show.\n\n\"Speculation about Gayle King seems to be a favorite parlor game of a lot of newspapers and people in this building, and I just want everyone here to know that she's absolutely beloved and see her long into the future here at CBS,\" Weiss said.\n\nIn prepared remarks, Weiss said that CBS News needed to \"shift to a streaming mentality immediately\" and that if the broadcast network stuck mainly to its linear TV strategy, \"we're toast.\"\n\nWhen asked about staffing or potential layoffs at CBS News, Weiss said that she couldn't make any promises amid a \"tsunami of technological change.\"\n\n\"I can't stand up here and tell you that in a moment of incredible transformation that that's not going to mean transformation of our workforce,\" Weiss said. She added that CBS News is \"also hiring people to suit that.\"\n\nWeiss said that if she didn't believe digital revenue could eventually replace linear TV revenue, she \"wouldn't be standing here.\" She said that linear TV wouldn't go away, but that revenue would \"decline sharply, as will the audience.\"\n\n\"What winning looks like writ large for this company is building incredible journalism for audiences that are so much bigger than the one that we currently have and are maintaining on linear,\" Weiss said. \"That's what winning looks like. It's really simple.\"\n\nHave a tip or thoughts on Bari Weiss' strategy for CBS News? Contact this reporter via email at jfaris@businessinsider.com or Signal at @jamesfaris.01.

    "title": "Speak in code, delete the chats: The tactics Venezuelans are using out of fear",
    "description": "Venezuelans are circumventing the government’s expanded crackdown on dissent by speaking in code, not mentioning political leaders, constantly deleting content from their phones and refusing to express opinions in WhatsApp groups.",
    "fullText": "“Delete your conversations before going out.”\n\nThese recent WhatsApp messages of a Venezuelan family – who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals – underscore the caution civilians are taking in their daily conversations, on social media and in text messages as the government expands its crackdown on dissenting speech.\n\nReports of authorities searching civilians’ phones for political content critical of the government have increased since officials declared a state of emergency in response to the US attack in Caracas, which led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAuthorities have set up more checkpoints along the streets of the capital and other parts of the country, claiming they’re necessary to reinforce national security amid political tension. Some are stationary, usually near security zones or public institutions, but others are mobile. Officers stop drivers, ask where they are going, search the vehicles, and often go through their cell phones.\n\nAlthough phone searches are nothing new, testimonies gathered by CNN show that these measures have increased since the government’s emergency decree after the January 3 US attack.\n\nThe decree enables authorities to adopt extraordinary measures, but it does not detail the scope, the criteria, or whether it limits the rights and freedoms of citizens such as the protection of privacy in communications.\n\nOn the other hand, article 48 of Venezuela’s constitution explicitly states: “The secrecy and inviolability of private communications in all their forms is guaranteed. They may not be interfered with except by order of a competent court, in accordance with legal provisions, and preserving the secrecy of any private matters not related to the corresponding legal process.”\n\nNevertheless, CNN has spoken with several Venezuelans who have had their phones searched in recent weeks. Because of this, many speak in code, avoid mentioning political leaders, constantly delete content from their phones and refuse to express opinions in WhatsApp groups.\n\nSince Maduro’s capture by the US, daily life for ordinary Venezuelans has become full of uncertainty.\n\nExactly who is in charge of the country is unclear. While US President Donald Trump has claimed to be “running” Venezuela, Maduro’s former deputy – the now acting president Delcy Rodríguez – has pushed back, saying on Sunday that she’d had “enough” of US orders.\n\nStill, there is no sign yet that she plans an election that would legitimize her rule. Meanwhile, the economy remains in crisis and the prices of basic products fluctuate daily.\n\nThe one thing that is certain, for anybody who might be perceived as a critic of the government, is the need to take precautions when going out in the street.\n\n“This afternoon we received a statement from the neighborhood community council, and they recommended we be careful with what we say on WhatsApp and in writing,” reads one of the group messages seen by CNN.\n\nAnother message is from a family member who is outside the country and mentions their desire to go to Venezuela. A relative responds that it is better not to because “right now things are complicated.”\n\nIn response to the insistence of another family member who says they will travel anyway, they suggest deleting social media accounts and creating a new Google account. According to what CNN was able to verify, cell phones of people entering the country are also checked when they arrive at the airport.\n\nAt the request of their loved ones, families in other countries have told CNN that they, too, avoid political conversations and use code words on their phones to communicate with relatives in Venezuela.\n\nEven before Maduro’s fall, routine checkpoints could become nightmares for civilians.\n\nThis is what a cook experienced in April of last year. The cook, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said that when he left his house on his way to work that day, an agent of the SEBIN intelligence service forced him to stop just after a bridge in western Caracas. They did not ask for papers or his ID card.\n\nThe first question was about his job. “Head chef,” he answered. The second question went straight to politics. “Are you a guarimbero?,” they asked, using a term the government coined to pejoratively refer to anti-government protesters. He replied that he was a cook and insisted that he worked as a head chef.\n\nHe even told the agent that he had recently become a father and just wanted to go to work and get home soon to see his newborn daughter. But instead of letting him go, they told him that they would check his car and cell phone.\n\nAfter authorities asked him to unlock his phone, they typed keywords in the chat search such as guarimba – or street protest – and names like Diosdado Cabello (Venezuela’s interior minister) and Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe cook told CNN that several of his friends had gone through similar situations, so he made a habit of reading and deleting any political content, although somewhere in his photo gallery he kept a picture with the opposition leader María Corina Machado. When they typed Maduro in the WhatsApp search, only recipes with plantains or ripe tomatoes appeared (maduro means ripe in English). And in the photo gallery, they only found pictures of dishes and his daughter.\n\nThe thorough search lasted about an hour “between intimidating messages and the same suspicious questions,” he recalls. During the vehicle inspection, one of the officers showed an interest in a motorcycle accessory he had in his truck. “Keep it. I don’t even have a motorcycle anymore,” the cook said, trying to end the situation with a gesture. Immediately after that, they gave him the signal to go on his way.\n\nAs he took off, he looked in the rearview mirror and saw other cars lined up waiting to be searched. Still, with a mix of fear and resignation, he drove away.\n\nThe experience affected him to the point that he now avoids political conversations entirely. Today, he says that if he receives a message on that topic, he asks to change the subject, deletes the texts and immediately empties the chat. He avoids going out alone, especially at night, because he says the number of checkpoints has increased. He also believes having tattoos draws more attention from officers. He says he has already been searched three times in less than six months.\n\nA journalist experienced a similar situation in December. In broad daylight and after sharing a coffee with colleagues, the journalist, who prefers not to be identified for fear of reprisals, was traveling down the Country Club route heading to El Bosque, in eastern Caracas, when he came across a police checkpoint that was stopping all the cars passing through the area, he said. This is the route the reporter usually takes when using “green paths,” or alternative ways to avoid traffic.\n\nThe procedure began with the usual requests: papers, ID and driver’s license. But then, they focused their attention on his wallet, he says. He recounts that when he opened it, a small, folded paper fell out, and he immediately felt the atmosphere change. The officers argued that they suspected he possessed marijuana, so they decided to do a more thorough inspection.\n\nThe tension increased. The officer asked for his phone and began to check it, also looking for keywords in his chats, traces of drug use, or anything that could implicate wrongdoing. The journalist says he did not have marijuana or any other drug in the car.\n\nFortunately, he says, the officers did not identify his profession and in their search did not include politically charged words that could have exposed conversations with his bosses, sources or colleagues. But he felt that fear throughout the search, which lasted almost an hour, leaving him extremely nervous and desperate to get out of the situation as soon as possible. He knew the episode was over when he heard the phrase: “Well, whatever you want to contribute.” He handed over a $50 bill from his wallet before continuing home.\n\nThe episode still affects his daily decisions. He has left several WhatsApp groups and frequently deletes content from his phone. He now avoids going out at night and limits his outings even during the day, leaving the house only when necessary.\n\nBoth men say they were surprised by the checkpoint, but not by the situation, given how increasingly frequent these measures have become.\n\nMany civilians have taken to social media to report phone inspections, which sometimes lead to intimidation, extortion and even detention. Many claims are made by men, who say authorities often demand payments in exchange for allowing drivers to continue. Security forces also search women, even in the presence of children. All testimonies agree that agents are looking for political content, especially for terms such as “invasion” or “Trump” and “Maduro.” But during the searches, personal and even intimate content has also been exposed, leading to complaints that the practice violates constitutional protections of private life.\n\nCNN has reached out to the interior ministry, which oversees most of these checkpoints, but has not yet received a response.\n\nWhen asked about the issue by a journalist, Maracaibo Mayor Giancarlo Di Martino said on January 17 that cellphone inspections were “completely prohibited, so any officer who abuses their authority must be reported.”\n\nSome people are not clear about their individual rights, including the right to privacy. Others know them, but fear being detained if they try to exercise them.\n\nThe non-governmental organization Espacio Público has shared recommendations on social media for those who encounter inspections: ask the officer to show necessary court orders that would allow a search, take note of the agent’s name and the entity they belong to in case there is no court order, and – if possible – try to have at least two witnesses and keep phone data encrypted, among other things.",

    "fullText": "The deadly shootings by ICE agents in Minnesota are driving some CEOs to publicly wade into politics again. It's a break from a corporate retreat fueled by fears of irking President Donald Trump, investors, consumers and others.\n\nTheir remarks in recent days range from expressions of grave concern and grief to blunt criticism.\n\nMore than 60 heads of large companies based in the Minneapolis area, including UnitedHealth, 3M, and General Mills, called for \"deescalation of tensions\" in an open letter that didn't mention Trump, ICE, or the shooting victims, Alex Pretti and Renee Good, by name.\n\nTarget's incoming CEO, who starts next week, sent a video message to staff in which he described the violence and loss of life in the local community as \"incredibly painful;\" he did not mention Trump or ICE directly.\n\nOthers have been more blunt. Big names in tech and venture capital, as well as small business owners around the country, have expressed outrage at the Trump administration and ICE on their own social media pages, using words like \"murderer,\" \"shameful,\" and \"a conscious-less administration.\"\n\nJeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, said \"CEOs are feeling the community pressure.\"\n\nHe said that reactions that convey sorrow and don't mention Trump or ICE are likely to be perceived as an unwelcome challenge to the White House's immigration agenda. \"That is not what the Trump administration wanted,\" he said.\n\nA White House spokesperson referred Business Insider to press secretary Karoline Leavitt's remarks on X from a briefing on Monday, in which she said \"nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets.\"\n\nLeavitt also said the shooting of a US citizen in Minneapolis over the weekend was a tragedy that occurred \"as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota.\"\n\nSome CEOs who voiced dissent in the past have faced blowback.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump said he was \"inclined\" to block ExxonMobil from operating in Venezuela after the company's CEO, Darren Woods, told him the country was not ready for investment.\n\nTrump ally Elon Musk faced the president's ire after the tech leader maligned the president's spending bill in June. Trump responded by threatening to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies.\n\n\"It's probably still best for companies and CEOs to play it safe,\" said Michael Serazio, a communications professor at Boston College. \"Trump can use all the levers of government, whether it be Department of Justice investigating your company, or some kind of tariff-based targeting of something that your company does.\"\n\nSome CEOs have decided it's worth speaking up anyway.\n\nRobert Pasin, CEO of toy company Radio Flyer, recently shared an email on LinkedIn that he sent to his employees that was critical of the shootings in Minneapolis.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the current state of our democracy, and the continued actions we are seeing from President Trump and his administration that are intended to undermine democratic institutions, the rule of law, and the norms that hold our country together,\" he wrote.\n\nThe response from staff at Chicago-based Radio Flyer was \"overwhelmingly positive,\" Pasin told Business Insider.\n\nDuring Trump's first term as president, CEOs talked about politics more freely, most notably after the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in 2020, and again after the January 6 riots.\n\n\"You previously had corporations embracing a much more, quote, woke positioning,\" said Serazio.\n\nIn recent years, some major CEOs have had a change of heart, going from Trump critic to Trump supporter. \"It became a competition of who can suck up to him the most,\" said Serazio.\n\nAny public statement from a CEO carries the risk of alienating customers and shareholders. But some see taking a stand as necessary at times like this.\n\nLloyd Vogel, CEO of the outdoor retailer Garage Grown Gear, said he felt compelled to condemn the shootings in a LinkedIn post because he lives and works in the Twin Cities.\n\n\"My primary rationale was to show solidarity with my community,\" he told Business Insider. \"It's also just bad for business when people are afraid to leave their homes.\"\n\nVogel described being so forthcoming on social media as nerve-racking, \"especially in such a charged environment.\" But he added that doing so was one of the few levers he could pull.\n\n\"There's so much fear in Minnesota right now,\" he said. \"It would just be cowardice to not have a perspective on this.\"\n\nJeff Berman, CEO of the US media company WaitWhat, also posted critical remarks on LinkedIn about the Trump administration's crackdown. He wishes more US leaders would do the same, especially those who helm big companies, since they are more likely to draw widespread attention.\n\nWhat's holding most back, Berman said, is a narrow calculus focused on short-term shareholder pressure and fears of retaliation by Trump. Instead, he said CEOs should consider the long-term risks to all stakeholders — and to democracy itself.\n\n\"They stay quiet at their own peril,\" said Berman. \"We know what happens in countries that follow this trajectory.\"",

    "fullText": "Guardian found OpenAI’s platform cited Grokipedia on topics including Iran and Holocaust deniers\n\nThe latest model of ChatGPT has begun to cite Elon Musk’s Grokipedia as a source on a wide range of queries, including on Iranian conglomerates and Holocaust deniers, raising concerns about misinformation on the platform.\n\nIn tests done by the Guardian, GPT-5.2 cited Grokipedia nine times in response to more than a dozen different questions. These included queries on political structures in Iran, such as salaries of the Basij paramilitary force and the ownership of the Mostazafan Foundation, and questions on the biography of Sir Richard Evans, a British historian and expert witness against Holocaust denier David Irving in his libel trial.\n\nGrokipedia, launched in October, is an AI-generated online encyclopedia that aims to compete with Wikipedia, and which has been criticised for propagating rightwing narratives on topics including gay marriage and the 6 January insurrection in the US. Unlike Wikipedia, it does not allow direct human editing, instead an AI model writes content and responds to requests for changes.\n\nChatGPT did not cite Grokipedia when prompted directly to repeat misinformation about the insurrection, about media bias against Donald Trump, or about the HIV/Aids epidemic – areas where Grokipedia has been widely reported to promote falsehoods. Instead, Grokipedia’s information filtered into the model’s responses when it was prompted about more obscure topics.\n\nFor instance, ChatGPT, citing Grokipedia, repeated stronger claims about the Iranian government’s links to MTN-Irancell than are found on Wikipedia – such as asserting that the company has links to the office of Iran’s supreme leader.\n\nChatGPT also cited Grokipedia when repeating information that the Guardian has debunked, namely details about Sir Richard Evans’ work as an expert witness in David Irving’s trial.\n\nGPT-5.2 is not the only large language model (LLM) that appears to be citing Grokipedia; anecdotally, Anthropic’s Claude has also referenced Musk’s encyclopedia on topics from petroleum production to Scottish ales.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the model’s web search “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints”.\n\n“We apply safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms, and ChatGPT clearly shows which sources informed a response through citations,” they said, adding that they had ongoing programs to filter out low-credibility information and influence campaigns.\n\nAnthropic did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut the fact that Grokipedia’s information is filtering – at times very subtly – into LLM responses is a concern for disinformation researchers. Last spring, security experts raised concerns that malign actors, including Russian propaganda networks, were churning out massive volumes of disinformation in an effort to seed AI models with lies, a process called “LLM grooming”.\n\nIn June, concerns were raised in the US Congress that Google’s Gemini repeated the Chinese government’s position on human rights abuses in Xinjiang and China’s Covid-19 policies.\n\nNina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who has worked on LLM grooming, said ChatGPT’s citing Grokipedia raised similar concerns. While Musk may not have intended to influence LLMs, Grokipedia entries she and colleagues had reviewed were “relying on sources that are untrustworthy at best, poorly sourced and deliberate disinformation at worst”, she said.\n\nAnd the fact that LLMs cite sources such as Grokipedia or the Pravda network may, in turn, improve these sources’ credibility in the eyes of readers. “They might say, ‘oh, ChatGPT is citing it, these models are citing it, it must be a decent source, surely they’ve vetted it’ – and they might go there and look for news about Ukraine,” said Jankowicz.\n\nBad information, once it has filtered into an AI chatbot, can be challenging to remove. Jankowicz recently found that a large news outlet had included a made-up quote from her in a story about disinformation. She wrote to the news outlet asking for the quote to be removed, and posted about the incident on social media.\n\nThe news outlet removed the quote. However, AI models for some time continued to cite it as hers. “Most people won’t do the work necessary to figure out where the truth actually lies,” she said.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for xAI, the owner of Grokipedia, said: “Legacy media lies.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose 100% tariffs on all Canadian goods and products exported to the US should Ottawa make a trade deal with China.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whom he called \"Governor Carney,\" against making a \"drop off\" deal with Beijing or face the levies.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,\" he added.\n\nCarney made an official visit to China last week — the first by a Canadian leader since 2017 — meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss economic and trade opportunities between the two countries.\n\nIn a joint statement following the meeting, Ottawa and Beijing said they had committed to expanding bilateral trade and investment, as well as building cooperation in areas such as energy and agriculture.\n\nCarney also announced that Canada would now allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market on the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In return, he said Canada expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by March 1.\n\nTrump had initially said that the deal was what Carney \"should be doing\" and that it was \"a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.\"\n\nTrump's changing tone comes days after Carney delivered an impassioned speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he opined on the changing face of global politics since Trump's election.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney, who did not explicitly name Trump, said, adding that \"middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.\"\n\nTrump did not miss the opportunity to snap back at Carney during his own speech at Davos, saying the prime minister \"wasn't so grateful.\"\n\n\"Canada lives because of the United States.

    "description": "Mass demonstrations can be worthwhile. But they also may be substituting for more useful forms of political participation.",
    "fullText": "Siddhu Pachipala is a student at MIT.\n\nOn the last day of a seminar I took at Harvard called The Success and Failure of Protest Movements, the professor circled the room with a final question: Should we protest?\n\nIn a class of roughly 50 students, every hand shot up almost instantly. My classmates argued that when the Trump administration pushes constitutional boundaries, resistance — marching, chanting, “speaking truth to power” — is what good citizenship looks like. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s name came up more than once, shorthand for the moral clarity of the moment. The instinctive speed and unanimity of the reaction left me uneasy.\n\nProtest has become the reflexive form of political participation on college campuses in recent years. Having led some chants and carried a few signs myself, I know the thrill: of standing against the Establishment, of being too loud and too numerous to ignore, of politics at its most immediate and emotionally legible. So my discomfort in class was not founded in an objection to protest as such. It came from a growing awareness that our peculiar understanding of protest on campus has made it both less effective and more likely to crowd out other forms of political participation that may be better suited for our moment.\n\nConsider the most prominent protest movements of past decades — Occupy Wall Street, March for Our Lives, Black Lives Matter, the wave of campus protests over Gaza — and a pattern emerges: extraordinary attention paired with limited legislative returns. Judge these protests’ precise aims however you’d like, but note that their scale, often in the millions, did not reliably cash out politically.\n\nDefenders of protest respond by broadening the definition of success. My classmates emphasized protest’s expressive value, how it affirms dignity, agency, and moral identity. Protests succeed, in this telling, not necessarily by changing policy but by helping people find their voices.\n\nIt is perfectly understandable to want to protest in the face of injustice; we bear a constitutional right to peaceable assembly for a reason. The expressive experience of a protest is an important form of solidarity; it can channel our spirited indignation in a way that isn’t revolutionary but reformist; and, even if it does not persuade, it can at least raise the salience of an issue for decision makers and the public.\n\nBut expression is not, in itself, a political achievement. Politics turns on assembling large and lasting majorities capable of exercising power. So protest earns its keep not when it feels morally bracing inside but when it builds those majorities and translates urgency into change outside. We must maintain a careful distinction between what feels powerful and what actually is powerful, especially because protest has a way of being so emotionally captivating that marching in a demonstration can make us feel like we’ve been excellent citizens — that we’ve fulfilled our “civic engagement” quota — when we haven’t done the thing we intended.\n\nKing understood this distinction. His uncommon genius was to subject his movement’s righteous anger to the strategic discipline democratic politics demands: message control, organizational hierarchy, tactical self-restraint. King sidelined factions that could threaten legitimacy or alienate an uncommitted middle. Protest was never the end goal of the civil rights movement. It was one tool among many, subordinated to the larger project of persuading the country.\n\nCampus protest culture forgets that lesson. It is allergic to structure; leadership and strategy are signs of inauthenticity. Any effort to persuade skeptics is unacceptable “both-sides-ism,” and any pitch to distance from radical elements is disloyalty. Expression becomes the goal rather than the means.\n\nThe problem, though, is more than tactical. Protest depends on civic conditions it cannot generate on its own. A protest that successfully persuades presupposes a political culture in which opponents recognize one another as legitimate participants — that those people marching over there are not unlike me, that they may be owed a hearing. This assumption is increasingly untenable. More and more, Americans don’t just see their ideological opponents as mistaken; the other side is assumed to be dangerously corrupt or acting in bad faith. Under these conditions, it is unclear who, exactly, contemporary campus protests are meant to persuade. Donald Trump and his followers are unlikely to be moved because students in Cambridge disapprove of his administration.\n\nIf protest is to matter, the civic foundations that make persuasion possible have to be rebuilt. That means that at least for now, we must devote less energy to expression directed at distant national actors and more to the slower, less glamorous work of conversation closer to home, which is far more likely to change how people actually vote and govern. Protest and conversation are, of course, not mutually exclusive; my ask is that we remember what each can actually achieve.\n\nI know how daunting this can seem. I grew up in a county in Texas that votes Republican by 15 points. Politics there looks nothing like it does on campus. But I also see how quickly caricatures dissolve and people open up when disagreement moves to conversation in church basements and around kitchen tables. It is difficult to hate someone once you are forced to take their reasons seriously and to defend your own in return.\n\nThat kind of engagement is, in a way, more demanding than protest. Protest is not dialectical; it draws on and inflames our passions, but it does not require confronting the strongest version of an opposing argument with our reason like conversation does. Protest may exercise some liberal virtues — a sensitivity to suffering, the courage to stand in public on behalf of some conception of the common good — but those virtues are woefully incomplete without those developed in conversation: the practical wisdom in weighing tradeoffs, the self-command in listening rather than dominating.\n\nThat protest is the default civic posture on campus reflects how young people understand disagreement at a more fundamental level. If political opponents are not just wrong but unreasonable, if conversation is ultimately futile, then it is prudent for politics to become a series of mass displays meant to overwhelm and little else. Yet democracy can only survive on the belief that our opponents are not so alien from us and that persuasion, however difficult, remains possible.\n\nYoung liberals, in particular, should be cautious. Trump’s rise was fueled in part by the perception that liberal elites advanced unpopular policy agendas without seriously considering dissenting arguments. Because liberals protest more than any other political group, every additional protest that isn’t accompanied by rational conversation just endorses the image: We are the rowdy, unthinking kids uninterested in genuine engagement, more than happy to take refuge in numbers.\n\nTo be sure, I am not opposed to protest on principle. There are moments when politics rightly looks like mass mobilization. But there are also moments when our impulse to protest becomes a substitute for good citizenship rather than its highest expression. This is one of those moments. Our civic fabric is frayed. It will not be repaired by larger crowds or sharper slogans alone. It will be repaired, if it is, by conversation, work that may be harder for us than marching — but work whose consequence could last.",

    "fullText": "Misinformation technology could be deployed at scale to disrupt 2028 US presidential election, AI researchers say\n\nPolitical leaders could soon launch swarms of human-imitating AI agents to reshape public opinion in a way that threatens to undermine democracy, a high profile group of experts in AI and online misinformation has warned.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize-winning free-speech activist Maria Ressa, and leading AI and social science researchers from Berkeley, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and Yale are among a global consortium flagging the new “disruptive threat” posed by hard-to-detect, malicious “AI swarms” infesting social media and messaging channels.\n\nA would-be autocrat could use such swarms to persuade populations to accept cancelled elections or overturn results, they said, amid predictions the technology could be deployed at scale by the time of the US presidential election in 2028.\n\nThe warnings, published today in Science, come alongside calls for coordinated global action to counter the risk, including “swarm scanners” and watermarked content to counter AI-run misinformation campaigns. Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said. “These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”\n\nOne leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.\n\nThe experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”\n\nOthers include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.\n\nTogether they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.\n\nThe threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.\n\nAs well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.\n\n“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.\n\nAnother of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”\n\nIn Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.\n\nDuring discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.\n\n“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”\n\nAmid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.\n\n“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”\n\n“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "Celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres, Rosie O'Donnell, and James Cameron are among the stars who have left America and moved elsewhere due to politics.",
    "fullText": "The lifestyles of the rich and famous often include mansions in California, penthouses in the big city, and maybe a small pied-à-terre in a foreign country. But as politics becomes an increasingly divisive topic in the United States, some more celebrities are moving out of the country — or saying that they will.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi moved to England from California in response to the 2024 election results. Rosie O'Donnell — thanks to her Irish grandparents — is in the process of becoming an Irish citizen, citing the current US political climate as her reason for moving in a TikTok video. Other celebrities like Laverne Cox and Cher have vowed to leave the States but haven't yet.\n\nThis isn't exactly a new trend. During the 2016 US presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, many stars vocally opposed Trump and threatened to leave America if he won. Now, with Trump's second term underway, celebrities are again considering relocating — not that the Trump administration is too upset.\n\n\"Good riddance!\" White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers told BI when asked for the administration's response.\n\nCelebrities aren't the only ones exploring a new place to live. Search interest for \"move abroad\" shows that peak interest occurred in November 2024. Though interest has since cooled off, it's still higher than in previous years.\n\nBureaucracy.es, an immigration services site that helps Americans moving to Spain with the visa application process, told CNN in December 2024 that it's seen over 300% more clients book consultations since the November election.\n\nHere are 10 celebrities who have moved abroad, or say they will for political reasons.\n\nOlivia Singh contributed to previous versions of this post.\n\nIn late November 2024, TheWrap reported that comedian Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, left their Montecito home for the Cotswolds, England. The publication said their move to the countryside was triggered by Trump's election and a source said they're \"never coming back.\"\n\nAn August 2025 Us cover story notes that DeGeneres told English broadcaster and host Richard Bacon during a July 20 event that she and DeGeneres were in the Cotswolds when the election results came in. \"We were like, 'We're staying here. We're not going back,'\" DeGeneres told Bacon on their reaction to Trump's victory.\n\nAccording to the Us story, DeGeneres and de Rossi have since moved from the original home they purchased in the Cotswolds and now live in a 10,000-square-foot country home called Hiaven. The pair tend to their chickens, sheep, and horses and walk to the local pub for lunch.\n\nIn a video recently posted on TikTok, Rosie O'Donnell confirmed that she moved from the US to Ireland with her youngest daughter, Dakota. The actor relocated on January 15, days before Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"Although I was never someone who thought I would move to another country, that's what I decided would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child,\" O'Donnell said in the video.\n\nThe talk show host, who has Irish grandparents, said her experience so far has been \"pretty wonderful\" and she's in the process of getting Irish citizenship.\n\nO'Donnell said that she misses her four other kids and her friends, but will remain in Ireland for the time being.\n\n\"I miss many things about life there at home, and I'm trying to find a home here in this beautiful country,\" she said. \"And when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there, in America, that's when we will consider coming back.\"\n\nUK-born actor Sophie Turner moved to America after marrying singer Joe Jonas. The couple first lived together in Los Angeles and later in Miami with their two daughters Willa and Delphine. Turner and Jonas sold their Miami home in August 2023 and news of their plans to divorce broke weeks later.\n\nIn an interview with Harper's Bazaar published in October 2024, Turner said that she was homesick while living in the US and struggled with the country's politics. Turner has since moved to West London.\n\n\"The gun violence, Roe v Wade being overturned... Everything just kind of piled on,\" Turner said.\n\nAfter the 2022 Uvalde shooting, in which 19 elementary school children and two teachers were killed, Turner said she \"knew it was time\" to leave.\n\nIt was no secret that Barbra Streisand wanted Hillary Clinton to beat Trump in the 2016 election.\n\n\"He has no facts,\" Streisand told Australian \"60 Minutes\" host Michael Usher in a 2016 interview prior to the election. \"I don't know, I can't believe it. I'm either coming to your country, if you'll let me in, or Canada.\"\n\nStreisand didn't move out of the US, but she did criticize Trump in her 2018 studio album \"Walls.\"\n\nIn a 2023 interview with Stephen Colbert, Streisand said that she liked Joe Biden and thought he did a \"good job.\" When asked about the possibility of a second Trump administration, Streisand again said she'd move.\n\n\"I can't live in this country if he became president,\" she said, adding that she'd probably move to England.\n\nPer an Instagram post shared in early January amid the Los Angeles wildfires, it appears that Streisand still lives in Northern California. Reps for Streisand did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nIn November 2016, Page Six reported that Cher threatened to move if Trump was elected.\n\n\"I'm gonna have to leave the planet,\" she reportedly said at a fundraiser for Clinton.\n\nShe had a similar stance before Trump officially ran for reelection.\n\n\"I almost got an ulcer the last time,\" she told The Guardian in October 2023. \"If he gets in, who knows? This time I will leave [the country].\"\n\nHowever, as of publication, it doesn't appear that Cher has relocated. Reps for Cher did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nDays after the 2024 presidential election, \"Orange Is the New Black\" star Laverne Cox appeared on the podcast \"Just for Variety\" and spoke about the impact the results would have on the transgender community.\n\nCox said that she and some friends were considering moving, but no plans have been solidified yet.\n\n\"We're doing research on different cities in Europe and in the Caribbean,\" Cox said.\n\n\"I don't want to be in too much fear, but I'm scared,\" the actor added. \"As a public figure, with all my privilege, I'm scared, and I'm particularly scared because I'm a public figure. I feel like I could be targeted.\"\n\nAt the 2016 Matrix Awards, \"Girls\" actor Lena Dunham said that she was serious about moving if Trump won the election.\n\n\"I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will,\" Dunham said. \"I know a lovely place in Vancouver and I can get my work done from there.\"\n\nBut after the election results, Dunham changed her mind.\n\n\"I can survive staying in this country, MY country, to fight and live and use my embarrassment of blessings to do what's right,\" she wrote in part in a note shared on Instagram.\n\n\"It's easy to joke about moving to Canada,\" she added. \"It's harder to see, and to love, the people who fill your mailbox with hate. It's harder to see what needs to be done and do it. It's harder to live, fully and painfully aware of the injustice surrounding us, to cherish and fear your country all at once. But I'm willing to try. Will you try with me?\"\n\nDunham did eventually leave her home in New York and moved to London. However, in an interview with the New Yorker published in July 2024, the actor said the move was prompted by work opportunities.\n\nRobin Wright, known for her roles in \"Forrest Gump\" and \"House of Cards,\" relocated to England for work and decided to make the move permanent.\n\nWright spends most of her time in the Chiltern Hills, a rural part of England about 44 miles outside London, and enjoys the peace and quiet it offers compared to her former home of Los Angeles.\n\n\"They're living,\" Wright told UK publication The Sunday Times in August. \"They're not in the car in traffic, panicked on a phone call, eating a sandwich. That's most of America. Everything's rush, competition and speed.\"\n\nWright mentioned during an appearance on The View that the UK's tax breaks make it advantageous for production, which is why she relocated there in the first place, but she's enjoyed her break from the US.\n\n\"I'm troubled, like many of us are, about this state of our country,\" Wright said. \"It's not the reason, I just — I'm so tranquil over there.\"\n\n\"Pretty Woman\" star Richard Gere and his wife Alejandra Silva sold their house in Connecticut for $10.75 million in November 2024 and moved to Spain.\n\nGere said the plan was to be closer to Silva's family in Spain, but on his way out of the country, he had some choice words about the US.\n\n\"We're in a very dark place in America where we have a bully and a thug who's the president of the United States,\" Gere said during a speech at Spain's Goya Awards in February.\n\nSilva told The Daily Mail that the move was not permanent, and that they plan on going back and forth between Spain and the US.\n\n\"We're always coming back,\" she said. We'll come back here in the summer because we have the kids at camp. We just have to balance our lives there and here.\"\n\nThe billionaire filmmaker has been visiting New Zealand since the 1990s, but he set roots there once the pandemic hit in 2020.\n\nSince then, Cameron has had another reason for staying.\n\n\"I'm not there for the scenery, I'm there for the sanity,\" he said in a January 2026 episode of \"In Depth with Graham Bensinger.\"\n\nAlong with supporting how New Zealanders handled the pandemic, Cameron has also voiced his opposition to Donald Trump. That led to Camera not just living there, but also making all his \"Avatar\" movies in the country. He became a citizen of New Zealand in 2025.\n\n\"I think it's horrifying,\" he told the New Zealand outlet Stuff in 2025 about Trump's reelection. \"I see it as a turn away from everything decent. America doesn't stand for anything if it doesn't stand for what it has historically stood for. It becomes a hollow idea, and I think they're hollowing it out as fast as they can for their own benefit.\"",

In a complaint filed in Miami-Dade County state court, Trump accused JPMorgan of trade libel and violating Florida's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n\nIn a Truth Social post over the weekend, Trump said that he planned to sue JPMorgan for \"incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest.\" \n\nRepresentatives for JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In August, the bank said in a statement to Reuters that it does not close accounts for political reasons.\n\nTrump has previously criticized some big banks for allegedly denying services to conservatives, telling CNBC in August that JPMorgan and Bank of America had previously refused to accept his deposits. In August, the president signed an executive order directing federal banking regulators to eliminate guidance that encourages what he deems \"politicized\" or \"unlawful\" debanking.",

    "title": "Chipotle's new PAC signals a change in how the company engages in politics",
    "description": "Ahead of the midterms, Chipotle has filed to form a political action committee, in a departure from its prior \"Government Affairs Engagement Policy.\"",
    "fullText": "Chipotle Mexican Grill has filed paperwork to form a political action committee, marking a shift in how the burrito chain engages in US politics.\n\nThe filing, a Statement of Organization submitted to the Federal Election Commission early this month, establishes a corporate PAC, a vehicle that allows companies to collect voluntary political donations from employees and executives and give that money to federal candidates.\n\nTwo corporate governance and political campaign finance experts said that, for a consumer-facing brand that has previously kept its distance from direct campaign giving, the move signals a more formal and proactive approach to federal politics — just as the 2026 midterm elections are heating up.\n\nThe decision also represents a departure from Chipotle's prior stance. In versions of its Government Affairs Engagement Policy dating from 2021 and 2024, the company said it did not operate a PAC, though it noted that it could form one in the future.\n\n\"As Congress debates critical issues in 2026, the PAC is a meaningful way to give our 130,000 employees a voice in the political process that impacts their lives, communities, and our business, on a day-to-day basis,\" Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, told Business Insider.\n\nThe timing of Chipotle's move is notable. The 2026 midterm elections are expected to be exceptionally competitive, in part because several states have undertaken mid-decade redistricting — a move that can make races more unpredictable and more expensive.\n\n\"When elections are heavily contested, they tend to cost more money,\" Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor of law at Stetson University College of Law and a Brennan Center fellow, told Business Insider. \"Candidates for Congress are subject to hard money limits, so they may want money from corporate PACs to run their campaigns.\"\n\nCorporate PACs can also serve longer-term strategic goals. Companies may give to lawmakers with influence over issues that affect their business, or to candidates they believe will appoint regulators aligned with their interests.\n\n\"Rather than just lobbying, a PAC allows a company to directly influence the election of officials, ensuring that legislators understand the company's specific business interests,\" Anat Alon-Beck, an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, whose research focuses on corporate law and governance, said.\n\nWhile corporate PACs are common across many sectors, restaurants have historically been smaller players in federal campaign finance. Trade groups like the National Beer Wholesalers Association and companies like American Crystal Sugar have been among the more active PACs in the food and drink space, but restaurant brands themselves have not ranked among the top corporate PAC spenders.\n\nThat context makes Chipotle's filing less about joining a dominant political force and more about signaling a shift in posture.\n\nSome clues can be found in Chipotle's previous government affairs contribution reports, which outline the company's contributions to political organizations and in support of state and local ballot measures.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, Chipotle as a company gave $50,000 each to both the Democratic and Republican Governors Associations and $25,000 to the Democratic Mayors Association. It also made annual contributions of $150,000 to the National Restaurant Association, in addition to $625,000 in 2024 and $408,000 in 2023 to Save Local Restaurants, a coalition led by the National Restaurant Association to lobby for pro-restaurant legislation.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association has its own PAC that has historically donated primarily to Republican candidates, according to OpenSecrets data.\n\nCorporate PACs — formally known under federal law as \"separate segregated funds\" — exist because corporations are barred from donating money from their own treasuries directly to federal candidates.\n\n\"That ban comes from the Tillman Act of 1907,\" Torres-Spelliscy said. \"To avoid that ban, corporations ask people who are associated with the company, typically executives, to donate up to $5,000 to the corporate PAC.\"\n\nThose funds can then be donated directly to candidates within federal contribution limits — $5,000 per candidate per election if the PAC contributes to at least five candidates, or a maximum of $3,500 if the PAC supports fewer than five candidates.\n\nOne advantage of corporate PACs, Torres-Spelliscy said, is transparency. \"Everyone who donates knows that the money is going into politics,\" she said. \"And the public can see who has given to the corporate PAC and who the corporate PAC has donated money to.\"\n\nSince 2010, corporations have also been able to spend money through Super PACs, which can accept unlimited funds — including corporate treasury money — as long as they operate independently of candidates. Creating a Super PAC requires a separate filing with the FEC, which Chipotle had not submitted at the time of publication.\n\n\"The catch is a Super PAC spends money independently of a candidate,\" Torres-Spelliscy said.\n\nThat independence can be a drawback for companies that want a more direct relationship with lawmakers. While Super PACs allow for far larger sums, they can't coordinate with campaigns or give directly to candidates.\n\nIn practice, the biggest corporate donors to Super PACs in recent election cycles have come from industries like cryptocurrency and fossil fuels — not restaurants or food companies, according to data from OpenSecrets.\n\n\"A corporation may still want to have a corporate PAC if it wants to make donations directly to federal candidates,\" Torres-Spelliscy said.",

    "fullText": "The heckler who booed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and upended an event in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday has been unmasked, and he’s a familiar face in politics.\n\nLutnick was speaking at an invite-only VIP dinner event hosted by billionaire BlackRock boss Larry Fink when a heckler, now identified as climate change advocate and former Vice President Al Gore, started booing the former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO.\n\nGore’s reaction came after Lutnick attacked Europe in his remarks, prompting European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to reportedly walk out of the event.\n\nThe soiree was halted before dessert came out, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a statement to Mediaite on Wednesday, Gore confirmed he heckled Lutnick, but said he wasn’t the only one.\n\n“I sat and listened to his remarks,” Gore said. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane. And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others.”\n\nThe situation unfolded a day before President Donald Trump’s speech to world leaders, which lasted a little over an hour, and covered everything from Greenland to windmills and his false “rigged election” claim.\n\nThe post Heckler Who Booed Howard Lutnick During Davos Event Revealed to Be Al Gore first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump used his Davos address to press for US control of Greenland, defend tariffs, and frame global politics as a contest of power.",
    "fullText": "It was a speech that was never going to fly under the radar.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used his Davos address on Wednesday to press his case for US control of Greenland, criticize what he described as Europe's economic decline, and outline a series of domestic and global policy priorities — from tariffs and credit card rates to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe speech came after Trump's flight to Davos was delayed following a midair turnaround of Air Force One due to a \"minor electrical issue\" and a transatlantic flight on a backup jet.\n\nIt also came amid mounting backlash from European leaders, rattled markets, and warnings of retaliation that could hit America's biggest economic advantages.\n\nHere are the four biggest takeaways from Trump's remarks:\n\nTrump devoted a significant portion of his speech to Greenland, saying that the US does not plan to use military force and adding that no other country can secure the territory.\n\n\"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force, Trump said.\"\n\nAt the same time, he framed US control of Greenland as essential to global security and openly criticized America's allies.\n\n\"All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,\" Trump said.\n\n\"No nation or a group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.\"\n\nTrump said US ownership would benefit NATO, even as he questioned the alliance's reliability.\n\n\"This would greatly enhance the security of the entire NATO alliance,\" he said, adding: \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly returned to tariffs as a central tool of leverage, describing them as a way to get other countries to change behavior.\n\n\"Instead of raising taxes on domestic producers, we're lowering them and raising tariffs on foreign nations,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that tariffs have enabled him to secure concessions that would not have been possible otherwise.\n\n\"Without tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to get it done,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, he described his negotiating style in blunt terms, telling the audience that when tariffs are on the table, the message to other countries is simple: \"You're going to do it fast.\"\n\nTrump used some of his most emotive language when discussing energy policy, particularly renewable power.\n\nHe dismissed green policies as \"the Green New Scam\" in reference to the EU's Green New Deal and called it \"perhaps the greatest hoax in history,\" adding that wind turbines ruin landscapes while losing money.\n\n\"Windmills all over the place destroy your land,\" Trump said.\"Stupid people buy them.\"\n\nHe also accused China of profiting from renewable energy by manufacturing windmills for export while relying on other energy sources at home, suggesting Beijing sells green technology it does not fully embrace itself.\n\nTrump said that parts of Europe have declined economically and politically — without naming specific cities or countries.\n\n\"Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable anymore,\" he said, adding that the changes were \"not in a positive way.\"\n\nHe blamed European governments for weakening themselves through energy and economic policy.\n\n\"They're destroying themselves,\" Trump said of European countries.\n\nAt the same time, he positioned the US as the central force in the global economy and security.\n\n\"The USA is the economic engine on the planet,\" he said. \"When America booms, the entire world booms.\"\n\n\"I'm working every day to ensure our military is very powerful. Our borders are very strong. And above all, our economy is strong because national security requires economic security and economic prosperity,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Just months ago, Elon Musk seemed to swear off major political spending. That seems to be over now.\n\nThe tech titan has poured $10 million into a super PAC backing GOP Senate candidate Nate Morris in Kentucky, according to Axios and The New York Times.\n\nIt would be Musk's largest publicly known single contribution to a political candidate since the 2024 election, when he spent nearly $300 million and emerged as the GOP's largest donor.\n\nMorris, an entrepreneur and tech executive running on an \"America First\" platform, is running against two other candidates to succeed the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell. He's been backed by a slew of MAGA-aligned politicians and figures, though President Donald Trump has yet to make an endorsement in the race.\n\nOn an episode of Donald Trump Jr's \"Triggered\" podcast on Monday, Morris said that the super PAC contribution came after he had a \"terrific meeting\" with Musk last week.\n\n\"He got excited about the race, and I think he was excited that I was a business guy and entrepreneur, and decided to make a big contribution to the super PAC that's going to be helping our campaign,\" Morris said. \"We're so delighted to have Elon's support, and for him to go all-in on us.\"\n\nMusk has not yet publicly commented on the reported contribution, and spokespeople for Musk and his companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe world's richest man has also reported to have made major contributions to super PACs tied to House and Senate GOP leadership. It comes as he's appeared to largely mend his relationship with Trump.\n\n\"America is toast if the radical left wins,\" Musk wrote on X earlier this month in response to reports of those contributions. \"They will open the floodgates to illegal immigration and fraud. Won't be America anymore.\"\n\nThe details of Musk's contributions will be publicly disclosed to the Federal Election Commission at the end of January.\n\nMore broadly, Musk appears to be re-engaging with American politics, posting about hot-button topics including immigration and his support for legislation to require proof of citizenship for voting.\n\nMusk spending big on an election would mark something of a reversal from the middle of last year.\n\nShortly before his feud with Trump erupted into public view, Musk declared that he was scaling back his political contributions.\n\n\"If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,\" Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May. \"I do not currently see a reason.\"\n\nThose comments came a month after he spent millions to support a GOP candidate in a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, only for that candidate to lose handily.",

    "fullText": "Yuval Noah Harari warned that the world is badly misjudging the timescale of artificial intelligence — and that the real danger lies not in how fast the technology is moving, but in how casually it's being treated.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, the historian and author of \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\" said that when he talks about the long-term impact of AI, he's not thinking in years or even decades.\n\n\"A lot of the conversations here in Davos, when they say 'long term' they mean like two years,\" Harari said. \"When I mean long term, I think 200 years.\"\n\nHarari compared the current moment in AI to the early days of the Industrial Revolution, saying that humanity tends to misunderstand transformative technologies as they unfold.\n\nThe deepest consequences of industrialization took generations to fully emerge, he said — often through social, political, and geopolitical upheaval that no one could have predicted in advance.\n\n\"You can test for accidents,\" he said. \"But you cannot test the geopolitical implications or the cultural implications of the steam engine in a laboratory. It's the same with AI.\"\n\nHarari warned that even if AI development were to stop today, its long-term effects would still be impossible to grasp.\n\n\"The stone has been thrown into the pool, but it just hit the water,\" he said. \"We have no idea what waves have been created, even by the AIs that have been deployed a year or two ago.\"\n\nHarari joins a plethora of senior AI researchers and tech leaders who have expressed concerns about AI's risks, ranging from waves of job losses to human extinction.\n\nHowever, what worries him most, Harari said, is not just uncertainty — but complacency. He said many of the most powerful decision-makers shaping AI are focused on short-term incentives rather than long-term consequences.\n\n\"I'm mainly concerned about the lack of concern that we are creating the most powerful technology in human history,\" he said.\n\n\"Very smart and powerful people are worried about what their investors say in the next quarterly report,\" Harari said. \"They think in terms of a few months, or a year or two.\"\n\nAI's social consequences, he said, will play out far beyond that horizon — whether the world is ready or not.",

    "title": "An Alaskan mine that's been in political limbo for years might be the key to satisfying America's huge appetite for copper",
    "description": "S&P Global said in a recent analysis that copper supply would fall short of demand for the next 15 years, barring significant increases in production.",
    "fullText": "Copper prices are soaring, and supply is expected to badly lag demand in the coming decade, but a small Alaska mine that's been in political limbo for years might hold the key to meeting the voracious appetite for the metal.\n\nBristol Bay is located in the southwest corner of Alaska, in the easternmost arm of the Bering Sea. The area boasts one of the nation's richest sockeye salmon runs. It's also home to a stalled project to mine a resource that's highly important to the AI infrastructure boom.\n\nLocals know all about the Pebble Mine project. The site was touted as having the potential to bring an economic windfall to the remote area, but was stalled by an EPA ruling. The wrangling over the project has gone on for over a decade and has spanned three presidential administrations—but with a copper shortage looming, the mining project has been thrust back into the spotlight.\n\nCopper prices are up sharply, breaking above $12,000 a ton for the first time in the last week and rising more than 40% in 12 months. The AI buildout is one factor that's sent demand soaring. However, a study by S&P Global this month said that supply will fall massively short between now and 2040, barring a sizable increase in production.\n\nThe firm predicts that copper production will peak in 2030, leaving the world roughly 10 million metric tons short by 2040.\n\nThe Pebble Mine project sits on vast copper and gold reserves. However, its operations have been blocked since 2014 under an Environmental Protection Agency provision that has remained in place across the Obama, Biden, and Trump administrations.\n\n\"Pebble is a world-class deposit,\" Deantha Skibinski, who serves as executive director of the Alaska Miners Association, told Business Insider. \"The copper in the ground at the pebble project is immense.\"\n\nShe added that there are few copper producers in the US with the type of reserves that Pebble Mine is sitting on. The project's owner says the site is the world's largest undeveloped store of both copper and gold. It also has large deposits of molybdenum and silver, two metals that also play a role in the AI buildout.\n\nSkibinski recalled the EPA's 2014 decision to block the mine during its exploratory phase after it failed a watershed assessment.\n\n\"What they did, which we contend is not legal, is that they issued the 404(c) veto preemptively, meaning before the company went into permitting,\" she said. \"And that is unprecedented.\"\n\nPebble Limited responded with a lawsuit, kicking off a long, complicated legal saga. More than a decade later, the mine is still not in operation.\n\nNow, as the US under Trump scrambles to secure domestic supplies of critical materials, Skibinski thinks the Pebble Mine project should get another look by the administration.\n\n\"You would think that the government should fully examine, transparently and honestly, how to get more mines that produce copper and other minerals online,\" she said. \"But when you talk about what it actually takes, there are many that say they're not interested in going that route.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump expressed support for other Alaska mining endeavors during his first term, including the Pebble Mine and a project that would open up the state's mineral-rich Ambler Mining District. But the New York Times reported in 2020 that Donald Trump Jr. opposed the mine's construction, citing the potential environmental impacts.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump Jr. did not return a request for comment. The White House did not reply to a request for comment about the administration's current stance on the Pebble Mine project.\n\n\"It is crucial for the President and all the federal agencies that may be holding up Pebble to understand that copper is vital for meeting our needs of a modern society that relies on it,\" said Lisa Reimers, an area native and the CEO of construction and logistics company Iliamna Development. \"Pebble Mine is an important project for the United States so we are not to be dependent on foreign companies for copper.\"",
