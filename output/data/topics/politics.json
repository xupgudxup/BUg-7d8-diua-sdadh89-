    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

    "title": "Trump Was Slammed For Leveling This 'Disgusting' 3-Word Phrase — And It Might Reveal A Lot",
    "description": "People were outraged by the president's recent use of this particular expression. Experts in political science and mental health say the term tells quite the story.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump recently leveled one of his commonly used terms in a statement attacking iconic actor and director Rob Reiner shortly after he and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead at their home on Sunday.\n\nThe president took to his Truth Social platform on Monday to seize on the opportunity to slam Rob Reiner, who was a critic of Trump, and for baselessly attributing the Hollywood filmmaker’s death to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a phrase Trump and his supporters often use to attack those who criticize the president, his policies and his rhetoric.\n\nLife: Psychologists React To THAT Post From Trump About Rob Reiner's Death\n\n“Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote in part on the social media platform.\n\nTrump’s vile post about Reiner garnered wide condemnation, with many on social media describinghis remarks as“disgusting.” Rocker Jack White took to Instagram to slam the president, writing: “Trump you disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child. Neither he nor any one of his followers can defend this gross, horrible insult to a beautiful artist who gave the world so much.”\n\nThe president also garnered a rare rebuke from many MAGA supporters and a number of the president’s most loyal advocates. He was further criticized when he doubled down on his attacks on Reiner while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office hours later.\n\nThe concept of a so-called “derangement syndrome” has been used against critics of past presidents before. But Trump has a history of frequently using the phrase against his naysayers himself. He had also used the expression against those who opposed him during his first term as president.\n\nLife: How To Do That 'Defying Gravity' Riff Without Murdering Your Voice\n\nAlexandra Cromer, a licensed professional counselor with Thriveworks, believes that Trump’s habit of leveling the phrase “Trump Derangement Syndrome” reveals a lot about his leadership style.\n\n“It reveals that he is not a leader that values, welcomes, or is willing to receive feedback,” she told HuffPost. “This also is a behavior pattern that we see in people with narcissistic tendencies; projection of perceived criticism onto someone else.”\n\nCromer explained that by Trump calling his critics “deranged,” he’s essentially seeking to undermine “the authenticity of the feedback.”\n\n“This reveals that his leadership style is very rigid and very one-dimensional. He is the one to give directions and all others must comply,” she said. “This is a tremendously unhealthy way to receive criticism or any other form of feedback. Psychologically, we know that feedback is critical to not only growth [and] prosperity, but overall health and wellness.”\n\nLife: The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Dec. 6-12)\n\nShe later continued, “shutting down criticism by engaging in stereotyping and blaming of the source can also be viewed as abusive behavior — that is, behavior that attempts to inflict psychological harm and maintain power structures.”\n\nHallie Kritsas, a licensed mental health counselor and therapist with Thriveworks who specializes in self-esteem, workplace issues and anxiety, told HuffPost that she believes the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is “polarizing and emotionally activating.”\n\n“It comes across as a threat and will more than likely increase stress and divide groups in two different ones versus unifying them,” she said.\n\nJacob Neiheisel, associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that he thinks Trump’s frequent use of the phrase is “meant to be dismissive of his opposition” and intended to “give his followers cover for dismissing similar criticisms that they might hear.”\n\nLife: The Most Popular Dog Names Of 2025\n\n“I think his use of the term reflects his deep-seated disdain for dissent,” he said. “Trump’s leadership style is certainly not one that is welcoming of a ‘team of rivals’ type of approach, but rather one that demands loyalty and a willingness to do political combat on his behalf.”\n\nNeiheisel thinks that the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” phrase has caught on with so many Trump supporters because it “allows them to adopt a similar orientation toward dissent in their own social environments.”\n\n“Simply dismissing the opposition as having a form of mental illness allows them to protect their own attitudes and beliefs, inoculating them against any negativity directed toward Trump,” he added.\n\nNeiheisel thinks that Trump’s attack on Reiner after his death hit “a new low.”\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\n“Republicans had the moral high ground in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder and were able to use the negative things said about Kirk after his death to attack Democrats,” he said. “With Trump’s response, that high ground is gone. I think that’s why we saw a number of Republicans condemning Trump’s remarks.”\n\nKritsas believes that Trump’s statements about the iconic director “violated what some might view as a time to grieve and have decency in a moment of loss.”\n\nCromer said that Trump’s harsh words for Reiner was likely particularly upsetting to so many people because the filmmaker was a “universally liked person.”\n\n“While Rob was not a perfect person (because nobody is), he demonstrated consistent prosocial behavior patterns and centered his personal values at the forefront of his personal and professional life,” she said.\n\n“Further, Trump’s remarks state a belief that someone was murdered because they didn’t like Trump; an assertion that can be viewed as narcissistic by inserting himself into a situation that had nothing to do with him in any contextual way,” she continued.\n\nCromer later added that overall, Trump’s remarks about Reiner “communicates a lack of respect for psychological and personal boundaries for those affected by this incident.”\n\nMedical Examiner Report States Rob And Michele Reiner’s Cause Of Death\n\n2 Of Rob Reiner's Children Release Statement On Parents' Deaths\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post",

    "fullText": "Locals band together in David v Goliath battle against facility they say would jack up bills, increase pollution and destroy area’s character\n\nA who’s who of the nation’s most powerful politicians and tech tycoons are forcing through a proposal for a massive data center in rural Michigan as locals from across the political spectrum have come out in force against it, with one calling it “uniquely evil”.\n\nSaline Township, Michigan, residents fear the $7bn center would jack up energy bills, pollute groundwater, and destroy the area’s rural character. The 1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help derail Michigan’s nation-leading transition to renewable energy.\n\nResponding to resident pressure, Saline Township’s board of trustees in September voted down the plans, but the data center’s powerful backers – including Donald Trump, Open AI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, utility giant DTE Energy, and Stephen Ross, the real-estate billionaire and Trump donor who owns Related Co – fought back.\n\nRelated Digital sued, and, vastly outgunned, the township board quickly folded and reversed its decision over strong resident objections. Now the project’s backers are trying to avoid minimal regulatory scrutiny on energy costs and pollution.\n\nThe controversy over the data center is representative of the David v Goliath fights playing out across the US, pitting working- and middle-class residents against the interests of billionaires and the political establishment.\n\n“This is part of an experience that America and the world is having around tech billionaires who are seizing power and widening the gap between those have much too much … and the working and middle classes,” said Yousef Rabhi, a former Democratic state legislative leader and clean energy advocate who opposes the plans.\n\n“That’s what these data centers are symbolic of, and they’re the vehicle for is the furtherance of this divide,” Rabhi added.\n\nThe proposal is part of the broader “Stargate” project composed of five data centers backed by the Trump administration, which granted $500bn in federal subsidies for them. It’s the largest project in Michigan history in terms of investment, and it also received subsidies on taxes that could have gone to roads and schools, among other uses, Rabhi said.\n\nThe plan’s supporters say the center would provide essential AI infrastructure, in part for national security, and create a few hundred jobs. Huge sums of money are at stake for the tech and utility companies.\n\nRoss’s Related Digital is the data center’s developer, while OpenAI, which produced ChatGPT, and Oracle will use the center to house its AI infrastructure.\n\nIn a statement, Related Digital alleged company the township’s decision violated zoning laws, and the spokesperson stressed the suit was filed jointly with three Saline Township property owners who are selling their property to Related.\n\n“Thankfully, we were able to reach a settlement agreement with the township to allow this project to move forward,” the spokesperson said. They noted Related is also making about $14m in donations to local causes.\n\nSaline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor. The Stargate project is one of around a dozen data center proposals in Michigan over the last year that are strongly opposed at the local level. It’s one of four proposed near Ann Arbor – last week, plans for a second a few miles away in a neighboring town surfaced.\n\nSome municipalities have been successful in derailing plans, while others have lost the fight.\n\nIn Saline Township, former US marine Kate Haushalter and her husband are raising five children in a farmhouse next to the data center site. They bought and renovated the once-dilapidated home so they could live in a bucolic area, and Haushalter said she was not about to cede ground even though the township did.\n\n“Maybe because I was in the Marine Corps, but I would rather stay and fight,” Haushalter said. “I’m sure the chances are slim, but it’s worth fighting for, and I don’t want to teach my kids to roll over.”\n\nBig tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Open AI, which often own data centers, typically have enough political support at the state and federal levels that inexperienced local leaders who are comparatively poorly resourced are left on their own to defend their town from the centers.\n\nSaline Township supervisor Jim Marion conveyed that challenge when he told angry residents during a contentious November discussion that the township’s “hands were tied”.\n\n“This township doesn’t have the money to fight these big companies. You got to understand that,” Marion told the crowd. “We were dealt the cards we were dealt.”\n\nSome municipalities have utilized zoning laws to block the centers. Beyond that, there’s little local officials can do, and state and federal level regulations on the centers are virtually non-existent.\n\nStill, residents are growing more organized. A first protest on 1 December drew about 200 people, who Rabhi described as “truly a cross-section of American society”. The next week, 800 people participated in a state-level public input session, and organizers are pressuring state environmental regulators to hold up the project’s required wetland permits.\n\nAmong residents leading the pushback is Josh LeBaron, whose home sits about 500 yards from the site, where crews have broken down.\n\nHe characterized the project as “uniquely evil” because of the environmental risks, and because, he and others allege, the companies and government have been secretive about their plans. In response to questions about accusations of nimby-ism leveled against local residents by the project’s supporters, LeBaron said he would not be opposed to other developments.\n\nHe noted that Michigan is full of former industrial sites that would be more appropriate for the 575-acre property.\n\n“I would be at home reading a book if it were a subdivision,” LeBaron said.\n\nA Related spokesperson told the Guardian the company “explored sites across Michigan before deciding on this site, which is ideal as it’s a contiguous flat area”, and is set close to a major road and transmission lines.\n\nLocal opponents’ best hope for holding up the project lies in the arcane utility regulatory process on the massive amount of power the data center would require.\n\nDTE Energy claims the data center’s power demands and need for expensive new infrastructure will not increase residential electricity prices.\n\nBut it doesn’t want to show its math.\n\nDTE filed a petition with the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC), the state agency that regulates utilities, asking the MPSC to fast-track the plan’s approval. DTE’s request for an “ex parte” case requires limited scrutiny of its claim that the center won’t destroy the climate laws, or increase electricity bills.\n\nIn response, Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel and consumer advocacy groups filed a legal petition with the MPSC, calling for a “contested case” that would require much closer regulatory review of DTE’s claims.\n\nThe MPSC is helmed by Whitmer appointees, and the governor has strongly backed the project, raising suspicions among opponents that the agency will approve the ex parte request.\n\nStudies from across the country have shown data centers often increase rates, and DTE and regulators “cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence”, said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the regulatory battle.\n\nIn a statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “To be clear, these data center customer contracts will NOT create a cost increase for our existing customers.”\n\nDTE has said the project won’t derail Michigan’s transition to clean energy, but state data and DTE’s plans suggest otherwise.\n\nMichigan, in late 2023, passed nation-leading climate laws that require utilities to transition to renewable energy by 2040. But the law included an “off-ramp” that allows utilities to continue running or building fossil fuel plants if renewable sources cannot handle the energy grid’s load.\n\nAt its peak, DTE’s grid already demands about 9.5 gigawatts of power, while the grid’s capacity is 11gw.\n\nIn July, DTE told investors it is in negotiations with big tech companies to provide 7gw of power for several proposed data centers.\n\nThe Saline center’s 1.4gw may not cause an exceedance of the 11gw threshold, especially because DTE is planning to build battery storage. But the Saline center along with any of the other proposed centers likely would trigger the off-ramp.\n\nDTE appears to be planning for that likelihood: DTE Energy executives said the company would likely need to build new gas plants to accommodate the data centers’ demand.\n\nHaushalter’s kids were born in the renovated farmhouse and are homeschooled there.\n\nShe and her husband try to teach the kids to respect nature. The family manages beehives, watches the geese and plant trees for wood to use in their wood-burning stove. At night, they take the kids outdoors for bonfires to look at the stars. “We’re not a big screen family,” Haushlater said.\n\nThe noise, light and air pollution is already disrupting the life the family built over 13 years. The center, if it is fully built, would fully destroy it, Haushalter said.\n\n“We are really passionate about nature and teaching our kids about it and I can’t believe the biggest construction project in Michigan is landing literally in my backyard, and there’s no recourse for the little guy,” she said. “It’s going to crush us.”",

    "fullText": "Growth in the US economy – and the president’s political survival – rest on AI. The EU must use its leverage and stand up to him\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

    "description": "The Pentagon is policing troops' speech in ways experts call an \"abuse.\" Some service members are self-censoring and scrambling to scrub social media.",
    "fullText": "Pentagon leadership's intensifying scrutiny of speech that is critical of conservatives and the Trump administration is fueling anxiety in the ranks and has some service members scrambling to protect their careers.\n\nIn interviews with Business Insider, troops and legal advisors detailed how behavior has changed amid the recent crackdown, which has some facing administrative actions that can end a career without a court-martial.\n\n\"I had to take my pronouns off my LinkedIn. I've scrubbed everything that has ever mentioned or supported\" LGBTQ causes, the Marine sergeant told Business Insider. She said her mentor warned that Pentagon officials may be looking for \"anything that could be construed as contrary to the vision that the current administration has.\"\n\nThese individual acts of self-censorship mirror a broader chill sweeping the ranks, especially as the crackdown has burst into the open at the highest levels. Tensions flared again this week as the Defense Department said it was launching a command investigation of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly after a preliminary review of his video urging troops to defy unlawful orders.\n\nThe Trump administration says it has a prerogative to police speech it deems offensive or inappropriate, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the administration's policies are intended \"to rip out the politics\" from the services. Some experts on military law say the scrutiny and its repercussions are an abuse of the military's authority.\n\nOne of the flashpoints has been the September murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Top Pentagon leaders have said it's \"unacceptable\" for troops \"to celebrate or mock\" the killing.\n\nAfter Kirk's killing, some service members said things online like \"glad he's dead.\" Others criticized his rhetoric or, more broadly, complained about Trump administration policies or conservatives. In one case, a colonel was suspended for lamenting to friends the angry arguments that followed Kirk's death.\n\nMore than 120 service members have been investigated for political comments since Kirk's death, according to a tally reported by The Washington Post.\n\nNearly a dozen military-law experts told Business Insider the punishments generally wouldn't hold up in a military courtroom because they lack the elements of speech crimes, such as \"contemptuous\" words against an elected leader, or because the comments were unrelated to the military and not said in uniform.\n\n\"What we're seeing now is abuse of speech restrictions,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a Southwestern Law School professor and retired Air Force JAG who is an expert on military speech.\n\n\"Our service members understand that their rights are more restricted within the military. Now they're being chilled into giving up the rights they actually do have,\" she said. \"It's unprecedented.\"\n\nMilitary leaders have disclosed that they are tracking \"unprofessional\" social media use. An October message from the Navy secretary encouraged sailors and Marines to \"refrain from social media engagement\" about official government or military policies.\n\n\"This is more than just policing manners,\" said Frank Rosenblatt, a professor at the Mississippi College School of Law and a retired Army JAG. \"A wider muzzling of the military seems to really serve what they're trying to do — identify these deep state people who are not politically trustworthy.\"\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice imposes some restrictions on troops, criminalizing speech that disrespects officers and civilian leaders, or that undermines the obedience necessary to carry out orders. Troops retain many First Amendment protections; hate speech, for instance, is lawful unless it has a military connection, such as if it was uttered on a base or warship.\n\nThe hunt for speech crimes is fueling suspicion and distrust among some. The field-grade officer who shut down her Facebook said she now worries that a casual remark could brand her as liberal and thus politically suspect.\n\nShe has begun scrutinizing parts of her career she never imagined — where her office is located, who works nearby, whether to respond to articles shared in group chats, and even whether to travel with coworkers she doesn't know well.\n\n\"It just takes one person to flag you as disloyal to end your career — or worse,\" said the officer, who asked for anonymity to avoid official retaliation.\n\nDon C. King, a civilian defense attorney, said he got a call recently from a worried service member. They'd written a social media post critical of the Trump administration's lethal attacks on suspected drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela. Someone at their command saw it and told them, \"'Hey, you better be careful with your social media.'\"\n\n\"I've been in the military my entire adult life, over 30 years, and I've never seen any of the services or DoD scout social media for what it considers to be inappropriate speech,\" said King, who retired as a Navy JAG in 2022 and owns the King Military Law firm specializing in military clients.\n\nThe allegations against rank-and-file troops are unfolding in the military's administrative system, which can discipline troops and end careers outside of public court proceedings.\n\n\"These cases are early, and both the government and the affected individuals are figuring out how they want to fight,\" said Eugene R. Fidell, an influential military law expert and senior research scholar at Yale. \"The simple wear and tear of having to defend and try to overturn one of these administrative sanctions is itself a punishment.\"\n\nFirst Amendment restrictions on troops stem from the military's apolitical role and its reliance on obedience to orders. Officers can face criminal penalties for \"contemptuous\" words about the president, as can all personnel for disrespecting a senior officer. However, troops can comment politically, donate to a campaign, or display bumper stickers. Their protections are strongest when their comments are in a personal capacity, made out of uniform and without any hint of official endorsement.\n\nSocial media can amplify a service member's comments far beyond a bumper sticker, regardless of intention. That poses higher risks that the military as an institution could be seen as backing a political party or objective, said Peter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University who authored a 2023 book, \"Thanks For Your Service,\" about how high confidence in the military has depended on beliefs about its competence and its avoidance of partisan politics.\n\n\"The military is becoming combatants in the culture wars,\" he said. Part of the way to change that, he said, \"requires the military not to sound like they're culture warriors.\"\n\n\"So you may have a right to say it, but it wouldn't be right to say it,\" he added.\n\nMilitary law criminalizes conduct that disgraces an officer or damages good order and discipline; however, case law has set a high bar when the conduct at issue is purely private speech otherwise protected by the First Amendment.\n\nBrent Sadler, a defense expert at a leading conservative think tank, said speech monitoring is justified to enforce the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\n\"The issue is more about professionalism and protecting any appearance of the military interfering with political-civil control,\" said Sadler, a retired Navy captain and senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"I do think numerous conservatives in the military have been persecuted legally and professionally,\" he said, pointing to the 8,000 troops kicked out for refusing the COVID vaccine mandate before the Pentagon rescinded it in 2023.\n\nMark Jensen, a former Army JAG who retired earlier this year, said the Pentagon's policing has expanded over the past few months from \"despicable\" speech about Kirk, to rebukes of his politics, to advocacy for transgender people, to criticism of the Trump administration.\n\nJensen represents four military clients and a civilian who face punishment for their speech. The fact that some of the allegations are public is the result of an anti-\"woke\" online army that publishes hearsay and leaked comments on sites like X.\n\nOn top of being \"smeared,\" Jensen said, these troops undergo the stress of an investigation, a relief if they're in leadership, a poor evaluation, a reprimand by a general, and face a review that can reduce their rank.\n\n\"It's like a 1-2-3-4-5 punch,\" Jensen said. \"All of it with minimal due process.\"\n\nKelly is not the only veteran to unexpectedly face punishment. In one recent case, an ex-soldier on the inactive reserve — a roster of those who can be reactivated in a national emergency — told a civilian attorney he was investigated by military officials for a private social media post, the attorney said.\n\n\"Even when people are in the normal reserves, the regulations are pretty clear that conduct in a civilian capacity shouldn't be punished in a military capacity,\" said Cody Harnish, a private defense attorney and former Army JAG who specializes in UCMJ cases.\n\n\"They're way out of their depth here.\"\n\nStaff writer Kelsey Baker contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: More than 150 anonymous channels using cheap AI tools to spread false stories about Keir Starmer, study finds\n\nYouTube channels spreading fake, anti-Labour videos have amassed more than a billion views this year, as opportunists attempt to use AI-generated content to profit from political division in the UK.\n\nMore than 150 channels have been detected in the last year that promote anti-Labour narratives, as well as outright fake and inflammatory accusations about Keir Starmer.\n\nA study seen by the Guardian has found the channels have accumulated 5.3m subscribers and have created more than 56,000 videos, with a total of almost 1.2bn views in 2025. The network of anonymous channels includes alarmist rhetoric, AI scripts and British narrators to attract hits.\n\nStarmer is personally targeted. The prime minister was either named in the video title or description 15,600 times.\n\nReset Tech, the non-profit group that produced the research, said the channels were part of a global trend to produce synthetic propaganda on the platform. It pointed to the proliferation of cheap AI tools that could be deployed to make a quick profit from divisive topics.\n\nOne channel called Britain News-night talked about Starmer and Reeves facing arrest. Another, TheUKPoliticalBrief, touted videos on the “explosive truth” about immigrant crime and marches on Westminster.\n\nThe UK NewsCore channel focused on how Nigel Farage was ousting Starmer, and claimed the prime minister was “sacked live” and thrown out of parliament.\n\nOther videos featured bizarre, fabricated stories about a row between the royal family and the government. One channel, Gold Up!, said the dispute had left Starmer “melting down on live TV”.\n\nSome of the videos and channels were removed by YouTube’s checks. However, all 150 were taken down when the platform was approached by the Guardian. Reset Tech said some channels had created tens or hundreds of similar videos without being deplatformed.\n\nThe research found similar channels operating in German, French, Spanish and Polish, targeting other politicians or political issues. In total, it mapped 420 problematic channels operating in Europe. Reset Tech said Russian-speaking creators operate some of the channels.\n\nIt is believed channels aimed at the UK were being driven by opportunistic creators trying to monetise political division over issues like immigration, rather than overseas political actors. However, it said their presence still posed a risk to public trust.\n\nThe content has caused concern inside Labour. “The rise of fake news online is a serious threat to our democracy,” a spokesperson said. “The public will be rightly alarmed that democratically elected leaders and institutions are being undermined by bad faith foreign state actors and those seeking to profit from misinformation.\n\n“We’ve already seen attempts from overseas to influence fair elections and manipulate public opinion both here and abroad.\n\n“The government is stepping up its efforts to work with online platforms to tackle this scourge on free and fair democracy. But it’s important that tech bosses take this threat seriously and live up to their obligations to remove this type of content wherever it’s found.”\n\nDylan Sparks, UK director of Reset Tech, called for YouTube to take swifter action. “Malicious actors are permitted by YouTube to spread synthetic ‘news’ that disrupts political debate in the UK, while also earning revenue from it,” he said. “This AI-generated, low cost content spreads across the platform undetected, revealing clear weaknesses in YouTube’s monetisation and content moderation systems.\n\n“This specific network focuses on the prime minister and Labour government, but the same loopholes could be exploited by any hostile actor to push an agenda. Because social media platforms profit from engagement, their business model creates an in-built tension between enforcing their own policies and reducing the spread of malicious content that drives revenue.\n\n“The rapid spread of AI has also introduced new risks to the online environment, and platforms need to move faster and invest more to address them.”\n\nA YouTube spokesperson said: “Spam and deceptive practices that try to take advantage of the YouTube community are not allowed on the platform, which is why the channels flagged by the Guardian have all been removed.\n\n“We enforce our policies consistently, regardless of political viewpoint expressed, or how the content is generated. Our teams work around the clock to monitor for harmful content, taking swift action as needed.”\n\nYouTube is now working with Reset Tech over its findings. The platform said its systems prominently feature authoritative news content on the YouTube homepage, in search results, and through recommendations. It has removed more than 2.1m channels for violating its community guidelines.\n\nMinisters have already formed an online advertising taskforce to see what action can be taken to address the advertising-based monetisation of harmful and misleading content.",

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) of breaking the “first rule of politics” following her announcement that she’s running for Senate.\n\nOn the Politics War Room podcast on Thursday, Carville and co-host Al Hunt expressed some hope for Democrats in the red state of Texas, but Carville laid out his problems with Crockett.\n\n“First of all, it seems like she’s well-educated. It seems like she’s got a lot of energy. But she, to me, she violates the first rule of politics, and that is, in politics, you always make it about the voters and never about yourself,” Carville said.\n\nListening to Crockett, he argued, it’s clear that it’s “a lot more about herself than it is the voters.”\n\nCarville added that Crockett can still be successful in her Senate run and recommended she collect the support of Democrats who have favored voting Republican.\n\n“You can get all the hits. You can get all the clicks. You can get on all of the TV shows. You can get in as long as you’re polemic, but you’re not helping very much,” he said.\n\nCarville still cautioned that “talking incessantly” about yourself is not what wins elections, and he hasn’t been impressed with Crockett’s “framing” and “understanding where people are coming from” on issues.\n\n“We know what wins elections. We just do,” he said. “And what wins elections is not sitting there talking incessantly about yourself. Winning elections is not how many clicks you get or how much overnight fundraising you do. Winning elections is being part of framing issues and understanding where people are coming from, and I don’t think [Congresswoman] Crockett is very good at that. I’ll be very frank.”\n\nCrockett, running with the slogan of “Texas Tough,” said she’s running for the Senate seat currently held by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) because Democrats need a “bigger voice.” She vowed to focus on issues like affordability.\n\n“There are a lot of people that said, ‘You gotta stay in the House. We need our voice. We need you there,” she told supporters this week. “And I understand. But what we need is a bigger voice.”\n\nThe post James Carville Blasts Fellow Democrat Jasmine Crockett for Violating ‘First Rule of Politics’: ‘I’ll Be Very Frank’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Platform fighting world-leading ban on grounds it contravenes implied freedom of political communication in constitution\n\nWill Australia’s social media ban survive a high court challenge?\n\nReddit has filed a challenge against Australia’s under-16s social media ban in the high court, lodging its case two days after implementing age restrictions on its website.\n\n The company said in a Reddit post on Friday that while it agreed with protecting people under 16, the law “has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences”.\n\nReddit said there was an “illogical patchwork” of platforms included in the ban.\n\n“As the Australian Human Rights Commission put it, ‘There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights.’”\n\nReddit argued it was a forum primarily for adults without the traditional social media features the government has “taken issue with”.\n\nReddit was challenging the law on the grounds it infringed on the implied freedom of political communication. It was also seeking to challenge whether Reddit could be considered an age-restricted social media platform under the legislation.\n\nIt said it was not seeking to challenge the law to avoid compliance, and had implemented age-assurance measures since Wednesday.\n\nThe company said the vast majority of Redditors were adults, and advertising wasn’t targeted to children under 18. The Apple app store age rating for Reddit is 17+.\n\n“Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark on actually protecting young people online,” Reddit said. “So, while we will comply with this law, we have a responsibility to share our perspective and see that it is reviewed by the courts.”\n\nReddit’s challenge is separate from one filed by New South Wales Libertarian MP John Ruddick’s Digital Freedom Project group. The next court appearance for Digital Freedom Project group is late February, and Reddit expects it will be heard sometime next year, if the high court takes up the case.\n\nProf Sarah Joseph, from Griffith university’s law school, said she believes there was a strong case against the ban.\n\n“I do believe the legislation has cut off the main source of political information for people under the age of 16, in terms of their receiving and giving information. Whilst that is not the intention of the legislation, that is one of its many effects,” she said.\n\n“Whilst other sources remain open, they operate in very different ways and do not provide the same means to communicate one’s opinions, and the same variety of opinions.”\n\nBut Joseph said she believed the high court case was more likely to fail, as with most challenges to legislation on implied freedom of communications grounds.\n\n“The freedom is engaged in most cases, but the high court goes on to find the law to be proportionate. In reality, the constitutional freedom is quite weak due to the way that it has been interpreted and applied.”\n\nA law that has the effect of reducing the overall volume of political communication in Australia will be invalid unless it is proportionate to a legitimate purpose, constitutional law professor Luke Beck wrote in the Guardian on Thursday.\n\n“[But] the social media account ban only slightly reduces the overall volume of political communication in Australia,” the Monash University academic said.\n\n“The law does not ban teenagers from using the internet or having online group chats. It’s likely that in the [Ruddick] social media account case … the government will succeed.”\n\nThe Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Reddit had argued to the eSafety commissioner in September that it should be excluded from the ban.\n\n“The sole or significant purpose of our platform is to provide knowledge-sharing in timely, context-rich conversations; interaction between end-users is simply an incidental step to enabling this primary purpose,” Reddit said in the letter obtained under freedom of information laws.\n\n“It is not in keeping with Reddit norms for users to use their real names or identities on Reddit, as communities are not centred around real-time social networking among young people.”\n\nReddit does not promote real-time presence, friend requests or activity feeds that drive ongoing engagement, the company said. It said it was committed to collecting minimal personal information from users to preserve pseudonymity on the platform.\n\nReddit was a “pseudonymous platform organised around sharing information in topic-based communities rather than personal profiles or social networks,” the platform said.\n\nThe 10 platforms the government announced were covered by the ban – Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit – had all implemented measures to comply by Wednesday.",
