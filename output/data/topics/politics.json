    "fullText": "Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville accused Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) of breaking the “first rule of politics” following her announcement that she’s running for Senate.\n\nOn the Politics War Room podcast on Thursday, Carville and co-host Al Hunt expressed some hope for Democrats in the red state of Texas, but Carville laid out his problems with Crockett.\n\n“First of all, it seems like she’s well-educated. It seems like she’s got a lot of energy. But she, to me, she violates the first rule of politics, and that is, in politics, you always make it about the voters and never about yourself,” Carville said.\n\nListening to Crockett, he argued, it’s clear that it’s “a lot more about herself than it is the voters.”\n\nCarville added that Crockett can still be successful in her Senate run and recommended she collect the support of Democrats who have favored voting Republican.\n\n“You can get all the hits. You can get all the clicks. You can get on all of the TV shows. You can get in as long as you’re polemic, but you’re not helping very much,” he said.\n\nCarville still cautioned that “talking incessantly” about yourself is not what wins elections, and he hasn’t been impressed with Crockett’s “framing” and “understanding where people are coming from” on issues.\n\n“We know what wins elections. We just do,” he said. “And what wins elections is not sitting there talking incessantly about yourself. Winning elections is not how many clicks you get or how much overnight fundraising you do. Winning elections is being part of framing issues and understanding where people are coming from, and I don’t think [Congresswoman] Crockett is very good at that. I’ll be very frank.”\n\nCrockett, running with the slogan of “Texas Tough,” said she’s running for the Senate seat currently held by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) because Democrats need a “bigger voice.” She vowed to focus on issues like affordability.\n\n“There are a lot of people that said, ‘You gotta stay in the House. We need our voice. We need you there,” she told supporters this week. “And I understand. But what we need is a bigger voice.”\n\nThe post James Carville Blasts Fellow Democrat Jasmine Crockett for Violating ‘First Rule of Politics’: ‘I’ll Be Very Frank’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Platform fighting world-leading ban on grounds it contravenes implied freedom of political communication in constitution\n\nWill Australia’s social media ban survive a high court challenge?\n\nReddit has filed a challenge against Australia’s under-16s social media ban in the high court, lodging its case two days after implementing age restrictions on its website.\n\n The company said in a Reddit post on Friday that while it agreed with protecting people under 16, the law “has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences”.\n\nReddit said there was an “illogical patchwork” of platforms included in the ban.\n\n“As the Australian Human Rights Commission put it, ‘There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights.’”\n\nReddit argued it was a forum primarily for adults without the traditional social media features the government has “taken issue with”.\n\nReddit was challenging the law on the grounds it infringed on the implied freedom of political communication. It was also seeking to challenge whether Reddit could be considered an age-restricted social media platform under the legislation.\n\nIt said it was not seeking to challenge the law to avoid compliance, and had implemented age-assurance measures since Wednesday.\n\nThe company said the vast majority of Redditors were adults, and advertising wasn’t targeted to children under 18. The Apple app store age rating for Reddit is 17+.\n\n“Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark on actually protecting young people online,” Reddit said. “So, while we will comply with this law, we have a responsibility to share our perspective and see that it is reviewed by the courts.”\n\nReddit’s challenge is separate from one filed by New South Wales Libertarian MP John Ruddick’s Digital Freedom Project group. The next court appearance for Digital Freedom Project group is late February, and Reddit expects it will be heard sometime next year, if the high court takes up the case.\n\nProf Sarah Joseph, from Griffith university’s law school, said she believes there was a strong case against the ban.\n\n“I do believe the legislation has cut off the main source of political information for people under the age of 16, in terms of their receiving and giving information. Whilst that is not the intention of the legislation, that is one of its many effects,” she said.\n\n“Whilst other sources remain open, they operate in very different ways and do not provide the same means to communicate one’s opinions, and the same variety of opinions.”\n\nBut Joseph said she believed the high court case was more likely to fail, as with most challenges to legislation on implied freedom of communications grounds.\n\n“The freedom is engaged in most cases, but the high court goes on to find the law to be proportionate. In reality, the constitutional freedom is quite weak due to the way that it has been interpreted and applied.”\n\nA law that has the effect of reducing the overall volume of political communication in Australia will be invalid unless it is proportionate to a legitimate purpose, constitutional law professor Luke Beck wrote in the Guardian on Thursday.\n\n“[But] the social media account ban only slightly reduces the overall volume of political communication in Australia,” the Monash University academic said.\n\n“The law does not ban teenagers from using the internet or having online group chats. It’s likely that in the [Ruddick] social media account case … the government will succeed.”\n\nThe Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Reddit had argued to the eSafety commissioner in September that it should be excluded from the ban.\n\n“The sole or significant purpose of our platform is to provide knowledge-sharing in timely, context-rich conversations; interaction between end-users is simply an incidental step to enabling this primary purpose,” Reddit said in the letter obtained under freedom of information laws.\n\n“It is not in keeping with Reddit norms for users to use their real names or identities on Reddit, as communities are not centred around real-time social networking among young people.”\n\nReddit does not promote real-time presence, friend requests or activity feeds that drive ongoing engagement, the company said. It said it was committed to collecting minimal personal information from users to preserve pseudonymity on the platform.\n\nReddit was a “pseudonymous platform organised around sharing information in topic-based communities rather than personal profiles or social networks,” the platform said.\n\nThe 10 platforms the government announced were covered by the ban – Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit – had all implemented measures to comply by Wednesday.",
