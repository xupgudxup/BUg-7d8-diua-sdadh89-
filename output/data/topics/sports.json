    "description": "In this Saturday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about why being a sports fan is sometimes better in moderation.",
    "fullText": "Being the ultimate sports fan doesn't come with a warning label, but maybe it should. Cheering on your favorite team can cause severe mood swings, violent outbursts, and even, at times, tightness in your chest. It's why I'm a fair-weather fan.\n\nThere's a backstory: I used to have a team. As a Baltimore native, when the Ravens came to our city in 1996, I was all in. After buying tons of black and purple, winning two Super Bowls, and then white knuckling through the lackluster seasons that followed, I decided to set a boundary for my own sanity.\n\nFor me, and the bold, ambiguous fans like me, being a fair-weather fan isn't about disloyalty; it's a form of self-care. It's choosing which stressors I'm letting get to me — and football was no longer one of them.\n\nGloria Chan Packer, who helps ambitious professionals manage stress and burnout in the workplace, writes in an essay for BI that \"we can't eradicate stress entirely,\" but advises that we should aim \"to establish a healthier and more sustainable relationship with your stress.\"\n\nSo yes, I've decided to protect my peace while still respecting the game and showing up when it matters most. It won't be this Sunday when the Seattle Seahawks face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX, but guess who's not stressed about that? Me.",

    "fullText": "Border Patrol really isn’t welcome anywhere!\n\nU.S. Border Patrol may be all about kicking people out of the country, but Commander Gregory Bovino just got the same treatment at a bar in Las Vegas.\n\nJust days after President Donald Trump pulled Bovino out of Minnesota when he started facing backlash for overseeing the administration’s aggressive mass deportation agenda that led to the fatal shooting of Americans Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the hands of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Bovino found out there was another place he wasn’t welcome: a Sin City bar.\n\nBovino was spotted drinking wine at a sports bar on the Las Vegas Strip Bottled Blonde, but he was quickly removed out of concern for the safety of the other bar patrons.\n\n“Upon becoming aware of the individual’s presence, the patron was asked to leave the premises and was escorted out by staff in accordance with venue policy to maintain a safe and orderly environment for all patrons,” the venue told the Daily Beast.\n\nBottled Blonde didn’t elaborate except to explain that, as a private business that “does not engage in political activity or affiliations,” they reserve “the right to refuse service to any patron at its discretion.”\n\nIt’s unclear why Bovino was seen in the Las Vegas bar three days after he was removed from his role as Border Patrol “commander at large” and transferred back to his old position in California, but he was caught on video and in still photos drinking with a group of younger men.\n\nAfter being kicked out of Bottled Blonde he was seen walking down the Strip with those same men. The photos and videos triggered a backlash online, where people were angry that he was enjoying a night out after leading the violent immigration sweep that caused the extrajudicial shooting of two American citizens.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: Border Patrol boss embarrassingly kicked out of a Las Vegas bar to protect patrons\n\nLGBTQ+ officials denounce ICE killing of Minneapolis woman, demand investigation\n\nBorder Patrol chief Greg Bovino and some of his masked agents will leave Minneapolis\n\nJustice Department employee charged & fired after throwing Subway sandwich at federal law enforcement officer",

    "description": "Nearly every Bruin on the roster got involved in the 40 point win Wednesday night.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - There was a Big Ten mismatch on Wednesday in Pauley Pavilion when No. 2 UCLA (22-1, 12-0) hosted Rutgers (9-14, 1-11) and came out the other end with an 86-46 victory to remain undefeated in conference play.\n\nA matchup between the top and bottom teams in the Big Ten was expected to end in Bruin domination and by the end of the first quarter, where UCLA went on a 17-0 run at one point and finished the quarter ahead 26-6, the game looked pretty much over.\n\nThat comfort meant that UCLA head coach Cori Close had some freedom to experiment with different rotations and utilize players like freshman forward Sienna Betts, freshman guard Lena Bilic and redshirt-sophomore forward Amanda Muse much earlier in the game than they'd appear normally.\n\nMuse played 20 minutes, her second-most minutes this season, while Bilic played 20 minutes herself and Betts played close to 24 minutes while scoring 11 points, the same amount her older sister senior center Lauren Betts scored in the game.\n\n\"I'm sure she'll [Sienna Betts] rub that in quite a bit,\" Close said.\n\nThe benefit of rotations that are uncommon to the team is that it gives them an opportunity to try out combinations with each other they otherwise wouldn't have a chance to. It also means that the starters have a chance to rest their bodies in a game where the stakes are much lower and the end result is all but guaranteed.\n\n\"We mixed up our rotations a little bit. It's a long year. We want to protect our bodies a little bit,\" senior guard Kiki Rice said. \"It's also a great opportunity to play with other people. To work on actions together and how we play with each other and we need to be able to play with different lineups because there's going to be times where that's going to happen throughout the year.\"\n\nJordan Teller - The Sporting Tribune\n\nKiki Rice #1 of the UCLA Bruins drives towards the basket during an NCAA basketball game against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, Wednesday February 4, 2026 in Los Angeles, Calif.\n\nWednesday's game was extra special because it fell on National Girls and Women in Sports Day. To celebrate UCLA involved several young women in the game production, with squeaky voices calling out over the loudspeaker to introduce players or announce a made basket.\n\nFor the players, it's another reminder of the privilege they have to make an impact as the next generation of role models for young women athletes.\n\n\"It's super special that we can do that and have the little girls be out there learning new skills... It's just really cool to see that and what's super cool about our program... there's lots of families here and there's little kids that look up to us. It's super cool because they are familiar faces to us so we do recognize the people that come to our games and we really appreciate it. Just super cool that we can do this game and lift women up,\" senior forward Gabriela Jaquez said.\n\nFor Close, a day like Wednesday's game reminds her of the role models in women's sports that she was looking for growing up but couldn't always find.\n\nIt also reminded her of all the programs and opportunities that exist now, and that UCLA is a part of, to give women more positions in the sports world as athletes, coaches, trainers, hosts and broadcasters.\n\n\"I wish I had women to look up to at that age that I could go and see,\" Close said. \"I am such a hoop head and I would watch as much basketball as my mom would let me, but there were no options to watch women and girls as I was growing up. It was all men's basketball.... What a privilege when you can combine trying to master your craft and compete at the highest levels and inspire somebody else and impact a heart. How lucky are we?\"",

    "fullText": "International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry says it must \"be better\" on climate change after receiving a petition signed by more than 21,000 people who want to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports.\n\nThe petition - delivered on Wednesday and with athletes among the signatories - comes as Italy's Eni, one of the world's seven biggest oil companies, is a 'premium partner' of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIt follows reports that the number of countries which could reliably host a Winter Olympics will hugely reduce in the future because of climate change.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether she is disappointed by the Games having high-carbon sponsors, Coventry said: \"It's really nice athletes have a platform to speak up.\n\n\"The petition, I know they met with our team today and we are having conversations in order to be better, and for our stakeholders to be better. But that takes time.\"\n\nChristophe Dubi, the IOC executive director for the Olympic Games, added: \"We make a point to receive those petitions, and we have to recognise climate is a challenge for all of us.\n\n\"What we have to do as an organisation is to be at the forefront of sustainability, and our principles are very clear.\"\n\nOne area the IOC is aiming to make the Olympics more sustainable is having Games take place over a wider area with more pre-existing facilities, and Coventry said Milan-Cortina is an acid test for whether this is a viable future.\n\nMilan-Cortina takes place in three hubs spread across northern Italy - in Milan, Cortina and Livigno - with only two newly built sporting facilities: the Santagiulia ice hockey arena and Cortina Sliding Centre.\n\nThe next two Winter Olympics - French Alps 2030 and Utah 2034 - will also have sports spread more widely, while the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane is will have venues across Queensland.\n\nThis has caused issues however, with Brisbane organisers saying, external they will go beyond the originally stated budget of $4.9bn (£3.6bn).\n\n\"We are really experiencing a spread out Games here for the first time - we are going to learn a lot,\" Coventry said.\n\n\"We have taken this decision for sustainability reasons, climate and not having to have new venues. We are seeing there is an impact on National Olympic Committees because of the spreadness [sic], also for broadcast and media, making it harder to get around.\n\n\"What is really cool is that you get to see iconic venues in beautiful places - but now we have to weigh this up, the balance between a spread games for sustainability reasons but not shifting complexity and sustainability to different areas.\"\n\nWhile the action got underway on Wednesday with the start of the curling events, the 2026 Winter Olympics will officially start with the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nCoventry said she hoped all nations would be treated with respect by spectators, including the USA team amid criticism from Italian authorities about the presence of ICE agents in Milan.\n\n\"I hope the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as a chance to be respectful,\" she said.\n\n\"For me, when we went to the Olympic village that is the best reminder of how the Games should be. I hope the opening ceremony will do that.\"\n\nFear and Hall named 2026 Team GB flagbearers\n\nRussian athletes linked to pro-war activity\n\nQuiz: Name every sport at the 2026 Winter Olympics",

    "description": "The \"Today\" anchor stepped away from Milano Cortina coverage as her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, remains missing",
    "fullText": "Sports commentator and former tennis player Mary Carillo will replace Savannah Guthrie as co-host of the NBC’s Opening Ceremony for the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games after the “Today” host pulled out, following her mother’s disappearance.\n\nGuthrie had been originally scheduled to host the Opening Ceremony with Terry Gannon, who will remain on. Ahmed Fareed will now host “Olympic Late Night” from Feb. 7 to 9, replacing Craig Melvin.\n\nMelvin will remain stateside rather than traveling to Milan for the Games.\n\n“Our hearts go out to Savannah and the entire Guthrie family. They continue to have our full support,” said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. “We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talented commentators who will step in and fill these roles.”\n\n“Mary is one of the most experienced Olympic commentators ever and a master storyteller,” she added. “She and Terry will lead the American audience through one of the world’s greatest global moments. With his skill and versatility, Ahmed has proven time and again he can step into any hosting role, and we’re thrilled he’s available to handle our late night coverage before heading to Los Angeles for NBA All-Star Weekend.”\n\nThe Milan Games will be Carillo’s 17th Olympics that she has covered — she was already scheduled to be a correspondent in Milan. Of Italian descent herself, the commentator has a personal connection with the host city. This year will be her 14th Olympic assignment with NBC.\n\nAs previously announced, Shaun White will join the Opening Ceremony commentators in the booth during the Parade of Athletes. Following her Opening Ceremony duties, Carillo will cover the Games as a SportsDesk reporter.\n\nGuthrie’s 84-year-old mother Nancy has been missing since late Saturday night. The case has escalated from a missing-person to a suspected abduction with authorities saying they found signs of forced entry in her Arizona home.\n\nLive coverage of the Opening Ceremony begins Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, with primetime coverage scheduled for 8 p.m. ET/PT on both NBC and Peacock.\n\nThe post NBC Sports Taps Mary Carillo to Fill In for Savannah Guthrie at Winter Olympics appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Michigan football went 9-4 in 2025 despite having a lot going on behind the scenes. The hope with new head coach Kyle Whittingham leading the charge is that the Wolverines won't just rebound, they'll thrive.\n\nBut given the schedule, it will be something of an uphill battle for the maize and blue.\n\nMichigan will play Ohio State, Oregon, Indiana, Penn State, Iowa, Oklahoma, and more in 2026, with the first two matchups mentioned being on the road. Even so, CBS Sports' Brad Crawford (who usually isn't effusive in praise for the maize and blue) is optimistic about Whittingham's first year in Ann Arbor.\n\nIn Crawford's too-early CFP 12-team projection, the Wolverines make the cut as the 10-seed, meaning that they would be 12th overall and face Texas Tech, with the winner of the game set to face Indiana.\n\nAn early season win over Oklahoma win come in clutch for first-year Michigan coach Kyle Whittingham, who has more assets with the Wolverines than he ever possessed at Utah. Whittingham often gets the most out of his roster, and with enhanced resources, he should quickly push Michigan back in the playoff conversation. In this scenario as the 10-seed, the Wolverines would become the playoff's second-ever three-loss team, but first to not reach their league title game to get in. The losses? Oregon, Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nHaving three losses in the 2026 season wouldn't be a surprise given the perceived strength of schedule. However, making it into the 12-team invitational without losing that third game in the Big Ten Championship Game would be a bit of a surprise, given that no one has made it in with a 9-3 record before.\n\nCould that equate to a successful season? Making the playoff but with losses to Ohio State, Oregon, and Indiana? Perhaps, but most likely not in Michigan fans' eyes. Even if the schedule is more daunting this year than last.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: CBS Sports projects Michigan football to 2026 College Football Playoff",

    "description": "The Washington Post has laid off one-third of its staff, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage.",
    "fullText": "A sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nThe Washington Post laid off one-third of its staff Wednesday, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a widespread purge that represented a brutal blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.\n\nThe Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, called the move painful but necessary to put the outlet on stronger footing and weather changes in technology and user habits. “We can’t be everything to everyone,” Murray said in a note to staff members.\n\nHe outlined the changes in a companywide online meeting, and staff members then began getting emails with one of two subject lines — telling them their role was or was not eliminated.\n\nRumors of layoffs had circulated for weeks, ever since word leaked that sports reporters who had expected to travel to Italy for the Winter Olympics would not be going. But when official word came down, the size and scale of the cuts were shocking, affecting virtually every department in the newsroom.\n\n“It’s just devastating news for anyone who cares about journalism in America and, in fact, the world,” said Margaret Sullivan, a Columbia University journalism professor and former media columnist at the Post and The New York Times. “The Washington Post has been so important in so many ways, in news coverage, sports and cultural coverage.”\n\nMartin Baron, the Post’s first editor under its current owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, condemned his former boss and called what has happened at the newspaper “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nAs of midday, the Post did not have any news of the changes on its website.\n\nBezos, who has been silent in recent weeks amid pleas from Post journalists to step in and prevent the cutbacks, had no immediate comment Wednesday.\n\nThe newspaper has been bleeding subscribers in part due to decisions made by Bezos, including pulling back from an endorsement of Kamala Harris, a Democrat, during the 2024 presidential election against Donald Trump, a Republican, and directing a more conservative turn on liberal opinion pages.\n\nA private company, the Post does not reveal how many subscribers it has, but it is believed to be roughly 2 million. The Post would also not say how many people it has on staff, making it impossible to estimate how many people were laid off Wednesday. The Post also did not outline its finances.\n\nThe Post’s troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products such as games and its Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade.\n\nEliminating the sports section puts an end to a department that has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, among them John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser. The Times has also largely ended its sports section, but it has replaced the coverage by buying The Athletic and incorporating its work into the Times website.\n\nThe Post’s Book World, a destination for book reviews, literary news and author interviews, has been a dedicated section in its Sunday paper.\n\nA half-century ago, the Post’s coverage of Watergate, led by intrepid reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, entered the history books. The Style section under longtime Executive Editor Ben Bradlee hosted some of the country’s best feature writing.\n\nWord of specific cuts drifted out during the day, as when Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker announced on X that she had been laid off, along with all of the newspaper’s Middle East correspondents and editors. “Hard to understand the logic,” she wrote.\n\nIn the immediate future, Murray said, the Post would concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness and impact, and resonate with readers, including politics, national affairs and security. Even during its recent troubles, the Post has been notably aggressive in coverage of Trump’s changes to the federal workforce.\n\nThe company’s structure is rooted in a different era, when the Post was a dominant print product, Murray said in his note to staff members. In areas such as video, the outlet hasn’t kept up with consumer habits, he said.\n\n“Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”\n\nWhile there are business areas that need to be addressed, Baron pointed a finger of blame at Bezos — for a “gutless” order to kill a presidential endorsement and for remaking an editorial page that stands out only for “moral infirmity” and “sickening” efforts to curry favor with Trump.\n\n“Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,” Baron wrote. “In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.”\n\nBaron said he was grateful for Bezos’ support when he was editor, noting that the Amazon founder came under brutal pressure from Trump during the president’s first term.\n\n“He spoke forcefully and eloquently of a free press and The Post’s mission, demonstrating his commitment in concrete terms,” Baron wrote. “He often declared that The Post’s success would be among the proudest achievements of his life. I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.”\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

    "fullText": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is conducting widespread layoffs.\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray wrote in a Wednesday memo that the \"substantial newsroom reductions\" would impact \"nearly all news departments.\"\n\nThe layoffs impacted hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nMurray told staff on a Wednesday morning call that the cuts were part of a strategic reset, according to an audio recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMurray said the changes included \"closing the sports department in its current form.\"\n\n\"We plan to retain several reporters to join features and cover sports as a cultural and societal phenomenon, as well as several folks to staff the print sports section,\" he added.\n\nMurray said impacted teams included audio and journalists who cover books, the DC metro area, and foreign affairs.\n\n\"A few products will be discontinued — among the most significant, we will be closing the book section and will be suspending the Post Reports podcast,\" Murray said.\n\nThe publication's San Francisco bureau was also heavily hit, one Post insider said.\n\nIn his memo, Murray wrote that for the immediate future, the paper would concentrate on \"areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers.\"\n\n\"These layoffs are not inevitable,\" the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. \"A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach, and its future.\"\n\nFormer executive editor Martin Baron wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"there were acute business problems that had to be addressed\" during \"a period of head-spinning change in media consumption.\" Baron added that the \"Post's challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nDonald Graham, the Post's former publisher, wrote in a Facebook post that he was saddened by the loss of \"so many excellent reporters and editors\" and that he would \"have to learn a new way to read the paper,\" as he had \"started with the sports page since the late 1940's.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nThis new round of layoffs follows a series of recent shake-ups at the 148-year-old newspaper.\n\nEarly last year, the company told its opinions desk that columnists should refocus their coverage to two pillars: \"personal liberties\" and \"free markets.\"\n\nIn March, the Post reorganized its newsroom in a push to shift away from \"commodity news.\" It then offered buy-outs to staffers in May.\n\nLast year's personnel shifts arrived shortly after the Washington Post came under fire from some readers for its decision to skip endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, breaking from a 35-year tradition. Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump.\n\nOver 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were \"deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave.\"\n\nThe Post's staff reductions arrive at a challenging moment for the media industry.\n\nSome brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.\n\nThe New York Times, long seen as the 800-pound gorilla in the newspaper business, saw its shares sink about 14% on Monday as investors fretted about increased costs.",

Its consistency was reflected in the latest edition of the USA TODAY Coaches Poll, released Tuesday.\n\nThe Tigers remained at No. 5 in this week's poll. The top stayed the same with UConn, UCLA, South Carolina and Texas going one through four. Vanderbilt, after suffering its second-consecutive loss this week, dropped two spots to No. 8. Louisville and Michigan each climbed to No. 6 and 7, respectively.\n\nLSU returned to the PMAC on January 26 for three straight home games last week. It defeated Florida, Arkansas and Alabama each by over 20 points. Sunday against Alabama, LSU exploded in the second half for a 40-point win. The Crimson Tide fell to No. 23 in the coaches poll.\n\nThis week, LSU has another chance to climb the rankings and boost its chances at getting a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament bracketology. It travels to Austin to take on the Longhorns on Thursday, then to Auburn for a Sunday afternoon tipoff.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Where LSU women's basketball ranks in latest USA TODAY Coaches Poll",

    "fullText": "It’s pretty safe the say that the general sentiment around college football is that Notre Dame will make its return to the College Football Playoff in 2026.\n\nThe Irish were left out of this year’s 12-team event, as many believed that they deserved to be in. After what we saw unfold, it was pretty safe to say that Notre Dame should have been in, as it very well could have won it all.\n\nAs for this coming season, CBS Sports Brad Crawford released his way-too-early CFP bracket projection, and he’s got the Irish as the No. 2 seed. Miami, one of Notre Dame’s opponents, takes the to spot, so it seems like whoever loses that game finds their footing once again. Texas and Indiana round out his top-4.\n\nIn this scenario, the Irish would take on the winner of the 7 vs. 10 matchup as Crawford has Texas A&M and Oregon battling it out in the first round. Overall, it’s an interesting take, with four Big Ten and SEC teams, Texas Tech making it again and Memphis as the Group of 5 team.\n\nIt will be interesting to come back to this when the regular season is over, but it doesn’t seem like the worst field considering which teams are participating.\n\nWay-Too-Early College Football Playoff projection for the 2026 season, via @BCrawford247 👀\n\nWhat would you change?\n\n🔗 https://t.co/QnshRG871e pic.twitter.com/Dlc3J28sIW\n\n— CBS Sports College Football 🏈 (@CBSSportsCFB) February 3, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: What seed is Notre Dame in CBS Sports early 2026 CFP projection?",

    "fullText": "Winning the Super Bowl and hoisting the Lombardi trophy as confetti rains down has always been considered the stuff of dreams. It’s one of the most coveted championships in all of sports. It’s what children emulate when they organize backyard football games, and Tom Brady is doing his best to remind both Sam Darnold and Drake Maye of that ahead of their respective debuts at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGiven the fact that he’s both won and lost more Super Bowls than most players will ever sniff throughout their careers, it’s safe to say that there’s no better person to humor before venturing into the gridiron’s grandest game than the former New England Patriot. Although it’s just as important to remember that, while confidence and encouragement are key, the hardcold truth is that not everybody can be Brady.\n\n“The reality is that the best team, in a one-game series, doesn’t always win,”he noted to Colin Cowherd during his most recent interview. “In football, you really only have one chance to get it right. That’s the challenge. You could have an off day,” he added.\n\nIn highlighting the Los Angeles Rams’ botched punt against the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, Brady suggested that it doesn’t take much to give your opponent “all of the momentum,” and that those moments happen incredibly fast. “That’s how finicky the game is,” he suggested.\n\nWhile it may be a bit funny to hear the most successful signal caller in NFL history refer to his former profession as being “finicky,” it’s also a testament to just how much the Super Bowl means to players. In other words, those being the ones of Brady’s former Super Bowl rival, the star tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce, “Losing a Super Bowl will never make you want to go back and win one.”\n\nIf anything, knowing that you only get one shot at cementing your name in the analogs of American sporting culture makes things that much harder. “That’s why I always think basketball, baseball, a seven-game series, does identify the best team, because you get seven chances to get it right,” Brady suggests.\n\nEven if this eventually proves to be neither Darnold nor Maye’s last Super Bowl appearance, both men are well aware that they won’t get a second opportunity at winning their championship debut. Throw in the fact that both teams feature a top-five defense from a points allowed perspective, and it’s safe to say that both of these quarterbacks know that their margin for error on Sunday will be painfully slim.\n\nThen again, that’s yet another one of the many things that make the Super Bowl the biggest game of the year, and we simply wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nThe post “You Could Have an Off Day”: Tom Brady Warns Sam Darnold and Drake Maye Ahead of Super Bowl 2015 Rematch appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Disney's next CEO often sports a similar look to that of longtime leader Bob Iger. Experts weigh in on the pros and cons of dressing like your boss.",
    "fullText": "Disney's new CEO is sending a wink with his wardrobe, whether he means to or not.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, who takes the helm of the Mouse House next month, has drawn attention for dressing much like his soon-to-be predecessor, Bob Iger. Both men regularly don sweaters over collared shirts and have a penchant for jackets paired with white dress shirts. At a celebration for Disney's 70th Anniversary last year, the pair sported button-downs and dark slacks.\n\nWhile D'Amaro may just have a natural affinity for the same kind of attire that Iger sports, leadership experts say the similar look projects continuity to Disney's stakeholders. The familiarity may resonate at Disney, where Iger has led the company on and off for nearly two decades — though it raises a question of whether the rest of us should dress like the leaders we hope to one day succeed.\n\n\"You want to avoid looking like a carbon copy of the person,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International in Chicago. \"But there are elements that you want to keep if you can.\"\n\nThose elements should be modest, akin to how Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn't deviate too far from the black turtleneck and jeans his predecessor Steve Jobs regularly wore, suggested Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\nA few years ago, she said a client of hers from a Fortune 200 retailer went overboard by wearing the same distinctive jewelry as his boss. When she met with his peers for feedback on his performance, several described him as a copycat.\n\n\"It really hurt him,\" said Eggers. \"We coached him, and he eventually lost his jewelry.\"\n\nStill, there can be benefits to mimicking a higher-up's sense of fashion when done subtly, added Akubuiro. \"People have a tendency to like people who are more like them,\" he said.\n\nJust keep in mind the fuzzy warm feeling may be temporary.\n\n\"It's effective as a bridge maybe, but not as a destination,\" said Eggers. \"Eventually, leadership credibility has to stand on its own.\"\n\nD'Amaro, who started at Disney in 1998 as a Disneyland business planner, faces a challenging road ahead no matter what he wears. He's tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nA post shared by Robert Iger (@robertiger)\n\nWhile D'Amaro's fashion style is similar to Iger's, Akubuiro said the business-casual look has also made sense for his role as a park executive.\n\n\"This is kind of the uniform of someone walking around the parks, and so it gives him a very accessible feel,\" Akubuiro said. \"When you're making a change, that accessibility is something that actually brings people in and gives them some confidence.\"",

    "fullText": "Florida football finds itself right in the middle of the SEC pack in CBS Sports' power rankings for the 2026 season, a reflection of both uncertainty and quiet optimism surrounding the program entering Jon Sumrall's first year with the Orange and Blue.\n\nCBS Sports' Brandon Marcello slotted the Gators 10th in the SEC, placing Florida firmly in the conference's crowded middle tier following a chaotic transfer portal cycle and a full coaching reset.\n\nSumrall inherited a group that needed significant turnover, and that context matters. Florida lost key contributors to the portal, rebuilt large portions of its depth chart and is still sorting out several position battles heading into spring practice.\n\nCBS Sports pointed specifically to quarterback uncertainty, noting the compeition between Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo and Tramell Jones Jr. as a storyline that could ultimately swing Florida's ceiling one way or another.\n\nIt's simply too early to make definitive judgements. Spring practices, sumeer development and continued roster movement will reshape the conference landscape before fall arrives. For Florida, that means the current ranking by CBS Sports should be viewed more as a snapshot than a verdict.\n\nFor now, the Gators are positioned as a team with something to prove.\n\nHere is everything Marcello wrote about Florida and why he ranked them at No. 10 in the SEC power rankings.\n\n\"Jon Sumrall arrives with a major rebuild on his hands in Gainesville. The former Tulane and Troy coach has never won less than 10 games in a single season, but make sure to temper your expectations for Year 1 in the SEC. He had to overhaul a roster depleted by transfers, and we don't quite know what to expect with Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo battling Tramell Jones Jr. at quarterback.\n\n\"Still, Sumrall has the magic touch and knows how to build rosters. He also hired a top-tier staff. The Gators could be in the top half of the SEC this season, but we need to see more this spring and summer to better gauge the Gators.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.",

    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "fullText": "Florida basketball's brutal home loss to the Auburn Tigers two weeks ago is well in the rearview mirror after a pair of superlative performances — a 47-point beatdown of the South Carolina Gamecocks on the road, followed by an epic victory in the O'Dome against the Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nAs a result of the Gators' plus-70 margin of victory over the last two games, Todd Golden finds his team up five spots in the latest USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll at No. 16. That puts the Orange and Blue between the No. 15 Vanderbilt Commodores and No. 17 Virginia Cavaliers.\n\nThat kick in the pants at home appears to have given Florida a wake-up call, and now the Gators have put the rest of the SEC — and college basketball — on notice with nine games remaining on the regular-season schedule.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference once again has only four member schools in this week's poll, with Vanderbilt hanging onto their league-high No. 15 ranking. Florida is right behind them at No. 16, followed by the Arkansas Razorbacks, who fell five spots to No. 21, and the Texas A&M Aggies, who entered the rankings for the first time this season at No. 25.\n\nAlabama fell out of the top 25, and now follows the de facto No. 27 Tennessee Volunteers (55 votes) with 15 votes. The Kentucky Wildcats continue to cling to their nine votes while the Georgia Bulldogs earned a pair this week.\n\nIowa 52; Tennessee 50; UCF 15; Alabama 15; Villanova 13; Kentucky 9; North Carolina State 4; Utah State 2; Georgia 2; Saint Mary's 1\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida basketball USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll ranking up after win",

    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans are coming off a dismal season that led to a massive overhaul of the organization. Gone is Brian Callahan, and most of his staff, and the Titans have a new head coach in Robert Saleh. But that doesn’t mean that Tennessee didn't have some highlights.\n\nOne of those that marked Callahan’s last victory as Titans’ head coach, and much like the majority of his tenure, it was a fluke. Incredibly, this victory over the Arizona Cardinals was so improbable that it landed on CBS Sports' top 25 stories of the 2025 season.\n\n22. Tennessee Titans at Arizona Cardinals, Week 5: Cardinals, Jonathan Gannon, Kyler Murray, Emari Demercado collapse\n\nThis one requires us to go back quite a bit, but the butterfly effect is startling. The Cardinals, up 21-3 at home against the then-winless Tennessee Titans, suffered one of the wildest and most inexcusable collapses in recent memory en route to a 22-21 defeat.\n\nAlthough the Cardinals basically handed the Titans the victory, Tennessee looked competitive in the fourth quarter and made the plays necessary for the win, with Cam Ward making some big-time throws to give them a chance.\n\nThe Titans would go on to fire Callahan a couple of weeks later, with the win being the highlight of his final weeks in Nashville. But for that week, the football gods looked down on the Titans and gave them a memorable moment in the 2025 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Titans improbable victory over Cardinals one of the top stories in 2025",

    "fullText": "Rangers are interested in completing a deal for Southampton striker Cameron Archer before next Monday’s transfer deadline, according to Sky Sports journalist Mark McAdam. Rangers manager Danny Rohl wants attacking reinforcements at the Ibrox club and the Bears have been linked with Hansa Rostock striker Ryan Naderi. They have offered a new bid of around €3.6 million and a sell-on clause for him, but, the German club do not want to lose him. Rangers are now looking at other options to bring to the Ibrox club before the deadline.\n\nRangers also have Leeds United striker Joel Piroe on their radar, and Archer has emerged as the latest player to be linked with the Bears. The 24-year-old has four goals in 23 games for the Saints this term after notching five goals in 40 appearances last term. Archer has proven himself in the Championship, with 20 league goals to his name across three seasons in the division. The Aston Villa star had earlier loan spells at Preston North End and Middlesbrough and will bring enough experience to the Rangers attack having also featured for the likes of Sheffield United and Solihull Moors.\n\nSouthampton are hoping to secure a return to the Premier League at the end of the season and it remains to be seen whether they will be open to losing one of their key players. Rangers are desperate to get a deal for a new striker over the line before the deadline to boost their chances of pipping Hearts and Celtic to the Scottish Premiership title. They are just four points behind league leaders Hearts after 23 matches and having a stronger squad would come in handy in the coming games as the top-three battle for the top prize.",

    "fullText": "Sunday, February 8, will be a legendary day for sports fans because of Super Bowl LX, and the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games will be happening on the same day. But also for NBC and their streaming platform, Peacock, as they will be presenting both events live all day in 4K HDR. Via a press release, this will mark the first time a Super Bowl and Olympic Games will be presented in 4K HDR on the NBC broadcast network and the Peacock.\n\nIn a statement, Rick Cordella, President of NBC Sports, believes that because February will be a huge month for sports for the network, they feel obligated to deliver the best viewing experience possible.\n\n“When you’re about to present the biggest month in U.S. sports media history, you want to make sure you’re giving fans the best experience possible – so that’s exactly what we have planned on NBC and Peacock for Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, and NBA All-Star Weekend,” said Cordella. “Building on NBC Sports’ long-standing commitment to innovation across all platforms, we’ll be celebrating the action on the field, slopes, and court with our signature storytelling, state-of-the-art production, and dynamic streaming features that together bring these incredible sporting events to life for audiences at home.”\n\nThe platform will be presenting other innovations with their Olympic coverage by expanding their Multiview feature to mobile, which activates a four-box vertical display that showcases the top four events at any given time. Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming, states Peacock leads the industry in preesnting high profile events due to their infrastructure.\n\n“Peacock is the first streamer to deliver major live sports at this scale, seamlessly presenting many simultaneous events, with millions of people coming to the platform at once, over several days,” said Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming. “This impressive performance is possible because of Peacock’s industry-leading infrastructure that supports unmatched reliability, especially under peak demand.”\n\nPeacock’s February doesn’t stop with the Olympics and the Super Bowl, as for the first time in over 20 years, NBC will produce NBA All-Star Weekend onsite in Los Angeles.",

    "fullText": "Eddie Hall has found himself in the ring with two influencers again, this time in another unusual 2 vs 1 boxing match.\n\nHall, who made his name as a Strongman competitor, has spent the last few years exploring different combat sports, including arm wrestling and boxing.\n\nThis past year, he finally stepped into an MMA cage, picking up a controversial win over Mariusz Pudzianowski after dedicating years to training for the sport.\n\nSeveral months on from that fight, Hall’s latest move sees him back in another strange setup.\n\nFollowing his quick success in MMA, it seemed inevitable that the 38-year-old would continue in the sport, and would potentially take on former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, who continues to look for a fight.\n\nHowever, since then, there hasn’t been much news about Hall’s next move in combat sports. But he’s still finding ways to stay active and grab attention with some unusual ventures.\n\nJust recently, a video made the rounds on social media showing Hall stepping into another two vs one boxing match against a pair of influencers.\n\nThis wasn’t new territory for Hall. Back in 2024, he knocked out two featherweights at once during what many called a ‘freak fight’.\n\nBut this latest fight didn’t go as smoothly as that one did. One of his opponents was Dean Alex (Dean.dodd online), who regularly takes on odd challenges set by his 750,000 followers.\n\nThe other was Kristen Hanby, whose prank videos have built him an audience of 8.2 million people online.\n\nDuring the fight, Dodd took several knockdowns from Hall but also managed to land a few clean shots himself. Fortunately for both Dodd and Hanby, it was all light-hearted sparring rather than anything meant to cause real harm.\n\nIt’s looking more and more likely that Hall will be back in the MMA cage before the end of the year.\n\nHowever, with influencer boxing on the rise, there’s also a chance his next appearance could come back inside the ring rather than under MMA rules.",

    "fullText": "Grassroots sports groups across the West Midlands have welcomed government funding to help improve their facilities.\n\nLast year, 991 projects across the UK received money through the Multi-Sport Grassroots Facilities Programme to improve things like floodlights, goalposts and all-weather pitches.\n\nA new round of funding has now opened and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has invited community organisations to apply for a share of an £85m grant.\n\nFor football groups in Herefordshire and Warwickshire, the funds they were previously awarded had a massive impact on the children they support.\n\nIn total, clubs in Coventry and Warwickshire received more than £310,000 to upgrade their facilities.\n\nThe funding ranged from just under £250,000 for new changing rooms at Racing Club Warwick, to just over £1,000 for Upper Lighthorne Football Club for new goalposts.\n\nNuneaton-based Camp Hill Educational Sports and Social, better known as Chess FC, was awarded £6,017 to buy portable floodlights for their training pitches at Hill Top Playing Fields in Arley.\n\nClub chairperson Ian Andrew said it meant their eight junior teams, including an under-15 girls side, could train anywhere on the surface at night and in all weathers.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"They love coming along in the evening. It's pitch black and they've got the chance to run around and feel like professional footballers playing under lights.\"\n\nRacing Club Warwick received just under £250,000 to build new changing rooms at their Townsend Meadow ground.\n\nClub chairman Gary Vella said: \"When you've got a 3G pitch and you've got game after game, particularly for juniors, you need changing facilities. The women's game, disability football, all need their own changing areas, so this will help push us on.\"\n\nNearly £60,000 was given to 16 clubs across Herefordshire and Worcestershire and the DCMS said the money was aimed at giving families affordable ways to stay healthy.\n\nDavid Pembridge, from Wessington Juniors FC in Hereford, said: \"Throughout Herefordshire there's a massive shortage of indoor facilities.\n\n\"It's very costly so any time that you're hiring indoor facilities, which could be anything from £50 an hour, when you've got 11 teams, that quickly racks up to thousands and thousands which makes it less affordable for parents.\"\n\nThe group was awarded a grant to provide portable floodlights\n\nHe added: \"Every winter since we have been able to continue training outside in almost all weathers, when the clocks change it doesn't mean football stops it means that we can carry on and the children still get their weekly fix of football.\"\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"This is sport delivering for the nation. Every pound we invest in grassroots facilities is a pound that takes pressure off our NHS, supports mental and physical health, and opens doors for new community members to benefit from sport - like women and girls who've been shut out for too long.\"\n\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.\n\nEngland inspire women footballers of the future\n\nFoundation to increase free football for adults\n\nGrassroots football teams get government funding\n\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport",

    "fullText": "Wonder what Caitlin Clark thinks about the confusion surrounding Austin Reaves' imminent return to the Lakers lineup? Or whether Jeanie Buss has turned on LeBron James? Or if she has nothing but praise for Luka Doncic?\n\nTune in to the Lakers' matchup against the New York Knicks on the NBC Sports debut of “Basketball Night in America” on Sunday night to find out. Clark, the uber-popular WNBA star, will serve an analyst on the pregame show, beginning at 3 p.m. PT, one hour before tipoff.\n\nShould Reaves return Friday or Sunday after missing a month with a left calf strain, it would mark only the seventh time the guard has played together with James and Doncic. That might be the first topic addressed by Clark, who will join the studio team of Maria Taylor and three former NBA stars: Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady.\n\nExpectations that Reaves would take the floor Wednesday in a nationally televised game against the Cleveland Cavaliers were heightened Tuesday when ESPN insider Shams Charania posted on X that the Lakers guard would be “available to return to the lineup on Wednesday.”\n\nA few moments later, however, the post was deleted with no explanation and the Lakers' injury report lists Reaves as out.\n\nClark might stick to lauding Doncic, considering that the superstar NBA guard complimented her game in 2024, saying \"that’s the women’s Steph Curry. She can shoot it better than me.”\n\nClark, who attended Iowa, is the all-time leading scorer in NCAA history. In two seasons with the Indiana Fever, she was named WNBA Rookie of the Year and is a two-time All-Star despite missing much of the 2025 season with a severe groin injury.\n\n“Caitlin is one of the most captivating players and dynamic scorers in basketball,” NBC Sports Executive Producer Sam Flood said in a statement. “We’re excited to have Caitlin join Hall of Famers Melo, Vince, Tracy and Reggie in New York for the launch of Sunday Night Basketball.”\n\nThe Lakers-Knicks game will begin a doubleheader that also includes the Oklahoma City Thunder facing the Denver Nuggets.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

TV shows and movies follow story beats, meaning you can usually get a sense for where things are heading, but sports do not work that way. The totally unexpected can, and does, frequently occur—and that's the reason people keep tuning in, whether their team is dominating or an underdog.\n\nSometimes, though, you can't catch the game live, but still want a bit of that feeling. That's why leagues offer extended highlights, featuring all the key moments, complete with the commentary from the broadcast. These can feel almost like watching the full game, and I love catching up with them the next day alongside my morning coffee. The problem: you'll typically find those videos on sites full of spoilers about who won, whether that's via a scoreboard at the top of the site or headlines blaring the results. If you're hoping for even a fraction of the fun of watching sports live, that's a problem.\n\nDon't Tell Me The Score is your solution. This simple website offers highlights for NFL, NHL, MLB, and NBA games, with no scores or spoilers of any kind. The site interface shows only a bunch of icons representing all upcoming and recent games. Color logos means there are highlights are already available, and you can click or tap to start watching.\n\nThis is my favorite way to catch up on games I missed. The videos, which are sourced from the league's official YouTube channels, tend to be a little over 10 minutes, meaning you'll see the highs and lows, but it won't take up hours of your day, and you won't know who won going in (provided you've also taken care to avoid spoilers via the TV, newspapers, social media, push notifications, or ill-timed texts from friends).\n\nThis tends to work really well, with one big hiccup: NFL videos can't be watched on the site itself, as the NFL prevents their highlights from being embedded on other sites. This means you'll need to click a link to watch the highlights on YouTube's website. This is a little annoying, but the YouTube pages usually don't include spoilers either, as long as you steer clear of the comments.\n\nI wish more leagues were supported—soccer highlights aren't offered at all, for example, and neither are the increasingly popular women's leagues. But if you're a fan of one of the \"big four\" North American sports, like watching highlights, and don't want to get spoiled first, Don't Tell Me The Score is worth adding to your daily rotation.",

That was Les Rennais wish in any case. Even in the event of an agreement being reached with another club, they had set retaining Jacquet on loan until the end of the season as one of the terms that would have to be agreed.\n\nHis future remains up in the air. But, as per Sky Sports, a preference has emerged. It is understood that Jacquet favours a move to Stamford Bridge. That is despite the interest expressed by other clubs.

    "description": "The stadium, home to the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks, will begin selling the hemp-derived drinks next month",
    "fullText": "The United Center in Chicago will become the first major U.S. sports venue to offer THC-infused drinks during events, reflecting a growing demand for non-alcoholic alternatives.\n\nThe arena — home to the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks — announced the move on Tuesday in a joint statement with RYTHM, a local beverage company.\n\nThe company inked a multi-year deal with the stadium to sell its drink, called Señorita, which contains hemp-derived THC, to guests 21 and older at live events, including concerts. The beverages, however, will not be available at sporting events due to league regulations.\n\n\"We are excited to introduce Señorita and RYTHM to the live entertainment space,” Joe Myhra, the chief operating officer at United Center, said in the release. “As we continue to evolve offerings for our guests, RYTHM’s Chicago roots made its beverage line a natural fit for the United Center experience.”\n\nSeñorita, which includes five milligrams of THC per drink, will become available for purchase at the stadium beginning in February.\n\n“Bringing Señorita and RYTHM to the United Center reflects a simple truth: consumers want non-alcoholic options, and leading venues are responding,” Ben Kovler, the CEO of RYTHM, said in the release.\n\n“The United Center is one of the world’s premier venues and continues to set the standard for live entertainment with the introduction of these modern, responsible options,” he added.\n\nThe announcement comes as demand for alcoholic beverages has fallen to a record low in the U.S., according to an August Gallup poll. In the survey, 54 percent of Americans reported consuming alcohol, marking the lowest share since 1939. The trend is largely driven by younger adults.\n\nAt the same time, young Americans are increasingly unwinding with weed drinks.\n\nIn an August poll by Drug Rehab USA, 66 percent of Gen Z and Millennial respondents said they had tried alternatives to alcohol in the past six months, with 24 percent saying they had “at least partially” substituted alcohol with non-alcoholic or cannabis-infused drinks.",

    "fullText": "Now nearly a full month into 2026, college basketball teams are into the thick of their conference schedules. UNC, which secured a huge road upset of rival Virginia on Saturday, is in the top half of what's shaping up to be a deep ACC.\n\nNorth Carolina (16-4, 4-3 ACC) rolled through non-conference play with a 12-1 record, securing wins against fellow blue bloods Kansas and Kentucky. The Tar Heels hit an impasse to begin ACC play, losing their first three conference road games, but squeaked by Wake Forest at home and dominated Notre Dame.\n\nUNC has plenty more season ahead, with a third-straight NCAA Tournament appearance increasingly likely. In USA TODAY Sports' January 26 bracketology, released earlier Tuesday, North Carolina is a 5-seed in the East Region.\n\nUSAT projects the Tar Heels facing 12-seeded Belmont in Tampa, Fla. Joining UNC and the Bruins are 4-seed, reigning national champion Florida and 2023 Final Four squad Florida Atlantic.\n\nNorth Carolina and Belmont, the latter a member of the Missouri Valley Conference, previously played in November 2013. If you attended that game at the Dean Dome, you likely still have memories of a painful upset etched in your mind.\n\nAfter dropping consecutive games at Stanford and Cal on their West Coast swing, the Tar Heels are now winners of two straight. Derek Dixon is a key in the starting lineup, Caleb Wilson remains a superstar and head coach Hubert Davis is now playing his best rotations.\n\nUNC has all the pieces to make a National Championship run. Can North Carolina continue to play at its current pace, rise through the ACC and be college basketball's last team standing in April?\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC basketball projected the East's 5 seed in USAT Sports bracketology",

    "fullText": "Independiente Santa Fe continues to add young talent to its sports project for the 2026 season. In recent hours, it was confirmed that Kilian Toscano, a 21-year-old midfielder, will join the \"Cardenal\" squad after reaching a loan agreement with Atlético Nacional. The young player, who is looking to establish himself in the capital, arrives with the mission of bringing balance and dynamism to the midfield of the team led by Pablo Peirano.\n\nDespite his young age, Toscano is no rookie in professional football. The midfielder already boasts 39 official matches, the vast majority of them wearing the verdolaga jersey, where he demonstrated his abilities in ball recovery and initiating play. Additionally, his talent led him to participate in several processes with the Colombia U-20 National Team during the Argentina 2023 World Cup cycle, although he ultimately was not included in the final squad for the global event.\n\nThis move represents the first change of scenery for Toscano, who completed his entire youth development in Medellín. For Santa Fe, the addition of the young player responds to the need to refresh the squad with promising players who are already familiar with the demands of big clubs. The footballer is expected to join training at the Tenjo facility immediately to compete for a spot in the starting eleven before the league begins.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "A sports nutritionist for NBA champs explains why athletes stop drinking water after 4 p.m. to optimize hydration and perform their best.",
    "fullText": "NBA champions don't have time for morning brain fog or an afternoon slump.\n\nTheir secret to staying sharp all day long: perfectly-timed water breaks, according to a top sports nutritionist.\n\nMatt Jones, who worked with the Boston Celtics during their 2024 NBA Championship-winning season and advises the supplement brand Cadence, said the pros have mastered the art of optimal hydration.\n\n\"Fueling intentionally is probably one of the biggest things we can take from the world of professional sport,\" he told Business Insider. \"Professional athletes are very good at repeating basic behaviors like hydrating, and it's those routines that allow them to perform to the best of their ability.\"\n\nIf you want to level up your hydration game, start paying attention to how much you drink and when, Jones recommends.\n\nAfter years of experience coaching elite athletes and military professionals, he has five key tips for getting enough water and electrolytes for better performance throughout the day.\n\nStaying hydrated makes a big difference to your brain and body in the office or on the basketball court, Jones said.\n\n\"It can impact your mood, your decision-making; it can impact the way you just go about your normal life,\" he said.\n\nResearch suggests that mild or moderate dehydration can impair reaction time and memory. Physically, being dehydrated can reduce strength and endurance, and make it more difficult to recover after exercise.\n\nJones uses a gold-standard test to see if his athletes need to drink more water. It can tell you if you're dehydrated based on three symptoms:\n\nEveryone's water needs are different, based on how much energy you use.\n\nJones said the gold standard recommendation is 1 milliliter to 1.5 milliliters per calorie of energy expenditure (in normal conditions). Two liters — or that eight cups of water a day you've probably heard about — makes sense for someone who burns 2,000 calories a day, but you may need more or less depending on your body size and activity level.\n\nSleeping is a superpower for athletes, and a simple tip helps them stay well-hydrated without too many overnight bathroom trips.\n\nJones said the solution for his athletes, including the Celtics, is to drink 80% of their fluids for the day before 4 p.m. so that their bodies have time to process all that liquid before bedtime.\n\nPlain water should be your first priority for hydration, but other drinks and even foods can count toward your daily total.\n\nFor instance, your morning brew can help keep you hydrated, since caffeinated drinks in moderation lead to a net gain in fluid. Just steer clear of artificially sweetened or sugary beverages, too much of which can cause health issues like chronic inflammation over time.\n\nHydrating foods such as fruits and veggies also provide electrolytes to regulate the fluids in your body.\n\nSodium, or salt, is a key electrolyte, but you probably get enough in your diet already. Instead, Jones said to focus on potassium to offset the side effects of too much sodium, such as high blood pressure.\n\nGood sources of potassium include bananas, avocados, coconut water, pomegranate, and watermelon.\n\nDehydration can sneak up on you before you realize it, especially if you're sweating a lot.\n\n\"During intense exercise, particularly in warm environments, thirst is not a good indicator of hydration status,\" Jones said. \"People are often chasing their tails a little bit.\"\n\nYou can calculate your sweat rate to estimate just how much water you need to replace during exercise, like Jones does with the pros.\n\nPrevent a dip in performance by drinking water at regular intervals.\n\n\"The first priority as soon as your big toe hits planet earth in the morning is to rehydrate,\" Jones said.",

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

    "fullText": "Arsenal icon Patrick Vieira believes one Manchester United player is reaping the rewards of Michael Carrick’s tactics more than Bryan Mbeumo, especially after Sunday’s result.\n\nDuring his punditry duties for Sky Sports, Patrick Vieira watched as his former club Arsenal fell to Manchester United in a 3-2 defeat at the Emirates.\n\nMichael Carrick has now overseen impressive back-to-back Premier League wins over top-two sides Arsenal and Manchester City since taking charge.\n\nBryan Mbeumo was once again trusted to lead the line for Man Utd under Carrick’s system, and the summer signing from Brentford delivered another strong performance.\n\nMbeumo pulled Man Utd level before half-time when he capitalised on a costly mistake from Arsenal’s Martin Zubimendi.\n\nAfter Bryan Mbeumo pulled Manchester United level, Patrick Dorgu put them in front early in the second half. It was a well-taken goal that gave United some momentum coming out of the break.\n\nMikel Merino equalised for Arsenal late on, just when it looked like United might hold on. But even with time running out, there was still more to come.\n\nMatheus Cunha replaced Bryan Mbeumo in the second half and the 26-year-old Brazilian forward scored the winner for Man Utd in Sunday evening’s result.\n\nFollowing Manchester United’s 2-0 victory against Manchester City at Old Trafford last week, Vieira believed that Carrick and his colleagues had finally “answered” the significant questions surrounding them.\n\n“There were still big questions after City,” he told Sky Sports.\n\n“They answered them so well. They are back on track. There’s still a long way to go. Wins against City and Arsenal is so good for confidence.”\n\nPlaying in the No 10 role behind Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes featured there for the second straight Premier League match under interim boss Carrick.\n\nThe Manchester United captain’s performances against both City and Arsenal have drawn high praise from Vieira.\n\n“The system allowed them to express themselves,” the Frenchman stated.\n\n“I think the 4-2-3-1 allowed Fernandes to be a little bit more free on the pitch, create situations, score goals.\n\n“You can see the pictures – the smile is back on the face of the United players.”\n\nUnder Ruben Amorim last season, Fernandes often played deeper before the manager was dismissed earlier this month. The coaching change has clearly had an impact on his play.",

    "description": "The Sky Sports pundit praised Carrick’s influence on the club after wins over Man City and Arsenal but believes they need a ‘bigger’ manager",
    "fullText": "Roy Keane shut down suggestions that Michael Carrick be given the role of Manchester United manager on a permanent basis following the 3-2 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nCarrick took over from the sacked Ruben Amorim on a contract until the end of the current suggestion with the executives at Old Trafford currently searching for a new manager to hire permanently.\n\nIn his first game in charge Carrick orchestrated a 2-0 derby win over Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City before masterminding United’s victory over the league leaders.\n\nKeane was quick to praise the impact Carrick and his staff have had on the players and results but revealed that his preference for the next manager be someone “bigger and better” than Carrick.\n\nAsked for his opinion on the result and the performance from Manchester United, Keane echoed the words of Harry Maguire who was awarded the player of the match trophy.\n\n“Harry makes a good point, they’ve got a lot of their players back now, it’s a full group, they’ve got full weeks together and there’s no other distractions,” Keane replied. “They can focus on the league form and they’re producing.\n\n“But, as we know you win one, two games for Man Utd, fantastic. Particularly to beat City, and come to Arsenal. I felt United would get a result today, I was thinking a draw but I felt United would turn up.\n\n“They’ve got enough quality players and they’ve got momentum into their season and all of a sudden you’re thinking it’s a great chance for top four. If they play with that confidence and belief, you give the manager and the staff credit.”\n\nKeane was then pressed by fellow Sky Sports pundit Micah Richards on whether Manchester United should hire Carrick on a permanent basis already given he has led the team to wins against first and second in the league.\n\n“The job? You’re being silly now,” Keane responded. “No, he’s had two great performances but anybody can win two games. It’s what he does until the end of the season.\n\n“Even if they do get into fourth I still wouldn’t be convinced he’s the man for the job. Absolutely not. I still think they need a bigger and better manager.\n\n“But, he’s got the opportunity, what a chance it is for him and, do you know what, he’s taking it so fair play to him.”",

    "fullText": "Random thoughts while waiting on the release of the new Super Bowl commercials.\n\nThe sight of Cubs star Pete-Crow Armstrong and Bears star Caleb Williams hanging out together at the Blackhawks and Bulls games was a nice way to portray Chicago as the biggest small town in America. Los Angeles has its Hollywood culture and New York is the media center of the world, but nowhere are the local sports stars as big a deal as they are in Chicago.\n\nIt’s nothing new, of course. Chicago’s stars have always supported each other. When the Bears played at Wrigley Field, Bobby Hull was a season ticket holder, and Billy Williams used to get tickets for games from Bears receiver Dick Gordon.\n\nThe budding bromance of Crow-Armstrong and Williams should last a long time, or at least until the Cubs and Bears sign them to massive deals.\n\nOne of the primary requisites of the job of commissioner of a major sports league should be the ability to project strength. But the commissioners of the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball are all weaklings, as evidenced by a report from The Athletic that Roger Goodell, Adam Silver, Gary Bettman and Rob Manfred will meet with President Donald Trump to help promote America 250, a celebration of the country’s 250th birthday.\n\nWhile Trump’s jackboots instill fear in Minneapolis, Chicago and other American cities, and he embarrasses the country on the international stage, these four pretend leaders will be posing for photo-ops in the Oval Office and pretending all is right with the country. None of them has the courage to speak out against what’s happening in America.\n\nLucky for them, they’re only beholden to the billionaire owners of their league’s teams, not the average fans who support their respective sports.\n\nESPN’s Pat McAfee has always appealed to the lowest common denominator, so it’s no surprise the clueless commentator is taking on unidentified media members who point out his lame frat boy act, calling them “fat … lazy nerds” on his TV show.\n\nMcAfee also tweeted that sports journalists “hate what sports are for people (happiness). They hate what sports are for society (unifier) … they’re political journalists by nature who’ve preyed on sports because they saw it as an easier path to ‘make it.’ Their days are numbered … my show being broadcasted on ESPN 10 hours a week with ZERO creative say from any ‘journalism school’ puppets is living proof of that.”\n\nActually, the audience of McAfee’s show is relatively tiny, or else it would be in a better time slot than in the early afternoon, when everyone else is working. He’s already wearing thin on college football fans, and sooner or later the ratings will slide and ESPN will pull the plug and send him off to UFC analysis, where he belongs.\n\nIllinois is having another stellar season, thanks to a deep team led by freshman Keaton Wagler. The 11th-ranked Illini are 17-3 after Saturday’s 88-82 road win over Purdue and in contention for the Big Ten title.\n\nAnd when the Illini are winning, coach Brad Underwood is at his most ornery, as when he recently sparred with an Illinois reporter who praised Tomislav Ivišić for a good game against Northwestern despite what he called an “up-and-down season.”\n\n“You guys say he’s been up and down,” Underwood shot back. “I just say his role changed. You guys create more damn narratives that are full of (bleep). That’s what he does. That’s why he’s been on draft boards. He’s big and can shoot the cover off of it. … No one has ever doubted Tommy.”\n\nLove him or hate him, Underwood is never afraid to speak his mind.\n\nKudos to White Sox general manager Chris Getz for immediately spending the $20 million he saved by dumping Luis Robert Jr.’s contract, signing reliever Seranthony Dominguez to a two-year, $20 million deal. Now maybe he can move Grant Taylor into the rotation where he belongs.\n\nMike Berman was a professional and a hardworking sports reporter willing to work long hours at NBC-5. A Glenbrook North alumnus who grew up rooting for Chicago teams, he did his job for 10 years without calling attention to himself. His work spoke for itself.\n\nBerman, who was let go by the station last week, deserved a better fate. Hopefully he winds up on another local station that will appreciate his work ethic.\n\nTerry Boers, who died Friday at age 75, was remembered by most as a radio host and an original member of The Score. But he was also a great newspaperman. Boers and I competed on the Illini basketball beat for one season back in the early 1990s, when he was still at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was as good a beat writer as there was and handed me my lunch on many occasions.\n\nBoers eventually found his way to radio, where he could put his brash personality into his job. He became a legend at WSCR-AM 670, along with the other originals such as Mike North, Tom Shaer and Dan McNeil. There will never be another quite like Boers, which is why his death has brought so many tributes from colleagues.\n\nCubs manager Craig Counsell is a Green Bay Packers fan, but he assured the media he is not a Bears hater. “Look, I grew up a Packers fan for sure,” he said before the Cubs Convention. “The Bears have struggled for a while, and so when a team hasn’t done well for a whole and starts to do well, you see what it does to a city. You feel it. That part of me knows what it’s doing for the city, and you root for that a little bit.”\n\nAsked who would be booed \n\nIt’s a tough call, but my guess is Counsell is still Public Enemy No. 1 among cheeseheads.",

    "fullText": "This Monday, January 26 at 9 p.m., Girona returns to Montilivi to host Getafe in the match of the 21st round of the EA Sports League. The team has started the second half of the season in the best possible way with an away victory against Espanyol. This result means that Michel's team has achieved three consecutive victories - the best streak of the season - against Espanyol, Osasuna, and Mallorca. This places them in eleventh place with 24 points. At the moment, the standings are very tight with three other teams having the same points: Elche, Real Sociedad, and Athletic Club; two with 22, Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, and three with 21, Sevilla, Mallorca, and Getafe.\n\nGetafe CF, on the other hand, arrives at Montilivi with a trajectory marked by rather negative results in the last league matches. In the most recent games, the Madrid team recorded a 1-0 loss to Valencia and a 2-1 defeat against Real Sociedad, and drew 1-1 with Rayo Vallecano. Additionally, before the Christmas break, Getafe suffered a 4-0 loss to Betis and a 3-1 defeat against Burgos in the Copa del Rey.\n\nAs for the head-to-head history between Girona and Getafe, the record shows a closely contested rivalry in recent history. In the first meeting of this same season, Getafe won 2-1 at the Coliseum, a match in which the Madrid team took the lead with goals from Mario Martín and Borja Mayoral, while Cristhian Stuani reduced the deficit from the penalty spot at the end of the game. Looking at a broader perspective, in a total of 17 historical encounters between both teams, Girona has achieved 6 victories, Getafe 7, and 4 matches have ended in a draw, reflecting the competitive balance that these matches usually display.",

The team said goodbye Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park, honoring Press before its first game of 2026, a 6-0 win over Paraguay.\n\nIn between, Press played 154 more times for the U.S., winning two World Cups, an Olympic bronze medal and scoring 62 more goals, retiring as the ninth-leading scorer in team history.\n\nBut those are just numbers because as good as Press was, she wants to be remembered for the legacy she left behind, for the barriers she broke, for the inspiration she continues to provide for players who followed her to the national team.\n\n“Well, it's sort of the point, right?” she said ahead of Saturday’s farewell ceremony before a crowd of 19,397. “I feel really lucky that I had the opportunity to play long enough to overlap with some of these young players and be able to see the growth of the game, how far it's come, and be able to see what the next generation of player feels like.\n\n“It's different, and it's going to take different things for people to have success.”\n\nTalk about following in Press’ footsteps: The first score Saturday came from Reilyn Turner of the Portland Thorns, like Press a Southern California native who scored her first U.S. goal on a left-footed shot in the first half of her international debut. The second goal, less than two minutes into the second half, came from Kansas City’s Ally Sentnor.\n\nAnd that opened the floodgates, with the U.S. getting an own goal from Paraguay’s Fiorella Martínez followed by scores from Trinity Rodman — who was celebrating the three-year contract, reported to be worth a record $6 million, she signed Thursday with the Washington Spirit — a second goal from Sentnor and another from Emma Sears.\n\nPress scored her final international goal in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Ten months later, playing with Angel City FC in the NWSL, she shredded the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee, an injury that required four surgeries and nearly 25 months to repair. She never played another game for the national team and made just three more starts for Angel City before announcing her retirement last October.\n\nThat, Press said, will continue to provide her with a link to the game.\n\n“We're so integrated into the women's sports ecosystem, through podcasts, through merchandise and through the women's soccer community,” she said. “I have spent a lot of time looking at the business of women's sports and how we need to reimagine it.\n\n“In a dream world, I'd be able to continue to influence the ecosystem as a businessperson.”\n\nPress got her start in soccer in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, about a dozen miles from where her career officially ended Saturday in Carson. As a preschooler she played with older kids in co-ed league because one team was short a girl.\n\n“I didn’t touch the ball once,” she remembered years later. “I picked daisies and waved to my mom.”\n\nShe went on to win two CIF Southern Section titles at the Chadwick School and a Hermann Trophy at Stanford before starting a club career that took her to eight teams in three countries. With the national team she went to three Olympics, won World Cups and played a key role in the landmark lawsuit against U.S. Soccer that ended with the women earning equal pay with the men’s team.\n\nIt’s a résumé that already is challenging the next generation of national team players.\n\n“I admired her for a long time,” said Seattle Reign winger Maddie Dahlien, 21, who made her national team debut Saturday. “She made a name for herself a little later. You never know when your opportunity will be. So make the most of it when it comes.”\n\nU.S. coach Emma Hayes never had a chance to work directly with Press, though she wanted to bring her overseas to Chelsea FC when Hayes managed there and Press was looking to move to the Women’s Super League.\n\n“I’ve always admired her and thought what a fantastic football player she is. Very different to what was a more traditional American forward at the time,” Hayes said. “What she’s achieved, as well-traveled as she is, what an honor to be coaching on the day she gets celebrated in her hometown.”\n\nFor Press, it was a celebration that marked the transition from one stage of life to the next. And, she acknowledged, there are a few things she’s going to miss.\n\n“I am so sad that I don't play soccer anymore,” she said. “I miss training. I miss being on a team, being around young people. I miss being outside every day. I miss the grass. I miss the discipline and ritual that football brings to my life.\"\n\n“I like to talk about all the things that I miss, because I think ‘I'm retired. It's easy now.’ No. I had the best job in the world. And it's an irreplaceable job.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Heading into Week 18, Aaron Rodgers was nothing if not pragmatically optimistic.\n\nThe days on his Pittsburgh Steelers contract were dwindling. The future of head coach Mike Tomlin was a subject of public debate. And the franchise he quarterbacked was cornered into a de facto playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens in the regular-season finale. Any direction you looked, there was something finite hanging in the balance. But in what registered in at least a mild surprise, Rodgers spoke to reporters like a man who didn’t see a definitive near-term conclusion to his football career … so long as he didn’t want it to end.\n\n“I’m thinking about this week, but obviously I’m 42 years old and I’m on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,” Rodgers told reporters. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. So that’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play.”\n\nRodgers gave a slight shrug and chuckled.\n\n“Not a lot of options, but — there will be options I would think. Maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.”\n\n[Get more Steelers news: Pittsburgh team feed]\n\nHe then punctuated the thought by opening the door to a return.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed this experience,” Rodgers said. “Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It’s really what I was hoping for, for this experience. It’s been even better than I was hoping.”\n\nA few days later, the Steelers would beat the Ravens and make the postseason, before getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Texans. All in all, it culminated in a season that felt like Rodgers, Tomlin and the Steelers squeezed about as much as they could have expected.\n\nThen Tomlin left, via a resignation that felt like a surprise to ownership. And maybe to Rodgers, too, given that any thought of his return seemed so strongly bound to whether Tomlin would continue to guide Pittsburgh. When that changed, logical speculation — and that’s all we’ve been left with thus far on the Rodgers front — was that a new head coach would mean a new quarterback. Whatever options were on the table for Rodgers, they appeared to have shrunk by one.\n\nThen came Saturday, when the Steelers went against their historical hiring template and locked in 62-year-old Mike McCarthy, a candidate who can fit more than one forward-looking ideology.  On one hand, McCarthy is a seasoned veteran coach who can come in and try to energize an aging roster that is still very much built to win now. On the other, he could be tasked with developing the franchise’s next young quarterback. Without a bridge starter currently on the roster, it will be difficult for McCarthy to achieve both of those responsibilities.\n\nUnless, of course, McCarthy can find a veteran who knows his system and can come in and help with both tasks. Maybe a quarterback who McCarthy previously helped develop into a star? One who already has spent a season in the Pittsburgh quarterback room with 24-year-old Will Howard, who showed promise in limited reps during his rookie preseason and has the support of the front office as a prospect worth some continued development?\n\nThat sounds like a fit for Rodgers. And perhaps the renewal of a 2026 option that appeared to be extinguished when Tomlin resigned.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean McCarthy was hired with any kind of specificity of luring Rodgers back for another season. While some of Pittsburgh’s players gave Rodgers high marks as a teammate in their exit interviews, the work to find the next long-term starting option is clearly near the top of the priorities for ownership and general manager Omar Khan. And that wouldn’t have changed even if Tomlin had remained. One way or another, 2026 was always going to be geared toward either figuring out if the next young quarterback is already on the roster (in the form of Howard) or if the Steelers liked any of their draft, trade or free-agency options.\n\nMcCarthy’s arrival won’t change that mindset. The real factors of change at the quarterback spot will instead be pressed against the options Pittsburgh has available. If McCarthy is a head coach Rodgers will play for, it gives Pittsburgh at least one more year of a bridge starter to either weigh Howard as a prospect, or find someone in the 2026 draft who is worthy of being selected and then groomed. And there’s certainly some deep-value intrigue over the coming draft class of quarterbacks.\n\nThe Steelers won’t have a shot at Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and their first-round draft pick at No. 21 overall might not be high enough to land Alabama’s Ty Simpson, either. But after that tandem, there are some interesting quarterbacks who could be seen as worthwhile projects with upside. Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss (if he can’t force another year of NCAA eligibility) will draw a significant amount of study from NFL teams. As will a quartet of others who were previously considered to be first-round picks — and potentially very high first-round picks — until hitting stumbles in their final seasons: LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier, Miami’s Carson Beck, Penn State’s Drew Allar and Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, among others.\n\nFor now — and we’ve yet to go through the draft sifting process, so take this with a grain of salt — only Mendoza cuts the figure as a Day 1 rookie starter. Simpson could round into that kind of prospect, or one who has a shot to earn a starting job during his rookie season. The rest? Most personnel opinions appear to be placing them on a developmental track to possibly get a shot with a year or more of work from further down the depth chart.\n\nIf any of those players are in the Steelers’ future, McCarthy’s hiring makes a lot of sense given his history with helping quarterbacks grow into starters. And it also makes sense that Rodgers would be a fit, so long as he continues to be in a year-to-year contract mindset and actually wants to play for McCarthy again.\n\nIn that latter vein, both McCarthy and Rodgers have said very nice things about each other in the least few years, each gaining the perspective of working with new people and in new places. Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real, with both having come to terms with their own mistakes and frustrations that ultimately played a part in McCarthy getting fired late in the 2018 season after coaching the Green Bay Packers for nearly 13 years.\n\nBut burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing. Even if Rodgers wants to play again and McCarthy would like to have him in 2026, the veteran quarterback doesn’t know what the rest of the league landscape will look like in even a few weeks. There’s a chance the Los Angeles Rams win a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford decides to pull a John Elway and retire. Should that happen, the Rams will still be very much in the middle of a Super Bowl window and not have an obvious starting quarterback on the roster. And then there is the Minnesota Vikings, a team Rodgers was very interested in playing for last offseason. They are looking for someone to come in and compete with J.J. McCarthy for the starting job next season.\n\nAdd the Steelers to that mix, and you have exactly what Rodgers was talking about when he focused his gaze on 2026. Not a lot of options — but certainly some interesting ones.",

    "fullText": "Most people dream about winning the lottery. But for one 29-year-old man, his $15 million windfall came with a side of guilt, entitlement, and a family-sized headache.\n\nIn a post shared on Reddit, the anonymous winner explained that his financial plans were anything but reckless. He didn't run off to buy yachts or sports cars. Instead, he wanted to take business and finance courses, manage his newfound wealth responsibly, and eventually give back through charitable work. What he didn't plan for? His parents demanding a full quarter of the winnings—roughly $3.75 million—because, in their words, \"we raised you.\"\n\nThe Reddit post made clear this wasn't a close-knit family cashing in on shared joy. The man described his upbringing as \"distant white middle class,\" saying he had moved an hour away from his \"oppressive mother and distant father.\" While he described his sisters as \"nice people,\" he noted they don't have a real relationship.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nDespite this, when he won the lottery, he offered to pay off his parents' mortgages and provide them a cash gift. But when they learned the full scope of his winnings, that wasn't enough. \"Once they found the total amount,\" he wrote, \"they expected a quarter of it.\"\n\nThe conversation escalated. When his mother said, \"we raised you,\" he couldn't help but remember the five-year stretch—from age 15 to 20—when his parents completely cut off contact. Though he didn't directly confront them with that memory, he now questions whether he owes them anything at all.\n\nMany Redditors agreed that his parents were being unreasonable, entitled, and opportunistic. One user summed it up sharply: \"You don't owe them s**t.\"\n\nAnother commenter laid out a detailed legal and financial checklist: hire a lawyer and financial adviser, draw up a will and living trust, create powers of attorney for medical and financial decisions, and install a home security system. They ended their comment with a blunt mantra: \"People get crazy with money.\"\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd they weren't alone in that warning. Multiple users emphasized the need for protection—not just from scammers or strangers, but from family members who might be willing to sue, manipulate, or guilt-trip to access the prize. One even suggested freezing the winnings in a trust for a year just to let emotions cool and see how people behave.\n\nStill, not everyone was entirely unsympathetic to the family's reaction. From a devil's advocate angle, some might say parents who supported their child for nearly two decades—through diapers, meals, and housing—might feel hurt or excluded if they're only offered a slice instead of a share.\n\nBut that perspective hinges on a relationship that doesn't seem to exist in this case. The man's post didn't reveal abuse or violence, but the emotional neglect—especially during his formative years—cast a long shadow. Five years of silence from his parents left a mark. And now, with millions on the table, old wounds are reopening under the glare of entitlement.\n\n\"I feel like I've been as generous as I can be,\" he said, noting he never explicitly said so to his parents, but assumed it would be clear. What stung most was that their reaction didn't reflect pride or joy—it reeked of resentment that they didn't get more.\n\nSee Also: Private-Market Real Estate Without the Crowdfunding Risk—Direct Access to Institutional-Grade Deals Managed by a $12B+ Real Estate Firm\n\nThe original poster has since emailed his parents to reiterate his offer and state firmly that nothing more would be coming. Whether they respond, and how, remains to be seen.\n\nIn a later update, he stressed that this situation wasn't about seeking revenge or proving a point. It was about maintaining boundaries and protecting the life he's worked hard to rebuild. \"I am not looking to be told how to spend my money or how to be vindictive,\" he wrote. \"They do love me, even if it's in their own sad way.\"\n\nAnd maybe that's the hardest part. Winning the lottery can change your bank account—but it doesn't fix broken relationships. The man walked away with $15 million, but in doing so, he discovered that family ties can fray under the weight of expectation. And in his case, no amount of money seems likely to stitch them back together.\n\nRead Next: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times give their thoughts on the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the Rams, the LeBron James-Jeanie Buss rift and college football.",
    "fullText": "The fury over the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker makes me wonder who's shouting the loudest?\n\nCould it be desperate, unfortunate fans whose beloved teams are owned by inheritors, nepo families, or private equity bros who celebrate their glamorous assets?\n\nSo how about a new metric in the sports page to accompany the ranking of teams and players: ownership. Not simply by wealth, but wisdom, brains and commitment. And for fun let's call it the McCourt-Moreno Index.\n\nIt's time we hold the Marge Schotts of pro sports accountable for the franchises they mismanage.\n\nThere are some alarming implications to Bill Plaschke's \"If it blows up baseball, so be it.\" Perhaps he means that MLB should be reduced to a burning garbage heap with three teams atop — Yankees, Cubs and Dodgers — because they were the only ones who went into the TV business and peddled their services for billions in the three largest TV markets.\n\nMaybe he yearns to transform MLB into the NHL of my childhood, with six teams. That was OK if you lived in a shallow arc extending between New York and Chicago — not so good for everyone else.\n\n\"So be it,\" as Plaschke would say, but I can guarantee I won't be the only one who isn't watching anymore.\n\nNaturally Dodger fans are all excited about the signing of the $60-million-a-year All-Star right fielder, Kyle Tucker. But we're not going to be happy when Dodger Stadium becomes the first MLB ballpark with a two-drink minimum.\n\nAs everyone seems to be raving about the Dodgers' acquisition of Kyle Tucker, I note the following: There is another player who was recently signed by the Yankees for less money and less signing bonus than Tucker who had higher numbers last year in average, home runs and WAR. He also plays more positions. Hadn’t the Dodgers heard of Cody Bellinger? Bellinger as a Yankee will never feel right to me.\n\nAsk a Major League Baseball owner like Arte Moreno, who sells out his ballpark whenever the Dodgers come to Anaheim, and sees Angel broadcast ratings surge whenever his team plays the Dodgers, if he thinks the Dodgers are ruining the game.\n\nThe Rams won the battle of which team gets to lose to Seattle.\n\nThe NFL needs to clarify exactly what does and doesn’t constitute pass interference. There is no consistency as to how it's called with each official seeming to have their own definition of what constitutes pass interference. It has gotten to the point where it’s worse than major league umpires and their own definition of the strike zone. NFL, you need to clean this up because these are major calls that are ruining games.\n\nBill Plaschke finally wrote a column about the Lakers with which I agree. LeBron James is the past, Austin Reaves is the future, and $50 million will help the Lakers rebuild. Yes, it's really as simple as that.\n\nWith the Lakers defense costing them multiple games, reminiscent of the coach Mike (no D)'Antoni days, the only real interesting Laker news last week were the alleged Jeanie Buss comments about the King. They sounded like they were lines taken from a scene in \"The Godfather\" .... \"What have I done to make you treat me so disrespectfully.\" My opinion is that it \"was not personal and strictly business.\"\n\nWhen asked after each game how he'd celebrate another victory, Indiana's Curt Cignetti would say, \"With a beer.\" After guiding his team to an undefeated season, and then winning the national championship, I doubt the Hoosiers' coach will ever have to buy another beer again.\n\nLincoln Riley is officially on the clock. In two years Curt Cignetti took a woebegone college team, with nary a five-star player, to an undefeated national championship. Cignetti has proven that, even in the NIL era, coaching matters. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick …\n\nCurt Cignetti and Indiana football playing in and winning the national championship was a modern-day version of the movie \"Hoosiers\" and would have made coach Norman Dale (actor Gene Hackman) proud. Now the question is, can new UCLA football coach Bob Chesney and his 40-plus transfers be the second coming of Indiana? Only time will tell.\n\nKings president Luc Robitaille appears to be happy with the Kings' status quo that appears to be getting one point every game in an overtime or shootout loss. Should we start referring to him as Luc RobitailleandthenloseinOT?\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

    "description": "Brenna Huckaby lost her leg to cancer when she was 14 years old. Then she discovered snowboarding, and it opened her entire world.",
    "fullText": "If we could ski down a mountain, then when we got home, we were able to conquer everyday life things.\n\nAt the time, Brenna Huckaby didn’t fully realize what the idea behind that rehabilitative trip to Utah would mean to her.\n\nShe had been diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, and lost her right leg at 14. To that point, conquering everyday things had meant wearing her prosthetic leg consistently.\n\nBut the trip, sponsored by her hospital, which sent Huckaby and kids who lost mobility from osteosarcoma to the slopes, opened up her world.\n\n\"I fell in love with it immediately,\" she tells USA TODAY Sports. \"It was the first sport that I had found just not only (an) incredible challenge, but also this fear and this knowing that I could do it, and I wanted to do it.\"\n\nHuckaby, now 30, became an American Paralympic snowboarder who will once again be competing at the Olympics, this time at Milano Cortina. She won gold and bronze at Beijing in 2022.\n\nHave you ever taken the time to think about what sports, especially your favorite sport, means to you?\n\nWe caught up with Huckaby, who would also become the first Paralympian to appear in the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated and is now a sports mom, about how sports can give us the confidence to take on life’s biggest challenges.\n\nIf we set a goal, and we push ourselves, we can reap their benefits at no matter what level we achieve.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nHuckaby spoke to USA TODAY Sports on behalf of Hershey’s for the “It’s Your Happy Place” campaign. Athletes partnered with the chocolate and candy company to showcase how happiness is not only found in winning, but sweet, everyday moments.\n\nThose moments, she says, \"don’t have to be big and explosive.\" The small ones can matter the most.\n\n\"I feel like that's been my main focus the last eight years,\" she says. \"How can I enjoy the process, enjoy the journey, not just the destination? And I feel like that's way easier said than done. I've learned that taking time to pause, to slow down, to be in the moment, that's how I have found happiness, presence, gratitude, all the things that make me feel good. It’s been in those tiny moments throughout the day.\"\n\nAs young athletes (and parents), if we take the time to reflect on what we’re doing as we race to our different sports events, we can improve our awareness. Huckaby’s sport, she says, is mostly mental, and that part of her game helps her push through the excruciatingly physical parts.\n\n\"I feel like I don't make progress and grow unless I am mentally present and in a good headspace to learn,\" she says.  \"I would say the sooner that you can take moments to reflect on – whether it's your training in the gym or a practice that you had – what was hard, what was good, what do you want to improve on, and what did it teach you about yourself? When you can start practicing that, it makes the things that you've learned so much easier.\n\n\"Then you're able to see those moments of growth and (be) like, 'Wow, like I'm so glad that I learned that. And I'm so glad I pushed through that because I've got this thing that I'm dealing with at home and I know that I can take the mindsets from sport and apply it here.'\"\n\nReflection has helped Huckaby realize she performs her best when she’s calm. She works with a sports psychologist to help her channel her strength to high stakes situations.\n\nDo you remember the instance where you either discovered your favorite sport or realized it was the one you love most?\n\nHuckaby, who has two older brothers (Jordan and Jeremy), loved to jump around as a little girl. Jeremy, her middle brother, and her parents were really into martial arts, which she tried. Her instructor pulled her parents (Jeff and Kristie) aside and told them, \"You need to put her in gymnastics.\"\n\n\"What I loved the most was learning how to do flips in the gym and that's what my martial arts teachers would just teach me because that was all I could stay focused for,\" she says. \"So my parents listened and also they were tired of me doing cartwheels in the house and stuff, and they thought it was a way to save their TV.\"\n\nHuckaby's cancer, which led to the amputation, ended her gymnastics career. But, Huckaby says, she thought about how she loved moving her body and chasing adrenaline.\n\n\"When snowboarding came to me, 'I was like, this is it,'\" Huckaby says.\n\nShe moved to Utah, about a year after the hospital-led trip with her mom, who worked as a nurse there. The rest of the family stayed at their home in Louisiana, and Kristie moved back home when her daughter graduated high school.\n\n\"It gave me opportunity to just heal from cancer through snowboarding,\" Huckaby says. \"Sports (is) such a great way to understand life in the way that it challenges you and the way that you intimately get to know who you are.\n\n\"You gain so much confidence in your body and what your body's capable of. So during cancer, I never really questioned that I could handle it. I put myself in extreme situations through gymnastics training that I knew that I could handle what was to come.\n\n\"I think now as I've been doing this at a professional level for so long, I've learned, 'How do I put that more into my everyday life so that I'm not just an athlete?'\"\n\nHuckaby says she doesn’t so much balance her life, but embraces what’s important to her through every season.\n\nWhen she’s home, she trains vigorously but finds family time every day with her husband, Tristan Klegg, and young school-aged daughters, Lilah and Sloan. Klegg, a former snowboard cross athlete, realizes he sometimes needs to be at home with the girls at times over being with his wife. But they interact daily.\n\n\"He takes care of our kids while I'm away and when I'm training and (is) such a big support, making sure that we win, right?\" she says. \"It's a team effort for sure.\n\n\"I'm in the gym in the offseason three to five days a week,\" she says, \"and I say three to five because we're human. It's life, you know? So the ideal, the perfect, is five. The reality is usually three, and during that period, you're going really hard. And so those off days are really important. And then between snowboard season and gym season, we have two weeks off. We are encouraged to have fun and move our body in ways that feel good, but it doesn't have to be intense. It's just, 'Take time off.'\n\n“And then I usually give myself a fall break. I know that it's good for my mental health. So usually as Halloween starts rolling around, I'm less intense and then I crank back up (in) November, and then most of December and then (the) holidays, I give myself permission to just chill. Because I know it's about to get serious after Christmas.\n\n\"It's (about) finding a rhythm, but I absolutely rest.\"\n\nLilah and Sloan, Huckaby’s daughters, like skateboarding, wakeboarding, wake surfing and other action sports near their home in Montana.\n\nLilah, her older daughter, has tried gymnastics and does aerial silks, which Huckaby describes as art-based body movements.\n\n\"We're active,\" she says. \"That's where we're trying to shine. I don't ever want them to think anything has just been given to me and easy. Of course, there are moments that it looks easy and it's because of all the decades of work that I've put in on my body and then my mind. And so things look like they come together naturally, but, I love the phrase, 'An overnight success was not built overnight.' It was built, you know, a decade before, just quietly working.\n\n\"Like yesterday, I did not want to go to the gym. It was my third day of two-a-days and I was just like, 'I don't want to go.' And they saw that, and I got up and I went.\"\n\nBut Huckaby also never wants her daughters to think that she’s fearless. She has been scared many times, whether it's during training, free riding or competing.\n\n“But I'm brave, and I do it anyway, and I do it scared, and I trust my training, and I trust myself, and I hope that they learn to do that for themselves,\" she says.\n\nHuckaby was horrified, she says, when Sports Illustrated approached her to pose for its 2018 swimsuit edition. She thought she wasn’t confident enough to put herself out in the world in that way.\n\n\"Then I just thought about my 14-year-old self who had just lost her leg and was bald at the time and just felt unbeautiful and unworthy, and I remembered that she deserved to be represented in a way that she wanted to, and to be seen as someone who could be beautiful and could be lovable. And so I wanted to give that to her, and I'm so proud of myself for doing that.\"\n\nIn a similar way, we sometimes have to put ourselves, or our kids, out there for our first big competition. It’s a risk, for sure, but then that rush of adrenaline can come, the one you only get from sports.\n\n\"Bet on yourself,\" Huckaby says, \"because you're worth investing in. If you want it, go for it. If you feel like you have what it takes and you love what you're doing, go out there and give yourself the time to do it and the opportunity to do it because that's what matters more than when you got into your sport. It’s never too late.\"\n\nWe don’t need to have it all figured out. We might just need more perspective on what we’re doing, and what we’re spending.\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "description": "There are no salary caps, no aprons, and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced",
    "fullText": "There are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced\n\nDavid Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.\n\nCurrent commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver said then in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”\n\n“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”\n\nFor decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.\n\nYet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won the Premier League just about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.\n\nConcerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double as handy instruments to write off taxes for billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.\n\nLately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.\n\nThey can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.\n\nThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rules now tweaked to merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.\n\nMore tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)\n\nCertainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.\n\nAt least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.\n\nThat’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

    "fullText": "Leadership is the invisible currency of sports. Hard to quantify, but impossible to win without. The Athletic surveyed over 100 industry insiders to find the figures who command the most respect in 2025. From tacticians to culture-setters, these are the names that define the modern standard. Here are the top 15 most admired leaders.\n\nRole: Quarterback, Kansas City Chiefs​\nMahomes makes the list because his leadership is as effortless as his playmaking. He balances supreme confidence with a calming presence that stabilizes the entire franchise when chaos hits. He isn’t just the face of the Chiefs; he is the league’s competitive north star.​\n\nRole: President of Basketball Operations, Boston Celtics​\nTransitioning from the sideline to the front office, Stevens proved that elite basketball IQ translates anywhere. He is admired for his cold, decisive roster management, prioritizing winning combinations over sentimentality. His vision turned a good team into a perennial juggernaut.​\n\nRole: Head Coach (Former)​\nCarroll’s legacy is built on a high-energy, positive culture that allowed players to be themselves. His “always compete” mantra wasn’t just a slogan; it was a daily way of life that resonated across generations of athletes. He remains the blueprint for the modern players’ coach.​\n\nRole: Quarterback, Philadelphia Eagles​\nHurts commands respect through a stoic demeanor that never fluctuates, regardless of the scoreboard. His leadership is quiet but heavy, grounded in a relentless work ethic that sets the temperature for the entire building. In a volatile market, he is the unshakeable constant.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, Michigan State​\nThe ultimate throwback, Izzo leads with a mix of brutal accountability and genuine, familial love. His teams mirror his identity: tough, physical, and built to survive the grind of March. Peers admire him for the fierce loyalty he inspires in everyone who wears the jersey.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, Pittsburgh Steelers​\nTomlin is the master of messaging, known for cutting through the noise with honesty that players crave. His greatest skill is his consistency; he prevents the floor from dropping out, no matter the roster turnover. He remains the standard for stability in the NFL.​\n\nRole: Forward, Las Vegas Aces​\nWilson has become the WNBA’s undisputed face, carrying the league’s growth with grace and dominance. She leads with accessibility and humor, anchoring a dynasty while shouldering the expectations of a superstar. She makes greatness look relatable.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, Detroit Lions​\nCampbell turned a punchline into a powerhouse by doubling down on authenticity and grit. He proved that vulnerability can be a strength, building a locker room that fights harder because they truly believe in the man leading them. His team is a direct reflection of his heart.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, USWNT​\nHayes brings a psychological edge to management, treating athletes as whole people to unlock their best performance. Her rapid success with Chelsea and the USWNT on the international stage showcased her ability to diagnose and fix culture instantly. She is a tactician who understands the human element first.​\n\nRole: General Manager, OKC Thunder​\nPresti is the long-game visionary who wasn’t afraid to look foolish in the short term to build something lasting. His disciplined approach to asset accumulation set a new template for success in small markets. He wins by sticking to the plan when others panic.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, Kansas City Chiefs​\nReid is the rare genius who lacks an ego, creating a collaborative environment where players’ personalities thrive. His offensive creativity is legendary, but his steady, fatherly hand is what keeps the dynasty humming. He makes the grind of football feel like a joyride.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, UConn​\nAuriemma demands a level of perfectionism that most programs can’t comprehend. His abrasive style works because it is rooted in a deep, relentless drive to extract every ounce of potential from his players. To play for him is to ​\n\nRole: Point Guard, Golden State Warriors​\nCurry’s leadership is defined by “joyful energy,” a selfless vibe that allowed a dynasty to breathe without ego battles. He is the rare alpha who invites others to share the spotlight rather than hoarding it. His presence dissolves tension and elevates everyone.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, South Carolina​\nStaley is a “truth-teller” who advocates fiercely for her players and the sport itself. She built a powerhouse by being a mentor first and a coach second, earning unshakeable trust from her roster. Her voice resonates far beyond the court.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, Golden State Warriors​\nKerr tops the list for his mastery of the soft skills, managing massive egos and keeping a dynasty hungry over a decade. His leadership is defined by emotional intelligence and perspective, keeping the game in balance for his team. He is the ultimate people manager.​\n\nThese fifteen leaders share one trait: the ability to make those around them better. Whether through tactical brilliance or emotional connection, they set the bar that the rest of the sports world chases.​\n\nThe post The Athletic’s top 15 leaders in sports appeared first on The Big Lead.",

His pursuit of the mineral-rich Arctic territory has caused growing tensions with European allies.\n\nDenmark could play in the World Cup - which will see 78 of the 104 matches staged in the US - if its team qualifies via play-offs.\n\nIn a statement, the chief executive of the Danish Football Association, Erik Brogger Rasmussen, told BBC Sport: \"We are, of course, aware of the current sensitive situation.\n\n\"Like many others, we are following it closely on an ongoing basis.

(Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\n“The Meazza will always be a stadium that brings back memories. And it has brought many victories,” Javier Zanetti said.\n\n“Everything has changed,” he added. “I believe that a top club like Inter, known worldwide, needs a new, state-of-the-art stadium.\n\n“The important thing is that it’s always at San Siro. I hope we’ll be able to create special memories there as well.”\n\nFinally, Zanetti named his most memorable game in the Nerazzurri shirt.\n\n“My debut game,” he claimed. “I could never have imagined it would be the first of 858 matches.”\n\nZanetti spent his entire professional career in Europe at Inter. Indeed, he joined the club in 1995 and stayed here until 2014.\n\nUpon retirement, the Nerazzurri retired his No.4 jersey, paying tribute to one of the most iconic figures in club history.\n\nHowever, Zanetti couldn’t stay away from his beloved Inter, returning to the club in a different capacity shortly after hanging up his boots.",

    "title": "Yahoo Sports' way-too-early Top 25 for 2026 season",
    "description": "The 2025 season is hardly over. That's not stopping us from looking eight months ahead.",
    "fullText": "The 2025 season just barely ended, but that's not stopping us from looking eight months ahead.\n\nHere's our way-too-early top 25 for the 2026 college football season. A lot can and will change in the months before the season begins in late August. But here's our quick and undoubtedly wrong look at how the field could stack up.\n\nHow do the Cavaliers follow up the best season in school history? Tony Elliott signed QBs Beau Pribula (Missouri) and Eli Holstein (Pitt) to replace Chandler Morris along with a few key defenders from the transfer portal. Virginia should be near the top of the ACC again.\n\nQB Luke Altmyer is out of eligibility and Bret Bielema brought in former East Carolina QB Katin Houser to replace him. The addition of FIU WR Alex Perry could be significant too. He had 56 grabs for 840 yards in 2025. This is a team that’s won 19 games over the past two seasons and should again be safely bowl eligible.\n\nThe Huskies dodged a huge loss when Demond Williams Jr. decided he was going to stay for the 2026 season. Williams can enter the season as a sleeper Heisman candidate and is the reason why we have Washington ranked. If he had left, coach Jedd Fisch would have had a huge hole to fill at QB.\n\nIs it a make-or-break season for Shane Beamer? Yes, the Gamecocks had a rough schedule in 2025, but the defense took a step back and the offensive line was rough. SC added NC State OL Jacarrius Peak in the transfer portal and QB LaNorris Sellers is back along with edge rusher Dylan Stewart.\n\nDid Houston have the quietest 10-win season in 2025? QB Conner Weigman is back for a second season after he threw for over 2,700 yards and 25 TDs and the Cougars have added a very solid transfer class. The team’s top two signees are offensive linemen and former Tulane RB Makhi Hughes comes over from Oregon where he hopes to recapture the form he had with the Green Wave.\n\nWe’re already bullish on the quick turnaround James Franklin can engineer in Blacksburg. He’s brought over a host of transfers from Penn State, including QB Ethan Grunkemeyer and TE Luke Reynolds along with CB Jaquez White from Troy and edge rusher Javion Hilson from Missouri.\n\nCan Lincoln Kienholz have a breakout season with the Cardinals? After multiple seasons as a backup at Ohio State, Kienholz is now the favorite to start at QB. Coach Jeff Brohm kept RB Isaac Brown from entering the transfer portal and also added Vanderbilt WR Tre Richardson.\n\nAs many former Nittany Lions have gone to Virginia Tech, even more Iowa State players have followed Matt Campbell to State College. That includes QB Rocco Becht, RB Carson Hansen, CB Jeremiah Cooper and a bunch of others. Building a team out of Iowa State players isn’t flashy, but Campbell is the winningest coach in school history for a reason.\n\nThe Mustangs bring back QB Kevin Jennings and added former Cal RB Kendrick Raphael in the transfer portal. He rushed for 943 yards and 13 scores in 2025. The loss of offensive coordinator Casey Woods could hurt — he’s the new head coach at Missouri State — but Rhett Lashlee’s offense should be one of the best in the ACC once again.\n\nIt’s hard to see how Michigan could have done much better than getting Kyle Whittingham after it fired Sherrone Moore. Whittingham brings offensive coordinator Jason Beck with him from Utah and Bryce Underwood could have a breakout season under Beck. DE John Henry Daley and other players have followed Whittingham from Salt Lake City, too.\n\nThe Cougars lost defensive coordinator Jay Hill after Whittingham hired him at Michigan and replaced Hill with longtime assistant Kelly Poppinga. QB Bear Bachmeier should be even better in 2026 and getting leading rusher LJ Martin back for his senior year is a big boost.\n\nThe Trojans have the top-ranked recruiting class in the country heading into the 2026 season. How many of those players can make an immediate impact? Lincoln Riley’s offense will be very good once again. The onus is on the defense … again. The Trojans haven’t allowed fewer than 5.5 yards per play since it gave up 5.4 yards a play in 2018 under Clay Helton.\n\nWe’re betting on a full offseason of health for John Mateer. He’s back for another run at it with the Sooners and was fantastic before he suffered a broken bone in his throwing hand in Week 4 against Auburn. OU’s defense was good enough to win a national title in 2025, but the offense simply wasn’t in the second half of the season.\n\nWith Ty Simpson off to the NFL, it’s up to Austin Mack or Keelon Russell to start at QB for the Crimson Tide. Mack has more familiarity with Kalen DeBoer and Ryan Grubb’s offensive system. Russell is a former five-star recruit. The Tide also bring in No. 1 running back recruit Ezavier Crowell. Can he make Alabama’s run game work again?\n\nLet’s be clear: This ranking is betting on Trinidad Chambliss winning his legal fight to get a sixth year of eligibility from the NCAA. The Rebels are clear contenders to get back to the College Football Playoff if he’s back in Oxford. If he’s not, there are major questions at quarterback after Austin Simmons transferred to Missouri.\n\nJust like with Ole Miss, we’re doing a bit of quarterback projection here and assuming that Darian Mensah ends up a Hurricane. If he doesn’t, then adjust your expectations accordingly. A young secondary should get even better in 2026 and Malachi Toney will be a sleeper Heisman candidate.\n\nQB CJ Carr got better as the season went on in 2025 and could be one of the best quarterbacks in college football in 2026. The Irish made some late moves in the transfer portal, have the No. 2 high school recruiting class in the country and, most importantly, coach Marcus Freeman rebuffed NFL interest to stay in South Bend.\n\nThe Aggies bring back QB Marcel Reed, RB Le’Veon Moss and WR Mario Craver. They also have On3’s No. 3 transfer portal class as they’ve loaded up on defense. Five of the Aggies’ top six rated transfers are all on that side of the ball, including former Tennessee QB Rickey Gibson and former Northwestern edge rusher Anto Saka.\n\nRaiding the transfer portal worked really well for Texas Tech ahead of the 2025 season. Why not do it again and add a QB this time? Brendan Sorsby comes over from Cincinnati and Texas Tech is reloading up front again after the success that its defensive line had in 2025.\n\nLane Kiffin got his quarterback in former Arizona State signal-caller Sam Leavitt. He also added former five-star recruit Husan Longstreet from USC. LSU was one of the biggest underachievers in 2025. This is a roster that can make the College Football Playoff. And, given the way Kiffin left Ole Miss, anything less than making the CFP semifinals can be considered a disappointment.\n\nQB Gunner Stockton is set to come back after he finished in the top 10 of the Heisman voting. The Bulldogs need to replace Zachariah Branch and CJ Allen, but this is a team loaded with top-tier recruits. Even though Georgia has lost in the quarterfinals in each of the past two seasons, we’re not betting against Kirby Smart’s team anytime soon.\n\nQB Julian Sayin and WR Jeremiah Smith are back as the Buckeyes are now the chasers in the Big Ten once again. Losing Sonny Styles, Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs on defense is significant, but Matt Patricia’s unit was so, so good in 2025 that it’s hard to see them taking a huge step back in 2026.\n\nThe Hoosiers have become one of the best teams at navigating the transfer portal and they have the top class in the country in 2026 after winning the national championship this season. Former TCU QB Josh Hoover is in line to replace Fernando Mendoza and WR Nick Marsh is a stellar add from Michigan State. Don’t overlook the edge rushing depth that Curt Cignetti signed as well.\n\nGet ready for another offseason of Texas talk. Don’t say you haven’t been warned. The Longhorns have loaded up on offense for what could be QB Arch Manning’s final season. RBs Raleek Brown and Hollywood Smothers arrived via the transfer portal along with former Auburn WR Cam Coleman. Oh, the defense is coordinated by Will Muschamp again, too. How good can he make that unit?\n\nThe return of Dante Moore for the 2026 season isn’t the only reason the Ducks are in this spot. Yes, Oregon loses TE Kenyon Sadiq, S Dillon Thieneman and LB Bryce Boettcher, but Matayo Uiagalelei is back along the defensive line along with A’Mauri Washington and Bear Alexander. RB Jordon Davison should be better as a sophomore and Oregon added Minnesota S Koi Perich in the transfer portal too.",

    "fullText": "As ESPN readies to air the College Football Playoff National Championship game, the sports network is announcing plans for a documentary series on the coach who has won more national championships than anyone else – Nick Saban.\n\nThe six-part series titled Saban, from ESPN and Word + Pictures, is directed by Russell Dinallo and produced by Words + Pictures’ Connor Schell, Libby Geist, Aaron Cohen, and Alexa Conway along with Tom Rinaldi, with Gabe Honig serving as co-executive producer and showrunner. It will document the man who won seven college football national championships – one at LSU and six at the University of Alabama.\n\nCollege Football Playoff National Championship: How To Watch Indiana Vs. Miami On TV & Online\n\nNFL Playoffs Schedule: How To Watch All Divisional Round Games Live Online & On TV\n\nDish Countersues Disney In Fight Over Sling TV Passes\n\nWatch a teaser for the Saban series below.\n\n“The series will peel back the curtain on the long closely guarded world of Saban,” notes a release, “with hundreds of hours of never-before-seen footage from the locker room and practice fields, as well as many other behind-the-scenes moments in his career at Alabama, and prior to that LSU, the Miami Dolphins, and Michigan State among other stops. There’s also a wealth of present-day interviews with Saban and his wife, the legendary Ms. Terry Saban, whose own influence and impact played a massive role in Nick’s success as a coach and leader.”\n\nSaban retired two years ago from Alabama and now serves as an ESPN analyst – as well as a pitchman for Aflac and Vrbo.\n\n“With my coaching days behind me, Ms. Terry and I have been doing a lot of reflection and realized we were ready to tell our story,” Nick Saban said. “The team at Words + Pictures has encouraged me to really look back not just at my time at Alabama, but every stop along the way – and not just reflect on what happened but consider the process which made it happen. I interacted with a lot of players and coaches along the way and I’m happy to see that so many of them have contributed to this docuseries. There’s a lot to tell, and I’m excited to share it all.”\n\nIn addition to his national titles, Saban’s football programs produced four Heisman Trophy winners and innumerable NFL stars. ESPN says the series will include “more than 30 hours of interviews with Saban, and more than 80 interviews with former players, assistant coaches, rivals, family, friends, and observers, the series offers a rare look at how he became the most successful and influential figure that the game of college football has ever known.”\n\n“There will never be another Nick Saban,” observed Connor Schell, CEO of Words + Pictures. “He’s a football genius, a singular leader, and a true icon who has done more than anyone to shape the modern game of college football and the culture around it. When you work with Coach Saban, you’re constantly reminded how every small detail matters and, in his case, that attention to detail and process has added up to an incredible journey and legacy. Working with Coach Saban and Ms. Terry has been a tremendous experience, and we can’t wait to share their story with the world.”\n\nESPN says the premiere date and full rollout plans for the series will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More",

    "fullText": "Manchester City have signed England defender Marc Guehi (25) from Crystal Palace in a deal worth an initial £20m, as reported by Sky Sports.\n\nThe 25-year-old has agreed a five-and-a-half-year contract at the Etihad Stadium, keeping him at City until 2031, with the deal also including a sell-on clause for Palace.\n\nCity moved for Guehi after suffering a number of injuries in defence. The centre-back was out of contract at the end of the season and had been close to joining Liverpool last summer, while Arsenal and Bayern Munich were also interested.\n\n“I am really happy and incredibly proud to be a Manchester City player,” said Guehi. “I am now at the best club in England and part of an unbelievable squad. I can’t wait to get started.”\n\nCity manager Pep Guardiola said the transfer was only possible because of Guehi’s contract situation, with several clubs hoping to sign him on a free transfer in the summer. He praised Guehi’s quality and versatility, saying he can play on either side of central defence.\n\nThe former Chelsea defender becomes City’s second January signing following the arrival of forward Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth. City’s spending over the past 12 months now stands at around £445m.\n\nCrystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner criticised the timing of the move, saying his side were “completely abandoned” by the club’s hierarchy after selling their captain so close to a match.\n\nGuehi leaves Palace having established himself as one of the Premier League’s most reliable defenders and a regular for England. For City, he arrives as an experienced option who can make an immediate impact as they continue to compete on multiple fronts.",

She also had 13 rebounds for her second double-double of the season.\n\nThe Coyotes held Denver under 40% shooting in each quarter and won all four quarters.

She reached 1,000 career points in just 78 games, with 774 of those points coming in 59 games at Truman State. She finished with 15 points on the day, a fifth consecutive game of 15-plus.\n\nThe Coyotes kept control down the stretch, not allowing Denver within 10 of the lead for the entire second half. The Pioneers shot 31.6% from the field and 22.2% from three, but under their season averages.\n\nOutside of Williams’ double-double, Joyce was second on the Coyotes in scoring Saturday with 15. Elise Turrubiates tallied 13 points and Tori Schlagel 10. Going up against her former team for the first time, Angelina Robles tallied nine points, six rebounds, six assists, three steals, and zero turnovers.\n\nSouth Dakota outrebounded Denver 41-37, and had more points off turnovers, points in the paint, second chance points, and bench points.\n\nThe Coyotes are now 14-5 on the season and 4-1 in Summit League play, marking the program’s best start to league play since the 2022-23 season.

Elvis Merzlikins had a succinct answer when asked Thursday what’s changed for the Jackets:\n\n3 wins in a row what’s different for the Blue Jackets?\n\n“New coach.” – Elvis Merzlikins pic.twitter.com/vKvUdIOkK1\n\n— Spittin' Chiclets (@spittinchiclets) January 16, 2026\n\nSeason Series: This marks the last time the Jackets and Pens will meet this season. All three prior games in this season series have gone to overtime, with the Penguins losing in a shootout in October but winning in overtime in November and earlier this month.\n\nHidden Stat: The Penguins are in a playoff spot in no small part thanks to their success against division opponents this season. Including their 2-0-1 record against the Blue Jackets, the Pens have gone 9-1-3 against teams in the Metropolitan Division so far this season. (Last season, Pittsburgh missed the playoffs after going 9-13-4 against division opponents).\n\nCole Sillinger – Adam Fantilli – Kirill Marchenko\n\nBoone Jenner – Sean Monahan – Kent Johnson\n\nDmitri Voronkov – Charlie Coyle – Mathieu Olivier\n\nDanton Heinen – Brendan Gaunce – Mikael Pyyhtia\n\nJake Christiansen / Erik Gudbranson\n\nGoalies: Elvis Merzlikins, Jet Greaves\n\nPotential scratches: Denton Mateychuk (day-to-day), Egor Zamula, Zach Aston-Reese\n\nInjured Reserve: Brendan Smith, Isac Lundestrom, Miles Wood, Mason Marchment\n\nBlue Jackets defenseman Denton Mateychuk is day-to-day after taking a hard hit from Brandon Tanev during the Jackets’ Sunday win over the Utah Mammoth. Columbus general manager Don Waddell said the team doesn’t expect the injury to be long-term.\n\nCoaching change in Columbus: The Blue Jackets fired former coach Dean Evason last week after one and a half seasons and a 19-19-7 start to the 2025-26 campaign. Evason told The Athletic’s Aaron Portzline he was “blindsided” by his dismissal.\n\nThe switch allowed the Jackets to bring in Rick Bowness, 70, who had most recently coached the Winnipeg Jets for two seasons from 2022 to 2024. He hasn’t been with the team for very long— he got the job offer Monday afternoon and joined the team Tuesday morning, per ESPN— but he’s since led the Jackets to wins over the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks.\n\nBones got the boys ready to go 👊\n\nCBJ x @PNCBank pic.twitter.com/tJ0gjt6C8V\n\n— Columbus Blue Jackets (@BlueJacketsNHL) January 14, 2026\n\nKent Johnson played a season-high 20:55 during his first game with Bowness. The Jackets could be hoping to see some more production from the second-line winger if he keeps getting more playing time going forward.\n\nLike the Penguins, the Blue Jackets have at times had a problems with holding on to late leads through the first half of the season. They blew third-period leads 15 times in their first 47 games, per Brian Hedger of the Columbus Dispatch. When asked about that habit after the Jackets held on to a comfortable lead in Thursday’s win over the Vancouver Canucks, Bowness said, per Portzline: “I don’t even worry about it. It was before I got here. I’m just not worried about it… That’s in the past. I know how I want us to play, so that’s the bottom line. And we’re building on that.”\n\nRickard Rakell – Sidney Crosby – Bryan Rust\n\nEgor Chinakhov – Tommy Novak – Evgeni Malkin\n\nAnthony Mantha – Ben Kindel – Justin Brazeau\n\nConnor Dewar – Blake Lizotte – Noel Acciari\n\nParker Wotherspoon / Jack St. Ivany\n\nGoalies: Stuart Skinner and Arturs Silovs\n\nPotential Scratches: Ryan Graves, Kevin Hayes\n\nIR: Erik Karlsson, Filip Hallander, Caleb Jones, Rutger McGroarty\n\nThe Penguins had an off day Friday after Thursday’s 6-3 win over the Flyers.\n\nSidney Crosby has 69 points (24 goals, 45 assists) in 48 career games against the Blue Jackets, which ranked behind only Patrick Kane for the most among any active NHL player. Kris Letang meanwhile leads all NHL defensemen with 14 goals against the Blue Jackets, his highest total against any single team, per Penguins PR.\n\nThe Penguins are 14-1-4 in their last 19 games against the Blue Jackets, and they’re 16-0-2 in their last 18 games against the Jackets at home, per Penguins PR.\n\nThe Pens’ special teams have been thriving lately. They’re heading into Saturday’s matchup having gone 16-for-16 on the PK over their last four games, and they’re currently ranked second in the NHL with a 29.4 percent power-play success rate.",

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section give their thoughts on the Chargers' playoff exit, the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the, Lakers, Clippers and Chloe Kim.",
    "fullText": "If there’s an important playoff game for the Chargers to win, you can bet they’re going to lose. Such was the case again against New England.\n\nWhile having a decent enough defense, the offense was pathetic. And, yes, I know their offensive line was completely depleted. But, the 49ers were banged up as well. They lost George Kittle and still won.\n\nWell, there’s always “next season.” Unfortunately, those two words still haunt the Chargers and their fans.\n\nOnce again the Chargers flop in the playoffs.\n\nThis time much of the blame should be placed at the top with Jim Harbaugh. Perhaps he did not watch or was not aware of how many times in this year's playoffs teams had failed to convert on fourth down with disastrous consequences. The psychological effect on the team from failing to convert and put points on the board early was evident. He had a team without their top running back and a very weak offensive line yet chose to go for it.\n\nHopefully he will learn from this or maybe it is time for Harbaugh to join his brother in seeking new jobs.\n\nNothing wrong with the Chargers that a new OC with a game plan can't fix. Or is there?\n\nThanks for firing your OC Greg Roman. Loyalty is great but loyalty does not get you to the promised land. In two postseason trips, one touchdown to show for it.\n\nIt needed to be done for Justin Herbert & Co.\n\nThe Yankees won 27 World Series championships by being the best team money can buy. The west coast Yankees, aka the Dodgers, are now the best team money can buy. That's capitalism, baby!\n\nAs a Dodgers fan for a Joe DiMaggio-esque 56 consecutive seasons, I am happy to have Kyle Tucker in the Dodgers' outfield in 2026. Certainly, he will be an improvement over Michael Conforto, and allow Teoscar Hernandez to go back to left field.\n\nHowever, I find it perplexing that a player who appeared in only 78 and 136 games in 2024 and 2025, and who has had only one top 10 MVP finish (fifth in 2023) in his career, would be signed for a whopping average of $60-million annually. To earn that enormous salary over the next four seasons, Tucker should be considered the best player in baseball not named Shohei Ohtani.\n\nNewsflash! The Dodgers buy another superstar, cost be damned! I'm not a Dodgers fan. I'm a Baseball fan, witnessing an organization job a system that destroys parity and fairplay. So go ahead — hop aboard the Dodgers bandwagon for another championship. While baseball fans everywhere else throw up their hands in disgust and flock to the NFL.\n\nThe Dodgers' signing of Kyle Tucker for ridiculous money now ensures a (stoppage) after this baseball season. For everyone saying other teams could do the same thing, really? As much as anyone could love the Dodgers, this just takes away from the game.\n\nIf you’re mad at the Dodgers don't stop there — might as well don a cape and be super mad because MLB has no kryptonite against them.\n\nWe should not expect too much from the Lakers. We have the same offense ran by the Dallas Mavericks for Luka Doncic transplanted to L.A. Give the ball to Luka and everyone else stands around and watch. Who is teaching these guys defense?\n\nHow many more games do fans have to endure before the Lakers hire a coach who is a defensive specialist? Where is Frank Vogel when you need him?\n\nThe only way I see the Lakers or Clippers making it to the second round of the playoffs is if they play each other in the first round.\n\nThe womens' snowboarding competition at next month's Winter Olympics in Milan has taken an interesting twist. American Chloe Kim, two-time Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe, will have to wear a shoulder brace after tearing her labrum. This would be analogous to having one arm tied behind your back.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

    "fullText": "The explosive growth of women’s sports has been a well-documented phenomenon over the last four years.\n\nBut when Chicago hosts the 2026 WNBA All-Star Weekend in July, Kara Bachman — the executive director of the Chicago Sports Commission — wants the city’s investors and businesses to do more than just cheer from the sidelines.\n\n“Do a little more,” Bachman said Friday during a launch event in Fulton Market. “Put your money where your mouth is.”\n\nThe league’s All-Star festivities will return to Chicago for the second time from July 23-25, with the game scheduled for Saturday, July 25 at the United Center. Those dates are more than six months away — but planning already has begun for a cornerstone of the WNBA calendar.\n\nThe latest step of that process took place Friday in a launch event headlined by Gov. JB Pritzker, mayor Brandon Johnson and part-owner Dwyane Wade as the Sky and the city made their pitch to local investors and business leaders to take part in the weekend.\n\nAccording to a report by Front Office Sports, Chicago was the only city to bid for hosting the 2026 All-Star weekend. The reticence from other teams? Hosting duties are split between the host team and the league, making the weekend an expensive affair as the standard for logistics such as hotels, parties and activations rise meteorically with the sport as a whole.\n\nSky co-owner and operating chair Nadia Rawlinson spearheaded the pitch for Chicago to land the event. She said the Sky are embracing the responsibility as an opportunity to highlight Chicago as a whole. While some features — a welcoming event, sponsor activations featuring star players, an invite-only party organized in collaboration with the players union — will be familiar from past iterations, Friday’s launch outlined a series of plans and initiatives to expand the event’s footprint.\n\nThis includes a series of VIP roundtable dinners in the months leading up to the event and an innovation summit to highlight and support advancements in women’s sports. During All-Star weekend, Rawlinson said the Sky will host a radio row to highlight prominent sports and business shows. The Sky also plan to partner with the city for a series of community initiatives around the weekend, including a project to add the WNBA 3-point line to basketball courts at every public park in Chicago.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Rawlinson emphasized that the Sky and the WNBA will seek to highlight the diversity of the league’s fanbase.\n\n“The WNBA is (a place) where everyone can find their person,” Rawlinson said. “They can find connection. This is a place where typically people who don’t have a natural community can find community. This is our chance to highlight that.”\n\nChicago hosted the 2022 WNBA All-Star Game at Wintrust Arena — home of the Sky. For the first time in franchise history, the team last season played two regular-season games at the United Center. The home of the NBA’s Bulls and NHL’s Blackhawks has nearly double the capacity of Wintrust’s 10,380.",

In a recent poll they conducted of over 115 sports figures, each of them nominating five of their personal best. The picks consisted of players, coaches and executives, which puts even more weight on these rankings.\n\nFreeman came in No. 20, the first college football head coach named, ahead of megastars like LA Laker LeBron James and New York Yankee Aaron Judge. There were only two other college coaches named with one other receiving multiple votes.\n\nFormer women’s basketball coach Muffet McGraw was one of the voters, as she noted “he puts players first, focusing on developing the whole person rather than just the athlete.”\n\nThis goes to show that Notre Dame has one of the best in the sport, and you could argue in all of sports. Freeman represents the university like he’s alum, and it’s clear the Irish have a great on leading their program.\n\nInspiring others by the way he leads ☘️\n\nCoach @Marcus_Freeman1 was named as one of the 40 most admired leaders in sports from 2025 in a survey of over 100 people in sports led by @TheAthletic.#GoIrish☘️ pic.twitter.com/FjszEviI8v\n\n— Notre Dame Football (@NDFootball) January 16, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Marcus Freeman is named as a the top leaders in all of sports",

The top-ranked Red Raiders breezed past Haverling 61-24, while improving to (10-1), and celebrating a two historic moments for the program. Midway through the 1st quarter of the contest, Selena Maldonado kicked off the senior night festivities, scoring an “and one,” off of a layup. At the line, Maldonado converted the free throw to earn the 1,000th point of her high school career.\n\nIn the 2nd, fellow senior Jordyn Dyring added to Hornell’s 21-5 lead and etched her name in history. With a floater in the paint, Dyring surpassed 1,527 career points to become the all-time leading scorer for the girl’s program. The impressive record had stood since 1996, when Megan Buchanan wrapped up her high school career with the Red Raiders. Buchanan would follow up her high school success at Division I U Albany.\n\nBuchanan was enshrined in both, the Hornell High School and Albany Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011, following an outstanding career. With the Great Danes, the Arkport native earned Female Athlete of the Year, as a member of the golf and basketball teams. On the court, Buchanan wrapped up her career 3rd in program history with 1,093 points. After her playing career, Buchanan has been serving as Senior Associate Athletic Director at Skidmore College, since 2005.\n\nElsewhere in high school basketball, the Horseheads girls wrapped up the STAC West Division title.

    "fullText": "Jan 16 (Reuters) - A study by AI risk management platform Alethea into the surge in artificial intelligence-generated fake content, dubbed \"AI slop,\" has warned sports teams, leagues and fans of the risks posed by increasingly sophisticated digital misinformation.\n\nRetired NFL player Jason Kelce never said ​2026 Super Bowl halftime singer Bad Bunny's critics were \"a bad fit for America's future\".\n\nSan Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle never ranted about slain ‌conservative activist Charlie Kirk and politics in football.\n\nHowever, thousands of people believed they did and that is the problem.\n\n\"Teams and players are suddenly being accused of things that are completely fabricated,\" Lisa Kaplan, ‌founder and CEO of Alethea, told Reuters on Friday, adding that the evolution of AI tools has made fake news a more daunting challenge.\n\n\"Content now looks real and is produced at a volume that makes it hard for the average person to determine if it's authentic,\" she said.\n\n\"Before, fake news often relied on human labour to repetitively copy and paste content. Today, AI can impersonate brands and create engaging images that mimic genuine announcements.\"\n\nKaplan noted that this wave of AI-generated misinformation has disrupted the traditional monetisation ⁠model of sports media. \"These networks drive engagement to questionable websites, ‌skew advertising metrics, and can even create scenarios that could manipulate betting markets,\" she added.\n\nC Shawn Eib, Alethea's Head of Investigations, described how these networks use tactics such as making multiple disjointed announcements, like the conflicting claims that former Baltimore Ravens coach ‍John Harbaugh had been hired by multiple teams at the same time.\n\n\"When a single figure appears to be linked with several teams at the same time, it quickly becomes clear that an AI system is behind the creation of these images,\" Eib explained.\n\nAI DECEPTION CAN EXPLOIT 'RAGE BAIT'\n\nThe content follows a formula: fake game updates, nonexistent celebrity feuds, manufactured scandals, and politicised ​quotes falsely attributed to star players.\n\nThe fabricated Kelce and Kittle quotes are prime examples. Both NFL stars publicly denied making comments they never said after the ‌posts went viral.\n\n\"If fans, players and even entire franchises fall prey to these manipulated narratives, it risks damaging reputations, undermining trust and even politicising sport,\" Alethea's VP of Communications Kaila Ryan said.\n\n\"Sports organisations need to proactively manage their brands and digital safety. It is crucial for teams and leagues to start monitoring these risks, work together across communications, legal and security teams, and educate fans to verify announcements from official channels,\" she added.\n\nThe business impact extends beyond reputational harm.\n\nThese networks siphon ad revenue from legitimate sports media and distort audience metrics. Some outbound links have been flagged for phishing and malicious redirects, presenting real fraud risk to fans.\n\nThe problem ⁠is not limited to the NFL. Alethea discovered similar operations targeting the NBA, WNBA, MLB, NHL, ​NASCAR, Formula 1, IndyCar and professional tennis.\n\nKaplan added that beyond monetisation, sport remains a rare cultural ​touchpoint that unites people, making them attractive targets for influence operations, and she pointed to Russia's alleged exploitation of then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's 2018 'Take a Knee' protest as a precedent.\n\nIn a 2019 report, the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed that Russian trolls had focused heavily ‍on the kneeling debate as part of ⁠a broader effort to stoke racial tensions and divide the U.S. following the 2016 election.\n\n\"Kaepernick's protests were exploited for a purpose that had nothing to do with sport. Instead, it's a way of leveraging a cultural touchstone and turning it into something that polarises people,\" said Kaplan.\n\n\"Teams need to ⁠work in unison to defend their identities and protect their fans from falling victim to fraud or manipulation,\" she added, noting that the best advice for fans is to be vigilant.\n\n\"Verify breaking news ‌through official team channels, don't click links in suspicious page comments and remember that outrage is often the product, not the by-product, ‌of what you're seeing\".",

With the Call of Duty franchise having an off year with Black Ops 7, sports titles took the top spots in PlayStation Store's American/Canadian and European PlayStation 5 downloads.\n\nNBA 2K26 was No. 1 in America and Canada, while EA Sports FC 26 claimed the top spot in Europe. It was previously clear that Black Ops 7 would have a hard time repeating Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's chart-topping performance in 2024. But the latest Call of Duty installment fell to No. 7 in America/Canada and Europe. By contrast, Battlefield 6 performed very well in both territories, with a No. 2 finish in North America and a fifth place slot in Europe. Through the end of November 2025, Circana had Battlefield 6 as the best-selling game of the year. But this particular list is only for PlayStation Store downloads and it doesn't count sales on other consoles or PC.\n\nThe lists contained some returning favorites like Minecraft and Helldivers 2, but newcomers like Arc Raiders, Ghost of Yotei, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made the cut in North America as well.\n\nAmong PlayStation 4 games, Red Dead Redemption 2 claimed No. 1 in both territories. Rockstar Games' 2018 open-world western has remained remarkably resilient, as has Grand Theft Auto 5, which placed highly on both the PS5 and PS4 lists.\n\nBeat Saber also claimed the top slots in America/Canada and Europe's PSVR 2 Games charts, and repeated its wins from 2024. Similarly, Fortnite was also a back-to-back winner for free-to-play games in both territories.\n\nThe complete list of 2025's top games on PlayStation Store can be found below.",

    "fullText": "In a recent report, Sky Sports stated that Arsenal are in the running to land Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi. It has been mentioned that the Gunners would have to rival Manchester City, Liverpool and Bayern Munich in the race to sign the English centre-back.\n\nGuehi has enjoyed a decent run of form at the South London club as he has put in a series of impressive displays for them on the defensive end of the field. The English talent has scored three goals and grabbed four assists in 33 appearances for Crystal Palace this season on all fronts.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been a rock at the back for the Eagles and deserves credit for making 30 tackles, 18 blocks, 25 interceptions and 105 clearances in the Premier League. He has even distributed the ball accurately from inside his half, as evidenced by his pass success rate of 84.5% in top-flight football (stats via fbref.com).\n\nHis current contract at Selhurst Park will run out at the end of this campaign. Hence, Arsenal could potentially sign him on a cut-price deal this month or on a free transfer next summer.\n\nSTRASBOURG, FRANCE – NOVEMBER 27: Marc Guehi of Crystal Palace during the UEFA Conference League 2025/26 League Phase MD4 match between Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace and Crystal Palace FC at Stade de la Meinau on November 27, 2025 in Strasbourg, France. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nGuehi loves a tackle and can time his challenges well to earn the ball back for his team inside his half. He usually puts his foot through the ball when required and can play his way out from the back.\n\nThe English sensation has got a wealth of experience at the highest level and won’t take much time to settle into life at Arsenal. He is also a great leader on the pitch.\n\nGuehi would undoubtedly bring more bite and steel to Mikel Arteta’s defence. He has what it takes to compete for a regular first-team spot at the Emirates Stadium in the coming seasons.\n\nAt 25, Guehi has his peak years ahead of him, which makes him a decent option for the Gunners to pursue this January or at the end of this campaign. He might even help Arsenal challenge for some major trophies over the next few years. Therefore, Arteta would be wise to try everything in his power to snap Guehi up soon.",

    "fullText": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\nThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024.\n\nMiss Universe Harnaaz Sandhu Joins Tiger Shroff, Sanjay Dutt in 'Baaghi 4' - Global Bulletin\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, ZEE5, SonyLIV Vie for India's IFFI Streaming Honor - Global Bulletin\n\nFox Orders Lifeguard Drama Series 'Rescue: Hi-Surf' from Producer John Wells (TV News Roundup)\n\nWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\nThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\nRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\nSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\nFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\nMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\nShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\nThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

(WMBD/WYZZ) — Morton did it to Washington again.\n\nPaige Selke and Abby VanMeenen scored 12 points each as third-ranked Morton handed top-ranked Washington its first loss of the season, 41-37, in a match-up of teams at the top of the Mid-Illini Conference standings Tuesday at Morton High School. The hosts (15-3, 7-0) led by as many as 12 points in the third quarter then had to hang on as the Panthers (17-1, 7-1) rallied to close within two in the final seconds.\n\nLast year, Morton went to No. 1 Washington and ended the Panthers season-opening 21-game win streak with a 46-45 win at Torry Gym. The Panthers returned the favor by beating the Potters in the regular season finale and in the sectional championship on the way to finishing third at state.\n\nPenelope Drake scored nine points for the Potters but may have delivered the game’s biggest play when she blocked a three-point shot by Washington’s Avery Tibbs with 0:15 left as Washington was aiming to tie the game. Tibbs finished with a game-high 14 points.\n\nThe two teams will meet again on Feb. 10 in the final game of the regular season in Washington.\n\nOther girls basketball winners included Notre Dame, Richwoods, Normal Community, Normal West, Metamora, Canton. Pekin, and Illini Bluffs. Boys basketball winners Tuesday included Normal Community, Normal West, Richwoods, Manual, Washington, Leroy, Fieldcrest, El Paso-Gridley, Elmwood and Peoria Heights.",

    "fullText": "Editor's note: Coaches are reminded to send in game results each weeknight, from 6-10 p.m., by emailing them to pjsports@providencejournal.com\n\nMarielle Nassiff provided some offensive pop in the third quarter that gave the Quakers the separation they needed to close out the Purple in their 51-37 win.\n\nThe first quarter was tough defensive basketball, as Moses Brown led 9-4, then took a 24-15 lead into halftime thanks to nine points from Nassiff and six from Lauren Bousquet in the second quarter.\n\nWith Classical still hanging around, the Quakers revved up the defensive measures. They limited the Purple to just five points in the third quarter and Nassiff got herself some buckets, scoring eight points in the stretch to build a 42-20 lead heading to the fourth quarter.\n\nNassiff finished as Moses Brown’s top scorer with 23 points. Bousquet was right behind her with 21 points and Adelaide Crosby and Madison Wilson accounted for the remaining seven points.\n\nJaydell Harris was the top scorer for Classical, putting up 12 points. Daniella Jimenez had seven in the loss.\n\nCranston West’s offense was feeling good on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Falcons made seven 3-pointers … in the first quarter against the Rebels. The early shooting led to a 28-point frame as Cranston West toppled South Kingston, 74-36, on the road in a Division I matchup.\n\nCranston West finished with 13 treys in the game with Talya Walker (19 points) making five from distance. Kyla Buco (18 points) was right behind her with four makes from beyond the arc. Walker and Buco each made three triples in the opening frame.\n\nSaniyya Chase scored a dozen points and Madeleine Marques added 11 in the victory. It was the Falcons’ best offensive game of the season by a wide margin as the Falcons hadn’t broken 60 points yet this season. Might Tuesday’s win spark a run for Cranston West?\n\nAn important matchup with Westerly awaits on Saturday at home.\n\nIt was close all night, but Chariho pulled out a nailbiter vs. St. Raphael in Division I play.\n\nThe Chargers carried just a 6-point lead into the break and that was enough to hold off the Saints behind Tessa Aiello’s 16 points. With scoring contributions from six different players, the Chargers used their balanced attack to secure their fourth win of the year.\n\nMenuhki Harris managed a dozen points and had 10 fouls shots in the game as the junior was tough to defend. The Chargers added six points from the line in their decisive 14-point fourth quarter that helped keep them ahead.\n\nAdrianna Noka supplied eight points in the win. Tuesday was a key win at home for the Chargers as they travel to Westerly on Thursday night for a rivalry match. Chariho could play upset against the Bulldogs, who are looking like one of the best teams in the state to start the year.\n\nSRA was paced by 16 points from Carolyn Abreu. The Saints host West Warwick on Thursday.\n\nGenesis Castro scored a team-high 18 points, including 4 buckets from beyond the arc, and teammates Ella Martin and Faith Van Ness added 13 and 11 points, respectively, in the Eagles victory, as Barrington is now 10-1 and ranked second to only Westerly in Division I.\n\nFor the Patriots in the loss, Annie Hurd scored 16 points with 2 threes, Violet Silvia acced 11 points and 3 treys, and Gyselle Mairs finished with 10 points and 2 threes. Portsmouth slips to 5-2 on the season.\n\nThe Skippers wasted little time in dispatching the Rams in his Division I clash, racing out to a 24-3 advantage and playing a solid defensive game to cruise to victory. Brooke Faunce led the way with a game-high 16 points and Mya Macchioni added 8 more as North Kingstown pushed its record to 6-3 with its second win over La Salle (2-8) this season.\n\nFor the Rams, Maya Fernandes led the team with 6 points as La Salle gears up to face Portsmouth later this week.\n\nWesterly continues to prove it’s one of the state’s best programs.\n\nThe Bulldogs handled Pawtucket comfortably in a 65-23 victory on Tuesday night at home. Westerly assisted on 24 of its 27 field goals with Macy Antoch’s 14 points pacing the group. The freshman also supplied four rebounds and four steals in a standout night in the Division I matchup.\n\nDanica Jarrett was right behind her teammate with 13 points, five rebounds and a trio of steals. Cece Saint rounded out Westerly’s scorers in double figures with 10 points. But the standout performers don’t end there. Santanaa Hamelin supplied seven assists and seven steals as the freshman was all over the court.\n\nThe young, and talented, Bulldogs are now 9-1 overall on the year and host Chariho on Thursday.\n\nEast Providence girls basketball rebounded in a big way Tuesday night.\n\nThe Division II Townies managed a season-high 57 points in their 57-43 victory against Division I’s West Warwick. The win comes on the heels of EP losing to Rogers last Friday.\n\nZarae Hall got East Providence started hot with 14 points in the first half and finished off the Wizards with 24 in the game. The junior made 10 shots from the field, including a trio of 3-pointers to push EP to its fifth win of the season.\n\nTrinity Provencher added a dozen points, including eight in the fourth quarter to close out the hosts. Audrey Bernard supplied another dozen points as EP’s offense was firing on all cylinders. East Providence travels to Tiverton on Friday.\n\nWest Warwick was led by Brea Lima’s 18 points and Alexa Foley’s 14.The Wizards meet St. Raphael on Thursday in Pawtucket.\n\nThe Vikings believe in the old adage that you only get one chance to make a first impression. So opening the game with a 17-point first quarter, and then adding 18 in the second was pretty indicative of how this Division II contest would play out.\n\nRogers started hot and stayed that way. They were paced by the dynamic duo of Zaida Aponte – 21 points, including four 3's – and Tameka Robertson – 14 first half points. The result was a 35-17 lead by the break and an easier second half.\n\nFor the Mariners, Taylor Sullivan and Delaney Bonneau each scored 11 points, with Sullivan making a pair of 3-pointers and Bonneau going 6-fo-6 at the foul line.\n\nRogers moves to 4-2 and will have a stiff test coming later this week when it faces first-place Coventry (8-1).\n\nFreshman Eveisha Santana had a night to remember as she poured in 26 points, 6 from beyond the arc, pulled down 8 rebounds and had 5 steals and 4 assists to lead the Knights to a win over the Villa Novans. Also factoring in the win was Keeana Palmer who had 8 points, 5 boards, 3 steals and 4 assists. Central improved to 7-1 on the season.\n\nSkyla Caro topped Woonsocket in scoring with 11 points and teammate Akira Moise added 8 points in the loss.\n\nLincoln School 53, Mt. Hope, 29\n\nThe Cavaliers made it two in a row on back to back nights, matching last season's win total (three) in the young season. Juanita Sanchez was up 39-21 at the break and was never threatened in the second half\n\nThe Cavs were led by Geston Richardson with 25 points and Corey McClain, who added 17. Amaree Gomes and Allen Ortiz also scored in double figures in the win. The Patriots were led by James Nute (11 points) and Josh Morales (10).\n\nSmithfield 47, North Kingstown 40\n\n200 medley relay: Westerly - Enzo Gynther, Brady Casady, Sam Lorello, Colby Champlin, 1:57.38; 200 free: Westerly - Cooper Palumbo, 2:09.88; 200 IM: NP/S/NS - Mason Smith, 2:28.65; 50 free: Westerly - Champlin, 2:14.91; 100 fly: NP/S/NS - Sean Mania, 57:07; 100 free: Westerly - Lorello, 1:00.50; 500 free: NP/S/NS - Mason Smith, 5:52.82; 200 free relay: Westerly - Juan Aquino, Josue Aquino, Casady, Champlin, 1:56.85; 100 back: Westerly - Gynther, 1:07.82; 100 breast: NP/S/NS - Mania, 1:12:28; 400 free relay: NP/S/NS - Mania, Connor Farrell, Joshua Mesick, Smith, 4:00.43\n\n200 medley relay: NP/S/NS - Patty Oussi, Alexa Cortes, Emily Pace, Lauren Riley, 2:11.33; 200 free: Westerly - Avery Lamb, 2:20:38; 200 IM: NP/S/NS, Alexa Cortes, 2:26.37; 50 free: Westerly, Sonja Beasley, 26:20; 100 fly: NP/S/NS, Oussi, 1:09.45; 100 free: Westerly, Beasley, 58:08; 500 free: Westerly, Olivia ONeil, 6:07:11; 200 free relay:  Alexia McCabe, Peyton Pietraszka, O’Neil and Beasley, 1:52:50; 100 back: NP/S/NS, Oussi, 1:10.93; 100 breast: NP/S/NS, Cortes, 1:15.65; 400 free relay: Westerly - O’Neil, Lamb, McCabe and Beasley, 4:12:03.\n\nHannah Hochman had two wins in two individual events (100 Free, 100 breaststroke) and she also participated in the winning 200 Medley Relay, and teammate Samantha Lin also had two individual victories (200 IM, 100 butterfly) and she also swam a leg on the winning 200 Medley Relay helping the Titans edge the Patriots.\n\nFor Pilgrim, Juliana Kavanaugh also captured two individual events (200 free, 100 backstroke) she swam a leg for the winning 400 freestyle relay.\n\nClassical vs. Hendricken at Al Morro Athletic Complex, 6 p.m.\n\nChariho at Narragansett, 6 p.m.\n\nAchievement First (PVD) vs. Hope at 85 Garfield Ave. Cranston, RI, 6:30 p.m.\n\nJohnston at Burrillville, 6:30 p.m.\n\nMt.
