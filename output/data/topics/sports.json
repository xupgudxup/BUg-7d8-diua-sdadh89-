    "description": "This story is part of IndyStar's project \"Only woman in the room:\" How Indy became top city in nation for women sports execs",
    "fullText": "This story is part of the IndyStar project \"Only woman in the room:\" How Indy became top city in nation for women sports execs\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- These five women have combined for more than 125 years of experience in sports careers and beyond. We asked them to give their best advice, lessons learned and how to navigate being a woman in the male-dominated sports industry.\n\nTitle: Chief operating officer of USA Track & Field since 2012\n\nNotable career stop: Washington spent five years with the U.S. Department of Labor, starting as a staff attorney and ending her tenure as deputy associate general counsel.\n\nCareer highlight: Washington was a key figure as USA Track & Field was determining whether to move its national headquarters from Indianapolis. The organization announced last year it would remain in the city and move into IU Indy's new James T. Morris arena in the fall of 2026.\n\n\"Renee deserves a lot of credit for what they've been able to accomplish,\" said Julie Roe Lach, executive vice president of Pacers Sports & Entertainment, \"including choosing to keep their headquarters in Indianapolis.\"\n\nAdvice for younger self: \"I say it to young people all the time, the world is not over tomorrow. You think that you've got to decide what you're going to do now, and you don't. There is time. There's always a new chapter you can write.\"\n\nAdvice for women: \"You can be competitive as women, but if you're going to do that, be competitive against the whole field, not just the women in the field. That is just so important.\"\n\nMaking a mark: \"You have to understand the larger picture in almost anything that you do, which means that you have to ask questions and you have to be inquisitive. And that makes you do your job not just efficiently, you want to go beyond being efficient. It helps you know your organization, and it helps make you of more value than you might have ever thought.\"\n\nTitle: President of Andretti Global, chief operating officer of TWG Motorsports\n\nNotable career stop: Gregory spent nearly 14 years with NASCAR as executive vice president and chief marketing and content officer.\n\nFor most of Gregory's career, she's been the only woman or one of few women in the room, and she's felt eyes looking at her, though she said she never had an overt incident where she felt unfairly treated because of her gender. Early on, she would sit off to the side of the room, instead of at the table, because she didn't have the experience or confidence to be there.\n\nAdvice for women: \"There were times when you kind of look around and say, 'I can't pay attention to the fact that I'm the only woman in the room. I just need to do a good job and prove myself and deliver on my own merits and not get sidetracked and worried about the fact that you might be the only one.' You have to kind of just plow through that.\"\n\nStill a way to go: \"You see this explosion in women's sports, which is fantastic, and the fan consumption, and that's going to help. But when you get into some of the day in, day out, it's not quite as far along as you would think. It's going to catch up, but we still have some work to do. We used to say it doesn't have a finish line at NASCAR and that was on diversity in general. You have to be deliberate about it.\"\n\nBringing the A game: \"As women in our various fields, you have to be prepared. You have to be better, in my opinion. And you've got to come with your A game all the time, and that does put a lot of pressure on you. But when you do that, you perform better, and then you gain more credibility, and then you have that reputation to build on, but you've got to invest the time in that up front.\"\n\nTitle: Senior vice president Penske Entertainment, leading marketing, branding, communications, content and broadcast across the IndyCar series and at Indianapolis Motor Speedway\n\nNotable career stop: Melangton was the second woman in history to lead a Super Bowl as the CEO and president of the 2012 Indianapolis Super Bowl Host Committee. She once had a guy come up to her at a funeral and say, \"Are you that lady running the Super Bowl? That's just crazy to me that they hired a woman.\"\n\n\"And I started laughing,\" Melangton said. \"And instead of being offended, I said, 'Tell me why it's crazy.'\"\n\nLesson learned: Early in her career, Melangton was working for Indiana Sports Corp. as director of events and was asked to help create the Big Ten women's basketball tournament. She went to work with the league negotiating, discussing, planning and, in 1995, it was set. The first tournament would be played at Hinkle Fieldhouse.\n\n\"It was so funny, I didn't know anything about basketball. And the first day, the athletes were throwing the balls out and they said, 'Did somebody break all these balls in?'\" Melangton said. \"I thought, 'What? I don't know anything about that.'\" Melangton and her staff stayed up all night bouncing the basketballs on the court to get them broken in for the games the next day.\n\nAdvice for women: \"Be the most confident person in the room, be better than everybody else, and it takes gender off the table.\"\n\nIn the eyes of her colleagues: \"The authenticity that Allison brings to all of her relationships, whether she knows you for many, many years or is new, there's a confidence and a comfort level that she provides to other women, other female leaders that I think is just amazing,\" said Gregory. \"It's something that motivates me. She leads by example.\"\n\nTitle: Executive vice president of Pacers Sports & Entertainment\n\nNotable career stop: Lach spent more than a decade as commissioner of the Horizon League before being hired by the Pacers in October.\n\nHer start in sports: \"Basketball was always my love, from middle school. They say, 'When you find your passion, you lose yourself while you're doing it,' and I would just lose myself in the midst of the game because I just loved it.\" Lach was a basketball All-Star at Millikin University.\n\nSome of Lach's favorite memories growing up happened on Sundays. The family would go to church, go home and watch WWF, then her dad would drop her off at the gym for pickup games. She'd wait on the sideline to get chosen on a team.\n\n\"I was always the only girl, but it didn't bother me because I could play, I could hang. You'd have to put up with some of the usual shenanigans, but I learned a lot,\" Lach said. \"My dad's proudest moment and his hardest moment was when I got picked ahead of him. But that was always the joke. He'd say, 'I knew you'd finally made it when they were picking you because they wanted to win.'\"\n\nLach was part of creating Indiana Sports Corp.'s 2050 vision, which included making Indy the women's sports capital of the world.\n\n\"No city has claimed it, because no city has done, I would argue, as much as we've already done,\" she said. \"And it's not just sporting events, although that's important. It's women leading in sports.\"\n\nProudest accomplishment: \"It's probably more behind the curtain. Those of us, especially in sports, get emails or calls or are approached by students or people that want to work in sports. I have coffee or Zooms or calls with people at least once or twice a week looking for some mentoring of how do you break in? it is definitely a pay it forward type deal, but it's the right thing to do. I think we all have a duty, and I think that's something that matters.\"\n\nTitle: Owner of Baughman Consulting, which specializes in sports management, bid concept and creation, hospitality and special events. She most recently was lead event director for WNBA All-Star 2025.\n\nNotable career stop: Baughman spent nearly 22 years at Indiana Sports Corp., ending her tenure as senior vice president. Baughman has been a part of putting on Indy's biggest sporting events. Among them the Super Bowl in 2012, the NBA All-Star Game in 2024, the National College Football Playoff in 2022 and so many others.\n\nWhen college football's biggest game was played in Indy, Baughman held the title of president of the 2022 College Football Playoff Host Committee. When she got the job, she had a sense of pride. She knew she had proven herself.\n\n\"It was more just like, 'You're really good at this. We trust you. We want you to do this.' Not, 'You're a woman and we should consider putting a woman in the position,'\" she said. \"Which to me is really important because I want to be the best person doing what I'm doing not the best woman doing something.\"\n\nAsk questions: \"There's so much to be learned from other people. And I feel like no one knows everything. And to be genuine in what you're knowledgeable about and what you think you have a fair opinion on. And when you're really seeking some guidance, that doesn't make you weak or less. It actually is really smart.\"\n\nAt the WNBA All-Star weekend this year, Baughman could be seen rolling carts, helping set up and tearing down, carrying boxes and inventorying T-shirts.\n\n\"Work your tail off. Do everything. Don't be like, 'Oh, I manage, I don't do those things.' Do whatever you need to do and help other people learn how to do it by doing it with them,\" Baughman said. \"I don't really like layers and titles. You get a much better result if you can get people to do things collectively as a group, because it feels more like a shared outcome at the end of the day.\"\n\nSign of a good leader: \"Let other people shine, and get out of the way sometimes.\"\n\nIn the eyes of her colleagues: \"Susan is so creative. So many of the creative things you see in the city related to sports are all her,\" said Melangton. \"She is deeply passionate and pours her entire self into whatever she's working on.\"\n\nFollow IndyStar sports reporter Dana Benbow on X: @DanaBenbow.

Spurs host the Czech Republic club at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this evening in the Champions League, and the 20-year-old Frenchman has been selected despite not initially registering him for the league phase of the elite European competition.

    "description": "Voting is open for the BBC Sports Personality's World Sport Star of the Year 2025 award.",
    "fullText": "Six contenders have been shortlisted for the award, which will be presented during the live show on BBC One on Thursday, 18 December.\n\nThe 2024 World Sport Star award was won by Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis.\n\nBelow you can vote for your favourite - and find out more about the contenders.\n\nSpain midfielder Caldentey enjoyed a stellar first season in English football, with her performances instrumental in Arsenal's march to Champions League glory, beating her former club Barcelona in the final.\n\nAfter scoring 19 goals in 41 appearances for the Gunners in her first season, Caldentey was named the Professional Footballers' Association women's player of the year and the Women's Super League player of the year.\n\nCaldentey scored in the Women's Euro 2025 final, which Spain narrowly lost to England on penalties.\n\nThe 29-year-old was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or award, missing out to compatriot Aitana Bonmati, and was also included in Uefa's Champions League team of the year.\n\nThe making of Spain and Arsenal's humble magician\n\nArsenal's Caldentey wins WSL player of year award\n\nSport: Boxing Country: United States\n\nCrawford cemented his status as one of the greatest boxers in history by becoming the first male fighter to be undisputed champion across three weight divisions in the four-belt era.\n\nThe 38-year-old had to go up two weight classes to face the great Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez at super-middleweight, but secured a unanimous decision in front of a fiercely pro-Mexican crowd in Las Vegas.\n\nIn claiming the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO and The Ring belts, the American extended his professional record to 42 straight victories - the past 20 of which have been world title fights.\n\nHowever, Crawford was stripped of the WBC belt earlier in December, with president Mauricio Sulaiman claiming the American did not pay sanctioning fees.\n\n'Crawford conquers Canelo to become the face of boxing'\n\nHistory-maker Crawford stuns Canelo in Vegas\n\nSport: Athletics Country: Sweden\n\nIn 2025, Sweden's Duplantis once again soared above his rivals to capture a third pole vault World Championship gold.\n\nIn doing so, he set yet another world record of 6.30m - his fourth of this year alone - and the 14th of his remarkable career.\n\nHe also retained his indoor world title - meaning he has won eight successive golds in major global competitions - and won all 16 of his events to become the first male pole vaulter in modern history to go undefeated for two successive years.\n\nIn November, the 26-year-old was named men's world athlete of the year for a third time.\n\nDuplantis gets 14th world record & third world title\n\nThe making of Mondo: How Duplantis is reaching new heights\n\nSport: Athletics Country: United States\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone, the greatest female 400m hurdler of all time, made the switch to the 400m flat at the World Athletics Championships this year, but the result remained the same as she became the first athlete to claim career world titles in both disciplines.\n\nHer time of 47.78 seconds was the second fastest in history and she came close to breaking a world record that has stood since 1985.\n\nThe 26-year-old is undefeated across both distances for two years.\n\nShe added another gold in the 4x400m relay in Tokyo and was named the women's world athlete of the year.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone wins 400m gold with second fastest time in history\n\nDuplantis & McLaughlin-Levrone named world athletes of year\n\nOn the LA Dodgers' march towards retaining their World Series title, Japanese superstar Ohtani produced one of the greatest individual performances in Major League Baseball history.\n\nThe rare 'two-way' player, who operates as both a pitcher and a hitter, smashed three home runs and struck out 10 batters against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThat made him the first pitcher since 1942 to hit three home runs in the same game.\n\nThe 31-year-old was named as one of baseball's Most Valuable Players for the third straight year, and the fourth time overall, moving him into second on the all-time list.\n\nOhtani wins fourth Major League MVP award\n\nOhtani rewrites history to send Dodgers to World Series\n\nSalah, the 'Egyptian King', scored 29 Premier League goals and broke a host of records as he helped Liverpool to a record-equalling 20th top-flight title in the 2024-25 season.\n\nHe became the first player to win the Golden Boot, the Playmaker award for most assists and the Premier League player of the season award in the same campaign. He was also named as the PFA men's player of the year for a record third time and collected a third Football Writers' footballer of the year award.\n\nThe 33-year-old became the highest-scoring overseas player in Premier League history, overtaking Sergio Aguero's mark of 184.\n\nSalah has scored five goals in 18 appearances for Liverpool so far this season, and on Saturday said he felt like he had been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club and that his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down.\n\n'The hunger makes me want more' - Salah wins third PFA award",
