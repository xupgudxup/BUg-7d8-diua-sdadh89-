    "fullText": "LINCOLN, Neb. (Courtesy of Nebraska Huskers Athletics) – The No. 1 Nebraska volleyball team cruised into the NCAA Regional Finals with a 25-12, 25-11, 25-12 sweep of No. 16 Kansas on Friday night in front of a crowd of 8,800 at John Cook Arena at the Bob Devaney Sports Center.\n\nThe Huskers (33-0) were dominant from start to finish, never trailing in the match. NU hit .450 – its third-highest attack percentage of the year – and stifled the Jayhawks (24-11) to a season-low .029 hitting percentage. Nebraska also out-blocked Kansas, 10-1, out-dug the Jayhawks 48-30 and had six services aces and only three errors while KU had one ace and six errors.\n\nNebraska’s middles were dominant, combining for 21 kills on 28 error-free swings (.750 attack percentage) while adding eight blocks. Rebekah Allick had nine kills on nine swings to hit 1.000, and she added three blocks. Andi Jackson also had nine kills on .600 hitting with five blocks. Manaia Ogbechie produced three kills on four swings in the third set.\n\nHarper Murray added seven kills and had a match-high 10 digs. Bergen Reilly dished out 30 assists while Olivia Mauch had a season-high three aces.\n\nThree players led Kansas with six kills.\n\nSet 1: NU got off to a 4-0 start on Choboy’s serve with a kill by Allick and two blocks by Jackson, one with Adriano and one with Murray. After Kansas got on the board, NU scored a 6-0 run with Mauch serving a pair of aces to go up 10-1. Jackson’s fourth block – with Reilly – and a kill by the junior middle blocker made it 13-3 Big Red. The Jayhawks scored three in a row to cut it to 13-6, but four kills by Allick put NU ahead 18-7. Landfair set Allick for her sixth kill on six swings, and a solo block by the senior middle blocker made it 21-8. Jackson and Landfair tacked on kills for a 25-12 win.      \n\nSet 2: Adriano had an early kill and an ace, and Murray and Jackson each posted a kill and a block together as the Huskers built a 7-3 lead. KU pulled within 9-7, but a Murray kill started a 5-0 run with Allick providing two kills and a block with Adriano. The lead grew to 10 at 19-9 after a block by Allick and Adriano and a kill by Murray. An Adriano kill made it 20-9, and Jackson and Murray teamed up for a block and a 22-11 lead. The Huskers closed out a 25-11 win on a Choboy ace.\n\nSet 3: Sigler had two kills, and Landfair and Jackson pounded away for a 9-4 NU lead. Landfair tacked on another kill before one by Manaia Ogbechie put NU ahead 13-6. Ogbechie, Murray and Jackson added kills, and Murray served an ace to help the Huskers go up 20-9. NU went on to finish the sweep, 25-12.\n\nUp Next: Nebraska will take on No. 6 Texas A&M in Sunday’s NCAA Regional Final at 2 p.m. on ABC. The Aggies beat No. 9 Louisville, 3-2 in a reverse sweep, in the first match on Friday.\n\nWith the win, Nebraska advanced to an NCAA Regional Final for the 34th time in program history. The Huskers’ 34 regional final appearances are the most in NCAA history. Nebraska has made an NCAA Regional Final in 13 of the past 14 seasons.\n\nThe Huskers played their 175th NCAA Tournament match tonight. Nebraska and Stanford are the only two programs to play 175 NCAA Tournament matches.\n\nWith the win, Nebraska improved to 137-38 all-time in the NCAA Tournament. The Huskers rank second in NCAA history in postseason wins and winning percentage (.783).\n\nThe win was Nebraska’s 33rd consecutive victory. The Huskers are 33-0 this season, marking the third straight season Nebraska has won 33 matches. The 33 wins tie for the second-most victories in a season by a Husker team in the NCAA era (1981-present).\n\nNebraska improved to 34-7 all-time in NCAA Regional Semifinal matches, including a 17-1 record in matches played in Lincoln.\n\nThe Huskers improved to 90-7 all-time in home NCAA Tournament matches, including a 35-2 record at the Devaney Center.\n\nNebraska has won 90 home matches in the NCAA Tournament while only four other schools have 90 or more total victories in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNU has won 29 consecutive home matches in the NCAA Tournament, a school record.\n\nOverall, Nebraska has won 63 consecutive home matches dating back to Dec. 1, 2022. That ties for the fifth-longest streak in NCAA Division I history and ties for the second-longest streak in Husker history.\n\nWith the win, Nebraska improved to 13-0 against ranked opponents this season. The 13 victories against ranked opponents are tied for second in school history, one shy of the school record (14 in 1998).\n\nNebraska won the first two sets and is now 106-2 all-time in the NCAA Tournament when taking a 2-0 lead.\n\nNebraska was the first to 20 points in each of the three sets. The Huskers are now 95-0 this season in sets when reaching 20 points first.\n\nThe Huskers held Kansas to fewer than 15 points in all three sets. That marked the second time this season that Nebraska has held its opponents to fewer than 15 points in every set, with both occurrences coming against top-25 teams (also against No. 25 Penn State on Nov. 28).\n\nNebraska won the first set, 25-12. That marked the Huskers’ 46th consecutive set won at home this season. That is a school record for consecutive sets won at home in one season, eclipsing the 45 consecutive home sets won by the 2004 team.\n\nOverall, Nebraska has now won 48 consecutive sets at home which ties for the second-longest streak in school history, trailing only the 52 consecutive home sets won spanning the 2001-02 seasons.\n\nNebraska stuffed four of Kansas’ first 11 swings of the night, recording four blocks in the first eight rallies. The Huskers had as many blocks in the match’s first 15 rallies (5) as they did in their second-round sweep of Kansas State last Saturday.\n\nFueled by the block, Nebraska won 13 of the first 16 rallies of the match to take a 13-3 lead.\n\nNebraska finished with 10 blocks in the match, tying for its highest block total in 13 matches.\n\nThe Huskers hit .450 in the match, its third-highest attack percentage this season. Two of Nebraska’s three matches this season hitting .450 or better have come in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNebraska has now hit above .400 in nine matches this season, the most in a single season in the rally-scoring era (2001-present).\n\nThe Huskers played three middle blockers in the match in Rebekah Allick, Andi Jackson and Manaia Ogbechie. The middles combined for 21 kills on 28 error-free swings.

This is unreal.\n\n\"My family won't believe me. Seeing Sir Gareth Edwards' name on the trophy, joining icons, I'm genuinely speechless.\"",

    "fullText": "Premier Sports Cup final: St Mirren v Celtic\n\nVenue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Sunday, 14 November Kick-off: 15:00 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sounds & digital\n\nCeltic manager Wilfried Nancy says victory in Sunday's Premier Sports Cup final against St Mirren would \"validate\" what he is trying to implement at his new club.\n\nBut he insists he will have \"many other\" chances to prove himself to their supporters.\n\nNancy became the first Celtic boss to lose his first two matches in charge as they were swatted aside by Roma in the Europa League on Thursday following last weekend's Scottish Premiership defeat by Heart of Midlothian.\n\nMany supporters had left by the time the full-time whistle blew and those that remained expressed their frustration at both the result and performance.\n\nGiven the importance of Nancy's first three matches in charge, some fans were confused by the timing of his appointment.\n\nThe Frenchman understands what is at stake at Hampden but insists he is not thinking about the prospect of a third straight defeat.\n\n\"For me? No,\" he said when asked about the importance of winning a trophy.\n\n\"For my players, yes. And for the fans, yes.\n\n\"Yes, I would like to win the trophy. I'm pretty sure that, if we don't win it, it's going to be difficult, because when we lose, this is painful.\n\n\"But, again, I am optimistic as a person. So hopefully we're going to do it. And also if it's going to validate what we are doing. But, if not, I don't want to think about this because, for the moment, I want to stay positive and this is the way I think.\n\n\"I'm going to have many, many other times to show, to do my stuff and to convince the fans that I am the right guy.\"\n\n'Nancy exposed to brutal life as Celtic manager as cup final looms'\n\nDoes Nancy 'know what he's walked in to' amid horror Celtic start?\n\nNancy inherited a side that had won seven from eight matches under interim manager Martin O'Neill, but he stamped his own identity on the team from the start, switching to a back three against both Hearts and Roma.\n\nWith some players shoehorned into unfamiliar positions, Celtic have struggled to click in attack and were dismantled at the back by Roma on Thursday in a dominant first-half display.\n\nStill, the former Columbus Crew head coach has seen enough to believe his system will come good.\n\n\"I watched the game and obviously we had a difficult moment, but we had also good moments,\" he said\n\n\"This game for me was important because it gives me the possibility to set the standard regarding what we want to achieve and it was good to compare certain things [with Roma].\n\n\"After that, the standard, we have it already. The desire to compete, the desire to train well, the desire to improve, this is the standard.\n\n\"The desire also to do what it takes to have good performance, we have it. We have to be better in terms of execution, but we are on the right track.\n\n\"For one week, I can see good stuff. We need also to improve on certain things, but it will come.\"\n\nGiven the two defeats leading into the cup final, Nancy admitted there will be a degree of doubt but dismissed the idea there was an added pressure on the game.\n\n\"It doesn't change,\" he added. \"A final is a final, it's not the same.\n\n\"Obviously the fact that we didn't win the last two games, mentally we can have a bit of uncertainty.\n\n\"But we're having a good discussion with the players and we know what we did well, we know what we need to improve and everything is clear.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola has selected an unchanged side for the Champions League clash with Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nThe City boss goes with the same starting line-up that beat Sunderland 3-0 on Saturday in the Premier League.\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS FOR CITY V BRENTFORD\n\nVictory in game six of the league stage would see us move into the top-eight in the Champions League table as we aim to get one of the top spots to avoid the play-offs.\n\nCity travelled to Spain with a 21-man squad with Rodri, Mateo Kovacic and John Stones unavailable due to injury.\n\nREAL MADRID XI: Courtois, Valverde (C), Asencio, Rudiger, Carreras, Tchouameni, Ceballos, Bellingham, Rodrygo, Gonzalo, Vinicius\n\nSubs: Lunin, Fran Gonzalez, Endrick, Mbappe, Guler, Fran Garcia, Brahim, Cestero, Mastantuono, Martinez, Valdepenos\n\nCITY XI: Donnarumma, Nunes, Dias, Gvardiol, O’Reilly, Nico, Bernardo (C), Foden, Cherki, Doku, Haaland\n\nSubs: Trafford, Bettinelli, Reijnders, Ake, Marmoush, Ait-Nouri, Savinho, Khusanov, Bobb, Lewis\n\nCity are in the winning habit, with three victories on the bounce so Pep has stuck with a successful formula.\n\nThat should see Nico O’Reilly and Matheus Nunes as our full-backs either side of Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol.\n\nNico will playing in the holding midfield role with captain and Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden close by.\n\nErling Haaland will again lead the attack with Rayan Cherki and Jeremy Doku offering plenty of threat going forward for the Blues.\n\nIf this feels like a regular fixture, that’s because tonight’s clash will be the 15th time we’ve met since the 2012/13 season, making it the most-played Champions League game during that time.\n\nThat probably reflects our positions as the most successful teams in Spain and England in recent years and even with the familiarity, it certainly hasn’t bred contempt, with the encounter as mouthwatering as ever.\n\nThis will be the fifth successive season that we visit the Santiago Bernabeu with two draws and two defeats in our last four trips and our last win there in February 2020 so a win is due.\n\nCity go into tonight’s match sitting 12th in the Champions League standings and a victory in the Spanish capital would move us into the top eight and therefore avoid the play-offs for the round of 16.\n\nThe new format means those games can present a real pot luck of an opponent; last season we had the tricky task of facing tonight’s opponents who are also the record winners of the trophy.\n\nAhead of tonight’s game, the table shows we would currently face either Italian champions Napoli or Azerbaijani side Qarabag, so it’s a game to be avoided if possible.\n\nThis will be the 15th time that Real Madrid and City have faced each other in the Champions League. Since their first meeting in the 2012/13 season, it is already the most-played fixture in the competition in this period (14 games).\n\nCity have lost our last two games against Real Madrid, suffering defeats home and away against them in last season’s play-off round. This is as many losses as we had experienced in our previous 11 games against the Spanish side combined.\n\nPep Guardiola has faced Real Madrid on 27 previous occasions, winning 48% of those matches and only lost one of his first nine away games. However, he is winless in the most recent four against the Spanish side and has never gone five in succession without beating them.\n\nThis will be the first managerial meeting between Xabi Alonso and Guardiola. Alonso made 79 appearances in his playing career under Guardiola, all for Bayern Munich between August 2014 and May 2016.\n\nSince November 2024, City have lost six of our 12 games in the Champions League. Prior to this run of 12, their previous six defeats in the competition came over the course of 69 matches, between October 2018 and October 2024.\n\nReal Madrid are currently on the third-longest streak of scoring in consecutive home games in European Cup/Champions League history (38 games), behind a 44-game run by Real Madrid themselves (September 2011-October 2018) and one of 45 games by Juventus (April 1973-September 2000). The last visiting side to keep a clean sheet away to Real Madrid in this competition was CSKA Moscow in December 2018 (0-0 draw).\n\nKylian Mbappe has scored nine goals in five games in the Champions League this season; the joint-most by a Real Madrid player in their first five appearances in a single edition, along with Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013-14 (9).\n\nErling Haaland has scored more goals in the Champions League than any other player since his debut campaign in 2019/20 (54). Indeed, two of the only three players who have netted 50+ goals in the competition in this period could both square off in this match, with Real Madrid’s Mbappe also netting 50 times since then (Robert Lewandowski being the other).\n\nMbappe has been directly involved in eight goals in seven games against City in the UEFA Champions League (seven goals, one assist); only Lionel Messi has had a hand in more against us in the competition - nine in eight appearances.",

    "description": "YouTube TV will offer a cheaper sports-focused package in 2026, which it can offer after tough negotiations with Disney and other media companies.",
    "fullText": "YouTube TV will unveil new prices soon. But this time, it will be good news for sports fans.\n\nYouTube is launching a set of cheaper, slimmed-down versions of its popular live TV service in 2026, which it's calling \"YouTube TV Plans,\" the video giant announced on Wednesday. One of the new plans will be a sports bundle that provides access to ESPN Unlimited, FS1, and NBC Sports Network.\n\nWhile YouTube TV isn't yet revealing pricing for these 10 or so genre-specific packages, they'll cost less than the Google-owned service's typical rate, which is $83 a month.\n\n\"Our goal is to let you tailor your subscription with more options,\" said Christian Oestlien, YouTube's head of subscriptions, in a statement. \"Whether you stick with our main YouTube TV plan with 100+ channels, focus on sports, combine sports and news, or select a plan centered on family or entertainment content, subscribers will be able to easily choose the plan that works best for them.\"\n\nYouTube TV secured the rights to form these so-called \"skinny bundles\" after hard-fought negotiations with Disney, Comcast's NBC, and Fox. YouTube TV's battle with Disney was especially intense, as it left subscribers without ESPN and ABC for 15 days.\n\nJustin Connolly, YouTube's global head of media and sports, said at a media event on Tuesday night that YouTube worked with its partners on \"ingesting the entirety of the sports programming\" in its service, so that YouTube TV can be a one-stop shop for sports fans. Besides aggregating live games, Connolly said YouTube is being fan-friendly by aiming to \"meet the consumer where they are\" on price.\n\nYouTube TV's price has steadily increased since it launched in 2017 at $35, though it's also added more channels. Last December, YouTube TV's monthly price rose by $10.\n\nOther TV providers have launched sports-focused skinny bundles, with some tradeoffs.\n\nFubo's $55.99 a month Sports + News bundle includes all of ESPN and Fox's channels, plus CBS and the NFL Network, but it doesn't have NBC or Warner Bros. Discovery's networks like TNT or TruTV. It also doesn't have the news networks CNN and MS Now (formerly MSNBC), though it has Fox News.\n\nSling TV's Orange & Blue bundle goes for $60.99 and has ESPN, Fox with cable sidekick FS1, WBD's channels like TNT and CNN, and the NFL Network. It also carries local channels like NBC and ABC in certain markets. But Sling doesn't have a deal with CBS, plus its main bundle doesn't include specialty sports networks like the SEC Network, the Big Ten Network, or NBA TV. Sling offers a Sports Extra add-on for $15 a month on its main plan, bringing the total to $76.\n\nDirecTV's MySports package costs $69.99 but is more comprehensive, with the full suites of ESPN, Fox, and WBD, plus all four major local broadcast networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox (with possible exceptions in certain markets). It also carries the flagship networks for four major US sports: the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL.\n\nSports fans could complement those skinny bundles by buying a digital antenna or by using streaming services like Peacock or Paramount+ that give access to NBC and CBS, respectively.\n\nESPN also offers a subscription to its entire suite for $29.99 a month, or a bundle with competing streamer Fox One for $39.99 a month.\n\nYouTube said its new sports plan will have ESPN's full suite of programming plus sports channels from Fox and NBC, with the option to add on NFL Sunday Ticket and RedZone for more money. Otherwise, it's unclear exactly which channels this bundle will have.\n\nAs YouTube TV's sports bundle enters the market, sports fans have more choices than ever. The challenge for them now is finding the right plan.",

    "fullText": "This story is part of the IndyStar project \"Only woman in the room:\" How Indy became top city in nation for women sports execs\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- These five women have combined for more than 125 years of experience in sports careers and beyond. We asked them to give their best advice, lessons learned and how to navigate being a woman in the male-dominated sports industry.\n\nTitle: Chief operating officer of USA Track & Field since 2012\n\nNotable career stop: Washington spent five years with the U.S. Department of Labor, starting as a staff attorney and ending her tenure as deputy associate general counsel.\n\nCareer highlight: Washington was a key figure as USA Track & Field was determining whether to move its national headquarters from Indianapolis. The organization announced last year it would remain in the city and move into IU Indy's new James T. Morris arena in the fall of 2026.\n\n\"Renee deserves a lot of credit for what they've been able to accomplish,\" said Julie Roe Lach, executive vice president of Pacers Sports & Entertainment, \"including choosing to keep their headquarters in Indianapolis.\"\n\nAdvice for younger self: \"I say it to young people all the time, the world is not over tomorrow. You think that you've got to decide what you're going to do now, and you don't. There is time. There's always a new chapter you can write.\"\n\nAdvice for women: \"You can be competitive as women, but if you're going to do that, be competitive against the whole field, not just the women in the field. That is just so important.\"\n\nMaking a mark: \"You have to understand the larger picture in almost anything that you do, which means that you have to ask questions and you have to be inquisitive. And that makes you do your job not just efficiently, you want to go beyond being efficient. It helps you know your organization, and it helps make you of more value than you might have ever thought.\"\n\nTitle: President of Andretti Global, chief operating officer of TWG Motorsports\n\nNotable career stop: Gregory spent nearly 14 years with NASCAR as executive vice president and chief marketing and content officer.\n\nFor most of Gregory's career, she's been the only woman or one of few women in the room, and she's felt eyes looking at her, though she said she never had an overt incident where she felt unfairly treated because of her gender. Early on, she would sit off to the side of the room, instead of at the table, because she didn't have the experience or confidence to be there.\n\nAdvice for women: \"There were times when you kind of look around and say, 'I can't pay attention to the fact that I'm the only woman in the room. I just need to do a good job and prove myself and deliver on my own merits and not get sidetracked and worried about the fact that you might be the only one.' You have to kind of just plow through that.\"\n\nStill a way to go: \"You see this explosion in women's sports, which is fantastic, and the fan consumption, and that's going to help. But when you get into some of the day in, day out, it's not quite as far along as you would think. It's going to catch up, but we still have some work to do. We used to say it doesn't have a finish line at NASCAR and that was on diversity in general. You have to be deliberate about it.\"\n\nBringing the A game: \"As women in our various fields, you have to be prepared. You have to be better, in my opinion. And you've got to come with your A game all the time, and that does put a lot of pressure on you. But when you do that, you perform better, and then you gain more credibility, and then you have that reputation to build on, but you've got to invest the time in that up front.\"\n\nTitle: Senior vice president Penske Entertainment, leading marketing, branding, communications, content and broadcast across the IndyCar series and at Indianapolis Motor Speedway\n\nNotable career stop: Melangton was the second woman in history to lead a Super Bowl as the CEO and president of the 2012 Indianapolis Super Bowl Host Committee. She once had a guy come up to her at a funeral and say, \"Are you that lady running the Super Bowl? That's just crazy to me that they hired a woman.\"\n\n\"And I started laughing,\" Melangton said. \"And instead of being offended, I said, 'Tell me why it's crazy.'\"\n\nLesson learned: Early in her career, Melangton was working for Indiana Sports Corp. as director of events and was asked to help create the Big Ten women's basketball tournament. She went to work with the league negotiating, discussing, planning and, in 1995, it was set. The first tournament would be played at Hinkle Fieldhouse.\n\n\"It was so funny, I didn't know anything about basketball. And the first day, the athletes were throwing the balls out and they said, 'Did somebody break all these balls in?'\" Melangton said. \"I thought, 'What? I don't know anything about that.'\" Melangton and her staff stayed up all night bouncing the basketballs on the court to get them broken in for the games the next day.\n\nAdvice for women: \"Be the most confident person in the room, be better than everybody else, and it takes gender off the table.\"\n\nIn the eyes of her colleagues: \"The authenticity that Allison brings to all of her relationships, whether she knows you for many, many years or is new, there's a confidence and a comfort level that she provides to other women, other female leaders that I think is just amazing,\" said Gregory. \"It's something that motivates me. She leads by example.\"\n\nTitle: Executive vice president of Pacers Sports & Entertainment\n\nNotable career stop: Lach spent more than a decade as commissioner of the Horizon League before being hired by the Pacers in October.\n\nHer start in sports: \"Basketball was always my love, from middle school. They say, 'When you find your passion, you lose yourself while you're doing it,' and I would just lose myself in the midst of the game because I just loved it.\" Lach was a basketball All-Star at Millikin University.\n\nSome of Lach's favorite memories growing up happened on Sundays. The family would go to church, go home and watch WWF, then her dad would drop her off at the gym for pickup games. She'd wait on the sideline to get chosen on a team.\n\n\"I was always the only girl, but it didn't bother me because I could play, I could hang. You'd have to put up with some of the usual shenanigans, but I learned a lot,\" Lach said. \"My dad's proudest moment and his hardest moment was when I got picked ahead of him. But that was always the joke. He'd say, 'I knew you'd finally made it when they were picking you because they wanted to win.'\"\n\nLach was part of creating Indiana Sports Corp.'s 2050 vision, which included making Indy the women's sports capital of the world.\n\n\"No city has claimed it, because no city has done, I would argue, as much as we've already done,\" she said. \"And it's not just sporting events, although that's important. It's women leading in sports.\"\n\nProudest accomplishment: \"It's probably more behind the curtain. Those of us, especially in sports, get emails or calls or are approached by students or people that want to work in sports. I have coffee or Zooms or calls with people at least once or twice a week looking for some mentoring of how do you break in? it is definitely a pay it forward type deal, but it's the right thing to do. I think we all have a duty, and I think that's something that matters.\"\n\nTitle: Owner of Baughman Consulting, which specializes in sports management, bid concept and creation, hospitality and special events. She most recently was lead event director for WNBA All-Star 2025.\n\nNotable career stop: Baughman spent nearly 22 years at Indiana Sports Corp., ending her tenure as senior vice president. Baughman has been a part of putting on Indy's biggest sporting events. Among them the Super Bowl in 2012, the NBA All-Star Game in 2024, the National College Football Playoff in 2022 and so many others.\n\nWhen college football's biggest game was played in Indy, Baughman held the title of president of the 2022 College Football Playoff Host Committee. When she got the job, she had a sense of pride. She knew she had proven herself.\n\n\"It was more just like, 'You're really good at this. We trust you. We want you to do this.' Not, 'You're a woman and we should consider putting a woman in the position,'\" she said. \"Which to me is really important because I want to be the best person doing what I'm doing not the best woman doing something.\"\n\nAsk questions: \"There's so much to be learned from other people. And I feel like no one knows everything. And to be genuine in what you're knowledgeable about and what you think you have a fair opinion on. And when you're really seeking some guidance, that doesn't make you weak or less. It actually is really smart.\"\n\nAt the WNBA All-Star weekend this year, Baughman could be seen rolling carts, helping set up and tearing down, carrying boxes and inventorying T-shirts.\n\n\"Work your tail off. Do everything. Don't be like, 'Oh, I manage, I don't do those things.' Do whatever you need to do and help other people learn how to do it by doing it with them,\" Baughman said. \"I don't really like layers and titles. You get a much better result if you can get people to do things collectively as a group, because it feels more like a shared outcome at the end of the day.\"\n\nSign of a good leader: \"Let other people shine, and get out of the way sometimes.\"\n\nIn the eyes of her colleagues: \"Susan is so creative. So many of the creative things you see in the city related to sports are all her,\" said Melangton. \"She is deeply passionate and pours her entire self into whatever she's working on.\"\n\nFollow IndyStar sports reporter Dana Benbow on X: @DanaBenbow.

Spurs host the Czech Republic club at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this evening in the Champions League, and the 20-year-old Frenchman has been selected despite not initially registering him for the league phase of the elite European competition. Tel replaces Dominic Solanke, who has yet to return from a long-term injury, in the squad.\n\n🚨Exclusive French striker Mathys Tel is in Tottenham Hotspur's squad to face Slavia Prague this tuesday despite not being selected for the Champions League group stage.

Spurs manager Thomas Frank dropped Tel for him in the Champions League squad at the start of the 2025-26 campaign but has been forced to change his mind. The French forward now has a chance to prove himself tonight as he is likely to be involved in action.\n\nTel has not been a regular in the Tottenham starting XI, with only four starts to his name in 13 appearances this term.",

He was also named as the PFA men's player of the year for a record third time and collected a third Football Writers' footballer of the year award.\n\nThe 33-year-old became the highest-scoring overseas player in Premier League history, overtaking Sergio Aguero's mark of 184.\n\nSalah has scored five goals in 18 appearances for Liverpool so far this season, and on Saturday said he felt like he had been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club and that his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down.\n\n'The hunger makes me want more' - Salah wins third PFA award",
