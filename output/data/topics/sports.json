    "fullText": "The NFL certainly feels like the king of American sports. They generate north of $13B in annual revenue. That doesn’t that is enough for the empire Roger Goodell has helped expand.\n\nAfter NBC and the NBA agreed to a contract for Sunday Night basketball, it was revealed the NBA will be paid $2.45B per year. The NFL makes slightly less than at $2B per year.\n\nMORE: Former NFL star Tre Johnson dies suddenly at 54 on family trip\n\nTo a degree, you can understand why the NFL is agitated over this. Their viewership and brand is much stronger than that over the NBA.\n\nFor reference, the NFL’s Christmas Day performance saw a 27.5M viewership for one game versus the NBA’s 5.5M. It’s clear the NFL product is much more valuable. Is it worth a fuss over $450M margin?\n\nAfter all, the league is doing plenty well both in the owners’ and player’s pockets. The NFL is expecting their salary cap to make another historic jump in 2026. In essence, the NFL is making up for that margin and then some.\n\nMORE: FOX Sports’ Top 15 NFL free agents\n\nHowever, while the professional sports leagues all sail on similar waters, they all want to show off their boats. The NFL reportedly could look into their opt-out clause in the deal set to expire in 2029.\n\nOne might think NBC will simply raise their annual revenue pay-out to the NFL.

Instead, he focused on what sports can represent at a broader level.\n\nAfter watching the NBA All-Star Game and Team USA compete at the Winter Olympics, Obama posted a message about the impact of sports.\n\nHe tweeted: “Watching the NBA All-Star game and Team USA at the Winter Olympics, it’s clear that sports — just like music and art — still have the power to bring us together, build community, and remind us of our common humanity.”\n\nObama compared sports to music and art, suggesting they share a unique ability to connect people across different backgrounds.\n\nHis message centered on unity and shared experience rather than competition.\n\nAll-Star weekend, which features players from across the league and around the world, provided a fitting backdrop for that reflection.\n\nMichelle Obama also posted on social media after attending the game with Barack.\n\n“My favorite teammates on and off the court,” she wrote.\n\nHer caption accompanied a photo of the couple courtside at the Intuit Dome, adding a lighthearted note to the evening.\n\nThe post quickly drew attention from fans, many of whom enjoyed seeing the former president and first lady taking in the event together.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron jokes as Victor Wembanyama takes center stage at NBA All-Star Game\n\n‘Who is that?’ – Anthony Edwards’ Cristiano Ronaldo moment at NBA All-Star Game goes viral\n\nMetta Sandiford-Artest claims he can’t travel to Australia due to 2004 Malice at the Palace incident",

    "fullText": "There's a new No. 1 team in the nation.\n\nMichigan basketball (24-1, 14-1 Big Ten) moved up one spot, to No. 1, in the USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll on Monday, Feb. 16; the Wolverines were last atop the poll in its Jan. 5 iteration − five days before the Wolverines lost to Wisconsin in Ann Arbor, their only defeat this season.\n\nMichigan has won 10 consecutive games since, nine by double figures. The Wolverines are coming off another sweep last week, knocking off Northwestern on the road and crushing UCLA at home; with previous No. 1 Arizona losing twice last week, U-M has now taken over the top spot with less than four weeks to play before the reveal of the 2026 March Madness bracket.\n\n[ MUST WATCH: U-M's biggest week of the regular season is here. Make \"Hail Yes!\" your go-to Wolverines podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify). ]\n\nMichigan has been ranked No. 1 for 38 games in its 108-year history.\n\nThis is the latest in a season Michigan has been ranked No. 1 since it was No. 1 in the Associated Press poll on March 7, 1977 in the final poll before the NCAA tournament. Soon after, the Wolverines were upset by Charlotte in the NCAA's second round.\n\nPrior to that, Michigan hadn't been ranked No. 1 in February or later since 1965. That was the year consensus All-American Cazzie Russell led the Wolverines to the national championship game, which U-M lost to UCLA after holding onto the nation's top spot for more than three months.\n\nMichigan State, which has lost three of its past four games, dropped to No. 15 in this week's coaches poll, down from No. 10 last week.\n\nThis season, Michigan has dominated on both sides of the ball. The Wolverines are No. 1 in defensive efficiency (88 points per 100 possessions) and average 2-point distance (7.1 feet), No. 2 in 2-point defense (42.8%) and effective field goal defense (43.2), No. 4 in block rate (18.7%) and No. 7 in 3-point defense (29.1%).\n\nREQUIRED READING: How Michigan basketball built nation's biggest and best frontcourt\n\nOffensively, the Wolverines are No. 2 in 2-point shooting (63%), No. 4 in efficiency (126.6), No. 7 in effective field goal percentage (58.9%), No. 7 in average possession length (15 seconds) and No. 24 in offensive rebounding rate (36.6%).\n\nMichigan can't rest on its statistical excellence, however, with a tough slate this week: The Wolverines hit the road for a matchup with No. 7 Purdue on Tuesday (6:30 p.m., Peacock) before a neutral-court meeting with No. 3 Duke at Capital One Arena in Washington on Saturday (6:30 p.m., ESPN).\n\n\"It feels really good, but as you said, we have tough games now coming up,\" center Aday Mara said last week. \"We got to focus on, on that, on our scout, on practicing, getting better. ...

    "title": "Ratcliffe, Man Utd and the immigration comments fallout",
    "description": "Sports editor Dan Roan analyses the potential fallout of Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comments on immigration.",
    "fullText": "In the coming days, Sir Jim Ratcliffe should discover if the Football Association's legal team has decided the Manchester United co-owner brought the game into disrepute with his comments on immigration last week, which sparked condemnation from the government and beyond.\n\nThe governing body could decide his remarks reached the threshold required for him to be charged with a breach of its rules, it could write to the billionaire to remind him of his responsibilities, or it could choose to take no action at all.\n\nBut whatever the FA does, the impact of his claim that the UK had been \"colonised by immigrants\" - while citing incorrect population data - could be felt for some time to come.\n\nRegardless of the fact Ratcliffe also received support in some quarters for raising the issue of immigration in his interview with Sky News, the fact United felt the need to issue a statement, external that read like a public rebuke towards their own co-owner was a sign of the dismay felt at Old Trafford - along with concern at the potential cost of the backlash his words provoked.\n\nThe pointed assertion of United's \"inclusive and welcoming\" values - while not directly naming Ratcliffe - was a deliberate attempt to distance the club from him, and according to Old Trafford sources was signed off at the highest level.\n\nHours earlier Ratcliffe had said, external he was \"sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth\".\n\nWho is billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe and how did he make his money?\n\nRatcliffe sorry language 'offended some' after immigration comments\n\nRatcliffe has always spoken highly of the Glazer family, describing them as \"the nicest people on the planet\" last year.\n\nBut according to a source familiar with them, the club's majority shareholders will have been \"horrified\" by his initial remarks, and will have seen them as showing \"disregard for their ownership\".\n\nThe Glazers - whose grandparents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to the US - are yet to comment on the episode.\n\nBut the source believes a key reason they have supported inclusive initiatives such as All Red All Equal at the club is because they see it as a brand to be nurtured and heavily commercialised, and they will have taken a dim view of remarks that could make sponsors reconsider partnering with United.\n\n\"Big multi-nationals want to associate with youth, positivity and forward-thinking. United is currently struggling for sponsors… and this exacerbates that,\" the source added, suggesting that some potential partners would \"run a mile\".\n\nThis all came just days after the Glazers were said to have voiced their concerns about United's commercial performance, external at a recent meeting.\n\nIt is easy to see why. United have been without a training kit partner since last season, and their shirt-sleeve sponsor is also set to expire in the summer.\n\nLast year Marriott International - the world's largest hotel company - decided not to extend its sponsorship agreement, external with United after its contract expired.\n\nThe club's deal with Adidas is also worth £10m less this year because United have failed to qualify for the Champions League for two consecutive seasons.\n\nWhile United still managed to post record commercial revenue of £333m last year, their main Premier League rivals have been catching them up in recent years.\n\nSo, even with the club's statement and Ratcliffe's qualified apology, it is easy to see why there may be some nervousness among club executives in the wake of the controversy.\n\nPerhaps even more will now hinge on whether the team can secure Champions League qualification for next season.\n\nWhat this means for the long-term relationship between the six Glazer siblings - who retain 70% of the club - and their British business partner is unclear.\n\nIt is worth noting that under the terms of the agreement that saw Ratcliffe invest £1.25bn in the club in 2024, if the Glazers receive an offer from a third party that they want to accept, they can force him to sell his portion.\n\nAnd then there is the club's hopes for a new 100,000-seat stadium as part of a 370-acre Trafford regeneration project that relies on the support of local and national politicians.\n\nIn January, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Trafford council leader Tom Ross both hailed a new development corporation designed to enable the delivery of the multi-billion pound plan.\n\nThree weeks later however, both men issued statements condemning Ratcliffe's comments. The same applied to both Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves, both of whom had previously expressed support for the redevelopment project.\n\nWhile local officials have vowed that taxpayer money will not be used for the new stadium itself, public funds are being sought for surrounding infrastructure, including the crucial relocation of a neighbouring freight rail terminal to St Helens. Burnham has also said that his office could use compulsory purchase powers via the development corporation to force the sale of land required for the new stadium.\n\nIt is unclear whether Ratcliffe's remarks may make the ongoing negotiations more challenging, but they came at an important moment.\n\n\"Real harm could been done,\" one source close to the regeneration project said.\n\n\"The dust is still settling and none of it is insurmountable. But the optics of the council, the mayor and the government appearing to support his plans just became harder.\"\n\nUnited's hope will be that those involved focus on the 15,000 new homes, 48,000 new local jobs and billions of pounds in value to the economy that the project is said to be worth.\n\nIt appears Ratcliffe's relationship with many of United's fans has been harmed too.\n\n\"Comments from the club's senior leadership should make inclusion easier, not harder\", posted the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST).\n\nGhulam Haydar of the Manchester United Muslim Supporters' Club (MUMSC) told BBC Sport that Ratcliffe's apology was \"a first step\", but said he would like the 73-year-old to agree to a meeting with their members in order to provide some assurances.\n\n\"This is a global club… what's he going to do to actually assure us that the club is a welcoming space for people of colour, people of migrant backgrounds?\" he asked.\n\nMUMSC has said it does not feel that Ratcliffe's apology \"sufficiently addresses the seriousness\" of what was said.\n\n\"Expressing regret for causing offence is not the same as acknowledging the wider impact of words used. Leadership requires accountability as well as openness to debate.\"\n\nKick It Out - which works to fight racism, sexism and homophobia in football and says overall reports about discrimination have risen again this campaign after last season's record high, external - told BBC Sport that it has already received a number of reports about Ratcliffe's comments.\n\nHaving cut jobs and raised ticket prices, Ratcliffe was the subject of a protest by a supporter group just two weeks ago over the way the Ineos hierarchy has run the club since taking over football operations.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what kind of reception Ratcliffe receives when he next visits Old Trafford.\n\nUncertainty also surrounds the impact this could have on manager Michael Carrick - who will face questions about this issue for the first time when he addresses the media this week - along with United's players and staff, described by the club in their statement as a \"diverse group [that] reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home.\"\n\nDespite United's recent upturn in form since the appointment of the former midfielder, these are challenging times for Ratcliffe and his business Ineos, the petrochemicals firm he founded and leads.\n\nLast week, he warned, external that \"current conditions for Europe's chemical industry are unsurvivable without immediate intervention\".\n\nThose concerns were the reason Ratcliffe was at an industry summit in Antwerp. And they were clearly what he intended to talk about in an interview that instead ended up with him engulfed in a fierce political storm.\n\nIt is a controversy that is unlikely to blow over quickly, and the true repercussions are yet to become clear.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Few figure skaters at the Winter Olympics have seen Adeliia Petrosian compete in real life.\n\nShe might leave with the gold medal.\n\nRussia's exclusion from international sports events during its war with Ukraine means that the 18-year-old Petrosian has only skated one senior competition outside of her homeland, the qualifier that earned her place as a neutral athlete in Milan.\n\nAs she readies to skate to Michael Jackson's music in the short program Tuesday, no one besides Petrosian and her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, can be sure of her form, or whether she's injury-free.\n\nBut if Petrosian can get past skaters like the U.S. “Blade Angels” trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito, and Japanese stars Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai, she'll shoot to sudden fame as the fourth consecutive Olympic champion from Russia.\n\nPetrosian is the latest star produced by Tutberidze, who revolutionized women's skating a decade ago by getting young girls barely in their teens to perform bigger and bigger jumps, only to have many of them struggle with repeated injuries.\n\nShe coached 2018 gold medalist Alina Zagitova, and a trio of standouts in 2022, when Anna Shcherbakova won the gold medal.\n\nBut the Beijing Games have been remembered less for Shcherbakova's triumph and more for the positive doping test turned in by another Tutberidze talent, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva. The case ended ultimately in a doping ban for Valieva that only recently ended, and an investigation into Tutberidze, though it found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Russian coach.\n\nTutberidze also was criticized for her harsh words toward her students in Beijing, while World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Bańka said last week that he didn't “feel comfortable with her presence” at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nAs part of the fallout from the Valieva case, the International Skating Union increased the minimum age from 15 to 17 for senior-level athletes. That means Petrosian is one of the oldest women's skaters that Tutberidze has coached at a major championship.\n\nPetrosian has landed quadruple jumps in Russian national events, much like her compatriots were able to do in previous Olympics, and none of the other skaters at the Milan Cortina Games are able to match those high-scoring elements.\n\nThe big question is whether she's fit enough to do it in Milan.\n\n“I can't turn properly,” Petrosian complained in a Russian documentary following Tutberidze released last week. Tutberidze said Petrosian had been making progress in a difficult program around the new year, but suddenly “everything hurt.”\n\nThere's been no indication of how Petrosian's condition may have changed in the last month as she readied for the Olympics.\n\nFitness has been a factor for months. Tutberidze previously told Russian media that Petrosian wanted to give up her place in September's Olympic qualifier for lower-ranked skaters after an injury but ended up competing because the Russian alternate's fitness was worse.\n\n“Let's imagine it's just Chelyabinsk.” That was the advice Russian skater Petr Gumennik got from his coach ahead of skating in the men’s event, to pretend that the Olympics were happening in that provincial Russian city.\n\nFor a few seconds, it felt as if the competition might indeed be happening in Russia.\n\n“When I went out there I got so much applause, there was such noise, you can't compare it to anything,” Gumennik said after skating in the short program, where he was 12th. “That's Olympic support. It was unexpected and it gave me strength and confidence.”\n\nGumennik was greeted by fans waving personalized banners with his face, calling out “well done” in Russian.\n\nThere also was a Russian flag in the stands, even though Olympic organizers have barred it from the Games, where athletes such as Gumennik and Petrosian were vetted for any support of the war before they were allowed to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nAs the Russian with the best chance of a gold medal at these Olympics, there may be even more support when Petrosian skates. ___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "What is the hardest coaching job in world sport?\n\nWe are talking about the ‘poisoned chalice’ roles — mostly big teams where standards are high, fans’ expectations are higher and where coaches also have to contend with the weight of a glorious history.\n\nWe asked our writers across all sports for their nominations for the title, from Manchester United to the USWNT via Ferrari team principal (among others). In each case, reporters were asked to focus on those teams’ wider historical context rather than simply this current season.\n\nAt the end of the article, you can vote for the job you think is the hardest in world sport. This list is far from definitive, so please do make your own suggestions in the comments below if you feel we have missed any roles out.\n\nCoaching the England men’s team is such a peculiar role that it even has a name attached: ‘An Impossible Job’. Former manager Graham Taylor was the subject of a documentary of the same name, which laid bare the team’s unsuccessful bid to qualify for the 1994 World Cup.\n\nPart of this is just the natural effect of assuming this country cares more about its national team than others. Many other nations have a lot of public pressure on this role and a lot of expectation, too. Yes, in the past, the media glare in that job has been ferocious — but that is not the case in quite the same way now. And it is certainly not distinctive to England either.\n\nPerhaps the hardest element is to bridge the gap between resources and record. The England men’s team have won one major tournament: the World Cup hosted by the country in 1966. But they now have the richest, most popular football league in the world in the Premier League on their doorstep. And yet, turning that to the advantage of the England team is a challenge that has yet to be resolved.\n\nCan Thomas Tuchel, the current coach who this week signed a new deal until the European Championship in 2028, be the man to do that at last?\n\nThere are many layers to why coaching the New York Jets feels like an impossible job. Let’s start with the simple statement: they are the New York Jets.\n\nThere is not an NFL team that has been referred to mockingly, or derisively, or served as the butt of a joke in television shows, movies or sketch comedies quite like this team. That reputation is part of what makes it hard to work here: the “Same Old Jets” of it all, a feeling that, eventually, things will go terribly, even when it feels like there is hope.\n\nThat ties to the franchise’s history. This is a team that has not won a Super Bowl since 1969 and has not found any sort of stability at quarterback since then, either. Coaching the Jets means answering to a fanbase that has grown increasingly angry the longer their playoff-less streak (15 years and counting) goes on. Current head coach Aaron Glenn is a beloved former Jets player and he was not granted much of a grace period — after one losing season, fans are already calling for his head.\n\nThe other challenge: ownership. Woody Johnson is known to be meddlesome, impatient and easily influenced by headlines.\n\nBut really, it all falls under the “Same Old Jets” umbrella, which coaches have failed to overcome going on for a few decades now.\n\nManaging Real Madrid is a uniquely difficult challenge. Florentino Perez, long-serving president of the record 15-time European Cup/Champions League winners, has little patience for long-term projects or planning, and no time for excuses or mitigating factors such as injuries or misfortune.\n\nPerez fills the dressing-room with big-name players who do not always fit together well, rarely enjoy detailed tactical instruction and seldom take responsibility when the team is not doing well.\n\nMadrid are actually owned by 80,000 members who demand the highest standards — and are surrounded by a voracious local media who mercilessly criticise anyone who even temporarily falls short.\n\nTo enjoy success in the Spanish capital, Madrid’s coach must be able to motivate and organise star players, while showing humility and intelligence in dealing with Perez, and accepting the only thing that really counts is regularly winning the biggest trophies.\n\nSince 2000, Madrid have had 18 different coaches — and just three have won a Champions League: Vicente del Bosque in 2000 and 2002, Carlo Ancelotti in 2014, 2022 and 2024, and Zinedine Zidane in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nOther coaches with big reputations and personalities who have tried but failed include Jose Mourinho, Fabio Capello, Rafa Benitez, and, most recently, former playing icon Xabi Alonso. It is no surprise that the current incumbent, another former player, Alvaro Arbeloa, is feeling the pressure after just eight games.\n\nAll Formula 1 team principal jobs (the closest to a head coach’s role in other sports) come with pressure. But none compares to that of Ferrari, the sport’s most historic and trophy-laden team, who demand nothing but success. All of Italy is watching.\n\nIt is something Fred Vasseur, Ferrari’s team principal since 2023, felt last year. The team narrowly missed out on the title in 2024, only to then slide backwards and endure a winless season, despite the blockbuster signing of Lewis Hamilton. By mid-season, Vasseur was facing deep scrutiny in the press. Even with a new contract signed last June, that spotlight will only dim once success arrives.\n\nVasseur is Ferrari’s fifth team principal since 2014, with each of the past four changes coming abruptly in response to a lack of success. Simply fighting for wins is not enough to satisfy Ferrari’s board, the Italian press, or its fans watching around the world. Championships are the only currency they want to deal in.\n\nVasseur is acutely aware of that, his goal being to finally be the person to end Ferrari’s title drought (they last won the drivers’ title in 2007 and the constructors’ crown in 2008) and succeed in F1’s toughest job. But he needs to break the trend of his predecessors to make that happen.\n\nManchester United's 20 top-flight league titles, dating back to 1908, have been won by only three men: Ernest Mangnall, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson. That is the same number of league-winning managers that Liverpool have had since 1990, Chelsea have had since 2010 and Manchester City have had since 2012.\n\nIt took United five attempts to land on Busby's true successor. That was long enough, but their next permanent manager will be the seventh since Ferguson's retirement after winning 38 trophies in his 26 years in charge.\n\nThat success made United one of the biggest clubs in the world — almost certainly the biggest in the English-speaking world — but also set an almost impossible standard to meet.\n\nWhoever eventually puts United back on their perch, in Ferguson's parlance, will have to work with an unpopular ownership, an insatiable media and a long list of ex-players who have been there, won it and started a podcast.\n\nBut most of all, they will need to match the expectation that United should be the dominant force in English football, even more than a decade on from the last of those league titles.\n\nTottenham are, in theory, one of the world’s most promising football clubs.\n\nBased in London, an international financial and sporting capital, they can attract talent over competition from most teams in the Premier League and beyond, and their world-class stadium and training ground are, or at least should be, a dream to operate in. They also have wealthy owners.\n\nAll of this leads to high expectations, but Spurs, irrespective of the manager, have consistently fallen short.\n\nNow-USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino is considered the club’s most successful manager in the 21st century, taking Tottenham to a Champions League final and their highest finish in Premier League history (second). It felt like a golden age in waiting, but Spurs lost that final to Liverpool in 2019 and did not become English champions under Pochettino, failing to capitalise on the moment.\n\nSince then, Spurs have been on a steady decline — and no one has got particularly close to rescuing them over a sustained period.\n\nNo matter who has stood in the dugout, whether it has been Premier League winners Jose Mourinho or Antonio Conte, or Ange Postecoglou (who delivered the club's first trophy in 17 years last season at the expense of the club's worst league finish since 1976-77), Nuno Espirito Santo or Thomas Frank — the latter was sacked on Wednesday after only joining in June while Spurs have appointed the Croatian Igor Tudor until the end of the season — the product has never consistently matched the near-league-leading ticket prices. And the coaches are the ones who regularly take the blame.\n\nTottenham currently sit 16th in the Premier League, which led to the board moving on from Frank this week.\n\nThe potential of the young squad and the opportunity for investment should make them an exciting proposition for many top-class head coaches. But almost every type of manager has tried to establish Spurs as league and Champions League contenders post-Pochettino — and all have failed.\n\nThe average tenure of a permanent Chelsea manager this century is 532 days, or 17 and a half months. Across almost two decades of ownership under Roman Abramovich, the club ruthlessly chewed through many of the world’s most famous and successful coaches, banking a steady flow of trophies and pressing the ‘eject’ button at the first sign of failure.\n\nIt says something, then, that the Stamford Bridge dugout has become an even less forgiving environment since Abramovich, a Russian oligarch, sold up in 2022, following UK government sanctions imposed on him after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLiam Rosenior is BlueCo’s fourth permanent head coach appointment in four years, and those numbers do not even account for Thomas Tuchel — the Champions League winner they inherited and quickly sacked, now in charge of England — or Frank Lampard, who returned for a second miserable stint as caretaker boss in 2023.\n\nTo win at the highest level with one of Europe’s youngest squads and satisfy a demanding and increasingly disillusioned fanbase is challenging enough. Then there is Chelsea’s unique executive structure, with co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart heading up an increasingly sprawling brain trust overseeing everything from recruitment to injury prevention and management.\n\nIt is a structure that can only accommodate a head coach, not a manager, and both Mauricio Pochettino (in charge from 2023-2024) and Enzo Maresca grew weary of working within it. Rosenior, promoted with startling speed from BlueCo sister club Strasbourg, has been handed an incredible opportunity so early in his coaching career — but also a frighteningly difficult path to walk.\n\nPicture this: the biggest media market in the country. The franchise with by far the most World Series championships. The most intense fans in the game.\n\nThose are just a few things breathing down the neck of the manager of the New York Yankees.\n\nCalling it a tough job would be a major understatement. It even appears to take a physical toll — just look at the before and after photos of Joe Torre and Joe Girardi, who held the position before Aaron Boone took over in 2018.\n\nPressure like this exists nowhere else in baseball. Other teams tank for higher draft picks or trade their best players to retool, giving up today for a better tomorrow. In the Bronx, there is no such luxury. The Yankees must win every year — the fans demand it.\n\nTo the credit of owner Hal Steinbrenner, he does spend money bringing in some of the sport’s biggest names. But with great talent on the field also comes great expectations in the dugout — all while the manager is forced to explain his decisions to reporters twice a day while maintaining harmony between the clubhouse and the decision-makers in the front office.\n\nIn the biggest city in the U.S., being Yankees manager is a job nobody else can relate to.\n\nYou only need to look at the furore that followed recent defeats by Arsenal and Manchester City — and read The Athletic’s in-depth piece on the crisis happening behind the scenes — to understand the pressure that comes with managing Chelsea women. Sonia Bompastor has only lost three of her 37 Women’s Super League matches in charge of Chelsea since she was appointed in 2024, but there are still fans unhappy with the French manager.\n\nBompastor is a victim of her own success. Last season, she led Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic treble, and the expectations set by her predecessor and now-USWNT coach Emma Hayes, who won 16 trophies in her 12 years at the club. The standard at the club is unforgiving, and entertaining the idea of anything but total dominance is seen as a failure.\n\nThe only women’s club team with comparable expectations are Barcelona, where squad cohesion is helped by the fact that so many of the players are also longtime Spain team-mates. Bompastor has to integrate big-name signings from across the globe. Having such an array of talent is a blessing, but it leaves her with nowhere to hide.\n\nThe rest of the WSL are also narrowing the gap on Chelsea, whereas the only real threat to Barcelona’s dominance in Spain are Real Madrid, and even they have only beaten Barca once in 24 meetings.\n\nThe U.S. women’s national team’s win at the 1999 World Cup set a new bar and served as a catalyst not only for the women’s game domestically but around the world.\n\nThe head that wears the crown has always been heavy: until recently, the expectation of the USWNT was to not only win, but to annihilate opponents (think that 13-0 drubbing of Thailand at the start of their 2019 World Cup campaign). Head coach Emma Hayes will doubtless have found that out for herself since being appointed in 2023.\n\nIf anything, the job has become harder as the talent gap between the U.S. and every other nation has narrowed; they are No 2 in FIFA’s world rankings, trailing World Cup winners Spain.\n\nBalancing sustainable player development while still achieving results — yes, even in international friendlies — is a delicate balance to strike under the spotlight, and there may be no stage more daunting in women’s football than the USWNT.\n\nIt is beyond a joke, really. Just think of the Grampa Simpson meme showing him walking in and out, and that is Watford.\n\nThe second-tier side go through head coaches — it is ironic that they give them such a lofty title in the first place — quicker than you can say, \"another one bites the dust”.\n\nSince the Italian businessman Gino Pozzo bought the club in 2012, he has micro-managed his way through 23 incumbents of football's hottest seat. For context, there had been 34 in the club's 109-year history before then.\n\nOnly five coaches have lasted a whole campaign. Five seasons — including this one — have seen three different men in the dugout. In 2014-15 and 2019-20, there were four.\n\nIt appeared the hire-and-fire culture worked, as Watford spent six of seven seasons in the Premier League from 2015 to 2022. But they are not even a yo-yo club anymore. The string has snapped, the parachute payments from Premier League relegation have stopped, and that revolving door keeps on turning. Next!\n\nIt is a mistake to think of the Bayern Munich job as a coaching role — it is much more than that.\n\nThe starting point for the record 34-time German champions is that anything less than a domestic double of trophies each season is seen as performing below par, with every unconvincing performance — even in victory — subject to inquest.\n\nBut then there is the rapacious Bavarian and national media, for whom negativity about Bayern is big business, and a dressing room always loaded with forthright personalities and egos.\n\nThe club’s elders, Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, present a separate challenge. Hoeness, the honorary president who played for Bayern from 1970 to 1979, rarely has an unspoken thought, especially about the standard of the team or the quality of coaching, meaning that plenty of scrutiny comes from inside the club, from seemingly unimpeachable figures.\n\nA Bayern coach needs tremendous presence, but also the humility to know their place at certain times and when to be deferential. That is a balance few have found in the club’s modern history.\n\nThe hardest coaching job is one where expectations are high, patience is low and, sometimes, the view is irrational. In the NBA, that means the jobs at two high-profile teams on each coast.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers head coach lives under constant strain. Pressure is intensely high for a fanbase (and ownership) used to winning. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles, the second-most in league history. They are not used to losing. Even winning the NBA Cup (a feat with a nebulous value) is not enough. Darvin Ham was fired in 2024, the year after making the conference finals and hanging a Cup banner.\n\nThe Lakers have had 11 coaches in the last 25 years but only one has lasted more than three seasons in the job: Phil Jackson (from 1999-2004 and 2005-2011). Even Frank Vogel was fired in 2022, two years after winning a title.\n\nThe New York Knicks head coach feels the pressure, too. There have been 15 of them since 2000. But that franchise has not won an NBA championship in 53 years. The owner is demanding and impatient, and success is only success on the right terms.\n\nAfter two decades of ineptitude, Tom Thibodeau was fired last spring, despite leading the Knicks to their best finish in a quarter-century. Good luck to the new coach, and the one who replaces him.\n\nThere is an old cliche about the difficulty of coaching national teams in football. Clubs have big fanbases, sure, but they are splintered and spread around. When you manage a country, the number of people who think they can do a better job than you is roughly equal to the entire population.\n\nIn Brazil, that number is about 210million. Nearly all of them are obsessed with football. The older generations remember a time when the national team were the dominant force in the international game. The rest grew up hearing the tales and watching the videos — and many will still have seen one or two of the more recent World Cup wins (Brazil have lifted the game's most prestigious title a record five times). It is understandable that expectation often curdles into entitlement.\n\nWhat complicates things is a knot of competing dynamics. There are the zigzagging inferiority/superiority complexes when it comes to how Brazilian football compares to that played in Europe. There is the deathless debate around the compatibility — or otherwise — of winning and entertaining. There is also the fact that Brazil’s national self-image is so bound up with football.\n\nThe Brazil coach is not just picking 11 players and planning corner routines. He has to plot a course through all of that other stuff, all while loaded down by the weight of history. It is no great wonder most fail.\n\nNo NHL coaching job is quite like it.\n\nA longest-in-league-history championship drought means bringing the Stanley Cup to Toronto would all but guarantee instant legendary status and a statue outside the arena. The problem? That same historic drought — and all the failures along the way — have added to the pressure and noise in hockey’s largest market.\n\nCanada’s most populated city counts a fanbase that has only grown in the face of annual disappointment. The Maple Leafs, the NHL’s most valuable team, last won the Stanley Cup in 1967. There were just six teams in the league at the time. Today, there are 32.\n\nSince Punch Imlach led the Leafs to that last championship, 21 other coaches have tried — and ultimately failed — to satisfy a starved fanbase. Despite the billions of dollars invested over the years into the team’s expensive roster, facilities, resources and staff, the Leafs have never won more than two playoff rounds in a single season in that time.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2012, the Leafs did not even make the playoffs, adding to their sense of perennial heartbreak. Four coaches failed during that time. Two of them won the Stanley Cup elsewhere — giving weight to the notion that the Leafs might be cursed.\n\nWith 25 games remaining this season, the Leafs are in danger of missing the playoffs altogether for the first time in a decade. Craig Berube, a former Stanley Cup-winning coach who has been leading Toronto since 2024, is the latest person in the hot seat.\n\nPutting this season aside, the job of coaching one of Scotland’s big two could be naively regarded as a cakewalk. Historically, and certainly since the turn of the century, their budgets have dwarfed those of every other Scottish team. Your job, therefore, is to finish in front of the club over the road. Simple.\n\nBut in that respect, there is nowhere to hide. If you are Rangers and you wind up behind Celtic, you might as well have finished bottom. The same is true in reverse. To attend an Old Firm fixture, as the rivalry is known, is to understand the frenetic, vitriolic, passionate and sometimes poisonous world of football in Glasgow. It looks like easy street when it goes well. It is an untold nightmare if it goes badly.\n\nAnd, very often, the fate of a coach is wholly dictated by the structure around them and above them. Strain at boardroom level filters down onto the pitch, affecting resources and the quality of performances.\n\nYou have seen that at Rangers for more than a decade. You are seeing it at Celtic now. Yes, Wilfried Nancy was a disaster of an appointment, sacked after 33 days in charge last month — but when were Celtic last set up to fail as they seem to be at present? It made Nancy’s job a hospital pass, regardless of whether the former Columbus Crew coach was ever the right fit.\n\nWith regards to Glasgow, Vince Lombardi was bang on: there is no room for second place. It is sink or swim from a manager’s first morning in post — and rather them than me.\n\nThere is a phrase in Turkish football which roughly translates as “titles are won at the airport” — a reference to the big-name signings who are often greeted with frantic scenes when they get off the plane to finalise their deals.\n\nThe idea that new arrivals will inevitably mean success is an attitude shared by club presidents, too. The message to their coaches is “we’ve given you the stars, now win something”.\n\nWhich is part of the reason that coaching any of Istanbul’s big three clubs — Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas — is almost an impossible job. Plenty of cultures think of football as a form of religion, but there are not many cities that do so with such chaotic intensity as Istanbul.\n\nGood luck to anyone in charge of any of them, but right now the biggest pressure is on Fenerbahce. Historically the most successful club in Turkey (they have won 28 Turkish titles to Galatasaray’s 26), they have not been champions since 2014, their longest-ever drought, and have had to watch Galatasaray demolish them for the last three seasons.\n\nThey are on their 11th different manager since that last success, and things are getting desperate: Jose Mourinho was sacked earlier this season and the man now in the hot seat is former Belgium manager Domenico Tedesco.\n\nKalen DeBoer took on maybe the greatest challenge in college football history two years ago by signing up to be the coach who replaced Nick Saban. Saban produced an unprecedented run of six national titles in 17 seasons at Alabama from 2007 to 2023.\n\nAlabama fans became accustomed to ruling the sport under Saban. But it has historically set the standard at national championship for its football program, long predating Saban. Before him, coach Bear Bryant won six national championships with the football team during the 1960s and 1970s and their excellence stretches back almost a century — with their 30 Southeastern Conference football championships by far the most in the history of the storied league.\n\nIn the early to mid-1900s, a time in the United States when elite Northeast universities and large institutions in the Midwest often ruled the sport, Alabama was a Southern powerhouse and source of pride for much of the state, though in-state rival Auburn also commands similar support. That Iron Bowl rivalry is yet another aspect that makes the Alabama job so difficult. An otherwise successful season can be severely damaged or even ruined by a loss to Auburn in the regular-season finale.\n\nThere is a saying that college football is like a religion in the Deep South, as much a part of a fan's identity as their faith. Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, capacity 100,077, is among college football's largest and most hallowed cathedrals. Successful coaches at Alabama become legends. Coaches who fail to meet the lofty expectations, even respected alumni such as Ray Perkins, Mike DuBose and Mike Shula, are forever remembered for their shortcomings.\n\nIndia are international cricket’s sole powerhouse. Even if Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand can compete in terms of the talent of their first team, India have a much deeper overall pool. The country has a total population of more than 1.4billion.\n\nGiven the perceived player advantage they possess, the coach faces immense scrutiny from all corners in a country that views the sport as a religion and its stars as gods. No sport rivals cricket’s status and no celebrities rival cricketers’ popularity in India.\n\nIndia wield immense financial firepower as a result and a considerable influence over cricket’s global body, the International Cricket Council. Jay Shah, the son of the nation’s home minister, is the council’s chairman.\n\nThose elements also make the coach’s job a fairly thankless one as India are expected to — and arguably should — beat every team they face.\n\nWhat do you think the hardest coaching job in world sport is?

    "description": "Eileen Guo and Alysa Liu have been thrust into a debate that goes far beyond sports.",
    "fullText": "An unusual battle is unfolding over the Winter Olympics in Milan - not on the slopes or in the rinks, but on the internet.\n\nAt its heart are Eileen Gu, a freestyle skier, and Alysa Liu, a figure-skater. They have a lot in common: both are young women of American-Chinese heritage who were born and raised in the US. And they are champions in their field.\n\nAnd yet, one is being hailed a trailblazer, while the other is deemed a traitor. At least that's the case in the eyes of some in the US. On Chinese social media, it's the other way around.\n\nWhy? Liu, the daughter of a political activist who fled China after a deadly crackdown, is competing under the US flag. And Gu, whose mother moved to the US for higher education, often spent her childhood summers visiting Beijing. She is representing China in Milan.\n\nThat seems to rankle with some Americans. \"Eileen Gu competes for China and gets paid millions to do it. Alysa Liu is the daughter of a Chinese immigrant who participated in the Tiananmen Square protests. In a world of Eileen Gus, be an Alysa Liu,\" said one post on X.\n\nMuch of this backlash appears to be driven by political commentators and a vocal minority on X, rather than the broader public or the sporting world. The underlying current is the competition between the US and China - the world's two biggest economies are constantly vying for an edge in everything, from trade to tech.\n\nAnd so, a narrow yet vociferous slice of the internet is pitting two women against each other, questioning their loyalty and identity, while interrogating their immigrant experiences - and adding to the pressure they already face as sporting figures.\n\nKnown in China by her nickname \"Snow Princess\", Eileen Gu was born in California to a Chinese mother and American father.\n\nShe was raised by her mother Yan Gu - reportedly a successful venture capitalist with degrees from Peking University and Stanford.\n\nGu grew up with a foot firmly in both worlds, spending her summers in Beijing and the rest of her term at a private school in San Francisco.\n\nShe began freeskiing at the age of three in the Lake Tahoe region and joined the Northstar California Resort freeskiing team at the age of eight. She won her first national championship just a year later.\n\nShe initially skied for the US before switching to Team China in 2019 in preparation for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which took place in the Chinese capital Beijing.\n\nGu said she wanted to \"inspire millions of young people in Beijing - my mother's birthplace\". The decision earned her the praise of many in China.\n\nShe went on to win two golds and one silver in the 2022 Olympics.\n\nIn the years since, Gu has established herself as a veritable sports icon in China. Millions on Chinese social media follow her every move, leaving heart shaped emojis under her posts.\n\nChinese state media outlet the Global Times called her an \"idol for the whole world\". She is also one of the highest-earning female athletes in the world, reportedly earning around $23m (£16.9m) a year.\n\nHer decision to join Team China initially brought with it a considerable amount of backlash. Beyond the rivalry with the US, people also took issue with China's authoritarian Communist Party rulers, their poor record on human rights and the lack of free speech in the country.\n\nBut the outrage died down for the most part - until now.\n\nIt kicked off last week, when Olympian Hunter Hess was asked what it was like to represent the US given the polarising situation in the country, including the recent, contentious ICE raids in Minnesota that left two people dead.\n\nHe replied that he had \"mixed feelings\" about it, adding: \"Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded to Hess' comment by calling him a \"real loser\" who \"shouldn't have tried out for the team\". Many athletes leapt to Hess' defence, including Gu: \"As someone who's been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes\".\n\nHer comments enraged her critics, who said Gu was able to criticise Trump but had never spoken out publicly against China.\n\nFormer NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom was among them, calling Gu a \"traitor\", who \"was born in America, raised in America, lives in America and chose to compete against her own country for the worst human rights abuser on the planet - China\".\n\n\"You don't get to enjoy the freedoms of US citizenship while acting as a global PR asset for the Chinese Communist Party,\" he said in a lengthy post on X.\n\n\"Does Eileen Gu have any criticism for Xi Jinping for genocide, slavery and arresting dissenters?\" Matt Whitlock, a self-described Republican communicator also posted on X. Western governments, rights groups and the UN have repeatedly accused Beijing of grave human rights violations in Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as in its swift crackdowns on protest and dissent across the country. The Chinese government denies the charges and says these are internal matters.\n\n\"Many American-born athletes compete for other nations with little fanfare - the 'New Cold War' climate between the US and China has changed the stakes,\" says Professor Yinan He of Lehigh University.\n\n\"Personal identity is increasingly centred on national loyalty in the eyes of the public, diminishing the tolerance for 'deviance' or dual-identity\".\n\nEarlier this week Gu said she felt as though she was \"skiing with the weight of two countries on my shoulder\", after losing the gold in women's slopestyle to Switzerland.\n\nWhile some supporters saw this as a moment of vulnerability, it appeared to set her critics off again. Some took offence to her claiming the \"weight\" of the US was on her: \"She was only representing one country and it wasn't ours.\"\n\nSoon, many online began comparing her to Alysa Liu - an athlete who has made a comeback this year, winning a gold medal for the US figure skating team.\n\nThe 20-year-old is the daughter of Arthur Liu, who fled China after taking part in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. The student-led pro-democracy movement ended in a brutal massacre in Beijing. The subject remains taboo in China, and any references to it are swiftly censored.\n\nHer family history might partly explain why there aren't too many posts about Liu on Chinese social media. Those that do praise her usually have comments below such as: \"Why are you praising this person? Her whole family is anti-China\".\n\nRaised by her father, Liu grew up in California and began skiing at a young age. At the age of 13, she became the youngest ever athlete to win the US women's figure skating championship.\n\nIn 2019, Arthur Liu alleged that he was targeted in a spying operation that the Justice Department alleges was ordered by the Chinese government. His daughter says she was told by FBI agents in 2022 that she and her family were believed to be under surveillance by the Chinese government.\n\nHer father's background and the possibility that her family is still targeted because of it has certainly won Liu sympathy and admiration. That, in turn, seems to be fuelling the criticism of Gu.\n\nThe divide between Li and Gu isn't just about \"nationalism, it's also about class and relatability, Prof He says. Gu represents a luxury culture - private schools, Stanford. Her choice to compete for China is often seen through this lens as a 'mercenary business decision'\", he explains.\n\nIndeed a post on X by non-profit group Asians for Liberty read, \"The CCP lures American athletes with promises of wealth and fame but a true American rejects it. Alysa Liu is an American patriot\".\n\n\"All of this frames how the media and the public make sense of Liu and Gu, who have been cast as the good and bad immigrant respectively,\" says Professor Richard King of Columbia College Chicago.\n\nChinese Australian dissident artist Badiucao, known for his content against the Chinese Communist Party, posted drawings of the athletes recently. One showed Liu in front of a Tiananmen tank, a reference to her father's activism, and another showed Gu holding a Chinese flag, with what appear to be bodies hidden underneath, a not-so-subtle reference to the accusations against Beijing.\n\nFar-right news and opinion website The Daily Caller, founded by political commentator Tucker Carlson, went further with an article titled: \"Meet Eileen Gu, the true villain of the Winter Olympics\".\n\nThe episode also exposes \"the incredibly precarious social and political landscape that Asian Americans have to navigate,\" says Professor Stanley Thangaraj at Stonehill College. They \"come to be recognised only in limited ways, and any political act immediately dislocates them from the US\".\n\nWhen prominent Asian Americans attempted to defend Gu, with Marvel actor Simu Liu posting that he was \"freaking proud\" of Gu, calling her \"inspirational, resilient, intelligent and well spoken in two languages\" - he too faced an immediate wave of backlash, with comments demanding he \"go back to China\".\n\nAs the Games continue in Milan, the sport itself seems to have become an afterthought in discussions of both athletes.\n\n\"Despite both athletes sharing similar racial backgrounds and first-generation immigrant experiences,\" Prof He says, \"they have been cast as opposing archetypes in a narrative they didn't write\".",

    "description": "NBC Sports' exclusive stylist Amy Acton explains what it takes to dress more than 200 on-air personalities for Olympic coverage around the world.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Acton, the founder and CEO of Acton Styling Group. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the exclusive stylist for NBC Sports, which means I style NBC talent for the Olympics and other shows like Sunday Night Football, the Kentucky Derby, and more.\n\nI've always been interested in fashion. When I was younger, I went to college for all of two weeks because I ran out of outfits — I thought there was no point. It just wasn't for me. After working at health clubs, I became a personal shopper for an upscale clothing boutique, and then moved into television styling.\n\nI began my styling career on television for \"The Montel Williams Show\" in the 90s. I was styling mostly men then. At a photo shoot, a woman asked me to style NBC anchor Hannah Storm. I did closet edits for her and then her wardrobe for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Then I became a stylist for the Sydney Games. Sports changed my life.\n\nI style over 200 people for NBC during its Olympics coverage. It's not just on-air talent, although we style 20 to 25 on-air talent, like Mike Tirico and Rebecca Lowe. We also create the \"venue talent wardrobe package,\" which is what all the reporters and commentators who call the games on-site wear.\n\nWe start two years before the broadcast. As soon as one Olympics ends, we begin preparing for the next one. We have to make sure we are doing everything — from choosing the right colors to selecting clothing that will protect everyone from the environment — Milan's temperature is very different from the 2018 Winter Olympics site, PyeongChang, for example.\n\nA post shared by Trenni (Kusnierek) Casey (@trenninbcs)\n\nTo prepare, we bring all the talent to New York to do a fitting with the looks I pre-pull. Ralph Lauren, the exclusive brand NBC talent wears, has a team on hand to assist the in-studio team with alterations. The venue talent also comes to the studio; we have to make sure they look good and cohesive, and we don't want everyone wearing the same sweater at the same time. We alter the clothes, and then we ship everything where it needs to go. We shipped the clothes to Milan about a month prior to the games.\n\nMy company, Acton Group, doesn't have anything to do with what Team USA athletes wear.\n\nI'm always working in two different time zones. We have studios in the US plus talent in the host country. In the US, the talent is at the NBC Sports Group headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and sometimes at 30 Rock in New York City. The day never really ends. My phone is always on. For example, I went straight from dressing Super Bowl commentators Jason Garrett, Devin McCourty, and Maria Taylor to Milan for the Olympics.\n\nA post shared by Rebecca Lowe (@rebeccalowetv)\n\nIt's highly hands-on and fast-paced — I'm managing fittings, daily dressing, wardrobe organization, and last-minute changes. For studio talent alone, it's 420 looks over two weeks. There are 10 people in Milan, and 10 people in the US on my team. We are a machine, a 24-hour operation in both countries. Between Stamford and Milan, Acton Style Group manages the movement of more than 7,500 Ralph Lauren pieces across all venues.\n\nAs much as I love fashion, it's about making people feel good about themselves. We want talent — who are in front of the biggest audiences in the world — to feel good about themselves.\n\nYou can't put a price tag on that, and you can't always do it for yourself. You need someone else to pump you up and tell you that it looks good.",

    "fullText": "Recently, Liverpool and the Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk said former players-turned-pundits have a responsibility when discussing the performances of the current generation of footballers.\n\nHe believes they can stray into \"clickbait\" and have a possible impact on players' mental health.\n\nOn Thursday's episode of the More than the Score podcast, former Scotland international Pat Nevin and chief sports editor for Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf Marcel van der Kraan join John Bennett to discuss and analyse the modern world of punditry and the impact it can have on players and managers alike.\n\n\"As a player you do tend to take it to heart, especially when it feels a little personal,\" said Nevin.\n\n\"Generally, it isn't personal and the pundit is just having their opinion and we all kind of know where the lines are. But, the lines have been jumped over more often in recent years and I think Van Dijk is right about that.\n\n\"Because of the clickbait, it is so much easier to get more likes, views and work if you're a little bit more extreme. Ex-players aren't stupid and they know that. If you are too sensible and sit on the fence you won't get the big gigs.\n\n\"You have a dichotomy. Most ex-players would like to be balanced but they know if they are too balanced and sensible they won't be there next week.\n\n\"My criticism would always be constructive criticism which is explained. One-dimensional labeling of players should never happen. Sometimes if a big name says something enough it becomes accepted wisdom.\"\n\nVan der Kraan added: \"There are two different kinds of pundits; those who need to be on every week and those who are genuinely focused on what is right and what players should do.\n\n\"For Van Dijk, after so many years enough is enough.\n\n\"It all started after he came into the Netherlands team and became a big player at Liverpool. The first ex-player to really criticise him was Marco van Basten, saying he was not a leader. Van Dijk was biting his lip after every match because it became a bit of a stigma.\n\n\"Eventually it filtered to England and every time he had a bad game it became an open nerve.\"\n\nListen to the full episode on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Igor Thiago has reflected on his childhood watching Manchester United, which is where his love for football was first established.\n\nThe Brentford talisman chatted with TNT Sports ahead of his side’s clash with league leaders Arsenal last night.\n\nAfter being asked whether he’d always dreamed of being a professional player, he responded: “No, I didn’t even like it that much. But my brother started talking to me and made me watch the Premier League every weekend, especially Manchester United.\n\n“And then I started paying closer attention to United. From there it grew on me with feelings of love and affection. Then, I wanted to become a player too”.\n\n(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nWhile a striker addition isn’t United’s priority heading into the summer window, it’s certainly an admission that’ll have sparked the interest of INEOS chiefs.\n\nThiago is enjoying a tremendous campaign leading the Bees’ frontline – in a season in which they were widely anticipated to struggle in the absence of Thomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.\n\nHowever, they, as much as Keith Andreews might want to play down the prospect, are well in the mix for a European finish, and Thiago has been crucial to that.\n\nThe 24-year-old has netted a remarkable 17 goals in 26 matches, ranking him second-placed behind Erling Haaland in the Golden Boot race.\n\nHe has outscored costly summer signings such as Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike, both of whom are on 10 goals each, as well as Antoine Semenyo (13 goals), who moved from Bournemouth to Manchester City last month.\n\n(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nIn fact, United fans might recall that Thiago was on the scoresheet twice earlier this term when Brentford hosted the Reds at the Gtech Community Stadium back in September.\n\nHaving been injured for his team’s visit in 2024/2025, the Brazilian will experience Old Trafford for the first time in April, when United will be looking to avenge their 3-1 defeat, this time with Michael Carrick in the dugout.\n\nIn-form Premier League talisman says watching Man Utd with ‘love and affection’ made him want to be a player\n\nOwen fires warning to Man Utd that it’s going to be ‘nigh on impossible’ to replace star who could leave in summer\n\nMail: United ‘expected to make offer’ for £180k-a-week star with agreement now looking ‘increasingly likely’",

    "fullText": "CBS Sports sends scary warning to Ohio State, Ryan Day as pressure mounts ahead of 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough the Ohio State Buckeyes failed to repeat as national champions this past season, they are part of a select group of three consecutive Big Ten teams to win it all.\n\nWhether this year will continue the conference's trend, the Buckeyes are going to attempt to remain in that mix for a league and national title under coach Ryan Day.\n\nSome analysts, including CBS Sports' Cody Nagel, aren't fond of the Buckeyes' national title hopes entering this fall as he assessed 25 teams in a way-too-early Top 25 network.\n\nNagel ranked the Buckeyes at No. 1 despite him predicting that they will lose at least three games for the first time in 15 seasons.\n\n\"Ohio State has been a perennial national championship contender for most of the 21st century and expects to be in the title hunt again in 2026,\" Nagel wrote. \"But the Buckeyes face more hurdles than usual with one of the nation's toughest schedules, including five opponents from [Brandon] Marcello's way-too-early top 25. Ohio State hasn't lost more than two games since 2011. If there was ever a year for that streak to end, this is it.\"\n\nMORE: Kirk Herbstreit shares true feelings about Michigan's Bryce Underwood entering 2026 season\n\nFurther along in Nagel's preview, he notes that the Michigan Wolverines will regain momentum in \"The Game\" rivalry this November. Therefore, it would give the Wolverines their first head-to-head win against Ohio State since 2024. To make matters worse for the Buckeyes, their Nov. 7 opponent (Oregon Ducks) are a potential national title pick. Therefore, another loss there seems more likely than not.\n\nShould the Buckeyes miss the postseason, it would further validate the fact that the pressure Day faces from the Buckeyes' fanbase is real, raw and unapologetic.\n\nIf Nagel is proven correct, the next year in Columbus is going to be extremely interesting.\n\nMORE: Patriots coach Mike Vrabel shares harsh reality after losing Super Bowl 60 to Seahawks\n\nIllinois 2026 football schedule\n\nMichigan 2026 football schedule\n\nOhio State 2026 football schedule",

    "title": "THEN AND NOW: What 10 former Olympic stadiums look like today",
    "description": "Some Olympic venues are abandoned after the Games, but the main stadiums often get a second life as general sports arenas or concert venues.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Olympic opening ceremony was a 3 ½-hour extravaganza that mainly took place at Milan's San Siro Stadium.\n\nWith a capacity of over 75,000, it's the largest stadium in Italy and one of the largest stadiums across Europe. It's also the home of soccer teams AC Milan and Inter Milan.\n\nItaly is lucky that San Siro was large enough for the opening ceremony. Many countries have to spend millions constructing a stadium specifically for the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nBut what happens to them after the Games? Some are renovated and turned into sporting arenas. Others are left somewhat abandoned, as the host city often doesn't need the thousands of seats. Or they're destroyed entirely — in Lake Placid, New York, the stadium used for the opening ceremony was demolished soon after the 1980 Games.\n\nHere's what Olympic stadiums looked like at their peak, and how they've changed since the torch was extinguished.\n\nThe Olympiastadion was built for the 1936 Summer Games. A different stadium was used when Berlin hosted the Winter Games earlier that year.\n\nAfter Germany was reunified in 1990, it wasn't clear what Berliners would do with the stadium.\n\nEventually, it was renovated and reopened in 2004. It's now the biggest stadium in Germany, has hosted the 2006 FIFA Men's World Cup and the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, and has been the home stadium for Hertha BSC since 1963.\n\nMost recently, the 2024 UEFA Euro final was held at the Olympiastadion.\n\nHowever, some of the other venues from the Berlin Olympics are abandoned, including the swimming hall and Olympic Village.\n\nThe Beijing National Stadium, or the \"Bird's Nest,\" was built inside Beijing's Olympic Green complex specifically for the 2008 Summer Games.\n\nThe National Stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies again in 2022 after a 14-year hiatus, according to the Olympics.\n\nIn the time since the 2008 Olympics, though, the National Stadium has hosted a handful of sporting events, such as car racing, and concerts, but not many. But the venue costs $10 million a year to maintain, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) reported, so the city charges admission for tours.\n\nThe National Stadium's first big event was the 1958 Asian Games. It remained a popular site for sporting events until it closed in 2014, and it even remained unscathed during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, The Associated Press reported at the time.\n\nIt cost over $1 billion to construct the new stadium, CNN reported. It's now used by the national soccer and rugby teams.\n\nThe stadium has been nicknamed the \"big O\" by locals for its distinct shape ... or the \"big owe\" for how much it cost the city at the time.\n\nMontreal finally paid off its debts three decades after the Games wrapped, CFR reported.\n\nThe fields for equestrian events were already there, but the stands for the 30,000 spectators that day were constructed specifically for the Games and later removed, according to the Olympic Studies Centre.\n\nYou can learn more about visiting here.\n\nThe 1984 Winter Olympics were held in Sarajevo, one of the biggest cities in Yugoslavia, a country that would break up and splinter into multiple countries only a few years later, in 1991.\n\nAfter Yugoslavia broke up, Sarajevo became the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was subsequently bombed and under siege for almost four years, destroying the original Zetra Ice Hall.\n\nThe Juan Antonio Samaranch Olympic Hall was rebuilt in 1999 with the help of a donation from the International Olympic Committee.\n\nOther sites used in the Games have since been left to the elements.\n\nThe Atlanta Games, unfortunately, will always be remembered for the infamous bombing on July 27.\n\nBut after the Olympics, the stadium remained a huge presence in the city. It was shortly turned into Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves from 1997 to 2016.\n\nAfter the Braves departed, Georgia State University acquired the stadium and redesigned it for their football team, the Panthers, who have called Center Parc home since 2017.\n\nThe stadium was originally designed and built in the '80s so Athens could host the 1982 European Championships in Athletics, but it received a major renovation for the 2004 Games, including a new roof, according to the Olympics' website.\n\nWhile some other Olympic venues have seemingly remained untouched since the 2004 Games, the site of the opening and closing ceremonies is quite busy.\n\nHowever, in October 2023, there were concerns that the roof had become unsafe, Reuters reported, and the stadium was closed until May 2024. Just a few weeks later, Coldplay played two shows in the newly restored stadium.\n\nFisht Stadium was specifically built for the 2014 Winter Olympics. It was built as an enclosed facility.\n\nThis renovation was in preparation of Russia hosting the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and then the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The capacity of the venue can now be changed from 45,000 to 25,000 depending on its use, according to its engineering consultants Buro Happold.\n\nAdditionally, Russian soccer team PFC Sochi plays at Fisht.\n\nSoccer and track-and-field events were also held in Maracanã Stadium, which was originally built in 1950 to host the FIFA World Cup, according to Britannica.\n\nThe stadium held the finals for the 2021 Copa América — an international competition between men's soccer teams in South America — in July 2021. The Copa América finals were also played in Maracanã in 2019.",

    "description": "Andrei Arlovski furthered his combat sports legacy by defeating Ben Rothwell to win the BKFC heavyweight title.",
    "fullText": "Andrei Arlovski still has Ben Rothwell's number and has added another championship to his storied resume.\n\nIn the main event of BKFC: KnuckleMania 6, former UFC champ Arlovski met incoming BKFC heavyweight champ for the third time in combat sports – the first time in bareknuckle boxing. Arlovski won the first two fights in MMA and has now won the third in a different sport. The official result was a TKO stoppage due to cuts at 1:14 of Round 3.\n\nRothwell appeared more hesitant than ever before in the BKFC ring, and Arlovski took full advantage. Arlovski brought the fight to Rothwell, shoving him hard into the rigid ropes and clipping him with a few clean punches in Round 1.\n\nArlovski was quicker to the punch in Round 2 as well, opening up a nasty cut. In the closing seconds, Arlovski charged forward with a brutal combination, sending Rothwell reeling into the ropes. He didn't go down, but was clearly hurt from the accurate right hands.\n\nBefore the start of the third round, the referee had the doctor check on Rothwell, but the action continued. Rothwell struggled to deal with Arlovski's speed and accuracy. The fight was paused with less than a minute to go in the round so the doctor could take another look at the gashes on Rothwell's face – and that's where it would end.\n\nAndrei Arlovski makes it 3-0 in combat sports vs. Ben Rothwell, this time to claim the BKFC heavyweight title at age 47. #KM6\n\n🎥 @bareknucklefc pic.twitter.com/R6Q39G9CG4\n\n— MMA Junkie (@MMAJunkie) February 8, 2026\n\nThe pair first met in MMA at Affliction 1 in July 2008. Arlovski won that meeting by TKO in the third round. The rematch took place at UFC on ESPN 4 over a decade later. Once again, Arlovski got his hand raised, that time by unanimous decision.\n\nArlovski, 47, has not lost in competition since exiting the UFC in 2024. Since, he's won four total fights by stoppage; two in BKFC, one in Dirty Boxing Championship, and an exhibition boxing bout under the Misfits Boxing banner.\n\nRothwell, 44, ripped through the competition in BKFC after his UFC exit. He claimed the heavyweight title in his fourth fight by stopping Mick Terrill in just 36 seconds last January. However, his fantastic run came to a halt at the knuckles of a familiar foe.\n\nAndrei Arlovski def.

    "description": "In this Saturday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about why being a sports fan is sometimes better in moderation.",
    "fullText": "Being the ultimate sports fan doesn't come with a warning label, but maybe it should. Cheering on your favorite team can cause severe mood swings, violent outbursts, and even, at times, tightness in your chest. It's why I'm a fair-weather fan.\n\nThere's a backstory: I used to have a team. As a Baltimore native, when the Ravens came to our city in 1996, I was all in. After buying tons of black and purple, winning two Super Bowls, and then white knuckling through the lackluster seasons that followed, I decided to set a boundary for my own sanity.\n\nFor me, and the bold, ambiguous fans like me, being a fair-weather fan isn't about disloyalty; it's a form of self-care. It's choosing which stressors I'm letting get to me — and football was no longer one of them.\n\nGloria Chan Packer, who helps ambitious professionals manage stress and burnout in the workplace, writes in an essay for BI that \"we can't eradicate stress entirely,\" but advises that we should aim \"to establish a healthier and more sustainable relationship with your stress.\"\n\nSo yes, I've decided to protect my peace while still respecting the game and showing up when it matters most. It won't be this Sunday when the Seattle Seahawks face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX, but guess who's not stressed about that? Me.",

    "fullText": "Border Patrol really isn’t welcome anywhere!\n\nU.S. Border Patrol may be all about kicking people out of the country, but Commander Gregory Bovino just got the same treatment at a bar in Las Vegas.\n\nJust days after President Donald Trump pulled Bovino out of Minnesota when he started facing backlash for overseeing the administration’s aggressive mass deportation agenda that led to the fatal shooting of Americans Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the hands of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Bovino found out there was another place he wasn’t welcome: a Sin City bar.\n\nBovino was spotted drinking wine at a sports bar on the Las Vegas Strip Bottled Blonde, but he was quickly removed out of concern for the safety of the other bar patrons.\n\n“Upon becoming aware of the individual’s presence, the patron was asked to leave the premises and was escorted out by staff in accordance with venue policy to maintain a safe and orderly environment for all patrons,” the venue told the Daily Beast.\n\nBottled Blonde didn’t elaborate except to explain that, as a private business that “does not engage in political activity or affiliations,” they reserve “the right to refuse service to any patron at its discretion.”\n\nIt’s unclear why Bovino was seen in the Las Vegas bar three days after he was removed from his role as Border Patrol “commander at large” and transferred back to his old position in California, but he was caught on video and in still photos drinking with a group of younger men.\n\nAfter being kicked out of Bottled Blonde he was seen walking down the Strip with those same men. The photos and videos triggered a backlash online, where people were angry that he was enjoying a night out after leading the violent immigration sweep that caused the extrajudicial shooting of two American citizens.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: Border Patrol boss embarrassingly kicked out of a Las Vegas bar to protect patrons\n\nLGBTQ+ officials denounce ICE killing of Minneapolis woman, demand investigation\n\nBorder Patrol chief Greg Bovino and some of his masked agents will leave Minneapolis\n\nJustice Department employee charged & fired after throwing Subway sandwich at federal law enforcement officer",

    "description": "Nearly every Bruin on the roster got involved in the 40 point win Wednesday night.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - There was a Big Ten mismatch on Wednesday in Pauley Pavilion when No. 2 UCLA (22-1, 12-0) hosted Rutgers (9-14, 1-11) and came out the other end with an 86-46 victory to remain undefeated in conference play.\n\nA matchup between the top and bottom teams in the Big Ten was expected to end in Bruin domination and by the end of the first quarter, where UCLA went on a 17-0 run at one point and finished the quarter ahead 26-6, the game looked pretty much over.\n\nThat comfort meant that UCLA head coach Cori Close had some freedom to experiment with different rotations and utilize players like freshman forward Sienna Betts, freshman guard Lena Bilic and redshirt-sophomore forward Amanda Muse much earlier in the game than they'd appear normally.\n\nMuse played 20 minutes, her second-most minutes this season, while Bilic played 20 minutes herself and Betts played close to 24 minutes while scoring 11 points, the same amount her older sister senior center Lauren Betts scored in the game.\n\n\"I'm sure she'll [Sienna Betts] rub that in quite a bit,\" Close said.\n\nThe benefit of rotations that are uncommon to the team is that it gives them an opportunity to try out combinations with each other they otherwise wouldn't have a chance to. It also means that the starters have a chance to rest their bodies in a game where the stakes are much lower and the end result is all but guaranteed.\n\n\"We mixed up our rotations a little bit. It's a long year. We want to protect our bodies a little bit,\" senior guard Kiki Rice said. \"It's also a great opportunity to play with other people. To work on actions together and how we play with each other and we need to be able to play with different lineups because there's going to be times where that's going to happen throughout the year.\"\n\nJordan Teller - The Sporting Tribune\n\nKiki Rice #1 of the UCLA Bruins drives towards the basket during an NCAA basketball game against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, Wednesday February 4, 2026 in Los Angeles, Calif.\n\nWednesday's game was extra special because it fell on National Girls and Women in Sports Day. To celebrate UCLA involved several young women in the game production, with squeaky voices calling out over the loudspeaker to introduce players or announce a made basket.\n\nFor the players, it's another reminder of the privilege they have to make an impact as the next generation of role models for young women athletes.\n\n\"It's super special that we can do that and have the little girls be out there learning new skills... It's just really cool to see that and what's super cool about our program... there's lots of families here and there's little kids that look up to us. It's super cool because they are familiar faces to us so we do recognize the people that come to our games and we really appreciate it. Just super cool that we can do this game and lift women up,\" senior forward Gabriela Jaquez said.\n\nFor Close, a day like Wednesday's game reminds her of the role models in women's sports that she was looking for growing up but couldn't always find.\n\nIt also reminded her of all the programs and opportunities that exist now, and that UCLA is a part of, to give women more positions in the sports world as athletes, coaches, trainers, hosts and broadcasters.\n\n\"I wish I had women to look up to at that age that I could go and see,\" Close said. \"I am such a hoop head and I would watch as much basketball as my mom would let me, but there were no options to watch women and girls as I was growing up. It was all men's basketball.... What a privilege when you can combine trying to master your craft and compete at the highest levels and inspire somebody else and impact a heart. How lucky are we?\"",

    "fullText": "International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry says it must \"be better\" on climate change after receiving a petition signed by more than 21,000 people who want to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports.\n\nThe petition - delivered on Wednesday and with athletes among the signatories - comes as Italy's Eni, one of the world's seven biggest oil companies, is a 'premium partner' of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIt follows reports that the number of countries which could reliably host a Winter Olympics will hugely reduce in the future because of climate change.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether she is disappointed by the Games having high-carbon sponsors, Coventry said: \"It's really nice athletes have a platform to speak up.\n\n\"The petition, I know they met with our team today and we are having conversations in order to be better, and for our stakeholders to be better. But that takes time.\"\n\nChristophe Dubi, the IOC executive director for the Olympic Games, added: \"We make a point to receive those petitions, and we have to recognise climate is a challenge for all of us.\n\n\"What we have to do as an organisation is to be at the forefront of sustainability, and our principles are very clear.\"\n\nOne area the IOC is aiming to make the Olympics more sustainable is having Games take place over a wider area with more pre-existing facilities, and Coventry said Milan-Cortina is an acid test for whether this is a viable future.\n\nMilan-Cortina takes place in three hubs spread across northern Italy - in Milan, Cortina and Livigno - with only two newly built sporting facilities: the Santagiulia ice hockey arena and Cortina Sliding Centre.\n\nThe next two Winter Olympics - French Alps 2030 and Utah 2034 - will also have sports spread more widely, while the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane is will have venues across Queensland.\n\nThis has caused issues however, with Brisbane organisers saying, external they will go beyond the originally stated budget of $4.9bn (£3.6bn).\n\n\"We are really experiencing a spread out Games here for the first time - we are going to learn a lot,\" Coventry said.\n\n\"We have taken this decision for sustainability reasons, climate and not having to have new venues. We are seeing there is an impact on National Olympic Committees because of the spreadness [sic], also for broadcast and media, making it harder to get around.\n\n\"What is really cool is that you get to see iconic venues in beautiful places - but now we have to weigh this up, the balance between a spread games for sustainability reasons but not shifting complexity and sustainability to different areas.\"\n\nWhile the action got underway on Wednesday with the start of the curling events, the 2026 Winter Olympics will officially start with the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nCoventry said she hoped all nations would be treated with respect by spectators, including the USA team amid criticism from Italian authorities about the presence of ICE agents in Milan.\n\n\"I hope the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as a chance to be respectful,\" she said.\n\n\"For me, when we went to the Olympic village that is the best reminder of how the Games should be. I hope the opening ceremony will do that.\"\n\nFear and Hall named 2026 Team GB flagbearers\n\nRussian athletes linked to pro-war activity\n\nQuiz: Name every sport at the 2026 Winter Olympics",

    "description": "The \"Today\" anchor stepped away from Milano Cortina coverage as her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, remains missing",
    "fullText": "Sports commentator and former tennis player Mary Carillo will replace Savannah Guthrie as co-host of the NBC’s Opening Ceremony for the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games after the “Today” host pulled out, following her mother’s disappearance.\n\nGuthrie had been originally scheduled to host the Opening Ceremony with Terry Gannon, who will remain on. Ahmed Fareed will now host “Olympic Late Night” from Feb. 7 to 9, replacing Craig Melvin.\n\nMelvin will remain stateside rather than traveling to Milan for the Games.\n\n“Our hearts go out to Savannah and the entire Guthrie family. They continue to have our full support,” said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. “We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talented commentators who will step in and fill these roles.”\n\n“Mary is one of the most experienced Olympic commentators ever and a master storyteller,” she added. “She and Terry will lead the American audience through one of the world’s greatest global moments. With his skill and versatility, Ahmed has proven time and again he can step into any hosting role, and we’re thrilled he’s available to handle our late night coverage before heading to Los Angeles for NBA All-Star Weekend.”\n\nThe Milan Games will be Carillo’s 17th Olympics that she has covered — she was already scheduled to be a correspondent in Milan. Of Italian descent herself, the commentator has a personal connection with the host city. This year will be her 14th Olympic assignment with NBC.\n\nAs previously announced, Shaun White will join the Opening Ceremony commentators in the booth during the Parade of Athletes. Following her Opening Ceremony duties, Carillo will cover the Games as a SportsDesk reporter.\n\nGuthrie’s 84-year-old mother Nancy has been missing since late Saturday night. The case has escalated from a missing-person to a suspected abduction with authorities saying they found signs of forced entry in her Arizona home.\n\nLive coverage of the Opening Ceremony begins Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, with primetime coverage scheduled for 8 p.m. ET/PT on both NBC and Peacock.\n\nThe post NBC Sports Taps Mary Carillo to Fill In for Savannah Guthrie at Winter Olympics appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Michigan football went 9-4 in 2025 despite having a lot going on behind the scenes. The hope with new head coach Kyle Whittingham leading the charge is that the Wolverines won't just rebound, they'll thrive.\n\nBut given the schedule, it will be something of an uphill battle for the maize and blue.\n\nMichigan will play Ohio State, Oregon, Indiana, Penn State, Iowa, Oklahoma, and more in 2026, with the first two matchups mentioned being on the road. Even so, CBS Sports' Brad Crawford (who usually isn't effusive in praise for the maize and blue) is optimistic about Whittingham's first year in Ann Arbor.\n\nIn Crawford's too-early CFP 12-team projection, the Wolverines make the cut as the 10-seed, meaning that they would be 12th overall and face Texas Tech, with the winner of the game set to face Indiana.\n\nAn early season win over Oklahoma win come in clutch for first-year Michigan coach Kyle Whittingham, who has more assets with the Wolverines than he ever possessed at Utah. Whittingham often gets the most out of his roster, and with enhanced resources, he should quickly push Michigan back in the playoff conversation. In this scenario as the 10-seed, the Wolverines would become the playoff's second-ever three-loss team, but first to not reach their league title game to get in. The losses? Oregon, Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nHaving three losses in the 2026 season wouldn't be a surprise given the perceived strength of schedule. However, making it into the 12-team invitational without losing that third game in the Big Ten Championship Game would be a bit of a surprise, given that no one has made it in with a 9-3 record before.\n\nCould that equate to a successful season? Making the playoff but with losses to Ohio State, Oregon, and Indiana? Perhaps, but most likely not in Michigan fans' eyes. Even if the schedule is more daunting this year than last.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: CBS Sports projects Michigan football to 2026 College Football Playoff",

    "description": "The Washington Post has laid off one-third of its staff, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage.",
    "fullText": "A sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nThe Washington Post laid off one-third of its staff Wednesday, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a widespread purge that represented a brutal blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.\n\nThe Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, called the move painful but necessary to put the outlet on stronger footing and weather changes in technology and user habits. “We can’t be everything to everyone,” Murray said in a note to staff members.\n\nHe outlined the changes in a companywide online meeting, and staff members then began getting emails with one of two subject lines — telling them their role was or was not eliminated.\n\nRumors of layoffs had circulated for weeks, ever since word leaked that sports reporters who had expected to travel to Italy for the Winter Olympics would not be going. But when official word came down, the size and scale of the cuts were shocking, affecting virtually every department in the newsroom.\n\n“It’s just devastating news for anyone who cares about journalism in America and, in fact, the world,” said Margaret Sullivan, a Columbia University journalism professor and former media columnist at the Post and The New York Times. “The Washington Post has been so important in so many ways, in news coverage, sports and cultural coverage.”\n\nMartin Baron, the Post’s first editor under its current owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, condemned his former boss and called what has happened at the newspaper “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nAs of midday, the Post did not have any news of the changes on its website.\n\nBezos, who has been silent in recent weeks amid pleas from Post journalists to step in and prevent the cutbacks, had no immediate comment Wednesday.\n\nThe newspaper has been bleeding subscribers in part due to decisions made by Bezos, including pulling back from an endorsement of Kamala Harris, a Democrat, during the 2024 presidential election against Donald Trump, a Republican, and directing a more conservative turn on liberal opinion pages.\n\nA private company, the Post does not reveal how many subscribers it has, but it is believed to be roughly 2 million. The Post would also not say how many people it has on staff, making it impossible to estimate how many people were laid off Wednesday. The Post also did not outline its finances.\n\nThe Post’s troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products such as games and its Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade.\n\nEliminating the sports section puts an end to a department that has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, among them John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser. The Times has also largely ended its sports section, but it has replaced the coverage by buying The Athletic and incorporating its work into the Times website.\n\nThe Post’s Book World, a destination for book reviews, literary news and author interviews, has been a dedicated section in its Sunday paper.\n\nA half-century ago, the Post’s coverage of Watergate, led by intrepid reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, entered the history books. The Style section under longtime Executive Editor Ben Bradlee hosted some of the country’s best feature writing.\n\nWord of specific cuts drifted out during the day, as when Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker announced on X that she had been laid off, along with all of the newspaper’s Middle East correspondents and editors. “Hard to understand the logic,” she wrote.\n\nIn the immediate future, Murray said, the Post would concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness and impact, and resonate with readers, including politics, national affairs and security. Even during its recent troubles, the Post has been notably aggressive in coverage of Trump’s changes to the federal workforce.\n\nThe company’s structure is rooted in a different era, when the Post was a dominant print product, Murray said in his note to staff members. In areas such as video, the outlet hasn’t kept up with consumer habits, he said.\n\n“Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”\n\nWhile there are business areas that need to be addressed, Baron pointed a finger of blame at Bezos — for a “gutless” order to kill a presidential endorsement and for remaking an editorial page that stands out only for “moral infirmity” and “sickening” efforts to curry favor with Trump.\n\n“Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,” Baron wrote. “In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.”\n\nBaron said he was grateful for Bezos’ support when he was editor, noting that the Amazon founder came under brutal pressure from Trump during the president’s first term.\n\n“He spoke forcefully and eloquently of a free press and The Post’s mission, demonstrating his commitment in concrete terms,” Baron wrote. “He often declared that The Post’s success would be among the proudest achievements of his life. I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.”\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

    "fullText": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is conducting widespread layoffs.\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray wrote in a Wednesday memo that the \"substantial newsroom reductions\" would impact \"nearly all news departments.\"\n\nThe layoffs impacted hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nMurray told staff on a Wednesday morning call that the cuts were part of a strategic reset, according to an audio recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMurray said the changes included \"closing the sports department in its current form.\"\n\n\"We plan to retain several reporters to join features and cover sports as a cultural and societal phenomenon, as well as several folks to staff the print sports section,\" he added.\n\nMurray said impacted teams included audio and journalists who cover books, the DC metro area, and foreign affairs.\n\n\"A few products will be discontinued — among the most significant, we will be closing the book section and will be suspending the Post Reports podcast,\" Murray said.\n\nThe publication's San Francisco bureau was also heavily hit, one Post insider said.\n\nIn his memo, Murray wrote that for the immediate future, the paper would concentrate on \"areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers.\"\n\n\"These layoffs are not inevitable,\" the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. \"A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach, and its future.\"\n\nFormer executive editor Martin Baron wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"there were acute business problems that had to be addressed\" during \"a period of head-spinning change in media consumption.\" Baron added that the \"Post's challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nDonald Graham, the Post's former publisher, wrote in a Facebook post that he was saddened by the loss of \"so many excellent reporters and editors\" and that he would \"have to learn a new way to read the paper,\" as he had \"started with the sports page since the late 1940's.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nThis new round of layoffs follows a series of recent shake-ups at the 148-year-old newspaper.\n\nEarly last year, the company told its opinions desk that columnists should refocus their coverage to two pillars: \"personal liberties\" and \"free markets.\"\n\nIn March, the Post reorganized its newsroom in a push to shift away from \"commodity news.\" It then offered buy-outs to staffers in May.\n\nLast year's personnel shifts arrived shortly after the Washington Post came under fire from some readers for its decision to skip endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, breaking from a 35-year tradition. Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump.\n\nOver 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were \"deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave.\"\n\nThe Post's staff reductions arrive at a challenging moment for the media industry.\n\nSome brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.\n\nThe New York Times, long seen as the 800-pound gorilla in the newspaper business, saw its shares sink about 14% on Monday as investors fretted about increased costs.",

Its consistency was reflected in the latest edition of the USA TODAY Coaches Poll, released Tuesday.\n\nThe Tigers remained at No. 5 in this week's poll. The top stayed the same with UConn, UCLA, South Carolina and Texas going one through four. Vanderbilt, after suffering its second-consecutive loss this week, dropped two spots to No. 8. Louisville and Michigan each climbed to No. 6 and 7, respectively.\n\nLSU returned to the PMAC on January 26 for three straight home games last week. It defeated Florida, Arkansas and Alabama each by over 20 points. Sunday against Alabama, LSU exploded in the second half for a 40-point win. The Crimson Tide fell to No. 23 in the coaches poll.\n\nThis week, LSU has another chance to climb the rankings and boost its chances at getting a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament bracketology. It travels to Austin to take on the Longhorns on Thursday, then to Auburn for a Sunday afternoon tipoff.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Where LSU women's basketball ranks in latest USA TODAY Coaches Poll",

    "fullText": "It’s pretty safe the say that the general sentiment around college football is that Notre Dame will make its return to the College Football Playoff in 2026.\n\nThe Irish were left out of this year’s 12-team event, as many believed that they deserved to be in. After what we saw unfold, it was pretty safe to say that Notre Dame should have been in, as it very well could have won it all.\n\nAs for this coming season, CBS Sports Brad Crawford released his way-too-early CFP bracket projection, and he’s got the Irish as the No. 2 seed. Miami, one of Notre Dame’s opponents, takes the to spot, so it seems like whoever loses that game finds their footing once again. Texas and Indiana round out his top-4.\n\nIn this scenario, the Irish would take on the winner of the 7 vs. 10 matchup as Crawford has Texas A&M and Oregon battling it out in the first round. Overall, it’s an interesting take, with four Big Ten and SEC teams, Texas Tech making it again and Memphis as the Group of 5 team.\n\nIt will be interesting to come back to this when the regular season is over, but it doesn’t seem like the worst field considering which teams are participating.\n\nWay-Too-Early College Football Playoff projection for the 2026 season, via @BCrawford247 👀\n\nWhat would you change?\n\n🔗 https://t.co/QnshRG871e pic.twitter.com/Dlc3J28sIW\n\n— CBS Sports College Football 🏈 (@CBSSportsCFB) February 3, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: What seed is Notre Dame in CBS Sports early 2026 CFP projection?",

    "fullText": "Winning the Super Bowl and hoisting the Lombardi trophy as confetti rains down has always been considered the stuff of dreams. It’s one of the most coveted championships in all of sports. It’s what children emulate when they organize backyard football games, and Tom Brady is doing his best to remind both Sam Darnold and Drake Maye of that ahead of their respective debuts at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGiven the fact that he’s both won and lost more Super Bowls than most players will ever sniff throughout their careers, it’s safe to say that there’s no better person to humor before venturing into the gridiron’s grandest game than the former New England Patriot. Although it’s just as important to remember that, while confidence and encouragement are key, the hardcold truth is that not everybody can be Brady.\n\n“The reality is that the best team, in a one-game series, doesn’t always win,”he noted to Colin Cowherd during his most recent interview. “In football, you really only have one chance to get it right. That’s the challenge. You could have an off day,” he added.\n\nIn highlighting the Los Angeles Rams’ botched punt against the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, Brady suggested that it doesn’t take much to give your opponent “all of the momentum,” and that those moments happen incredibly fast. “That’s how finicky the game is,” he suggested.\n\nWhile it may be a bit funny to hear the most successful signal caller in NFL history refer to his former profession as being “finicky,” it’s also a testament to just how much the Super Bowl means to players. In other words, those being the ones of Brady’s former Super Bowl rival, the star tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce, “Losing a Super Bowl will never make you want to go back and win one.”\n\nIf anything, knowing that you only get one shot at cementing your name in the analogs of American sporting culture makes things that much harder. “That’s why I always think basketball, baseball, a seven-game series, does identify the best team, because you get seven chances to get it right,” Brady suggests.\n\nEven if this eventually proves to be neither Darnold nor Maye’s last Super Bowl appearance, both men are well aware that they won’t get a second opportunity at winning their championship debut. Throw in the fact that both teams feature a top-five defense from a points allowed perspective, and it’s safe to say that both of these quarterbacks know that their margin for error on Sunday will be painfully slim.\n\nThen again, that’s yet another one of the many things that make the Super Bowl the biggest game of the year, and we simply wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nThe post “You Could Have an Off Day”: Tom Brady Warns Sam Darnold and Drake Maye Ahead of Super Bowl 2015 Rematch appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Disney's next CEO often sports a similar look to that of longtime leader Bob Iger. Experts weigh in on the pros and cons of dressing like your boss.",
    "fullText": "Disney's new CEO is sending a wink with his wardrobe, whether he means to or not.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, who takes the helm of the Mouse House next month, has drawn attention for dressing much like his soon-to-be predecessor, Bob Iger. Both men regularly don sweaters over collared shirts and have a penchant for jackets paired with white dress shirts. At a celebration for Disney's 70th Anniversary last year, the pair sported button-downs and dark slacks.\n\nWhile D'Amaro may just have a natural affinity for the same kind of attire that Iger sports, leadership experts say the similar look projects continuity to Disney's stakeholders. The familiarity may resonate at Disney, where Iger has led the company on and off for nearly two decades — though it raises a question of whether the rest of us should dress like the leaders we hope to one day succeed.\n\n\"You want to avoid looking like a carbon copy of the person,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International in Chicago. \"But there are elements that you want to keep if you can.\"\n\nThose elements should be modest, akin to how Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn't deviate too far from the black turtleneck and jeans his predecessor Steve Jobs regularly wore, suggested Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\nA few years ago, she said a client of hers from a Fortune 200 retailer went overboard by wearing the same distinctive jewelry as his boss. When she met with his peers for feedback on his performance, several described him as a copycat.\n\n\"It really hurt him,\" said Eggers. \"We coached him, and he eventually lost his jewelry.\"\n\nStill, there can be benefits to mimicking a higher-up's sense of fashion when done subtly, added Akubuiro. \"People have a tendency to like people who are more like them,\" he said.\n\nJust keep in mind the fuzzy warm feeling may be temporary.\n\n\"It's effective as a bridge maybe, but not as a destination,\" said Eggers. \"Eventually, leadership credibility has to stand on its own.\"\n\nD'Amaro, who started at Disney in 1998 as a Disneyland business planner, faces a challenging road ahead no matter what he wears. He's tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nA post shared by Robert Iger (@robertiger)\n\nWhile D'Amaro's fashion style is similar to Iger's, Akubuiro said the business-casual look has also made sense for his role as a park executive.\n\n\"This is kind of the uniform of someone walking around the parks, and so it gives him a very accessible feel,\" Akubuiro said. \"When you're making a change, that accessibility is something that actually brings people in and gives them some confidence.\"",

    "fullText": "Florida football finds itself right in the middle of the SEC pack in CBS Sports' power rankings for the 2026 season, a reflection of both uncertainty and quiet optimism surrounding the program entering Jon Sumrall's first year with the Orange and Blue.\n\nCBS Sports' Brandon Marcello slotted the Gators 10th in the SEC, placing Florida firmly in the conference's crowded middle tier following a chaotic transfer portal cycle and a full coaching reset.\n\nSumrall inherited a group that needed significant turnover, and that context matters. Florida lost key contributors to the portal, rebuilt large portions of its depth chart and is still sorting out several position battles heading into spring practice.\n\nCBS Sports pointed specifically to quarterback uncertainty, noting the compeition between Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo and Tramell Jones Jr. as a storyline that could ultimately swing Florida's ceiling one way or another.\n\nIt's simply too early to make definitive judgements. Spring practices, sumeer development and continued roster movement will reshape the conference landscape before fall arrives. For Florida, that means the current ranking by CBS Sports should be viewed more as a snapshot than a verdict.\n\nFor now, the Gators are positioned as a team with something to prove.\n\nHere is everything Marcello wrote about Florida and why he ranked them at No. 10 in the SEC power rankings.\n\n\"Jon Sumrall arrives with a major rebuild on his hands in Gainesville. The former Tulane and Troy coach has never won less than 10 games in a single season, but make sure to temper your expectations for Year 1 in the SEC. He had to overhaul a roster depleted by transfers, and we don't quite know what to expect with Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo battling Tramell Jones Jr. at quarterback.\n\n\"Still, Sumrall has the magic touch and knows how to build rosters. He also hired a top-tier staff. The Gators could be in the top half of the SEC this season, but we need to see more this spring and summer to better gauge the Gators.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.",

    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "fullText": "Florida basketball's brutal home loss to the Auburn Tigers two weeks ago is well in the rearview mirror after a pair of superlative performances — a 47-point beatdown of the South Carolina Gamecocks on the road, followed by an epic victory in the O'Dome against the Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nAs a result of the Gators' plus-70 margin of victory over the last two games, Todd Golden finds his team up five spots in the latest USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll at No. 16. That puts the Orange and Blue between the No. 15 Vanderbilt Commodores and No. 17 Virginia Cavaliers.\n\nThat kick in the pants at home appears to have given Florida a wake-up call, and now the Gators have put the rest of the SEC — and college basketball — on notice with nine games remaining on the regular-season schedule.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference once again has only four member schools in this week's poll, with Vanderbilt hanging onto their league-high No. 15 ranking. Florida is right behind them at No. 16, followed by the Arkansas Razorbacks, who fell five spots to No. 21, and the Texas A&M Aggies, who entered the rankings for the first time this season at No. 25.\n\nAlabama fell out of the top 25, and now follows the de facto No. 27 Tennessee Volunteers (55 votes) with 15 votes. The Kentucky Wildcats continue to cling to their nine votes while the Georgia Bulldogs earned a pair this week.\n\nIowa 52; Tennessee 50; UCF 15; Alabama 15; Villanova 13; Kentucky 9; North Carolina State 4; Utah State 2; Georgia 2; Saint Mary's 1\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida basketball USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll ranking up after win",

    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans are coming off a dismal season that led to a massive overhaul of the organization. Gone is Brian Callahan, and most of his staff, and the Titans have a new head coach in Robert Saleh. But that doesn’t mean that Tennessee didn't have some highlights.\n\nOne of those that marked Callahan’s last victory as Titans’ head coach, and much like the majority of his tenure, it was a fluke. Incredibly, this victory over the Arizona Cardinals was so improbable that it landed on CBS Sports' top 25 stories of the 2025 season.\n\n22. Tennessee Titans at Arizona Cardinals, Week 5: Cardinals, Jonathan Gannon, Kyler Murray, Emari Demercado collapse\n\nThis one requires us to go back quite a bit, but the butterfly effect is startling. The Cardinals, up 21-3 at home against the then-winless Tennessee Titans, suffered one of the wildest and most inexcusable collapses in recent memory en route to a 22-21 defeat.\n\nAlthough the Cardinals basically handed the Titans the victory, Tennessee looked competitive in the fourth quarter and made the plays necessary for the win, with Cam Ward making some big-time throws to give them a chance.\n\nThe Titans would go on to fire Callahan a couple of weeks later, with the win being the highlight of his final weeks in Nashville. But for that week, the football gods looked down on the Titans and gave them a memorable moment in the 2025 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Titans improbable victory over Cardinals one of the top stories in 2025",

    "fullText": "Rangers are interested in completing a deal for Southampton striker Cameron Archer before next Monday’s transfer deadline, according to Sky Sports journalist Mark McAdam. Rangers manager Danny Rohl wants attacking reinforcements at the Ibrox club and the Bears have been linked with Hansa Rostock striker Ryan Naderi. They have offered a new bid of around €3.6 million and a sell-on clause for him, but, the German club do not want to lose him. Rangers are now looking at other options to bring to the Ibrox club before the deadline.\n\nRangers also have Leeds United striker Joel Piroe on their radar, and Archer has emerged as the latest player to be linked with the Bears. The 24-year-old has four goals in 23 games for the Saints this term after notching five goals in 40 appearances last term. Archer has proven himself in the Championship, with 20 league goals to his name across three seasons in the division. The Aston Villa star had earlier loan spells at Preston North End and Middlesbrough and will bring enough experience to the Rangers attack having also featured for the likes of Sheffield United and Solihull Moors.\n\nSouthampton are hoping to secure a return to the Premier League at the end of the season and it remains to be seen whether they will be open to losing one of their key players. Rangers are desperate to get a deal for a new striker over the line before the deadline to boost their chances of pipping Hearts and Celtic to the Scottish Premiership title. They are just four points behind league leaders Hearts after 23 matches and having a stronger squad would come in handy in the coming games as the top-three battle for the top prize.",

    "fullText": "Sunday, February 8, will be a legendary day for sports fans because of Super Bowl LX, and the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games will be happening on the same day. But also for NBC and their streaming platform, Peacock, as they will be presenting both events live all day in 4K HDR. Via a press release, this will mark the first time a Super Bowl and Olympic Games will be presented in 4K HDR on the NBC broadcast network and the Peacock.\n\nIn a statement, Rick Cordella, President of NBC Sports, believes that because February will be a huge month for sports for the network, they feel obligated to deliver the best viewing experience possible.\n\n“When you’re about to present the biggest month in U.S. sports media history, you want to make sure you’re giving fans the best experience possible – so that’s exactly what we have planned on NBC and Peacock for Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, and NBA All-Star Weekend,” said Cordella. “Building on NBC Sports’ long-standing commitment to innovation across all platforms, we’ll be celebrating the action on the field, slopes, and court with our signature storytelling, state-of-the-art production, and dynamic streaming features that together bring these incredible sporting events to life for audiences at home.”\n\nThe platform will be presenting other innovations with their Olympic coverage by expanding their Multiview feature to mobile, which activates a four-box vertical display that showcases the top four events at any given time. Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming, states Peacock leads the industry in preesnting high profile events due to their infrastructure.\n\n“Peacock is the first streamer to deliver major live sports at this scale, seamlessly presenting many simultaneous events, with millions of people coming to the platform at once, over several days,” said Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming. “This impressive performance is possible because of Peacock’s industry-leading infrastructure that supports unmatched reliability, especially under peak demand.”\n\nPeacock’s February doesn’t stop with the Olympics and the Super Bowl, as for the first time in over 20 years, NBC will produce NBA All-Star Weekend onsite in Los Angeles.",

    "fullText": "Eddie Hall has found himself in the ring with two influencers again, this time in another unusual 2 vs 1 boxing match.\n\nHall, who made his name as a Strongman competitor, has spent the last few years exploring different combat sports, including arm wrestling and boxing.\n\nThis past year, he finally stepped into an MMA cage, picking up a controversial win over Mariusz Pudzianowski after dedicating years to training for the sport.\n\nSeveral months on from that fight, Hall’s latest move sees him back in another strange setup.\n\nFollowing his quick success in MMA, it seemed inevitable that the 38-year-old would continue in the sport, and would potentially take on former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, who continues to look for a fight.\n\nHowever, since then, there hasn’t been much news about Hall’s next move in combat sports. But he’s still finding ways to stay active and grab attention with some unusual ventures.\n\nJust recently, a video made the rounds on social media showing Hall stepping into another two vs one boxing match against a pair of influencers.\n\nThis wasn’t new territory for Hall. Back in 2024, he knocked out two featherweights at once during what many called a ‘freak fight’.\n\nBut this latest fight didn’t go as smoothly as that one did. One of his opponents was Dean Alex (Dean.dodd online), who regularly takes on odd challenges set by his 750,000 followers.\n\nThe other was Kristen Hanby, whose prank videos have built him an audience of 8.2 million people online.\n\nDuring the fight, Dodd took several knockdowns from Hall but also managed to land a few clean shots himself. Fortunately for both Dodd and Hanby, it was all light-hearted sparring rather than anything meant to cause real harm.\n\nIt’s looking more and more likely that Hall will be back in the MMA cage before the end of the year.\n\nHowever, with influencer boxing on the rise, there’s also a chance his next appearance could come back inside the ring rather than under MMA rules.",

    "fullText": "Grassroots sports groups across the West Midlands have welcomed government funding to help improve their facilities.\n\nLast year, 991 projects across the UK received money through the Multi-Sport Grassroots Facilities Programme to improve things like floodlights, goalposts and all-weather pitches.\n\nA new round of funding has now opened and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has invited community organisations to apply for a share of an £85m grant.\n\nFor football groups in Herefordshire and Warwickshire, the funds they were previously awarded had a massive impact on the children they support.\n\nIn total, clubs in Coventry and Warwickshire received more than £310,000 to upgrade their facilities.\n\nThe funding ranged from just under £250,000 for new changing rooms at Racing Club Warwick, to just over £1,000 for Upper Lighthorne Football Club for new goalposts.\n\nNuneaton-based Camp Hill Educational Sports and Social, better known as Chess FC, was awarded £6,017 to buy portable floodlights for their training pitches at Hill Top Playing Fields in Arley.\n\nClub chairperson Ian Andrew said it meant their eight junior teams, including an under-15 girls side, could train anywhere on the surface at night and in all weathers.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"They love coming along in the evening. It's pitch black and they've got the chance to run around and feel like professional footballers playing under lights.\"\n\nRacing Club Warwick received just under £250,000 to build new changing rooms at their Townsend Meadow ground.\n\nClub chairman Gary Vella said: \"When you've got a 3G pitch and you've got game after game, particularly for juniors, you need changing facilities. The women's game, disability football, all need their own changing areas, so this will help push us on.\"\n\nNearly £60,000 was given to 16 clubs across Herefordshire and Worcestershire and the DCMS said the money was aimed at giving families affordable ways to stay healthy.\n\nDavid Pembridge, from Wessington Juniors FC in Hereford, said: \"Throughout Herefordshire there's a massive shortage of indoor facilities.\n\n\"It's very costly so any time that you're hiring indoor facilities, which could be anything from £50 an hour, when you've got 11 teams, that quickly racks up to thousands and thousands which makes it less affordable for parents.\"\n\nThe group was awarded a grant to provide portable floodlights\n\nHe added: \"Every winter since we have been able to continue training outside in almost all weathers, when the clocks change it doesn't mean football stops it means that we can carry on and the children still get their weekly fix of football.\"\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"This is sport delivering for the nation. Every pound we invest in grassroots facilities is a pound that takes pressure off our NHS, supports mental and physical health, and opens doors for new community members to benefit from sport - like women and girls who've been shut out for too long.\"\n\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.\n\nEngland inspire women footballers of the future\n\nFoundation to increase free football for adults\n\nGrassroots football teams get government funding\n\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport",

    "fullText": "Wonder what Caitlin Clark thinks about the confusion surrounding Austin Reaves' imminent return to the Lakers lineup? Or whether Jeanie Buss has turned on LeBron James? Or if she has nothing but praise for Luka Doncic?\n\nTune in to the Lakers' matchup against the New York Knicks on the NBC Sports debut of “Basketball Night in America” on Sunday night to find out. Clark, the uber-popular WNBA star, will serve an analyst on the pregame show, beginning at 3 p.m. PT, one hour before tipoff.\n\nShould Reaves return Friday or Sunday after missing a month with a left calf strain, it would mark only the seventh time the guard has played together with James and Doncic. That might be the first topic addressed by Clark, who will join the studio team of Maria Taylor and three former NBA stars: Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady.\n\nExpectations that Reaves would take the floor Wednesday in a nationally televised game against the Cleveland Cavaliers were heightened Tuesday when ESPN insider Shams Charania posted on X that the Lakers guard would be “available to return to the lineup on Wednesday.”\n\nA few moments later, however, the post was deleted with no explanation and the Lakers' injury report lists Reaves as out.\n\nClark might stick to lauding Doncic, considering that the superstar NBA guard complimented her game in 2024, saying \"that’s the women’s Steph Curry. She can shoot it better than me.”\n\nClark, who attended Iowa, is the all-time leading scorer in NCAA history. In two seasons with the Indiana Fever, she was named WNBA Rookie of the Year and is a two-time All-Star despite missing much of the 2025 season with a severe groin injury.\n\n“Caitlin is one of the most captivating players and dynamic scorers in basketball,” NBC Sports Executive Producer Sam Flood said in a statement. “We’re excited to have Caitlin join Hall of Famers Melo, Vince, Tracy and Reggie in New York for the launch of Sunday Night Basketball.”\n\nThe Lakers-Knicks game will begin a doubleheader that also includes the Oklahoma City Thunder facing the Denver Nuggets.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

TV shows and movies follow story beats, meaning you can usually get a sense for where things are heading, but sports do not work that way. The totally unexpected can, and does, frequently occur—and that's the reason people keep tuning in, whether their team is dominating or an underdog.\n\nSometimes, though, you can't catch the game live, but still want a bit of that feeling. That's why leagues offer extended highlights, featuring all the key moments, complete with the commentary from the broadcast. These can feel almost like watching the full game, and I love catching up with them the next day alongside my morning coffee. The problem: you'll typically find those videos on sites full of spoilers about who won, whether that's via a scoreboard at the top of the site or headlines blaring the results. If you're hoping for even a fraction of the fun of watching sports live, that's a problem.\n\nDon't Tell Me The Score is your solution. This simple website offers highlights for NFL, NHL, MLB, and NBA games, with no scores or spoilers of any kind. The site interface shows only a bunch of icons representing all upcoming and recent games. Color logos means there are highlights are already available, and you can click or tap to start watching.\n\nThis is my favorite way to catch up on games I missed. The videos, which are sourced from the league's official YouTube channels, tend to be a little over 10 minutes, meaning you'll see the highs and lows, but it won't take up hours of your day, and you won't know who won going in (provided you've also taken care to avoid spoilers via the TV, newspapers, social media, push notifications, or ill-timed texts from friends).\n\nThis tends to work really well, with one big hiccup: NFL videos can't be watched on the site itself, as the NFL prevents their highlights from being embedded on other sites. This means you'll need to click a link to watch the highlights on YouTube's website. This is a little annoying, but the YouTube pages usually don't include spoilers either, as long as you steer clear of the comments.\n\nI wish more leagues were supported—soccer highlights aren't offered at all, for example, and neither are the increasingly popular women's leagues. But if you're a fan of one of the \"big four\" North American sports, like watching highlights, and don't want to get spoiled first, Don't Tell Me The Score is worth adding to your daily rotation.",

That was Les Rennais wish in any case. Even in the event of an agreement being reached with another club, they had set retaining Jacquet on loan until the end of the season as one of the terms that would have to be agreed.\n\nHis future remains up in the air. But, as per Sky Sports, a preference has emerged. It is understood that Jacquet favours a move to Stamford Bridge. That is despite the interest expressed by other clubs.

    "fullText": "The United Center in Chicago will become the first major U.S. sports venue to offer THC-infused drinks during events, reflecting a growing demand for non-alcoholic alternatives.\n\nThe arena — home to the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks — announced the move on Tuesday in a joint statement with RYTHM, a local beverage company.\n\nThe company inked a multi-year deal with the stadium to sell its drink, called Señorita, which contains hemp-derived THC, to guests 21 and older at live events, including concerts. The beverages, however, will not be available at sporting events due to league regulations.\n\n\"We are excited to introduce Señorita and RYTHM to the live entertainment space,” Joe Myhra, the chief operating officer at United Center, said in the release. “As we continue to evolve offerings for our guests, RYTHM’s Chicago roots made its beverage line a natural fit for the United Center experience.”\n\nSeñorita, which includes five milligrams of THC per drink, will become available for purchase at the stadium beginning in February.\n\n“Bringing Señorita and RYTHM to the United Center reflects a simple truth: consumers want non-alcoholic options, and leading venues are responding,” Ben Kovler, the CEO of RYTHM, said in the release.\n\n“The United Center is one of the world’s premier venues and continues to set the standard for live entertainment with the introduction of these modern, responsible options,” he added.\n\nThe announcement comes as demand for alcoholic beverages has fallen to a record low in the U.S., according to an August Gallup poll. In the survey, 54 percent of Americans reported consuming alcohol, marking the lowest share since 1939. The trend is largely driven by younger adults.\n\nAt the same time, young Americans are increasingly unwinding with weed drinks.\n\nIn an August poll by Drug Rehab USA, 66 percent of Gen Z and Millennial respondents said they had tried alternatives to alcohol in the past six months, with 24 percent saying they had “at least partially” substituted alcohol with non-alcoholic or cannabis-infused drinks.",

    "fullText": "Now nearly a full month into 2026, college basketball teams are into the thick of their conference schedules. UNC, which secured a huge road upset of rival Virginia on Saturday, is in the top half of what's shaping up to be a deep ACC.\n\nNorth Carolina (16-4, 4-3 ACC) rolled through non-conference play with a 12-1 record, securing wins against fellow blue bloods Kansas and Kentucky. The Tar Heels hit an impasse to begin ACC play, losing their first three conference road games, but squeaked by Wake Forest at home and dominated Notre Dame.\n\nUNC has plenty more season ahead, with a third-straight NCAA Tournament appearance increasingly likely. In USA TODAY Sports' January 26 bracketology, released earlier Tuesday, North Carolina is a 5-seed in the East Region.\n\nUSAT projects the Tar Heels facing 12-seeded Belmont in Tampa, Fla. Joining UNC and the Bruins are 4-seed, reigning national champion Florida and 2023 Final Four squad Florida Atlantic.\n\nNorth Carolina and Belmont, the latter a member of the Missouri Valley Conference, previously played in November 2013. If you attended that game at the Dean Dome, you likely still have memories of a painful upset etched in your mind.\n\nAfter dropping consecutive games at Stanford and Cal on their West Coast swing, the Tar Heels are now winners of two straight. Derek Dixon is a key in the starting lineup, Caleb Wilson remains a superstar and head coach Hubert Davis is now playing his best rotations.\n\nUNC has all the pieces to make a National Championship run. Can North Carolina continue to play at its current pace, rise through the ACC and be college basketball's last team standing in April?\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC basketball projected the East's 5 seed in USAT Sports bracketology",

    "fullText": "Independiente Santa Fe continues to add young talent to its sports project for the 2026 season. In recent hours, it was confirmed that Kilian Toscano, a 21-year-old midfielder, will join the \"Cardenal\" squad after reaching a loan agreement with Atlético Nacional. The young player, who is looking to establish himself in the capital, arrives with the mission of bringing balance and dynamism to the midfield of the team led by Pablo Peirano.\n\nDespite his young age, Toscano is no rookie in professional football. The midfielder already boasts 39 official matches, the vast majority of them wearing the verdolaga jersey, where he demonstrated his abilities in ball recovery and initiating play. Additionally, his talent led him to participate in several processes with the Colombia U-20 National Team during the Argentina 2023 World Cup cycle, although he ultimately was not included in the final squad for the global event.\n\nThis move represents the first change of scenery for Toscano, who completed his entire youth development in Medellín. For Santa Fe, the addition of the young player responds to the need to refresh the squad with promising players who are already familiar with the demands of big clubs. The footballer is expected to join training at the Tenjo facility immediately to compete for a spot in the starting eleven before the league begins.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "A sports nutritionist for NBA champs explains why athletes stop drinking water after 4 p.m. to optimize hydration and perform their best.",
    "fullText": "NBA champions don't have time for morning brain fog or an afternoon slump.\n\nTheir secret to staying sharp all day long: perfectly-timed water breaks, according to a top sports nutritionist.\n\nMatt Jones, who worked with the Boston Celtics during their 2024 NBA Championship-winning season and advises the supplement brand Cadence, said the pros have mastered the art of optimal hydration.\n\n\"Fueling intentionally is probably one of the biggest things we can take from the world of professional sport,\" he told Business Insider. \"Professional athletes are very good at repeating basic behaviors like hydrating, and it's those routines that allow them to perform to the best of their ability.\"\n\nIf you want to level up your hydration game, start paying attention to how much you drink and when, Jones recommends.\n\nAfter years of experience coaching elite athletes and military professionals, he has five key tips for getting enough water and electrolytes for better performance throughout the day.\n\nStaying hydrated makes a big difference to your brain and body in the office or on the basketball court, Jones said.\n\n\"It can impact your mood, your decision-making; it can impact the way you just go about your normal life,\" he said.\n\nResearch suggests that mild or moderate dehydration can impair reaction time and memory. Physically, being dehydrated can reduce strength and endurance, and make it more difficult to recover after exercise.\n\nJones uses a gold-standard test to see if his athletes need to drink more water. It can tell you if you're dehydrated based on three symptoms:\n\nEveryone's water needs are different, based on how much energy you use.\n\nJones said the gold standard recommendation is 1 milliliter to 1.5 milliliters per calorie of energy expenditure (in normal conditions). Two liters — or that eight cups of water a day you've probably heard about — makes sense for someone who burns 2,000 calories a day, but you may need more or less depending on your body size and activity level.\n\nSleeping is a superpower for athletes, and a simple tip helps them stay well-hydrated without too many overnight bathroom trips.\n\nJones said the solution for his athletes, including the Celtics, is to drink 80% of their fluids for the day before 4 p.m. so that their bodies have time to process all that liquid before bedtime.\n\nPlain water should be your first priority for hydration, but other drinks and even foods can count toward your daily total.\n\nFor instance, your morning brew can help keep you hydrated, since caffeinated drinks in moderation lead to a net gain in fluid. Just steer clear of artificially sweetened or sugary beverages, too much of which can cause health issues like chronic inflammation over time.\n\nHydrating foods such as fruits and veggies also provide electrolytes to regulate the fluids in your body.\n\nSodium, or salt, is a key electrolyte, but you probably get enough in your diet already. Instead, Jones said to focus on potassium to offset the side effects of too much sodium, such as high blood pressure.\n\nGood sources of potassium include bananas, avocados, coconut water, pomegranate, and watermelon.\n\nDehydration can sneak up on you before you realize it, especially if you're sweating a lot.\n\n\"During intense exercise, particularly in warm environments, thirst is not a good indicator of hydration status,\" Jones said. \"People are often chasing their tails a little bit.\"\n\nYou can calculate your sweat rate to estimate just how much water you need to replace during exercise, like Jones does with the pros.\n\nPrevent a dip in performance by drinking water at regular intervals.\n\n\"The first priority as soon as your big toe hits planet earth in the morning is to rehydrate,\" Jones said.",

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

    "fullText": "Arsenal icon Patrick Vieira believes one Manchester United player is reaping the rewards of Michael Carrick’s tactics more than Bryan Mbeumo, especially after Sunday’s result.\n\nDuring his punditry duties for Sky Sports, Patrick Vieira watched as his former club Arsenal fell to Manchester United in a 3-2 defeat at the Emirates.\n\nMichael Carrick has now overseen impressive back-to-back Premier League wins over top-two sides Arsenal and Manchester City since taking charge.\n\nBryan Mbeumo was once again trusted to lead the line for Man Utd under Carrick’s system, and the summer signing from Brentford delivered another strong performance.\n\nMbeumo pulled Man Utd level before half-time when he capitalised on a costly mistake from Arsenal’s Martin Zubimendi.\n\nAfter Bryan Mbeumo pulled Manchester United level, Patrick Dorgu put them in front early in the second half. It was a well-taken goal that gave United some momentum coming out of the break.\n\nMikel Merino equalised for Arsenal late on, just when it looked like United might hold on. But even with time running out, there was still more to come.\n\nMatheus Cunha replaced Bryan Mbeumo in the second half and the 26-year-old Brazilian forward scored the winner for Man Utd in Sunday evening’s result.\n\nFollowing Manchester United’s 2-0 victory against Manchester City at Old Trafford last week, Vieira believed that Carrick and his colleagues had finally “answered” the significant questions surrounding them.\n\n“There were still big questions after City,” he told Sky Sports.\n\n“They answered them so well. They are back on track. There’s still a long way to go. Wins against City and Arsenal is so good for confidence.”\n\nPlaying in the No 10 role behind Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes featured there for the second straight Premier League match under interim boss Carrick.\n\nThe Manchester United captain’s performances against both City and Arsenal have drawn high praise from Vieira.\n\n“The system allowed them to express themselves,” the Frenchman stated.\n\n“I think the 4-2-3-1 allowed Fernandes to be a little bit more free on the pitch, create situations, score goals.\n\n“You can see the pictures – the smile is back on the face of the United players.”\n\nUnder Ruben Amorim last season, Fernandes often played deeper before the manager was dismissed earlier this month. The coaching change has clearly had an impact on his play.",

    "description": "The Sky Sports pundit praised Carrick’s influence on the club after wins over Man City and Arsenal but believes they need a ‘bigger’ manager",
    "fullText": "Roy Keane shut down suggestions that Michael Carrick be given the role of Manchester United manager on a permanent basis following the 3-2 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nCarrick took over from the sacked Ruben Amorim on a contract until the end of the current suggestion with the executives at Old Trafford currently searching for a new manager to hire permanently.\n\nIn his first game in charge Carrick orchestrated a 2-0 derby win over Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City before masterminding United’s victory over the league leaders.\n\nKeane was quick to praise the impact Carrick and his staff have had on the players and results but revealed that his preference for the next manager be someone “bigger and better” than Carrick.\n\nAsked for his opinion on the result and the performance from Manchester United, Keane echoed the words of Harry Maguire who was awarded the player of the match trophy.\n\n“Harry makes a good point, they’ve got a lot of their players back now, it’s a full group, they’ve got full weeks together and there’s no other distractions,” Keane replied. “They can focus on the league form and they’re producing.\n\n“But, as we know you win one, two games for Man Utd, fantastic. Particularly to beat City, and come to Arsenal. I felt United would get a result today, I was thinking a draw but I felt United would turn up.\n\n“They’ve got enough quality players and they’ve got momentum into their season and all of a sudden you’re thinking it’s a great chance for top four. If they play with that confidence and belief, you give the manager and the staff credit.”\n\nKeane was then pressed by fellow Sky Sports pundit Micah Richards on whether Manchester United should hire Carrick on a permanent basis already given he has led the team to wins against first and second in the league.\n\n“The job? You’re being silly now,” Keane responded. “No, he’s had two great performances but anybody can win two games. It’s what he does until the end of the season.\n\n“Even if they do get into fourth I still wouldn’t be convinced he’s the man for the job. Absolutely not. I still think they need a bigger and better manager.\n\n“But, he’s got the opportunity, what a chance it is for him and, do you know what, he’s taking it so fair play to him.”",

    "fullText": "Random thoughts while waiting on the release of the new Super Bowl commercials.\n\nThe sight of Cubs star Pete-Crow Armstrong and Bears star Caleb Williams hanging out together at the Blackhawks and Bulls games was a nice way to portray Chicago as the biggest small town in America. Los Angeles has its Hollywood culture and New York is the media center of the world, but nowhere are the local sports stars as big a deal as they are in Chicago.\n\nIt’s nothing new, of course. Chicago’s stars have always supported each other. When the Bears played at Wrigley Field, Bobby Hull was a season ticket holder, and Billy Williams used to get tickets for games from Bears receiver Dick Gordon.\n\nThe budding bromance of Crow-Armstrong and Williams should last a long time, or at least until the Cubs and Bears sign them to massive deals.\n\nOne of the primary requisites of the job of commissioner of a major sports league should be the ability to project strength. But the commissioners of the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball are all weaklings, as evidenced by a report from The Athletic that Roger Goodell, Adam Silver, Gary Bettman and Rob Manfred will meet with President Donald Trump to help promote America 250, a celebration of the country’s 250th birthday.\n\nWhile Trump’s jackboots instill fear in Minneapolis, Chicago and other American cities, and he embarrasses the country on the international stage, these four pretend leaders will be posing for photo-ops in the Oval Office and pretending all is right with the country. None of them has the courage to speak out against what’s happening in America.\n\nLucky for them, they’re only beholden to the billionaire owners of their league’s teams, not the average fans who support their respective sports.\n\nESPN’s Pat McAfee has always appealed to the lowest common denominator, so it’s no surprise the clueless commentator is taking on unidentified media members who point out his lame frat boy act, calling them “fat … lazy nerds” on his TV show.\n\nMcAfee also tweeted that sports journalists “hate what sports are for people (happiness). They hate what sports are for society (unifier) … they’re political journalists by nature who’ve preyed on sports because they saw it as an easier path to ‘make it.’ Their days are numbered … my show being broadcasted on ESPN 10 hours a week with ZERO creative say from any ‘journalism school’ puppets is living proof of that.”\n\nActually, the audience of McAfee’s show is relatively tiny, or else it would be in a better time slot than in the early afternoon, when everyone else is working. He’s already wearing thin on college football fans, and sooner or later the ratings will slide and ESPN will pull the plug and send him off to UFC analysis, where he belongs.\n\nIllinois is having another stellar season, thanks to a deep team led by freshman Keaton Wagler. The 11th-ranked Illini are 17-3 after Saturday’s 88-82 road win over Purdue and in contention for the Big Ten title.\n\nAnd when the Illini are winning, coach Brad Underwood is at his most ornery, as when he recently sparred with an Illinois reporter who praised Tomislav Ivišić for a good game against Northwestern despite what he called an “up-and-down season.”\n\n“You guys say he’s been up and down,” Underwood shot back. “I just say his role changed. You guys create more damn narratives that are full of (bleep). That’s what he does. That’s why he’s been on draft boards. He’s big and can shoot the cover off of it. … No one has ever doubted Tommy.”\n\nLove him or hate him, Underwood is never afraid to speak his mind.\n\nKudos to White Sox general manager Chris Getz for immediately spending the $20 million he saved by dumping Luis Robert Jr.’s contract, signing reliever Seranthony Dominguez to a two-year, $20 million deal. Now maybe he can move Grant Taylor into the rotation where he belongs.\n\nMike Berman was a professional and a hardworking sports reporter willing to work long hours at NBC-5. A Glenbrook North alumnus who grew up rooting for Chicago teams, he did his job for 10 years without calling attention to himself. His work spoke for itself.\n\nBerman, who was let go by the station last week, deserved a better fate. Hopefully he winds up on another local station that will appreciate his work ethic.\n\nTerry Boers, who died Friday at age 75, was remembered by most as a radio host and an original member of The Score. But he was also a great newspaperman. Boers and I competed on the Illini basketball beat for one season back in the early 1990s, when he was still at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was as good a beat writer as there was and handed me my lunch on many occasions.\n\nBoers eventually found his way to radio, where he could put his brash personality into his job. He became a legend at WSCR-AM 670, along with the other originals such as Mike North, Tom Shaer and Dan McNeil. There will never be another quite like Boers, which is why his death has brought so many tributes from colleagues.\n\nCubs manager Craig Counsell is a Green Bay Packers fan, but he assured the media he is not a Bears hater. “Look, I grew up a Packers fan for sure,” he said before the Cubs Convention. “The Bears have struggled for a while, and so when a team hasn’t done well for a whole and starts to do well, you see what it does to a city. You feel it. That part of me knows what it’s doing for the city, and you root for that a little bit.”\n\nAsked who would be booed \n\nIt’s a tough call, but my guess is Counsell is still Public Enemy No. 1 among cheeseheads.",

    "fullText": "This Monday, January 26 at 9 p.m., Girona returns to Montilivi to host Getafe in the match of the 21st round of the EA Sports League. The team has started the second half of the season in the best possible way with an away victory against Espanyol. This result means that Michel's team has achieved three consecutive victories - the best streak of the season - against Espanyol, Osasuna, and Mallorca. This places them in eleventh place with 24 points. At the moment, the standings are very tight with three other teams having the same points: Elche, Real Sociedad, and Athletic Club; two with 22, Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, and three with 21, Sevilla, Mallorca, and Getafe.\n\nGetafe CF, on the other hand, arrives at Montilivi with a trajectory marked by rather negative results in the last league matches. In the most recent games, the Madrid team recorded a 1-0 loss to Valencia and a 2-1 defeat against Real Sociedad, and drew 1-1 with Rayo Vallecano. Additionally, before the Christmas break, Getafe suffered a 4-0 loss to Betis and a 3-1 defeat against Burgos in the Copa del Rey.\n\nAs for the head-to-head history between Girona and Getafe, the record shows a closely contested rivalry in recent history. In the first meeting of this same season, Getafe won 2-1 at the Coliseum, a match in which the Madrid team took the lead with goals from Mario Martín and Borja Mayoral, while Cristhian Stuani reduced the deficit from the penalty spot at the end of the game. Looking at a broader perspective, in a total of 17 historical encounters between both teams, Girona has achieved 6 victories, Getafe 7, and 4 matches have ended in a draw, reflecting the competitive balance that these matches usually display.",

The team said goodbye Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park, honoring Press before its first game of 2026, a 6-0 win over Paraguay.\n\nIn between, Press played 154 more times for the U.S., winning two World Cups, an Olympic bronze medal and scoring 62 more goals, retiring as the ninth-leading scorer in team history.\n\nBut those are just numbers because as good as Press was, she wants to be remembered for the legacy she left behind, for the barriers she broke, for the inspiration she continues to provide for players who followed her to the national team.\n\n“Well, it's sort of the point, right?” she said ahead of Saturday’s farewell ceremony before a crowd of 19,397. “I feel really lucky that I had the opportunity to play long enough to overlap with some of these young players and be able to see the growth of the game, how far it's come, and be able to see what the next generation of player feels like.\n\n“It's different, and it's going to take different things for people to have success.”\n\nTalk about following in Press’ footsteps: The first score Saturday came from Reilyn Turner of the Portland Thorns, like Press a Southern California native who scored her first U.S. goal on a left-footed shot in the first half of her international debut. The second goal, less than two minutes into the second half, came from Kansas City’s Ally Sentnor.\n\nAnd that opened the floodgates, with the U.S. getting an own goal from Paraguay’s Fiorella Martínez followed by scores from Trinity Rodman — who was celebrating the three-year contract, reported to be worth a record $6 million, she signed Thursday with the Washington Spirit — a second goal from Sentnor and another from Emma Sears.\n\nPress scored her final international goal in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Ten months later, playing with Angel City FC in the NWSL, she shredded the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee, an injury that required four surgeries and nearly 25 months to repair. She never played another game for the national team and made just three more starts for Angel City before announcing her retirement last October.\n\nThat, Press said, will continue to provide her with a link to the game.\n\n“We're so integrated into the women's sports ecosystem, through podcasts, through merchandise and through the women's soccer community,” she said. “I have spent a lot of time looking at the business of women's sports and how we need to reimagine it.\n\n“In a dream world, I'd be able to continue to influence the ecosystem as a businessperson.”\n\nPress got her start in soccer in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, about a dozen miles from where her career officially ended Saturday in Carson. As a preschooler she played with older kids in co-ed league because one team was short a girl.\n\n“I didn’t touch the ball once,” she remembered years later. “I picked daisies and waved to my mom.”\n\nShe went on to win two CIF Southern Section titles at the Chadwick School and a Hermann Trophy at Stanford before starting a club career that took her to eight teams in three countries. With the national team she went to three Olympics, won World Cups and played a key role in the landmark lawsuit against U.S. Soccer that ended with the women earning equal pay with the men’s team.\n\nIt’s a résumé that already is challenging the next generation of national team players.\n\n“I admired her for a long time,” said Seattle Reign winger Maddie Dahlien, 21, who made her national team debut Saturday. “She made a name for herself a little later. You never know when your opportunity will be. So make the most of it when it comes.”\n\nU.S. coach Emma Hayes never had a chance to work directly with Press, though she wanted to bring her overseas to Chelsea FC when Hayes managed there and Press was looking to move to the Women’s Super League.\n\n“I’ve always admired her and thought what a fantastic football player she is. Very different to what was a more traditional American forward at the time,” Hayes said. “What she’s achieved, as well-traveled as she is, what an honor to be coaching on the day she gets celebrated in her hometown.”\n\nFor Press, it was a celebration that marked the transition from one stage of life to the next. And, she acknowledged, there are a few things she’s going to miss.\n\n“I am so sad that I don't play soccer anymore,” she said. “I miss training. I miss being on a team, being around young people. I miss being outside every day. I miss the grass. I miss the discipline and ritual that football brings to my life.\"\n\n“I like to talk about all the things that I miss, because I think ‘I'm retired. It's easy now.’ No. I had the best job in the world. And it's an irreplaceable job.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Heading into Week 18, Aaron Rodgers was nothing if not pragmatically optimistic.\n\nThe days on his Pittsburgh Steelers contract were dwindling. The future of head coach Mike Tomlin was a subject of public debate. And the franchise he quarterbacked was cornered into a de facto playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens in the regular-season finale. Any direction you looked, there was something finite hanging in the balance. But in what registered in at least a mild surprise, Rodgers spoke to reporters like a man who didn’t see a definitive near-term conclusion to his football career … so long as he didn’t want it to end.\n\n“I’m thinking about this week, but obviously I’m 42 years old and I’m on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,” Rodgers told reporters. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. So that’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play.”\n\nRodgers gave a slight shrug and chuckled.\n\n“Not a lot of options, but — there will be options I would think. Maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.”\n\n[Get more Steelers news: Pittsburgh team feed]\n\nHe then punctuated the thought by opening the door to a return.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed this experience,” Rodgers said. “Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It’s really what I was hoping for, for this experience. It’s been even better than I was hoping.”\n\nA few days later, the Steelers would beat the Ravens and make the postseason, before getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Texans. All in all, it culminated in a season that felt like Rodgers, Tomlin and the Steelers squeezed about as much as they could have expected.\n\nThen Tomlin left, via a resignation that felt like a surprise to ownership. And maybe to Rodgers, too, given that any thought of his return seemed so strongly bound to whether Tomlin would continue to guide Pittsburgh. When that changed, logical speculation — and that’s all we’ve been left with thus far on the Rodgers front — was that a new head coach would mean a new quarterback. Whatever options were on the table for Rodgers, they appeared to have shrunk by one.\n\nThen came Saturday, when the Steelers went against their historical hiring template and locked in 62-year-old Mike McCarthy, a candidate who can fit more than one forward-looking ideology.  On one hand, McCarthy is a seasoned veteran coach who can come in and try to energize an aging roster that is still very much built to win now. On the other, he could be tasked with developing the franchise’s next young quarterback. Without a bridge starter currently on the roster, it will be difficult for McCarthy to achieve both of those responsibilities.\n\nUnless, of course, McCarthy can find a veteran who knows his system and can come in and help with both tasks. Maybe a quarterback who McCarthy previously helped develop into a star? One who already has spent a season in the Pittsburgh quarterback room with 24-year-old Will Howard, who showed promise in limited reps during his rookie preseason and has the support of the front office as a prospect worth some continued development?\n\nThat sounds like a fit for Rodgers. And perhaps the renewal of a 2026 option that appeared to be extinguished when Tomlin resigned.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean McCarthy was hired with any kind of specificity of luring Rodgers back for another season. While some of Pittsburgh’s players gave Rodgers high marks as a teammate in their exit interviews, the work to find the next long-term starting option is clearly near the top of the priorities for ownership and general manager Omar Khan. And that wouldn’t have changed even if Tomlin had remained. One way or another, 2026 was always going to be geared toward either figuring out if the next young quarterback is already on the roster (in the form of Howard) or if the Steelers liked any of their draft, trade or free-agency options.\n\nMcCarthy’s arrival won’t change that mindset. The real factors of change at the quarterback spot will instead be pressed against the options Pittsburgh has available. If McCarthy is a head coach Rodgers will play for, it gives Pittsburgh at least one more year of a bridge starter to either weigh Howard as a prospect, or find someone in the 2026 draft who is worthy of being selected and then groomed. And there’s certainly some deep-value intrigue over the coming draft class of quarterbacks.\n\nThe Steelers won’t have a shot at Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and their first-round draft pick at No. 21 overall might not be high enough to land Alabama’s Ty Simpson, either. But after that tandem, there are some interesting quarterbacks who could be seen as worthwhile projects with upside. Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss (if he can’t force another year of NCAA eligibility) will draw a significant amount of study from NFL teams. As will a quartet of others who were previously considered to be first-round picks — and potentially very high first-round picks — until hitting stumbles in their final seasons: LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier, Miami’s Carson Beck, Penn State’s Drew Allar and Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, among others.\n\nFor now — and we’ve yet to go through the draft sifting process, so take this with a grain of salt — only Mendoza cuts the figure as a Day 1 rookie starter. Simpson could round into that kind of prospect, or one who has a shot to earn a starting job during his rookie season. The rest? Most personnel opinions appear to be placing them on a developmental track to possibly get a shot with a year or more of work from further down the depth chart.\n\nIf any of those players are in the Steelers’ future, McCarthy’s hiring makes a lot of sense given his history with helping quarterbacks grow into starters. And it also makes sense that Rodgers would be a fit, so long as he continues to be in a year-to-year contract mindset and actually wants to play for McCarthy again.\n\nIn that latter vein, both McCarthy and Rodgers have said very nice things about each other in the least few years, each gaining the perspective of working with new people and in new places. Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real, with both having come to terms with their own mistakes and frustrations that ultimately played a part in McCarthy getting fired late in the 2018 season after coaching the Green Bay Packers for nearly 13 years.\n\nBut burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing. Even if Rodgers wants to play again and McCarthy would like to have him in 2026, the veteran quarterback doesn’t know what the rest of the league landscape will look like in even a few weeks. There’s a chance the Los Angeles Rams win a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford decides to pull a John Elway and retire. Should that happen, the Rams will still be very much in the middle of a Super Bowl window and not have an obvious starting quarterback on the roster. And then there is the Minnesota Vikings, a team Rodgers was very interested in playing for last offseason. They are looking for someone to come in and compete with J.J. McCarthy for the starting job next season.\n\nAdd the Steelers to that mix, and you have exactly what Rodgers was talking about when he focused his gaze on 2026. Not a lot of options — but certainly some interesting ones.",

    "fullText": "Most people dream about winning the lottery. But for one 29-year-old man, his $15 million windfall came with a side of guilt, entitlement, and a family-sized headache.\n\nIn a post shared on Reddit, the anonymous winner explained that his financial plans were anything but reckless. He didn't run off to buy yachts or sports cars. Instead, he wanted to take business and finance courses, manage his newfound wealth responsibly, and eventually give back through charitable work. What he didn't plan for? His parents demanding a full quarter of the winnings—roughly $3.75 million—because, in their words, \"we raised you.\"\n\nThe Reddit post made clear this wasn't a close-knit family cashing in on shared joy. The man described his upbringing as \"distant white middle class,\" saying he had moved an hour away from his \"oppressive mother and distant father.\" While he described his sisters as \"nice people,\" he noted they don't have a real relationship.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nDespite this, when he won the lottery, he offered to pay off his parents' mortgages and provide them a cash gift. But when they learned the full scope of his winnings, that wasn't enough. \"Once they found the total amount,\" he wrote, \"they expected a quarter of it.\"\n\nThe conversation escalated. When his mother said, \"we raised you,\" he couldn't help but remember the five-year stretch—from age 15 to 20—when his parents completely cut off contact. Though he didn't directly confront them with that memory, he now questions whether he owes them anything at all.\n\nMany Redditors agreed that his parents were being unreasonable, entitled, and opportunistic. One user summed it up sharply: \"You don't owe them s**t.\"\n\nAnother commenter laid out a detailed legal and financial checklist: hire a lawyer and financial adviser, draw up a will and living trust, create powers of attorney for medical and financial decisions, and install a home security system. They ended their comment with a blunt mantra: \"People get crazy with money.\"\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd they weren't alone in that warning. Multiple users emphasized the need for protection—not just from scammers or strangers, but from family members who might be willing to sue, manipulate, or guilt-trip to access the prize. One even suggested freezing the winnings in a trust for a year just to let emotions cool and see how people behave.\n\nStill, not everyone was entirely unsympathetic to the family's reaction. From a devil's advocate angle, some might say parents who supported their child for nearly two decades—through diapers, meals, and housing—might feel hurt or excluded if they're only offered a slice instead of a share.\n\nBut that perspective hinges on a relationship that doesn't seem to exist in this case. The man's post didn't reveal abuse or violence, but the emotional neglect—especially during his formative years—cast a long shadow. Five years of silence from his parents left a mark. And now, with millions on the table, old wounds are reopening under the glare of entitlement.\n\n\"I feel like I've been as generous as I can be,\" he said, noting he never explicitly said so to his parents, but assumed it would be clear. What stung most was that their reaction didn't reflect pride or joy—it reeked of resentment that they didn't get more.\n\nSee Also: Private-Market Real Estate Without the Crowdfunding Risk—Direct Access to Institutional-Grade Deals Managed by a $12B+ Real Estate Firm\n\nThe original poster has since emailed his parents to reiterate his offer and state firmly that nothing more would be coming. Whether they respond, and how, remains to be seen.\n\nIn a later update, he stressed that this situation wasn't about seeking revenge or proving a point. It was about maintaining boundaries and protecting the life he's worked hard to rebuild. \"I am not looking to be told how to spend my money or how to be vindictive,\" he wrote. \"They do love me, even if it's in their own sad way.\"\n\nAnd maybe that's the hardest part. Winning the lottery can change your bank account—but it doesn't fix broken relationships. The man walked away with $15 million, but in doing so, he discovered that family ties can fray under the weight of expectation. And in his case, no amount of money seems likely to stitch them back together.\n\nRead Next: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.
