    "fullText": "Dolphins (6-9) vs. Buccaneers (7-8), Sunday, 1 p.m., FOX\n\nLatest line: Buccaneers are favored by 5 1/2 points\n\nDave Hyde, Sports Columnist (Season record: 5-10): Buccaneers 27, Dolphins 24\n\nMaybe it’s as easy as Baker Mayfield vs Quinn Ewers. Like the Dolphins, Tampa Bay isn’t the team it wanted to be. But this game has playoff consequences for the Bucs, so there’s the difference.\n\nChris Perkins, Dolphins Columnist (Season record: 8-7): Buccaneers 24, Dolphins 14\n\nIt’s hard to predict a victory with Quinn Ewers at quarterback. Plus, the defense is coming off one of its worst performances and it won’t have safety Minkah Fitzpatrick again. Oh, yeah, the Bucs need to win to keep their playoff hopes alive, while the Dolphins have no playoff hopes.\n\nDavid Furones, Dolphins Writer (Season record: 7-8): Buccaneers 24, Dolphins 20\n\nIt’s a guessing game with which version of the Dolphins comes out. Quinn Ewers looked fine in his debut as a starter, but he didn’t get much help around him as the team collapsed in the third quarter against the Bengals last week. The Dolphins are playing for pride at this point, while the Buccaneers are still alive for an NFC South crown, so they need this game more and it might show on the field.\n\nKathy Laughlin, Sports Editor (Season record: 6-9): Buccaneers 27, Dolphins 17\n\nIt’s hard to see this one going Miami’s way after the dismal Bengals put such a hurt on the Dolphins last week. The reeling Buccaneers won’t even be thrown off by the hot temperatures at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nKeven Lerner, Assistant Sports Editor (Season record: 12-3): Buccaneers 27, Dolphins 17\n\nThe reeling Buccaneers have lost six of their last seven games, but still control their own playoff destiny. If they win their final two games against Miami and Carolina, they will win their fifth straight division title. But if they lose to the Dolphins and the Panthers beat the Seahawks this weekend, the Bucs will be eliminated. Facing elimination, I don’t see Tampa Bay losing to Miami. A loss also could cost coach Todd Bowles his job.\n\nSteve Svekis, Assistant Sports Editor (Season record: 7-8): Buccaneers 26, Dolphins 17\n\nThe Bucs are in a free fall, but are still alive, and desperate. While Baker Mayfield has been a shell of himself since injuring a shoulder against the Rams, Tampa Bay should still have enough against a Dolphins team that looked in free fall last week against the Bengals.",

    "description": "Social media and sports fans all over share their opinion on whether the one game suspension was enough for Coach Cooley",
    "fullText": "Should Ed Cooley’s suspension have been longer than one game? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nGeorgetown’s 80–77 loss to Xavier on December 20 was a tightly contested Big East matchup, but the final moments quickly shifted the attention away from the game itself. After the Hoyas missed a potential game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer, head coach Ed Cooley reacted in frustration by throwing a water bottle into the stands. The bottle struck a child sitting on an adult’s lap, later identified as members of the Nyahkoon family. Georgetown responded by suspending Cooley for one game, sparking debate across college basketball about whether that punishment was enough.\n\nOn the court, Georgetown showed a strong effort against Xavier. Malik Mack, Julius Halaifonua, and KJ Lewis carried most of the offensive load, keeping the Hoyas competitive throughout the night. However, late shooting struggles allowed Xavier to close out the win. While the loss itself mattered in the standings, Cooley’s actions after the final buzzer quickly became the main storyline.\n\nCooley issued an apology shortly after the incident, calling his behavior unacceptable and taking full responsibility. He also reached out directly to the Nyahkoon family, whom he described as close to him. The family accepted his apology, and Georgetown determined that a one-game suspension aligned with the school’s standards and expectations for conduct.\n\nYou’re kidding me Ed Cooley just beamed a water bottle 100 mph directly into a toddlers face 😭 #PrayForWaterBottleKidpic.twitter.com/jKIYTB3QPe\n\n— Nick Bateman (CBB guru) (@nickbateman33) December 21, 2025\n\nThe suspension was served Monday night when Georgetown faced Coppin State without Cooley on the sideline. The Hoyas responded with a dominant 97–67 victory, building a 53–25 halftime lead and controlling the game from start to finish. Julius Halaifonua led the way with 20 points and eight rebounds, while Isaiah Abraham and KJ Lewis provided strong all-around performances. While the win showed Georgetown’s ability to move forward, it also reopened questions about whether the punishment matched the severity of the incident.\n\nThose who believe the suspension should have been longer point to safety concerns. Throwing an object into the stands especially when it hits a child is a serious lapse in judgment. Coaches are leaders and public figures, and moments like this can reflect poorly on a program and the sport as a whole. From this perspective, a multi-game suspension could have sent a stronger message about accountability and fan safety.\n\nSupporters of the one-game suspension focus on Cooley’s response. He did not avoid responsibility, apologized publicly and privately, and accepted the punishment without protest. Georgetown appeared to view the incident as a one-time emotional mistake rather than a repeated issue, choosing to balance discipline with stability within the program.\n\nSimilar situations across sports show that discipline is not always consistent. NHL coach John Tortorella once received a one-game suspension for throwing water toward fans. In the NFL, Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper was fined $300,000 for throwing a drink toward spectators. In other cases, longer penalties have been handed down when intent or repeat behavior was involved. These examples highlight how leagues and schools often weigh context, harm, and response differently.\n\nSo, should Ed Cooley’s suspension have been longer than one game? There are reasonable arguments on both sides. If a similar incident were to happen again, it would likely result in a much harsher punishment, as this suspension was viewed by many as relatively light.\n\nA longer ban may have sent a stronger message about player and fan safety, but Georgetown clearly weighed several factors in its decision. Cooley’s immediate apology, the family’s acceptance of that apology, and his positive track record all played a role in how the university handled the situation.\n\nIn the end, this case highlights how difficult it can be to balance accountability, emotion, and context in sports. While opinions will differ on whether the punishment fits the incident, the debate underscores an ongoing challenge for schools and leagues when moments of frustration cross an important line.\n\nRick Pitino reacts to St. John’s opening win\n\nOhio State loses point guard commitment\n\nAJ Dybansta makes debut for BYU\n\nJalen Rose on TNT college basketball coverage",

    "description": "Amazon, YouTube TV, and Netflix dominate US sports streaming, accounting for 65% of the $6.5 billion spent by streamers on sports rights.",
    "fullText": "The NFL is giving sports fans a triple header for Christmas this year, starting with the Dallas Cowboys vs. the Washington Commanders at 1 p.m. ET, plus a Snoop Dogg halftime performance. But you have to \n\nThe tech giants have eaten the entertainment world, and now they're coming for sports.\n\nTogether, Amazon and YouTube TV account for 65% of the $6.5 billion that streamers will spend on sports rights for US audiences in 2025 (34.4% and 30.6%, respectively), according to Ampere Analysis. The third biggest share went to Netflix, with 11.3%. Disney's ESPN+ and Comcast's Peacock held a distant fourth and fifth place.\n\nAmazon and YouTube have actively pursued significant deals for sports rights in recent years, with Amazon paying $11 billion for the NFL's Thursday Night Football and $19.8 billion for NBA rights, and YouTube paying $14 billion to secure NFL \"Sunday Ticket\" rights.\n\nNetflix has also been active, scooping up NFL Christmas Day games and the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, although it prefers to treat sports as part of a broader live events strategy that includes comedy specials and awards shows rather than \"renting\" full seasons of sports rights. A person familiar with Netflix's spending said they pegged it at about $600 million versus Ampere's calculation of $738 million.\n\nAmpere's data comes with a few caveats. Its measurements of eight platforms exclude spending for rights distributed internationally — such as Amazon's spending on NFL rights outside the US, or on the UEFA Men's Champions League within the UK — and for DAZN's acquisition of the global FIFA Club World Cup 2025 rights for $1 billion.\n\nBroadcasters remain the largest buyers of sports rights in the US, although streamers are making inroads.\n\nNearly half (47%) of US broadcasters' content spending — $24 billion — went to sports rights in 2025, per Ampere. Most of US streamers' content budgets still go to TV shows and films. This year, 10% of their content budgets overall went to sports in 2025, up from 6% in 2024. Even for Amazon, sports were about 19% of its spending on content, approaching the amount it spends on movies.\n\nSports can help streamers grow engagement and keep audiences subscribed. However, the rising cost of sports means less money for an already stagnating entertainment TV ecosystem that has been producing fewer shows since the end of Peak TV in 2022.\n\nDisney said in its fourth quarter earnings call that it would spend $24 billion in the next fiscal year, driven in large part by sports rights. CFO Hugh Johnston justified paying a more than 73% step up for NBA rights in its 2024 deal by pointing to their value to audiences and advertisers, despite the cost creating \"a little bit of bumpiness during the course of the year.\"\n\nNetflix compared its recent NFL deal to the cost of its movies, which it's been making fewer of. Asked about the cost of the deal at an investor conference last year, Netflix exec Spencer Wang said he would characterize each game as \"roughly the size of one of our medium-sized original films.\"\n\nThe shift of sports to streaming platforms looks likely to continue.\n\nAmpere forecasts global spending on sports rights to increase by 20% to $78 billion worldwide by 2030. Spending will be driven by the US, where new NBA and MLB rights will be up for grabs in the coming years. Talks for the next round of NFL negotiations could start as early as 2026, as the league seeks to maximize the value of its media rights.\n\nYouTube TV is also expanding its play for sports fans, announcing a new sports bundle along with other niche packages that cost less than its regular $83-per-month service.",

    "fullText": "Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy.\n\nHe thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance.\n\nAfter earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams.\n\nCardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making.\n\nKress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a \"dream job.\" She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the \"culmination\" of her career, offering \"unparalleled exposure\" to global policymakers and business leaders.\n\nJack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase\n\nLevendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron.\n\nIn that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions.\n\nMenasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries.\n\nToday, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' private capital and liquidity solutions group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions.\n\nJackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley\n\nBefore joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking.\n\n\"I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two,\" she told Business Insider. \"I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas.\" So she made the pivot to Wall Street.\n\nAfter holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks.\n\nGolf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents.",

Wichita Sports Commission hopes that includes strengthening ongoing partnerships with the franchise.\n\n“The Chiefs have been big proponents of getting flag football into high schools, and we were a part of that locally with some Wichita schools,” Jenks said. “We are still continuing to promote and be a part of that process.”\n\nDr. Larry Straub, an associate professor of business management at Newman University, says the Chiefs’ presence is likely to improve Kansas’ national image. However, he’s skeptical that the financial boom that comes with a major sports team moving in will echo around the state.\n\n“From an economics standpoint, I think the closer you are to Kansas City, the more benefits you’re going to have,” Straub said.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

    "fullText": "It was a year of dominance for women’s sports in 2025.\n\nYou couldn’t blink without missing some display from a big-time athlete stepping up in a big-time moment: Mikaela Shiffrin bagging her 100th career win. Iga Świątek winning Wimbledon with a double bagel. A’ja Wilson, Paige Bueckers, Trinity Rodman, Lottie Woad — name a sport, and there was excellence to be found, records to be broken, trophies to be stockpiled.\n\nAnd in 2025, everyone was watching. From the summer of tournaments in women’s football across Europe, South America and Africa to rinks and courts across the globe, attendance and TV ratings remain on the rise.\n\nFor the first time, the National Women’s Soccer League cracked one million viewers for its championship game, all of whom were treated to the magic of Rose Lavelle’s left foot. Try watching footage of any of the fan walks in Switzerland from Euro 2025 without a smile — an impossible challenge.\n\nWomen’s basketball has always been bigger than any single player, and from the college game to the pros, everyone capitalized on the massive boost from 2024. UConn and the Aces rose to the top once again, with plenty of drama and excitement along the way.\n\nNew leagues and competitions sparked joy. Napheesa Collier and the Lunar Owls cried, “Hootie Hoo!” at Unrivaled, Bayern Munich danced their way through the first World Sevens and new leagues in volleyball and softball joined the ecosystem, with even more ready to enter the fray in 2026.\n\nIt feels impossible to sum up another beautifully chaotic year in women’s sports, but that challenge didn’t stop us. Here, The Athletic’s writers from across the globe pick the moments that stood out for them in 2025.\n\nAnd the best part? We know this list will be even harder to write in 2026.\n\nThis wasn’t the way it was supposed to happen.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin was supposed to reach her century of World Cup race wins at the start of the season, near her childhood home and the school that helped make her a champion in Vermont.\n\nInstead, the races in Killington in November 2024 nearly ended her career. A violent crash sent her tumbling across the snow. She suffered a puncture wound in her abdomen; whatever caused it nearly tore through her colon.\n\nShiffrin spent the next nine weeks recovering physically, before returning to the slopes in February, fit in her body but a shadow of her former self, unable even to make it down a giant slalom hill.\n\nShe arrived in Sestriere, Italy, with low expectations, but after the first run, she had a lead of just under a 10th of a second. That meant she had to go hard or go home in the second run.\n\nOf course, she went hard, and secured that unprecedented 100th victory.\n\n“The mountain ahead of me is steep and long,” Shiffrin said during a news conference after the race. “I just have to take this day and be grateful for it. Because it’s a small moment in the middle of many tough moments that makes me feel like maybe I can be good again.”\n\nMaybe? Shiffrin started the 2025-26 season winning four consecutive slalom races. Now she has 105 wins — and counting.\n\nUConn star Paige Bueckers earned the storybook ending to her collegiate career as the Huskies demolished UCLA and South Carolina in the 2025 Final Four to win their 12th title in program history. ESPN’s Ryan Ruocco had been sitting on the final call of “the book of Bueckers”, as the UConn guard had been destined for stardom for years.\n\nBueckers was the top recruit in a loaded 2020 high school class (one that included Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink in its top five) and immediately fulfilled that promise by winning national player of the year honors as a freshman. Her debut season ultimately ended in disappointment in the national semifinals, as the Huskies’ title drought extended to five years, and the real struggle was yet to come. Over the next three seasons, Bueckers was betrayed by her own body with multiple leg injuries and her teammates’ inability to stay healthy, causing her to delay her entrance into the WNBA and play a fifth and final year at UConn.\n\nThe payoff came in 2025. With a healthy Azzi Fudd and freshman phenom Sarah Strong by her side, Bueckers led the Huskies to the promised land as UConn won its first championship in nine years.\n\nAfter four Final Fours and three All-American seasons, Bueckers cried on coach Geno Auriemma’s shoulder as she exited her last game with victory in hand, adding the ultimate item to her historic college resume. Eight days later, Bueckers was the obvious No. 1 pick in the WNBA Draft, en route to being named an All-Star, all-WNBA and rookie of the year.\n\nWhile Turki Al-Sheikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority, continues to ignore its existence, women’s boxing plants its feet and keeps on punching, producing historic moments such as the night of July 11 this year, when one of the greatest female fighters of all time, Katie Taylor defended her undisputed junior welterweight title against Amanda Serrano inside Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe entire night was a showcase of women’s boxing, with the trilogy fight between Taylor and Serrano headlining the first all-female boxing card to be held at the Garden, featuring three undisputed and two unified title fights. It all took place in front of a sellout crowd of 19,721, split between Irish and Puerto Rican fans, with millions more watching the Netflix-streamed show (nearly six million globally tuned in from opening to closing bell).\n\nThe main event went Taylor’s way via majority decision after a tight 10-round battle, giving the Irishwoman a three-fight sweep over the unified featherweight world champion, though this was undoubtedly the most convincing win of the three. Despite the single-sided outcome, their trilogy will go down in history as one of the most significant battles in women’s boxing history, showing the sport deserves its place in the brightest of spotlights.\n\nEngland were heading home. Within 25 minutes, they were 2-0 down against Sweden in soccer’s European Championship quarterfinals. They had dug themselves a deep hole and it seemed there was no way back. All Sweden had to do was hold on for 11 minutes…\n\nBut then up popped Lucy Bronze at the back post. Still at 2-1, Sweden could nick it. Then came England’s saviour, 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang, levelling the game at 2-2.\n\nA collision, bloody nose, cramp and Bronze strapping her own leg added to the drama of extra time before a topsy-turvy penalty shootout that went to sudden death. Hannah Hampton should be credited for saving two spot kicks but I have never seen someone strut up to the spot, whip off a bandage and dispatch their penalty with such ruthlessness as Bronze did. She later revealed she had been playing with a broken bone in her leg.\n\nThe Lionesses should have been down and out. Through sheer grit, they rose again on their way to becoming European champions. Again.\n\nOn an October Friday night in Phoenix, A’ja Wilson strutted around the underbelly of Mortgage Matchup Center, rattling a pink tambourine. The Las Vegas Aces had won their third title in four seasons and Wilson, the league’s first four-time MVP, was basking in the victory, parading around the stadium. She was heard as loudly as her play was impactful.\n\nThere was little drama entering that evening’s contest in large part because of what Wilson did two nights earlier. With 0.3 seconds remaining in Game 3 of Las Vegas’ WNBA Finals matchup with the Phoenix Mercury, and Las Vegas leading the series 2-0, Wilson sank the biggest shot of her career. She drove left from the elbow, spun away from the rim to create space, and elevated for a short jumper over the outstretched arms of Phoenix’s Alyssa Thomas.\n\nFor the briefest of seconds, the ball rattled around the rim. Then it fell, giving Las Vegas a two-point lead and a decisive advantage in the series. They would close it out 48 hours later.\n\nThe shot was the moment of an, at times, underwhelming finals (in part because of Las Vegas’ dominance), and a defining moment for Wilson. The play call had been simple: put the ball in the MVP’s hands. The memory of what happened will last for years to come.\n\nThe PWHL welcomed two new teams in Vancouver and Seattle — the league’s first wave of expansion after two seasons of early success and rapid growth — and brought on seismic change.\n\nRosters were torn apart, with superstars Hilary Knight and Sarah Nurse on the move due to the league’s player dispersion process. Each team lost four players from its 2024-25 roster through the expansion draft and exclusive signing window, which was designed to ensure the PWHL’s newest teams could compete on day one.\n\nWhile there have been some growing pains early in the 2025-26 season, Seattle and Vancouver have two of the most talented rosters in the PWHL. They’re also already two of the league’s most successful teams from a business perspective.\n\nIn its first-ever game on Nov. 21, the Vancouver Goldeneyes sold out the Pacific Coliseum (14,958) and drew the largest crowd of any game played at a regular PWHL home venue. One week later, the Seattle Torrent beat that record with 16,014 at Climate Pledge Arena, which also set a record for attendance at a professional women’s hockey game in the United States.\n\nAccording to the league, Seattle had the most single-day jersey sales in PWHL history when the team’s inaugural jerseys went on sale Oct. 21. Vancouver was right on its heels, and has sold the most season tickets league-wide. Seattle, the league said, is third, behind Toronto.\n\nAnd more change is soon to come in 2026.\n\nThe league could add between two and four teams by next season, according to executive vice president of business operations Amy Scheer, who went public with the plans when addressing Ottawa city council last month and doubled down on those plans in an interview with CNBC.\n\n“We are expanding again, it’s either two to four teams,” she said. “If I were a betting woman, I’d say it’d be four teams. And then I think we’ll hold at 12 for a bit.”\n\nAll sporting events produce joy and misery on some level. And then there is the 2025 Wimbledon women’s singles final.\n\nOn one side of the net, Iga Świątek cemented her status as the greatest player of her era with a dominant 6-0, 6-0 win, capturing the most important title in tennis — and the one that she least expected to win.\n\nAfter the most difficult period of her career, her status as the best since Serena Williams became inarguable.\n\nIt doesn’t get more perfect than that.\n\nOn the other side of the net was Amanda Anisimova. A year prior, she had been outside the top 300 and had failed to qualify for Wimbledon. Now she’d made the final — and froze, on the most hallowed stage in tennis, in front of millions of people around the world.\n\nAnisimova’s mother rarely attends her matches out of superstition. She’d flown across the Atlantic for this one. Ugh.\n\nBut then, Anisimova, who lost her father to a sudden heart attack at 17, gave a tearful speech that was sad and rousing all at once, a tribute to her mother for her love and loyalty that announced her to the world as a sports star in her lowest tennis moment.\n\nAnd seven weeks later, at the U.S. Open, Anisimova found Świątek across the net again — and managed to exorcize the ghosts of the grass with a win.\n\nAs the primary story of the NWSL offseason, Trinity Rodman is the free agent figuring out if she can stay with the Washington Spirit and get paid what she’s worth. Remembering her emotional return to the field in August is the perfect reminder of why so much of the conversation revolves around her.\n\nAfter months recovering from a lingering back injury, Rodman returned to the pitch at Audi Field, but was not fit enough to start. Instead, 15 minutes was all she needed to score a game-winning goal over the Portland Thorns, immediately bursting into tears as she was swarmed by her teammates in celebration.\n\nRodman is the shooting star of the NWSL, and now the flashpoint for the existential question of how the league retains its biggest talent — but she’s also just a 23-year-old human, trying to play the game she loves.\n\nOn a wet track at the Japan National Stadium in September, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone ran her way, once more, into the record books.\n\nThe 26-year-old had boldly switched from the 400-metre hurdles to the one-lap flat, moving out of an event in which she holds the world record and forfeiting an almost certain gold medal over the barriers.\n\nIn her way stood Olympic champion Marileidy Paulino and defending world champion Salwa Eid Naser. Paulino clocked 47.98secs, but McLaughlin-Levrone stunned them both, flying round in 47.78secs, the second-fastest time by a woman and only 0.18s off Marita Koch’s 1985 world record.\n\nIt was the first race where two women had run 400m in under 48 seconds.\n\nDuring another French Open blighted by allegations of sexist scheduling, Loïs Boisson offered the best possible rejoinder.\n\nThe wild-card entry, ranked No. 361 at the time, became the first Frenchwoman since 2011 to reach the semifinals, and her run became one of the stories of the tournament.\n\nOn one level, it was personal: Boisson had a wild card in 2024, but tore a knee ligament just before the tournament. She did not even watch it on TV.\n\nBut it also came in the context of zero women’s matches being selected for the coveted night slot on Court Philippe-Chatrier, the main stadium, for the second year in a row. Women’s matches also opened play — a slot with the stands at their most empty — every day of the tournament that both men’s and women’s matches were played. Tournament officials maintained that the decisions were not a comment on the quality of women’s tennis.\n\nBoisson’s fourth-round match, against then-world No. 3 Jessica Pegula, was declined for the primetime slot by the tournament, multiple people briefed on discussions between Amazon and the French Open told The Athletic at the time.\n\nSo Boisson started the biggest match of her life in front of swathes of empty seats, which steadily filled as news of an upset swept across Roland Garros and Boisson became the first home women’s quarterfinalist at Roland Garros for eight years.\n\nBoisson then beat No. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva to reach the semis, where she lost to eventual winner Coco Gauff. But her stirring performances captured the imagination of supporters and showed the potency of women role models being given the sport’s biggest stages — especially at their home event.\n\nLottie Woad began the year as the reigning amateur world No. 1 of women’s golf. She will end it ranked 11th on the Rolex professional world rankings.\n\nIn July, we saw a “Woad summer”: the Englishwoman, 21, started July by winning the Irish Open by six strokes. One week later, she finished third at the Evian Championship, one of the women’s game’s five majors. The best part? She was still an amateur at both events, so had to forego earnings of around half a million pounds ($660,000).\n\nBut it wasn’t riches Woad — who has since earned $831,400 — sought, it was the holy grail: an LPGA Tour card.\n\nThen, on the last weekend of July, Woad won the Scottish Open at Dundonald Links by three shots. It was her professional debut and the first time since 2018 that a women’s golfer had won their inaugural event after turning pro – that has only happened twice before.\n\n“If you don’t know who Lottie is, you don’t follow golf,” Amy Bond, Woad’s coach at Florida State University, told The Athletic at the time. Plenty of people know her name now, that’s for sure.\n\nBefore the WNBA’s mid-season showcase, players participating in the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game took the floor in Indianapolis revealing a message on their shirts: “Pay Us What You Owe Us.” The shirts made a clear statement, one that resonated across the sporting landscape and brought waves of attention to the ongoing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) discussion between the players union and the league.\n\nThe WNBA is generating record revenue and expanding. Franchise valuations are soaring. Amid the growth period, players are seeking a significant change not just in how much they are being paid, but to the salary system that determines what they are being paid.\n\nTensions between the two sides continued to escalate throughout the summer and into the fall, highlighted by a press conference on the eve of the WNBA Finals when Minnesota Lynx Napheesa Collier lambasted WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert and the league office. Collier said the WNBA has “the worst leadership in the world.” Engelbert was pressed to answer questions about her job status.\n\nAnd while those questions have publicly dissipated, the two sides remain on edge. They have agreed to two extensions of the deadline in recent months, but gaps remain and it is unclear when a new agreement will be reached.\n\nThe women’s rugby union World Cup in England was a watershed moment, a line drawn in the sand that marked a before and after.\n\nA record 81,885 fans attended the final in which England beat Canada 33-13 at London’s Twickenham Stadium, the largest women’s rugby crowd in history. It represented a 518 per cent increase from 15 years ago, when England hosted the 2010 World Cup final at the Twickenham Stoop, which has a capacity of 14,800.\n\nWhat’s more, 50 per cent of fans had never been to a women’s rugby match before. Across the tournament, 444,465 tickets were sold, three times more than the 2022 World Cup.\n\nParallels can be drawn with England women’s triumph on home soil at soccer’s Euro 2022. “What we are trying to prove is that it’s not just a one-off with football,” England winger Abby Dow told reporters. “It’s women’s sport as a whole and it is here to stay.”\n\nThere’s just something about a Gotham run in the playoffs coming in on the final day of the regular season as the final team to clinch the postseason. They won it all in 2023 that way, and managed to repeat the feat in 2025 thanks to clutch performances from Rose Lavelle, Jaedyn Shaw, Emily Sonnett and Ann-Katrin Berger.\n\nAdd in an instant classic of a quote from Shaw, dropped after Gotham upended the Kansas City Current (winners of the NWSL Shield by a whopping 21 points in a historically great season) in Kansas City. Then, they went to Orlando and beat last year’s champions, led by Marta. Finally, the win in San Jose over the Washington Spirit thanks to a Lavelle banger late in the match. An instant classic of a playoff run ending in lifting the Tiffany trophy for the second time in three years.\n\nThey’ll add it to the hardware cabinet, alongside May’s trophy for winning the inaugural Concacaf W Champions Cup. Continental champions and domestic bragging rights — it’s a solid way to wrap 2025, and maybe the start of another NWSL dynasty.\n\nWhen India lost three games in the group stage of their home cricket World Cup, pressure grew. But the team captained by Harmanpreet Kaur, who would go on to make the winning catch in the final against South Africa, reset themselves on their way to a stunning victory in Navi Mumbai.\n\nThe final itself at the DY Patil Stadium was intense. India lost the toss and batted first. A two-hour rain delay stood in their way but when it cleared, they got off to a flier. Shafali Verma hit 87 off 79 balls to set India up for glory as they put up a score of 298-7, the second-highest total in a World Cup final. Smriti Mandhana scored 45 to take her total for the tournament to 434 runs, the most by a player at a World Cup.\n\nSouth Africa, led by captain Laura Wolvaardt, who posted 101 runs, didn’t give up. But the host nation had Deepti Sharma in stellar form and she took five wickets to stop South Africa as India won by 52 to become world champions for the first time.\n\nWhen Lindsey Vonn and her damaged knees barreled out of the start gate at the 2019 World Championships in Sweden for one last time, it was the denouement of one of the greatest careers in Alpine skiing history.\n\nAt the finishing line in the Swedish resort of Are was Ingemar Stenmark, whose then-record of 86 World Cup wins she was four short of equalling. She had begged him to come, she would later tell a crowded news conference. Her father, Alan, and sister, Karin, were there, too. She had always wanted to break Stenmark’s record but this was meant to be the last race for a champion whose body was, she said, “broken beyond repair.”\n\nCompeting in such a brutal event had taken its toll. The injury list over the years was lengthy: broken right arm, fractures in the left knee, broken left ankle, torn ligaments, broken bone in the right leg, concussion.\n\nBut then came a partial knee replacement in 2024 and one of the greatest comebacks in modern sport.\n\nWith titanium in her right knee, the most famous skier of her generation, the first American to win the women’s Olympic downhill, was pain-free for the first time in years.\n\nBut Vonn isn’t merely competing again. She is fast. Not only did she win the year’s first World Cup downhill in Saint Moritz, Switzerland, this month, but she also did so by nearly a second. The next day, she finished on the podium again in the downhill.\n\nWith the 2026 Olympics under two months away, the 41-year-old is a contender and that is remarkable — or, as she said in February, a “miracle.”\n\nLet us know which of these picks was your favorite of 2025 — and tell us about any we have missed! — in the comments below.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nGotham FC, WNBA, Golf, Boxing, Women's Soccer, Women's College Basketball, Olympics, Women's Euros, Women's Hockey, Tennis, Global Sports, Cricket\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "A host of top sports stars and governing bodies have expressed fears that playing fields across England could be built on and disappear if proposed planning reforms come into force.\n\nFormer Lioness Jill Scott, and Olympic champions Sir Mo Farah and Alex Yee are among those to sign an open letter saying they are \"deeply concerned\" by the potential removal of statutory protections for the facilities.\n\nOther signatories included the heads of the Football Association (FA), the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA).\n\nThe government is considering stripping funding agency Sport England of its right to be consulted before a playing field is built on.\n\nIt is part of a plan by ministers to speed up planning decisions as it looks to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.\n\nBut with a consultation underway, the signatories said: \"Playing fields are irreplaceable - and Sport England's statutory consultee role is an important line of defence.\n\n\"Weakening this protection risks accelerating the loss of the very spaces that make grassroots sport and physical activity possible, at a time when participation is growing and demand has never been higher. \"\n\nSport England declined to comment, but this month said it protected more than a thousand playing fields across the country last year. Tasked with increasing physical activity, it has had to be consulted on planning decisions for the past 30 years after an estimated 10,000 playing fields were lost in the 1980s and early '90s.\n\nThe letter has been written by Fields in Trust, a charity that works with local authorities and communities to protect parks and playing fields from development.\n\nIts president, former midfielder Scott, said: \"Bringing together so many people for this letter has been incredibly personal to me. Too many communities risk losing these very spaces. I urge the government to listen carefully. We're not asking for the impossible. We're asking them to protect what already exists, for the generations who will come after us.\"\n\nThe signatories - which also include Eilish McColgan, Sir Matthew Pinsent, Tessa Sanderson, and the heads of UK Athletics, British Cycling and Parkrun, are calling on ministers \"to ensure that any planning reforms retain a meaningful mechanism to protect playing fields and sports facilities for future generations.\n\n\"This is about social justice. The people who need green space the most often have the least access. Without these protections, the health and wellbeing of communities will suffer. \"\n\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: \"There are already strong protections in place for playing fields which we are proposing to keep and we are investing £400m into grassroots sport.\"\n\nBBC Sport has been told no decision will be made until the results of the consultation are fully considered. The government is proposing to remove the Gardens Trust and the Theatres Trust as statutory consultees as well as Sport England, which is expected to reduce more than 3,000 consultations annually.\n\nThis month, the government said there will need to be a sharp surge in housebuilding to meet its promise to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.\n\nBuilders have warned the government will miss its target, after the number of new homes started fell from 207,000 to 139,000 after Labour took office - the lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLast week, Women in Sport said: \"Now is not the time to be putting our playing fields and pitches at risk.\n\n\"Any loss of this space now would come at a critical moment, excluding more women and girls from sport and stunting the growth of one of the UK's biggest success stories.\"\n\nIt is among a number of sports bodies urging members to support a petition titled 'Do not remove Sport England as a statutory consultee for planning applications'.\n\nIt has been signed by almost 16,000 people.",

    "fullText": "Hugo González has made quite an impression on Boston Celtics fans and the rest of the NBA during his rookie season.\n\nIt’s becoming obvious that Hugo’s teammates on the Celtics love him too; how could they not? González plays with a fiery intensity, fearlessness, and desire to win that reminds you what sports are all about.\n\nOn Monday, Celtics center Neemias Queta became the latest player to heap praise upon González.\n\nQueta RAVED about Hugo González this morning at shootaround: \"I knew a couple of people at Real Madrid … that's all they (raved) about, how hard he can play. I've been familiar to a little bit of the stuff that he had going on, but it's amazing to see it live.\"@CLNSMedia pic.twitter.com/ZQ9YXzCWY9\n\n— Celtics on CLNS (@CelticsCLNS) December 22, 2025\n\n“I knew a couple of people at Real Madrid … that’s all they (raved) about, how hard he can play,” Queta said on Monday. “I’ve been familiar to a little bit of the stuff that he had going on, but it’s amazing to see it live.”\n\nCeltics fans are still getting to know González and learning the teenager’s backstory to becoming a first-round pick.\n\nBorn in February 2006 in Madrid, Spain, González emerged as one of Europe’s top young talents through Real Madrid’s renowned youth system. Joining the club at age nine, he quickly rose, debuting professionally in the Liga ACB at just 16 in October 2022, becoming one of the youngest players in Real Madrid history. He excelled in junior competitions, leading Real Madrid U18 to back-to-back Adidas Next Generation Tournament titles in 2023 and 2024, earning MVP honors in the latter.\n\nQueridos Madridistas,\n\nQuiero dar las gracias a toda la entidad del Real Madrid por su cariño y trato durante estos ocho años y, no menos importante, enseñarme a jugar al baloncesto y formarme con unos valores. \n\nEsta etapa se cierra hoy y estoy muy orgulloso de haber cumplido un… pic.twitter.com/8edZSXOBHs\n\n— Hugo González Peña (@hugoglezz_) June 30, 2025\n\nOn the international stage, González contributed to Spain’s silver medals at the 2022 FIBA U17 World Cup and subsequent youth events. In February 2025, he debuted for Spain’s senior national team, scoring 11 points in a EuroBasket qualifier.\n\nSelected 28th overall by the Boston Celtics in the June 2025 NBA Draft, González participated in Summer League before making his regular-season debut. His rookie year has featured fluctuating minutes, with a first career start in October and a breakout performance on December 20, against Toronto, posting his initial double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) in a Celtics victory.\n\nGonzález, Queta, and the rest of the 17-11 Celtics will continue their season on Monday evening when they host the 6-22 Indiana Pacers at TD Garden. Boston will be going for its third-straight victory.\n\nMike Vrabel Has Hilarious Reaction To Will Campbell’s Viral Stunt At Celtics Game",

    "fullText": "In a week that saw the college sports landscape dominated by College Football Playoff storylines, the men's basketball season saw a couple of notable upsets that have shaken up the latest top 25 rankings.\n\nPerhaps none was bigger than the loss by previously unbeaten, third-ranked Duke, which fell 82-81 in Madison Square Garden to a short-handed, 19th-ranked Texas Tech team. JT Toppin paced the win with a 19-point, 10-rebound double-double, though the Red Raiders also saw a 20-point effort from LeJuan Watts and 27-point explosion from Christian Anderson.\n\nREQUIRED READING: College basketball poll: Michigan still No. 1, Duke tumbles in Top 25 rankings\n\nElsewhere, No. 11 Louisville fell 83-62 to previously 23rd-ranked Tennessee on Dec. 16.\n\nHere's how those games and more impacted the latest men's college basketball rankings from the USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll and AP Top 25:\n\nFirst-place votes in parentheses\n\nOthers receiving votes: St. John's 32; Kentucky 32; Seton Hall 20; Utah State 15; Auburn 10; California 9; UCLA 8; Saint Louis 8; LSU 6; Yale 4; Oklahoma State 3; Saint Mary's 1; Indiana 1; Clemson 1.\n\nThis section will be updated when the AP Top 25 poll is unveiled.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Men's college basketball rankings: Updated Coaches Poll, AP Top 25",

    "description": "The Times' sports reporting staff selects their favorite story from 2025, a showcase of stories that hold a special place with 17 writers.",
    "fullText": "There are no shortage of year-end lists that employ metrics — unique visitors, page views, minutes spent — to measure the most popular stories of the year.\n\nThe most enjoyable lists, however, are less quantifiable and divined instead by the writers themselves and what they have found most rewarding.\n\nThe following 17 Times staff writers and columnists, listed alphabetically, share their favorite sports stories from 2025.\n\nWhy these stories stuck with me: I actually have two stories from 2025 that I think rise a little above the daily noise, yet in a strange way they are related. The first is about baseball's one-hit wonders, players who played just one game in the major leagues but have seen that appearance shape the rest of their lives. The second is about former Dodger Mike Davis, who spent 10 years in the big leagues but has seen his career defined by one plate appearance, one which ended in the best-remembered walk in the team's history.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: This story captured a sliver of the irreverent joy that Bill Walton brought to everyone he touched, including me.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: Lizbeth Ovalle’s story is one of my favorites because this year she became the player with the highest transfer fee ever paid by a women’s soccer team. She is from Mexico, a country where women’s soccer still faces many disadvantages compared to the men’s league. Ovalle represents how women’s soccer is gaining relevance worldwide, even in places where support has been limited. Earlier in her career, at age 14, she endured 10-hour bus rides to train with the Mexican national team, receiving no pay beyond transportation. The Orlando Pride player recently won the 2025 FIFA Marta Award (FIFA Goal of the Year) for her stunning acrobatic goal, known as the “reverse scorpion kick,\" while playing in Liga MX with Tigres.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: The fun of doing this story is talking to the 20-plus industry executives and experts to find out what would happen to racing nationally if California horse racing were to go away. The story received a lot of attention and even got some attention from NBC, the network that covers the Kentucky Derby. As a reporter, one of the fun challenges is to distill tens of thousands of interview words into a story that makes sense. So, thanks to the Times editors who allowed the story to be of magazine length.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: In a rare visit to Reno, Nev., I spoke with Canelo Álvarez, who showed great pride as he reflected on two decades of building an extraordinary career — the resilience, the sacrifices and the legacy he hopes to leave behind. The piece also gave me rare insight through conversations with his brother Ricardo and his longtime trainer Eddy Reynoso, who shared intimate memories and moments that shaped him inside and outside the ring. Bringing all their voices together made the story feel personal, layered and special.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: What I liked about this was Cooper Kupp, an iconic player and a cornerstone to the Rams rebuilding a fan base in Los Angeles, gave me an exclusive and insightful window into a difficult and painful segment of his life — his parting with the team. He hadn't opened up publicly before this, and I was pleased to have built that relationship and trust so that he was comfortable doing so with me.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: The Dodgers' infusion of Japanese talent has been transformational to the franchise in many ways. But to Dave Roberts, it led to a particularly profound personal awakening, helping one of the most successful managers in MLB history reconnect with familial roots in a way that goes far beyond baseball.\n\nWhy these stories stuck with me: Covering the wrongful-death trial of former pitcher Tyler Skaggs vs. the Angels had elements similar to writing about ballgames: Describe what happened in the courtroom. Finding a story beyond trial testimony was difficult, but my Dec. 15 story predicting a settlement and explaining the secretive, outsized influence of the Angels' insurance companies met the challenge. Four days later the case settled while the jury was deliberating. My story on the rapidly unfolding events and reaction to the outcome ran on A1.\n\nWhy this column stuck with me: It’s unfortunate I had to write this. But our job as journalists is to chronicle what’s happening, and based on what many people told me after it was published, I’m glad I was able to put what they were feeling into words.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: Of all the touted freshmen I’ve covered in my years on the college football beat, Jahkeem Stewart might be the most fascinating. Already a physical marvel as a sixth-grader, he took an unusual path to USC, having played in only a dozen high school games. This was a fun story to report, partly because it also came with great video of Stewart as a young football player, steamrolling pretty much everyone in his path.\n\nWhy these stories stuck with me: Stories are like children — all of them are your favorite. The opportunity to convey how athletes can positively influence and inspire others in their community is always rewarding. Speaking with fans and Polynesian athletes and coaches such as Jesse Sapolu, Norm Chow, Manti Te'o, Marcus Mariota and Jaylen Maiava provided a window into Puka Nacua's impact. And though young Rams defensive linemen and the famed “Fearsome Foursome” are separated by more than a half century, the respect and the homage the young players paid to Rosey Grier — the last living member of the Fearsome Foursome — and Deacon Jones, Merlin Olsen and Lamar Lundy — was heartwarming to report.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: The most common question I got while covering the Chargers had nothing to do with Jim Harbaugh or Justin Herbert. Everyone wanted to know who was in charge of the social media accounts. Investigating weird, funny corners of the internet is my favorite way to remind myself (and hopefully others) that sports don't always have to be serious.\n\nWhy this column stuck with me: I chose “I’m Fighting Parkinson’s One Punch At A Time” because it was a story that took four years to write but one that has resonated immediately and endlessly.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in the winter of 2021, I decided to keep the diagnosis a secret. Initially I didn’t even tell my own three children. I didn’t want people feeling sorry for me, or looking at me differently or, worse, treating me differently. I wanted to continue with my normal life while fighting the disease in private.\n\nAs part of this fight, I attended a boxing class for Parkinson’s patients. The class was filled with 80-year-old women pounding on a heavy bag, 75-year-old men dancing across the floor, elderly and trembling people working hard to stave off the effects of PD. They quickly became my heroes, and deserved to be illuminated as inspirations to others. I finally realized that I could tell their story and maybe push others to come out of the PD shadows and seek the same therapy.\n\nAnd, well, if I was going to write about others with Parkinson’s disease, I would have to come clean about myself. So, with help from boxing instructor Jody Hould and sports editor Iliana Limón Romero, I did. And I’m glad I did. I’ve since heard from countless people that the story moved them to admit their illness and begin boxing therapy or other types of PD workouts. My diagnosis was a punch in the gut. But thanks in part to the encouragement that came from this story, I’m fighting back.\n\nWhy this column stuck with me: The Dodgers did not much care for this story on how increasingly unaffordable Dodger Stadium has become for families. If we're so unaffordable, they said, how come we pack our stadium every night? It's a fair point: Ticket prices are a function of supply and demand, and demand for Dodgers tickets is driven by Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers' dynasty. And the owners of the Dodgers, unlike the owners of too many other teams, put that money back into the team. Still, the Dodgers have a choice whether to maximize revenue or lower some prices so kids can come and the team can develop a new generation of fans. After the Dodgers hit a team-record 4 million in attendance last season and won baseball's first back-to-back championships in 25 years, the affordability challenge will only become more challenging next year.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: In August was year No. 49 for me covering high school sports in Southern California, so on a beach in the summer, I wrote down some memories how it all started. Next fall will be a countdown of 50 best memories/stories for 50 years.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: I enjoyed getting the backstory of this unusual mural. Some great photos by Juliana Yamada made the article look really good.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: In one of the biggest and most shocking trades in NBA history, being the first to get this honest reaction from Anthony Davis about being traded to Dallas for Luka Doncic showed that building and maintaining relationships can pay off.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas lawmakers are poised to vote Monday on a proposal that could lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line from Missouri, and replace popular but aging Arrowhead Stadium with a new facility capable of hosting major year-round events.\n\nThe meeting of the Legislative Coordinating Council, which includes the state's top lawmakers, is expected to be attended by Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and other team officials. If the proposal is passed, the Chiefs could move swiftly in announcing plans to depart their 53-year-old home at the Truman Sports Complex for a stadium that could cost upwards of $2 billion.\n\nThe state's proposal would allow for STAR bonds to be issued to cover up to 70% of the overall cost of the project. They would be paid off with state sales and liquor tax revenues generated in a defined area around around the sports complex.\n\nThe same bonding process was used to build Kansas Speedway and the surrounding shopping and entertainment district, known as The Legends, in Kansas City, Kansas — the area where a future stadium for the Chiefs is most likely to be built.\n\nThe area is also home to Children's Mercy Park, where Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer plays its home matches.\n\n“The state of Kansas is in active discussions with the Kansas City Chiefs about the prospects of building a new stadium and other facilities in Kansas,” the Kansas Department of Commerce said last week. “No final agreement has been reached, but this would be a massive economic win for Kansas and benefit Kansans for generations to come. We are aggressively pursuing this opportunity.”\n\nThe move by the Chiefs would be a massive blow to Missouri lawmakers and Gov. Mike Kehoe, who have been working on a package of their own to prevent a second NFL franchise in a decade from leaving their borders. The Rams departed St. Louis for Los Angeles a decade ago in part because of their inability to secure funding to help replace The Dome at America’s Center.\n\nKehoe backed a special legislative session in June to authorize bonds covering up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, plus up to $50 million of tax credits for each stadium and unspecified aid from local governments.\n\nThe special session came in response to Kansas lawmakers approving their bond package.\n\nThe Chiefs originally planned an $800 million renovation of Arrowhead Stadium in a joint effort with the Kansas City Royals, who are similarly planning to build a new facility to replace Kauffman Stadium — which sits a couple of hundred yards across a parking lot from Arrowhead Stadium — when the two teams' leases with Jackson County, Missouri, expire in January 2031.\n\nBut after county voters soundly defeated a local sales tax extension last year, the Royals and Chiefs began work on separate plans.\n\nThe Royals will not be discussed by Kansas lawmakers Monday, but momentum appears to be building behind their own move across the state line. An affiliate of the club already has purchased the mortgage on a tract of land in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nQuinton Lucas, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, has been working to keep both franchises on the Missouri side of the state line. He said in a statement over the weekend that negotiations had continued with the Chiefs throughout last week.\n\n“We’ll reserve further comment until we hear from the Kansas City Chiefs,” Lucas said.\n\nHunt has long said his preference was to renovate Arrowhead Stadium, which was beloved by his father and team founder, the late Lamar Hunt. It is considered one of the jewels of the NFL, alongside Lambeau Field in Green Bay, and is revered for its tailgating scene and home-field advantage; it currently holds the Guinness World Record for the loudest stadium roar.\n\nThis summer, Arrowhead Stadium will host six World Cup matches, including matches in the Round of 32 and quarterfinals.\n\nThe Hunt family has warmed in recent years to the idea of leaving their own mark by building its replacement, though. Not only would a new, state-of-the-art stadium provide new revenue streams, through luxury seating and accompanying development, but a fixed or retractable roof would allow it to be used year-round. That would mean the potential to host concerts and events, college football bowl games, the Final Four and one of Lamar Hunt's long-held dreams: a Super Bowl.\n\nHanna reported from Topeka.

    "title": "Arellano: Shea Serrano's 'Expensive Basketball' headlines remarkable year for Latino sports books",
    "description": "Gustavo Arellano highlights a special year for Latinos in sports, with Fernando Mendoza winning the Heisman and four strong sports books released.",
    "fullText": "When Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy this weekend with another Latino finalist looking on from the crowd, the Cuban-American quarterback did more than just become the first Indiana Hoosier to win college football’s top prize, and only the third Latino to do so. He also subtly offered a radical statement: Latinos don't just belong in this country, they're essential.\n\nAt a time when questions swirl around this country‘s largest minority group that cast us in a demeaning, tokenized light — how could so many of us vote for Trump in 2024? Why don't we assimilate faster? Why does Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh think it’s OK for immigration agents to racially profile us? — the fact that two of the best college football players in the country this year were Latino quarterbacks didn’t draw the headlines they would’ve a generation ago. That’s because we now live in an era where Latinos are part of the fabric of sports in the United States like never before.\n\nThat’s the untold thesis of four great books I read this year. Each is anchored in Latino pride but treat their subjects not just as sport curios and pioneers but great athletes who were and are fundamental not just to their professions and community but society at large.\n\nShea Serrano writing about anything is like a really great big burrito — you know it’s going to be great and it exceeds your expectations when you finally bite into it, you swear you’re not going to gorge the thing all at once but don’t regret anything when you inevitably do. He could write about concrete and this would be true, but his latest New York Times bestseller (four in total, which probably makes him the only Mexican American author with that distinction) thankfully is instead about his favorite sport.\n\n“Expensive Basketball” finds Serrano at his best, a mix of humblebrag, rambles and hilarity (of Rasheed Wallace, the lifelong San Antonio Spurs fan wrote the all-star forward “would collect technical fouls with the same enthusiasm and determination little kids collect Pokémon cards with.”) The proud Tejano's mix of styles — straight essays, listicles, repeated phrases or words trotted out like incantations, copious footnotes — ensures he always keeps the reader guessing.\n\nBut his genius is in noting things no one else possibly can. Who else would’ve crowned journeyman power forward Gordon Hayward the fall guy in Kobe Bryant’s final game, the one where he scored 60 points and led the Lakers to a thrilling fourth-quarter comeback? Tied a Carlos Williams poem that a friend mistakenly texted to him to WNBA Hall of Famer Sue Bird? Reminded us that the hapless Charlotte Hornets — who haven’t made it into the playoffs in nearly a decade — were once considered so cool that two of their stars were featured in the original “Space Jam?” \"Essential Basketball\" is so good that you’ll swear you’ll only read a couple of Serrano's essays and not regret the afternoon that will pass as quickly as a Nikola Jokic assist.\n\nI recommended “Mexican American Baseball in the South Bay” in my regular columna three years ago, so why am I plugging its second edition? For one, the audacity of its existence — how on earth can anyone justify turning a 450-page book on an unheralded section of Southern California into an 800-page one? But in an age when telling your story because no one else will or will do a terrible job at it is more important than ever, the contributors to this tome prove how true that is.\n\n\"Mexican American Baseball in the South Bay\" is part of a long-running series about the history of Mexican American baseball in Southern California Latino communities. What's so brilliant about this one is that it boldly asserts the history and stories of a community that too often get overlooked in Southern California Latino literature in favor of the Eastsides and Santa Anas of the region.\n\nAs series editor Richard A. Santillan noted, the reaction to the original South Bay book was so overwhelmingly positive that he and others in the Latino History Baseball Project decided to expand it. Well-written essays introduce each chapter; long captions for family and team photos function as yearbook entries. Especially valuable are newspaper clippings from La Opinión that showed the vibrancy of Southern Californians that never made it into the pages of the English-language press.\n\nMaybe only people with ties to the South Bay will read this book cover to cover, and that’s understandable. But it’s also a challenge to all other Latino communities: if folks from Wilmington to Hermosa Beach to Compton can cover their sports history so thoroughly, why can’t the rest of us?\n\nOne of the most surprising books I read this year was Jorge Iber’s “The Sanchez Family: Mexican American High School and Collegiate Wrestlers from Cheyenne, Wyoming,” a short read that addresses two topics rarely written about: Mexican American freestyle wrestlers and Mexican Americans in the Equality State. Despite its novelty, it’s the most imperfect of my four recommendations. Since it's ostensibly an academic book, Iber loads the pages with citations and references to other academics to the point where it sometimes reads like a bibliography and one wonders why the author doesn’t focus more on his own work. And in one chapter, Iber refers to his own work in the first person — profe, you’re cool but you're not Rickey Henderson.\n\n“The Sanchez Family” overcomes these limitations by the force of its subject, whose protagonists descend from Guanajuato-born ancestors that arrived to Wyoming a century ago and established a multi-generational wrestling dynasty worthy of the far-more famous Guerrero clan. Iber documents how the success of multiple Sanchez men on the wrestling mat led to success in civic life and urges other scholars to examine how prep sports have long served as a springboard for Latinos to enter mainstream society — because nothing creates acceptance like winning.\n\n“In our family, we have educators, engineers and other professions,” Iber quotes Gil Sanchez Sr. a member of the first generation of grapplers. “All because a 15-year-old boy [him]…decided to become a wrestler.”\n\nHeard that boxing is a dying sport? The editors of “Rings of Dissent: Boxing and Performances of Rebellion” won’t have it. Rudy Mondragón, Gaye Theresa Johnson and David J. Leonard not only refuse to entertain that idea, they call such critiques “rooted in racist and classist mythology.”\n\nThey then go on to offer an electric, eclectic collection of essays on the sweet science that showcases the sport as a metaphor for the struggles and triumphs of those that have practiced it for over 150 years in the United States. Unsurprisingly, California Latinos earn a starring role. Cal State Channel Islands professor José M. Alamillo digs up the case of two Mexican boxers denied entry in the United States during the 1930s, because of the racism of the times, digging up a letter to the Department of Labor that reads like a Stephen Miller rant: “California right now has a surplus of cheap boxers from Mexico, and something should be done to prevent the entry of others.”\n\nRoberto José Andrade Franco retells the saga of Oscar De La Hoya versus Julio Cesar Chávez, landing less on the side of the former than pointing out the assimilationist façade of the Golden Boy. Mondragón talks about the political activism of Central Valley light welterweight José Carlos Ramírez both inside and outside the ring. Despite the verve and love each “Rings of Dissent” contributors have in their essays, they don't romanticize it. No one is more clear-eyed about its beauty and sadness than Mondragón’s fellow Loyola Marymount Latino studies profe, Priscilla Leiva. She examines the role of boxing gyms in Los Angeles, focusing on three — Broadway Boxing Gym and City of Angels Boxing in South L.A, and the since-shuttered Barrio Boxing in El Sereno.\n\n“Efforts to envision a different future for oneself, for one’s community, and for the city are not guaranteed unequivocal success,” she writes. “Rather, like the sport of boxing, dissent requires struggle.”\n\nIf those aren’t the wisest words for Latinos to embrace for the coming year, I’m not sure what is.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "Letters to Sports: No defense for the Rams, or Bill Plaschke's prediction",
    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section share their thoughts on the Rams, Dodgers, UCLA and Mick Cronin, as well as the NBA Cup.",
    "fullText": "Once again, Bill Plaschke has literally jinxed another Southern California sports team with his proclamation questions regarding the Rams:\n\nWho’s going to stop the unstoppable offense?\n\nWho’s going to score on the persistent defense?\n\nWho’s going to outwit the coaching genius?\n\nI have the answers, and it's not just Seattle. It's their special teams, their defensive backs and it's coach Sean McVay's play-calling. Well, maybe the referees … but that's for another day.\n\nThanks again for the poison-pen article, Bill.\n\nJust four days after Bill Plaschke promised that the Rams would win the Super Bowl, the team blew a big lead and lost in a stinker to the Seahawks. Like my mother told me when I was a kid: Be honest, respect others, and bet against Plaschke — you'll win every time!\n\nCan we quit the Rams praise now? They can’t tackle anyone that gets past the line of scrimmage. Coach Sean McKay and defensive coordinator Chris Shula went into a shell as the Rams lost the game to the Seahawks and any chance of a long playoff run.\n\nHow many more times do we need to see Emmanuel Forbes chasing a receiver because of a blown coverage or missing an assignment and giving up a big play. The secondary is the weak link in the Rams defense and he’s absolutely a broken link. Chris Shula, please put someone else back there. The mascot Rampage would be a better choice than Forbes.\n\nBill Plaschke writes of the Rams: \"Who's going to score on the persistent defense?\" Maybe the Lions with 34 points?\n\nWilliam P. Bekkala\nWest Hollywood\n\nBill Plaschke's Rams encomium is puzzling. During the course of the game I watched, Detroit moved through the Rams defense like Sherman through Georgia. This was, at best, park football. The first team that exploits the Rams defense as the Lions did and consistently moves the ball on offense will defeat the Rams.\n\nJust when the Rams thought that they solved their kicking situation, they lost another game because of a missed field goal. After the game, they must have been kicking themselves.\n\nIt looks like the Bills are going to win the Super Bowl, because Plaschke wrote, \"The Bills? Not ever.\"\n\nThose who think what the Dodgers are doing is sound financial decision-making only have to look a little in front of their noses. The Dodgers have now committed over a billion dollars in deferred salary. What happens when that bill becomes due? They will commit another billion in the same buy-it-now, pay-it-later mode.\n\nOther teams can’t and shouldn’t follow this lead, which eventually fans pay for in higher prices for everything Dodger related. We will have their management to thank for the impending 2027 MLB labor stoppage and no baseball at that time.\n\nJust when you think that things could not possibly get any worse in Westwood, UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond adds five more years to Mick Cronin’s contract.\n\nKudos to the Knicks for apparently deciding not to hang a banner to signify their NBA Cup championship, despite not winning a title since 1973, whereas the Lakers have won 11 since that time. Hopefully new ownership of the Lakers will reverse course and take down the Lakers’ barren banner for their 2023 Cup championship.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

    "title": "Is there a secret to playing college sports? This boys coach says yes",
    "description": "Linda Martindale, a boys high school coach, mental fitness expert and mom to collegiate players, says college athletes have this special ingredient.",
    "fullText": "Linda Martindale wasn’t brave, at least she didn’t think she was after she had been hired as a varsity boys basketball coach.\n\n“Once the game started, I was fine,” says Martindale, now in her sixth season leading Lincoln-Sudbury (MA), “but walking into the gym and people thinking I'm the scorekeeper or whatever, I had to sort of overcome this feeling of, ‘Do I belong in the gym?’ ”\n\nShe made the three words her mantra, and she convinced herself she was brave. You need to be as an athlete, or a coach, in today’s world of youth sports.\n\n“I have fond memories of my athletic career, but I also know there was a lot of heartache and it was very difficult,” says Martindale, who played Division II basketball at Alaska-Anchorage and in the old Pac-10 at Arizona in the late 1980s and early 1990s. “But nowadays, it's totally different. Your whole career is splashed all over social media.”\n\nMartindale’s father devoted his life to coaching baseball and football, driving her and her three siblings to be punctual and polite. He was hard on them, she says, but led with love.\n\n“If I had a bad game, the people in the stands knew and my parents knew, and that was it,” Martindale tells USA TODAY Sports. “You'd come home and your parents would say, ‘How did the game go?' You could self-report that. Easy to deal with.\n\n“My oldest son would literally get DMs from strangers that say horrible things if he missed a free throw in the clutch. The landscape is very different. And it obviously trickles down to youth.”\n\nMartindale got certified as a mental fitness coach to help ease the pressure on her three sons and one daughter (all of them have played college sports) but also other young athletes.\n\nShe works with sports teams at Division I Holy Cross and D-III Curry College, as well as individual athletes. She says there’s a secret beyond the physical component to playing sports in college.\n\nWe offer 10 ways, through consultation with Martindale, for parents to help athletes get there.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nWhen Martindale walked into the gym feeling the male eyes on her, she felt she needed an inner coach.\n\nYour coach on the court or field will tell you what to do but, Martindale says, the one in your head will kick you in the butt to help get you where you need to go.\n\nJenny Levy, who has won four national titles as North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, believes so strongly in an inner coach she likes when her players form their own mantras.\n\n“Confidence looks good on you,” she heard her players say to each other in 2013, the year they broke through.\n\n“A lot of coaches will say, ‘This is our saying,’ ” Levy told Martindale on Martindale’s ‘Game Changers’ podcast. “And I think that’s fine – to each his own – but I actually let our team organically come up with their own little things. This is the team having a good time together.”\n\nThe inner voice tells you it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, only what you do.\n\nTo come up with your own mantra, Martindale says, ask yourself why you play a sport? Look for performance cues to grind that thought into you.\n\n“It's not fun to lose, but it's still really fun to compete and to play,” Martindale says. “OK, good, let's start with that. So at least you can say it's not fun to lose, but it's really fun to prepare for the game. We've now established that the majority of the time is fun. Now we can get through the parts that aren't fun.”\n\nWas that ‘fun’? How Coco Gauff’s tough US Open embodies what the word means\n\nKids respond to the truth. We don’t need to always sugarcoat it.\n\nInstead of saying, “It’s not so hard,” acknowledge that something is.\n\nMaybe you’re afraid that you might lose or you’re going to make a fool of yourself in front of everybody.\n\n“I'm happy that you can articulate a fear,” Martindale might tell an athlete. “Now, let's squash it. What are you really afraid of? Is it really embarrassing to lose, or is it embarrassing not to play at all?\n\n“It would be embarrassing if you threw yourself on the floor and screamed and cried in the middle of the game. But nobody thinks it's embarrassing that you sat on the bench, cheered on your team, and then fought another day to try to get some minutes.”\n\nA current role doesn’t mean an ultimate role. Martindale goes back to Tom Brady.\n\nHe was once buried deep on Michigan’s depth chart. But he focused on nailing reps he got in practice. He was at game speed when he found himself starting.\n\n“As parents, we say, ‘I don't think you should have to be the backup quarterback,' \" Martindale says. “ 'I think you should be the quarterback.’ This is not helping. What you need to do is crush being the backup. And then your time comes and you're ready instead of spending so much time worrying that you don't have the role that you want (and) you're not ready for it.”\n\nAnother of her podcast guests, Luke Avdalovic, a former walk-on basketball player at Northern Arizona University, told her: “I had a teammate named JoJo Anderson and he told me, ‘If you want to find a role into this team, find one thing that you’re really good at. Make sure you’re head and shoulders better than every single other person on the team. Then they can’t take you off the floor.’ ”\n\nAvdalovic became a top sharpshooter who rose to the NBA G-League.\n\nAvdalovic has shot so much over the years he feels he’s never really in a slump. Some days he shoots better than others, but that is just the law of averages.\n\n“You can't be a pitcher if you can't pitch poorly,” Martindale says. “You can't be a shooter if you can't miss. It's just not possible (to) be perfect. So what do you do when you're imperfect?”\n\nThe next time your son or daughter has a bad game, ask them, “Did you compete hard?”\n\nYou don’t want them to lose or fail but they need to know how to do both. As parents, and as coaches, our best support can come out of struggles.\n\nYou know the term if you’re a baseball fan. Suddenly, Steve Sax or Chuck Knoblauch can’t make a routine throw from second to first base, or Rick Ankiel can’t throw a strike.\n\n“Yips is not a real thing,” Martindale says.\n\nStruggles come alive, she says, when we say them out loud. Instead, if you’re a parent or a coach, tell your athlete: “I really believe in you. Just keep throwing, you'll get it back, you'll find a rhythm.”\n\nWhen kids feel deep-rooted support, they have more confidence in themselves.\n\nMartindale says today’s world for young athletes is like taking the SATs while your score is being put on a scoreboard.\n\nSometimes, it seems, we expect our kids to be good at everything. Martindale asks the ones with whom she works, “What class are you good at?”\n\nShe doesn’t necessarily mean classes in which they have an “A,” but the ones they enjoy most.\n\nSometimes it takes looking at things through a less critical lens. We have an “A” in science, but we enjoy the challenge of English Lit, in which we have a B-, which energizes us to try and bring up the grade.\n\nEugene Glisky, Martindale’s father, had his ashes buried on the field where he coached near Toronto. She suspects he changed the lives of many young men.\n\nBut she stops short of calling a team a family.\n\n“When a coach says to a parent, ‘I'm gonna treat your son or daughter like my own,' I want to say, ‘No, thank you. I don't need you to treat my son like he’s your own,’ ” Martindale says. “He has a great father. What I really want you to do is treat him like a player and a human being.\n\n“It's a team, which is amazing and I love my kid being part of a team. But it's not a family. Why? Because what happens when your family cuts you?”\n\nThere are times when we need to be Coach, and times when we need to be Mom or Dad. Martindale had to be Coach when Judson, her oldest who now plays basketball for Manchester Basketball Club in the United Kingdom, came out of a game when he was younger and looked at her like, “Why are you pulling me?\n\nHe threw his water bottle, and she turned and said: \"You can take your sneakers off. You're done.\"\n\nThe same coach, though, drove him home from a different game, criticizing him for what he didn’t do while failing to realize he was sick.\n\n\"So many examples of total failure by me,\" she says. \"What kind of mother would be talking to their kid about some offensive set when clearly they needed a mother?\"\n\nLevy, North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, does parent Zoom calls. Before the first one, she asked her players what they wanted her to tell them.\n\n“They said, ‘We don’t want to talk about the game at the tailgate after,’ ” Levy told Martindale. “ ‘We don’t want any parent to have this sad conversation after the wins because their kid didn’t play. We want the parents to sit together. We want them to be positive on the sideline.’ ”\n\nLevy says the players gave her a Letterman top 10 of parent no-no’s, which she shared on the Zoom.\n\n“I think they were pretty shocked,” says Levy, who coaches her daughter, Kate, on the team. “Our kids were like, ‘Last year was not OK. This is what we want and this is what we need this year.’\n\n“And then if we saw it, I had permission from our players to call the parent and say, ‘Hey, you’re at the tailgate and your behavior was below the line for our program.’\n\n“What if I acted like that as a parent? What if I did that in the middle of a tailgate?”\n\nLevy’s point: A kid could be completely happy but if the parent is unhappy with their role, then the kid’s unhappy. And if the parent isn’t feeling like their kid is getting a fair shake, or they’re being really negative toward coaches or teammates, the kid internalizes the feeling.\n\n“Your influence is not neutral, parents,” Levy says.\n\nDuring a clip Martindale shared of her speaking to athletes, she says, “There has to be wins in there. Otherwise, you can't go an entire season and be like, ‘If we don't win a game, this whole season is a waste.’ ”\n\nShe is not necessarily talking about checks in the “W” column as much as what we perceive as personal wins. Maybe you tell a teammate you loved the way he blocked a punt or moved into position on defense. If we don’t have wins, even within losses, you don’t learn how to win.\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nMartindale believes there are five pillars of mental fitness: 1. Staying in the moment; 2. Controlling the controllables; 3. Seeing mistakes as opportunities; 4. Not judging yourself (or others) too harshly and 5. Comparison (positively).\n\nShe says she was once a failure at all of them. Has she since learned a special ingredient we need to have to play college sports?\n\nMartindale thinks Angela Duckworth, director of the Penn-Wharton Behavior Change for Good Initiative, said it best.\n\n“It’s grit,” Martindale has said. “I'm obsessed with grit, because we know it's a single defining characteristic of successful people.\n\n“Can you get up after you get knocked down? The athletes who are successful at every level of college, I think, have this kind of dog mentality that is about grit. And of course, you have to be skilled and you have to be athletic but when we really look at who performs best when it counts, it's people who have failed. Over and over and over. And then now they succeed.”\n\nWe can’t beat our kids up over mistakes. Let them hear the voice in their head that gives them the grace to move forward from them.\n\nThen, as Martindale says: “Watch them fail and then watch what they do after they fail.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "fullText": "Girona FC returns to Montilivi this Sunday, December 21, at 2:00 PM to face one of the most challenging opponents in the EA Sports League 2025-26, Atlético de Madrid. The match comes at an intense moment in the season, with both teams determined to earn valuable points towards their respective football goals.\n\nGirona approaches this match after a very positive weekend, with a notable away victory against Real Sociedad (1-2), their first win of the season away from Montilivi. This triumph comes in a context where Girona has competed with determination in recent league matches, also achieving notable draws such as the 1-1 against Real Madrid and the 1-1 against Betis.\n\nMeanwhile, Atlético de Madrid arrives at Montilivi with a solid trajectory in the league despite some recent difficulties. In the previous matchday, the team led by Diego Simeone returned to winning ways with a 2-1 victory over Valencia, with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Koke, regaining confidence after some matchdays with irregular results. This triumph has boosted the team's confidence and helped them remain among the top teams in the LaLiga standings. The Madrid team has also competed internationally, achieving an important result for their European aspirations in the Champions League group stage by winning 2-3 away against PSV.\n\nAmong the most memorable matches is a thrilling 4-3 victory by Girona against Atlético played at Montilivi in January 2024, a duel with goal alternations and intensity, in which the Girona team delivered a memorable offensive performance. On the other hand, in the 2024-25 season, the home match ended with an adverse result (0-4) against Atlético on matchday 38 of the league, a game where the Madrid team showed great offensive effectiveness.\n\nAnother recent example was at the beginning of that same season, when Girona visited the Metropolitano and, despite competing, ended with a 3-0 defeat against the Madrid team.\n\nThe Girona fans will have a date with high-level football at home this Sunday, with the team's commitment to compete intensely from the first minute. As the season progresses and with every point at stake in LaLiga, this preview of the match against Atlético de Madrid sets up a clash that promises excitement, strategy, and dedication from both squads, with Montilivi as the stage for the showdown.",

    "fullText": "Love him or hate him — Jake Paul knows how to draw a reaction out of people. Friday's latest sideshow fight was no different.\n\nIn a matchup that baffled the fight world, former two-time unified heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua made easy work of Paul, dropping the YouTuber-turned-pugilist four times en route to a brutal sixth-round knockout live on Netflix. Joshua was an overwhelming BetMGM favorite coming into the weekend for good reason — the Englishman, who stands 6-foot-6 with a monstrous 82-inch reach, towered over Paul in both stature and résumé, and he put those advantages to good use.\n\nAfter a slow start, Joshua battered Paul around the ring in a bizarre and lopsided fight that saw Paul repeatedly dive for Joshua's legs as if he was shooting an MMA-style double-leg takedown. Paul said afterward that he believed he suffered a broken jaw due to Joshua's powerful punches.\n\nNot surprisingly, given how high-profile Paul's fights have become, the sports world had plenty to say about six rounds it witnessed Friday.

We also had the captain, vice captain and all of the backroom team - we could not have done what we did without all of them.\"",

I know how much hard work and dedication it takes, so it is a pleasure to just be in this room. I feel truly honoured to just be a part of it.\n\n\"2025 has been the year I made my dreams come true.

    "fullText": "Netflix has signed ESPN’s Elle Duncan as its first sports anchor. As part of her multiyear deal, she will lead on-air coverage for Netflix Sports across the streamer’s diverse portfolio of growing sports coverage.\n\nHer first on-air hosting gig will be in early 2026 with “Skyscraper Live,” where free solo climber Alex Honnold will attempt to scale Taipei 101, the tallest building in Taiwan.\n\n“Joining Netflix feels like being invited to an already legendary party and somehow getting handed the aux cord!” Duncan said. “For a lifelong utility player, a multisport assignment is a full-circle moment, and being trusted with something this one-of-a-kind feels incredibly special and surreal. I’m bringing boundless energy, storytelling and bad puns no one asked for but will be subjected to anyway.”\n\n“Also, I was told this fast-tracks my kids to meeting the KPop Demon Hunters, so … win-win,” she added.\n\nDuncan comes from ESPN, known for her work on “SportsCenter,” “College GameDay” and “WNBA Countdown.” She specifically covered college and professional basketball, hosting “College GameDay” for women’s basketball across the country.\n\nNetflix has expanded its sports portfolio signing deals with the NFL, MLB, the Women’s World Cup, WWE, FIFA and more, so Duncan’s coverage slate will be diverse.\n\n“Elle Duncan’s proven ability to seamlessly move between hard-hitting sports analysis and warm, personality-driven cultural hosting makes her a perfect fit at Netflix,” Gabe Spitzer, vice president of sports at Netflix, said. “She immediately adds credibility and familiar star power to our global programming slate.”\n\nThe television host started her career in Atlanta, as an anchor for NESN and spending six years as an Atlanta Hawks sideline reporter. She joined ESPN in 2016, where she hosted the 6 p.m. ET edition of “SportsCenter” and held key roles across college and professional basketball. Her final “SportsCenter” appearance was Tuesday.\n\nThe post Netflix Taps ESPN’s Elle Duncan as First Sports Anchor in Multiyear Deal appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "FOX Sports and IndyCar have announced the race broadcast start times for the upcoming 2026 season.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, IndyCar will have a record 19 network windows, with all 17 races featured on broadcast television. It is also the second time in as many years that IndyCar will be the only premier motorsports series in North America with all races broadcast on network television.\n\nUnique to this upcoming season is the summer stretch that also features FOX Sports’ coverage of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The opening match on Sunday, June 21, will lead into the IndyCar Series round at Road America set for 2 pm (all times Eastern). That theme continues as one game in the World Cup’s round of 16 follows the 12:30 pm start time for the race at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course on July 5.\n\nThe only broadcast time unconfirmed is the Music City Grand Prix at Nashville Superspeedway on Sunday, July 19, with the 400-mile race immediately following the FIFA World Cup Final. A start time will be confirmed at a later date.\n\nThe 2025 season was the first year of IndyCar’s multi-year partnership with FOX Sports, with viewership increasing 27% from the previous season. It was the “fastest growth curve of any major sport,” according to the press release.\n\n“Once again FOX Sports is providing an unparalleled platform to showcase the most competitive and dynamic racing series on the planet,” Penske Entertainment Corp. president and CEO Mark Miles said. “On the heels of significant milestones and momentum last year, this new season will provide meaningful opportunities to reach new audiences and build upon the best growth trajectory in all of sports.”\n\nOther notables of the broadcast schedule include the second round of the season at Phoenix Raceway, which will be a unique shared weekend with NASCAR. IndyCar’s return to the 1-mile oval for the first time since 2018 will see race coverage for North America’s premier open-wheel championship begin at 3 pm Sunday, March 7.\n\nThe inaugural Grand Prix of Arlington is set for Sunday, March 15, with a 30-minute prerace beginning at 12:30 pm.\n\nCoverage for qualifying for the 110th Running of the Indianapolis 500 begins at 4 pm on Saturday, May 16 and Sunday, May 17. Additionally, “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” on Sunday, May 24 will feature an extensive six-hour broadcast for the second consecutive year, beginning at 10 am.\n\nIndyCar boss Doug Boles explains new officiating system\n\nIndyCar’s debut round on the Streets of Markham at 12 pm on Sunday, August 16.\n\nLastly, the 2026 season finale is set for Labor Day weekend in a return to Laguna Seca, with coverage beginning with a prerace show at 2:30 pm on Sunday, Sept. 6.\n\n\"There is so much to look forward to on the 2026 NTT IndyCar Series schedule, including our first race at Arlington,” said Pato O’Ward, driver of the No. 5 Arrow McLaren Chevrolet. “As we have already seen in this new partnership, it is one of the most exciting, new additions to our calendar in recent years, and FOX Sports will provide the perfect showcase for our fans watching on TV. The new season can’t get here soon enough.\"\n\nCoverage of all IndyCar practice and qualifying sessions will be featured on either FS1 or FS2, FOX One and the FOX Sports app. The coverage schedule for Indy NXT, the development category for IndyCar, will be announced at a later date.\n\n“I’m a big sports fan, so having the 2026 IndyCar schedule share the stage with FOX’s coverage of the World Cup next summer is going to be exciting,\" said Kyle Kirkwood, driver of the No. 27 Andretti Global Honda. \"2025 was a breakout year for me, and it was especially rewarding to see it all play out on FOX in their first IndyCar season. We’re looking forward to another strong season for the No. 27 Andretti Global Honda, and I’m eager to see what FOX has in store for the upcoming season.”\n\nFOX SPORTS’ 2026 NTT INDYCAR SERIES RACE COVERAGE SCHEDULE:\n\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway Road Course\n\nWeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Former model Stacey Williams said Donald Trump groped her at Trump Tower in 1993 while her then-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein watched on in what she described as “some sort of twisted game.”\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the Friday deadline to release the remaining Epstein files, the 57-year-old former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model opened up to The Daily Beast Podcast about her brief relationship with the late sex offender when she was in her twenties and he was in his forties.\n\nWilliams told host Joanna Coles that she met Epstein at a dinner party with other models, “and that’s how I started dating him, which led to, obviously, months later, him walking me into Trump Tower to be groped, assaulted by Donald Trump while the two men stood there and walked and talked as it was happening.”\n\nEpstein and Trump were close friends for many years until a bitter falling-out, supposedly over Epstein poaching Trump’s staff.\n\nIn retrospect, Williams said, it made sense why Epstein kept directing her toward Trump Tower while they were out on a walk and convinced her to “just drop by and see him.”\n\n“I do remember little snippets of Trump saying, ‘Oh yeah, her career is on fire.’ You know, that thing that he does: ‘Everything’s the best,’” she said. “And Jeffrey just kept—he didn’t intervene. He watched it, and then he raged at me in the elevator and on the way down that I allowed it to happen. You know, either it was some sort of twisted game, and he didn’t get the result he wanted. Maybe it was a bet. I don’t know, but I’m confident that that is what occurred.”\n\nShe ended her romance with Epstein soon after.\n\n“I just said, ‘Jeffrey, you are extremely mentally ill and you need to get help. There’s something deeply wrong with you. And stop calling me. I don’t want anything to do with you.’ And he, oddly enough—this is hard for people to understand—but he got weepy. He was very sad.”\n\nThe model previously told The Daily Beast Podcast that Trump “came out of his office right outside of, in sort of the waiting area, and started groping me while the two of them continued having a casual conversation… He’s just moving his hands sort of up and down my body and, like, smiling at him. And Jeffrey smiling back.”\n\nWilliams first went public with her allegations against Trump on a “Survivors for Kamala” Zoom call last year. Though she told NBC News at the time that she had no communications with the Kamala Harris campaign team, that didn’t stop the White House from accusing her of having political motivations.\n\n“These accusations were unequivocally false when they were first contrived and nothing has changed. Democrats and the mainstream media are desperately trying to use this hoax as a distraction to talk about anything other than President Trump’s tremendous successes,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the Daily Beast.\n\nLast year, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt similarly said, “These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris Campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false.”\n\nUnder the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump’s Department of Justice must release the federal investigation files related to the disgraced financier by Friday.\n\nThe co-author of the law, California Democrat Ro Khanna, warned that Justice Department officials “could be subject to prosecution given the federal law” and “hauled in front of Congress, the Oversight Committee” if they fail to release the files on time.\n\nNew episodes of The Daily Beast Podcast are released every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday.

    "description": "Comment: After the year of his life, the award should go to Rory McIlroy – though it does not make it a scandal if the public decides to crown someone else",
    "fullText": "Rory McIlroy will be feeling confident when he takes his seat in the audience at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award tonight. We will know that simply because of his presence in the room, and because it is an honour that still carries enough significance and prestige that you want to be there if there’s a good chance you’re going to win.\n\nOthers may disagree. McIlroy, in the past, has been among them. But then, for some, bashing the Sports Personality of the Year contest is as much of an annual ritual as the prize itself, an opportunity to take cheap shots at the BBC, among other things.\n\nMcIlroy has enjoyed an exceptional year, the stuff of dreams, spearheaded by two successes at the Masters and Ryder Cup so astonishing that they may as well have been scripted. There’s no argument against that.\n\nHe won the Masters but did so on an agonising final round that displayed his vulnerabilities and the strength to overcome them, the qualities that make him such an endearing, inspiring champion. Leading Europe to an away Ryder Cup victory, against that American crowd at Bethpage Black, further strengthens his credentials and claim to a season that stands above the rest.\n\nAnd with McIlroy, there is also the sense of if he isn’t crowned SPOTY this year, then when will he ever be? There may be an acknowledgement of legacy and past achievements now that he has completed golf’s career slam. Certainly, given Andy Murray won SPOTY three times and Lewis Hamilton has done so twice, few would argue that McIlroy would not belong in their company in terms of British sporting greats of the past 20 years.\n\nSo, sure, the Northern Irishman should probably win, but this is also a public vote, decided on the night, and the history of this award can tell us it is rarely that straightforward.\n\nAt which point, it is worth considering what may happen should McIlroy lose out, or, rather, what the reaction would be depending on who he could lose out to. The Daily Mail has already declared there would be a “stain” on SPOTY should McIlroy not win the award this year.\n\nWhy? Yes, McIlroy has the strongest case in terms of his achievements. Yes, his victory at Augusta and what Europe achieved at Bethpage Black stirred emotions and created unforgettable drama. But, increasingly, the biggest factor in SPOTY voting can be the divide between sport that is behind a paywall and sport that is open to the largest audience possible, and it is a line that McIlroy, through no fault of his own, falls on the wrong side of.\n\nIt is why Chloe Kelly or Hannah Hampton (unless they split the vote) may stand as the biggest threat to McIlroy after another major tournament victory for the Lionesses. It is why Ellie Kildunne is an excellent outside contender, and why her world champion Red Roses may beat both Europe’s Ryder Cup team and the Lionesses to team of the year.\n\nSport is ultimately at its best when it brings people together. Its power is greatest when it can uplift and inspire. Ultimately, the most-watched moment of 2025 was Hampton saving from Aitana Bonmati and Mariona Caldentey and Kelly thumping her penalty into the net as the Lionesses won the Euros again – becoming the first England football team to win a major tournament on foreign land. The victory that had within it the capacity to influence society was the Red Roses lifting the World Cup at a sold-out Twickenham, a dominant, jubilant team celebrating how it had broken down barriers while demonstrating that strength and athleticism come in different shapes and sizes.\n\nAn accusation often levelled at the BBC is that its diminished offering of live sport means it has lost other events that consistently conjured this magic, such as the Masters. But in turn, the decision to platform the Women’s Euros and Women’s Rugby World Cup has seen audiences, particularly female viewership, hit record numbers. The success of a Lionesses or Red Roses team can now become a national event in the same way as men’s football or men’s rugby. It’s almost as if making live sport accessible and these athletes visible, following decades of marginalisation and catering to the male audience, has brought in new fans and levels of interest across a broader range.\n\nThis should be celebrated. But then, this is the BBC. To some, even the all-female presenting line-up of tonight’s event, in Gabby Logan, Clare Balding and Alex Scott, is evidence of an organisation and SPOTY award that has gone overly woke and lost its shine. You can probably imagine, then, what the reaction would be should either Kelly or Hampton follow Beth Mead in 2022 and Mary Earps in 2023 and win, even if more than 16 million people watched the Lionesses’ latest tournament victory.\n\nHow the votes between Kelly and Hampton are split will be another factor as, for the first time, two members of the same team have been named on the final shortlist. Why both? It may be down to England’s bewildering summer of survival and Kelly’s rather curious role within it, the star who delivered on the biggest moments but yet did not start a match. Over the course, Hampton was integral to keeping the Lionesses alive, and the goalkeeper was unlucky not to win player of the Euro 2025 – she was certainly England’s.\n\nThe truth is that any of the six on the final shortlist would deserve to win. That includes the two individual world champions, one crowned at the start of the year and the other less than a fortnight ago, in Luke Littler and Lando Norris, both of whom are immensely popular as well. But, after the year of his life, it should be McIlroy. It does not, though, make it a scandal or bring a “stain” on the award if the public decides to crown someone else.",

    "fullText": "Scarlet Knights across a wide variety of fall and winter sports earned recognition this past week, headlined by national podium finishes, conference and national honors, and academic acknowledgements. This includes preseason, midseason, and postseason awards, watch lists, and national medals.\n\nRutgers divers Bailee Sturgill and Katerina Hoffman had a standout showing at the 2025 USA Diving Winter Nationals, teaming up to earn a silver medal in the synchronized platform event with a second-place score of 488.91. Additionally, Sturgill added a second silver medal on synchronized 3M, as she teamed up with Lilly Witte of Indiana. The duo had a final score of 528.12, trailing the winning duo by roughly 31 points.\n\nSturgill and Witte won the synchronized 3M event in May during the USA Diving Nationals, but were unable to go back-to-back. Sturgill also competed on the 3M dive, while Hoffman also competed in the 1M and 3M events.\n\nSturgill was previously named the Big Ten Diver of the Week after winning the 3M dive against Princeton in November. She currently holds a spot on Rutgers’ all-time top-10 list in the 1M, 3M, and platform dive.\n\nAt the 2025 Winter Junior Nationals, Emilana Gonzalez finished fifth in the 50-meter freestyle at the East Regionals on the campus of Indiana University. She posted a time of 22.40, which was the second-fastest time in Rutgers program history. Several other Rutgers signees competed at the US Junior Nationals, as the Scarlet Knights recently announced a talented eight-person class.\n\nStar running back Antwan Raymond picked up a major college football award, winning the Cornish Trophy as the most outstanding Canadian player in NCAA football. He was also named a semifinalist for the Doak Walker National Running Back Award.

Dildy made the list for the second straight year after a 2025 season in which she qualified as an individual on beam at the NCAA Regional Championships.\n\nHer score of 9.850 also helped Rutgers qualify for NCAA Regionals for the first time in 11 seasons.

She has career highs of 9.900 on vault, beam, and floor.\n\nLeese is ready to make her return to competition after missing the 2025 season rehabbing from injury. She owns the program record in the vault with a 9.925, which Leese accomplished in both 2023 and 2024. She qualified for the 2023 NCAA Regionals on vault and boasts a 9.925 career high on floor and a 9.850 on beam. She is also a team captain for the second straight year and has a multitude of academic Big Ten honors to her name.\n\nRutgers will open their 2026 season with a tri-meet shortly after the New Year, hosting Temple and Brockport at Jersey Mike’s Arena on January 4th.\n\nRutgers also celebrated academic excellence this week with 141 student-athletes named to the 2025 Fall Academic All-Big Ten list, representing a wide range of programs, including football and other fall varsity sports.\n\nCassidy Kidd (women’s cross country), Graham Kois (men’s soccer), and Rachel Quigley (women’s soccer) were highlighted on the Big Ten’s list for their perfect 4.0 GPAs. 65 football players were named to the list, including Sean Cooper, Bryan Felter, Henry Hughes Jr., Tyler Needham, Michael O’Connor, and Gus Zilinskas, who earned the honor four times as Rutgers student-athletes.\n\nEach of the 141 student-athletes was on a fall varsity team, enrolled full-time at the institution for a minimum of 12 months, and received a cumulative term GPA of 3.0 or higher, showing the university’s commitment to balancing strong athletics and academics.\n\nTo support me and my work, please follow @arnavsarkar100 on X!",

When asked for his prediction, Paul kept it bold and simple: \"It’s going to be the biggest upset in sports history.\"\n\nPaul doubled down on his prediction, comparing his impending victory to the monumental Giants-Patriots Super Bowl upset of 2007 and dramatically calling the event \"the Boston Tea Party 2.0.\" As always, he was not afraid to say what was on his mind, providing some soundbite-worthy moments throughout the night.\n\nMeanwhile, the veteran Joshua— stepping back into the ring after a September 2024 loss to Daniel Dubois— remained composed, focusing on his professional approach.The tension was palpable when Joshua's viral quote, \"If I can kill him, I’ll kill him,\" was brought up; he had an icy calm response, stating simply, \"It’s my job.\"\n\nFinally, as the two faced off, it was exactly what fans came to expect: a smaller, confident Paul against a silent former heavyweight champion of the world. Soon enough, the two will decide it in the ring.\n\nThe Sporting News followed all the action from Wednesday night’s press conference.

    "fullText": "SCOR, the interactive sports ecosystem, launched Fun.SCOR.io – a mobile and Web ecosystem.\n\nThe gaming firm has launched its much-awaited unified ecosystem across two chains for improved accessibility.\n\nThe native token SCOR is now live on OKX, Gate, and Bybit.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of blockchain gaming, SCOR is making some notable moves that could shake up the landscape for sports fans and crypto enthusiasts alike.\n\nThey’ve just rolled out Fun.SCOR.io, a new web and mobile platform that serves as a one-stop shop for their extensive ecosystem of sports-themed mini-games.\n\nThe on-chain sports giant debuts its central web and mobile platform, empowering its massive player base with true wallet freedom via a simultaneous deployment on two major blockchains. The native token, SCOR, is now available on Bybit, OKX, and Gate.\n\nWith over 2 million active users already on board, it’s building on existing integrations in messaging apps and now providing players with a dedicated space to participate in tournaments, collect athlete characters, and prepare for PvP battles in the future.\n\nThe new web and mobile platform enables fans to play a variety of minigames with a pro sports theme, collect on-chain professional athlete characters, compete in tournaments, and soon participate in skill-based PvP challenges.\n\nTom Mizzone, Founder/CEO of Sweet, the developer of the SCOR ecosystem, said;\n\n“With the launch of Fun.SCOR.io, we are effectively opening the stadium doors to the broader Web3 world. A platform this size requires robust infrastructure, that is why we are going multichain on day one. By deploying on both Base and Mantle, we are ensuring our 2 million users enjoy a seamless, low-cost experience with true asset portability, regardless of which wallet or network they prefer.”\n\nThe real game-changer here is SCOR’s move to go multichain from day one, rolling out simultaneously on Base and Mantle.\n\nBase, the Ethereum Layer 2 from Coinbase, offers extremely low fees and lightning-fast transactions, making it ideal for high-volume trading. Mantle, with its modular design, adds another layer of scalability and efficiency.\n\nThe Fun.SCOR.io ecosystem launch provides gamers with a plethora of options, including the ability to connect any self-custody wallet on either chain. Thanks to the SCOR-ID system, gamers’ progress and assets flow seamlessly across both chains.\n\nFun.SCOR.io is now live, serving as the central hub destination for the ecosystem’s skill-based sports gaming.\n\nUsers can connect via their preferred self-custody wallets on either Base or Mantle, enjoying the specific benefits of each network.\n\nSCOR’s multi-chain play feels like a practical evolution toward more open and user-friendly Web3 sports experiences.\n\nWith such a strong user base already engaged, it could push the whole sector away from single-chain limitations and toward something truly interconnected. Exciting times are ahead for sports fans who are dipping into blockchain.\n\nThe post SCOR Launches Fun.SCOR.io as 2M-User Sports Ecosystem Goes Multichain on Base and Mantle appeared first on ccn.com.",

    "fullText": "Netflix will exclusively carry three Barstool Sports video podcasts, marking the streamer's third major podcast deal. Netflix has been readying a slate of shows for early 2026 as it looks to enter the space dominated by YouTube.\n\nNone of the podcasts prominently features Barstool's famous founder, Dave Portnoy, who hosts \"The Unnamed Show.\" The deal also doesn't include Barstool's popular \"Million Dollaz Worth of Game,\" which ranked 33rd in US audience reach in the third quarter, as measured by Edison.\n\nPortnoy said in a statement that he hoped the deal would drive new audiences for the shows. Netflix pointed to the shows' \"unfiltered commentary, sharp takes, and undeniable humor\" as a reason behind the deal.\n\nNetflix has made similar deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia. As with those deals, the video versions of the Barstool shows will be pulled off YouTube and run exclusively on Netflix. The audio versions will remain available elsewhere. The deal includes new episodes and certain library episodes of each show.\n\nNetflix's move into video podcasts is part of a broader effort to expand its content offerings beyond its core of TV series and movies. The streamer has added content from YouTubers like Mark Rober, event-focused sports fare, and games as it looks to boost engagement time. Netflix is also aiming to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studios business.\n\nThe Barstool deal brings the total number of shows involved in Netflix deals to at least 33. Netflix has told some Hollywood agents that it wants to have 50 to 75 titles ready to go early next year.",

All my brothers did sports. So I’ve been doing them since third grade.”\n\nShe’s played numerous sports throughout the years, but truly found her stride in cross country, even setting a school record her freshman year. But before her season even started this year, she tore her ACL, an injury that can put athletes on the bench for more than 9 months.\n\n“It’s been an emotional journey because running is my big thing,” Harris said. “I didn’t know if I’d be able to run this season with my team and keep our streaks alive and just be there for my team because that’s what I love doing.”\n\nThrough her recovery process, she said she found out she might be able to compete this season.\n\n“I got told by my doctors that if I put in the work at physical therapy this summer, that I would be able to get back to running before surgery,” Harris said.\n\nSo that’s what she did, working every week to get better and better to overcome this injury while pushing her team to grow together through a difficult season.\n\n“In a strange way, the injury has grown us all because as a coaching staff, we’ve been able to see our kids rally around one another, and other kids got stronger and maintained that going into the season,” Girls’ athletic coordinator JB Littlejohn said.\n\nDuring this recovery, Harris became an inspiration to her teammates and peers.\n\n“She was our athlete of the Year last year as a freshman,” Littlejohn said. “Her competitive nature, combined with her work ethic, you put that with the natural talent, that’s why we’re seeing what she’s doing.”\n\nThrough determination and hard work, Landry and her team made it all the way to the state cross country meet.\n\n“It was very like congratulating, and I felt like my efforts and everything that I went through paid off finally,” Harris said.\n\nYou can now stream KETK and FOX51 News live 24/7 on your smart TV with KETK+, our brand-new app!

    "fullText": "It's a scene you would expect to see in Tokyo.\n\nBut the sound of bare feet padding, and bodies thudding on the mat of a sports hall in Belfast signals an unlikely first - the ancient Japanese tradition of sumo wrestling has landed in Northern Ireland.\n\nSumo Na hÉireann is thought to be the first sumo wrestling club on the island of Ireland and its members are keen to make their mark.\n\nAmong them is Toraigh Mallon, who believes she is Ireland's first female sumo wrestler.\n\nShe says sumo is \"definitely on the up,\" with \"new members coming along every week\".\n\nSumo Na hÉireann club founder Johnny Templeton said the growing interest comes hot on the heels of the professional Grand Sumo Tournament in London's Royal Albert Hall in October.\n\nUnlike professional sumo in Japan, where women are not allowed to compete, amateur sumo does have female competitions.\n\nMs Mallon is determined to break through to the top, and is training hard in preparation for the inaugural British Isles Sumo Wrestling Championship at Ulster University in January, where she expects a \"grudge match\" against her Norwegian counterpart.\n\nShe was drawn into the world of sumo by an advert on Instagram and has not looked back since.\n\n\"I would do anything to get out of the house, because I don't like sitting in, I like being active.\"\n\nFor Toraigh, it's training every night of the week, be that in the gym, boxing and in the dohyō (sumo ring) in preparation for her match in January.\n\nShe said she sees sumo wrestling taking off in Ireland.\n\n\"There's new people here every night, there's a new club in Dublin, it's on the up definitely,\" she added.\n\nIn the amateur games, size and weight doesn't matter just as much as it does in the professional world.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Mr Templeton said: \"In amateur competitions, which we compete in, there is weight classes, so you'll never have to fight someone outside of your weight class, unless you want to.\"\n\n\"The professionals you see on TV, there's no weight classes so they can get as big as they like,\" he said.\n\nMr Templeton said Sumo Na hÉireann came to be after he competed for Team GB in the world championships and in amateur competitions across the UK.\n\nHe got into sumo after competing in other types of martial arts and wrestling for most of his life and after having sumo success in the UK, that's when he decided to carry sumo over to Ireland.\n\nSumo Na hÉireann is just over a year old, and expanded to Dublin last month.\n\nMr Templeton believes sumo wrestling has found a home here in Ireland, and thinks sumo has some interesting similarities to an old Irish form of wrestling.\n\n\"The way sumo is the native, indigenous traditional wrestling of Japan, Ireland does have that as well, it's just that it's practice has been lost over the years.\"\n\nTraditional Irish wrestling is called collar-and-elbow wrestling.\n\n\"It is focused mostly on foot sweeps, and is a type of jacketed wrestling but the goal is very much the same as it is in sumo.\n\n\"The parallels are amazing,\" he added.\n\nRising sumo star Matt Wilson has been competing in the UK and has his eye on the world championships next year.\n\nSumo is his passion, and he said aside from the weekly bouts, he trains hard in the gym and keeps an eye on his diet.\n\n\"I used to eat loads to get my weight up so I could wrestle some of the heavier guys,\" he said.\n\nNow he keeps a \"maintenance weight\" so he is able to fight faster and still stay heavy.\n\nMr Wilson said he \"can definitely see sumo exploding\" in the UK and Ireland especially after the Grand Sumo Tournament in London.\n\nFrom leg stomps to drive away evil spirits, to throwing salt to purify the ring (or dohyō), and burying food as an offering, sumo wrestling is steeped in traditions and sumo wrestlers (or Rikishi), live highly-regimented lives.\n\nMost sumo wrestlers in Japan are required to live in communal sumo training stables, where every aspect of their daily lives - from diet to dress code - are dictated by traditions.\n\nYet while the ancient Japanese customs are acknowledged and respected at Sumo Na hÉireann, the focus is on the wrestling, and everyone is welcome.\n\nThe basic principle of sumo is that a match is decided by a fighter either being forced out of the circular dohyō (ring), or touching the ground inside the ring with any part of the body other than the soles of the feet.\n\nRitual, wrestling and Reddit: Grand Sumo meets internet fandom in London",

The post Kevin Byard III among five players to watch in Bears vs Browns Week 15 game appeared first on Marquee Sports Network - Home of the Cubs, Bears, Red Stars and Sky.",
    "fullText": "This Sunday’s game between the Chicago Bears (9-4) and the Cleveland Browns (3-10) at Soldier Field is going to test the players, coaches and fans with frigid temperatures potentially dropping below zero.\n\nOne team is fighting for playoff positioning, while the other is using these final regular-season games to end a double-digit loss season on a positive note.\n\nHead coach Ben Johnson said on Wednesday at Halas Hall that his team “desperately” needs to win this week. The Bears are currently the seventh seed in the NFC playoff picture, and a loss only opens up the possibility of the No. 8 seed Detroit Lions (8-5) leapfrogging the Bears for the final Wild Card spot.\n\nHere are five players to watch on Sunday who will have a major impact on this Week 15 game.\n\nThe Bears’ defense gave up far too many explosive plays in last Sunday’s loss to the Green Bay Packers. Kevin Byard III and the Bears’ secondary will have to prove they can limit those 20-plus yard chunk pass plays against a Browns offense that has the third-fewest big completions (28) in the NFL, according to Radar360. Byard mentioned during his Wednesday press conference at Halas Hall that the secondary has to “tighten up with the execution of different coverages.”\n\nOne area that could help Byard and the rest of the defense is playing more effectively on early downs.\n\n“I think looking at the last game, Green Bay was eight-of-12 on third downs, I think seven of those third downs were three and less,” Byard said. “So that means that they were really good on first and second downs. We had to be better on early downs to be able to get guys in the third-and-long because we’re really good on third-and-long. I just think those are a couple things we have to button up. We’re just continuing to get better.”\n\nIn the Browns’ 31-29 loss to the Tennessee Titans last Sunday, Cleveland’s defense gave up 184 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 25 carries. Titans running back Tony Pollard scored both rushing touchdowns and accounted for 161 yards, including a 65-yard touchdown in the first quarter.\n\nThere is no reason why Kyle Monangai shouldn’t have a huge impact on Sunday in the frigid cold. The Bears’ rookie running back ran for 57 yards on 14 carries and ran in a two-point conversion attempt against the Packers last Sunday.\n\nSmall preview of my discussion with Kyle Monangai. \n\nHow does the Bears' running back keep his balance after big hits?\n\n— Nicholas Moreano (@NicholasMoreano) December 11, 2025\n\nIf the Bears’ offensive line continues to reset the line of scrimmage and create rushing lanes, Monangai could be in store for a big game.\n\nAn underlying storyline to follow is how Monangai and Browns rookie running back Quinshon Judkins perform. Judkins leads all rookie running backs with 784 rushing yards this season, and Monangai is third with his 648 yards.\n\n[READ: Kyle Monangai analyzes his running style in Bears’ NFL Week 14 loss]\n\nMontez Sweat is having a relatively productive season rushing the quarterback. His 8.5 sacks are the 12th most in the NFL. Read more about Sweat’s impact in the in-depth article that Scott Bair wrote for Marquee Sports.\n\n[READ: How Montez Sweat impacted Bears’ winning 2025 season, NFL playoff push]\n\nThe Bears’ defensive end will have a favorable matchup on Sunday with starter Jack Conklin out with a concussion. Former 2024 seventh-round draft pick KT Leveston filled in on the right side in last Sunday’s loss to the Titans, and Leveston allowed four total quarterback pressures and was penalized for holding.\n\nSweat’s career high in sacks is 12.5, and with four regular-season games remaining, he has a chance to break that mark. A well-played game against the Browns would help him to achieve that milestone.\n\nMyles Garrett is on pace and most likely will break the NFL’s single-season sack record by the end of the regular season. The 6-foot-4, 272-pound pass rusher has a career-high 20 sacks and is just three sacks away from breaking Michael Strahan’s and T.J. Watt’s 22 1/2 NFL shared record.\n\ncloser and closer to history for @flash_garrett#TENvsCLE on Fox and NFL+ pic.twitter.com/fpa81LW4cR\n\n— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 7, 2025\n\nThe Bears must have a sound protection plan so that the single-season sack record isn’t set at Soldier Field. Offensive tackles Ozzy Trapilo and Darnell Wright will both be tested, as Garrett is someone who will line up all over the defense.\n\nHis primary matchup will be against the second-round rookie in Trapilo. According to Pro Football Focus, Garrett has lined up on the defense line’s right side for 521 of his 633 D-line snaps.\n\nThe Browns’ rookie quarterback is coming off his best performance of the season, throwing for 364 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in the team’s 31-29 loss to the Titans.\n\nShedur Sanders showed good accuracy throughout the game, especially on his touchdown throw to David Njoku in the second quarter.\n\ndiving grab by the Chief for the TD!#TENvsCLE on Fox and NFL+ pic.twitter.com/vAXy3LajdT\n\n— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 7, 2025\n\nAccording to Next Gen Stats, Sanders has excelled at throwing passes behind the line of scrimmage, totaling +5.1 EPA, the sixth-highest mark in the NFL. However, the rookie quarterback has a -17.9 EPA on all other throws, which is the fourth-lowest among quarterbacks.\n\nIf the Bears can minimize the production on some of the shorter route concepts, Chicago’s defense should have success against the Browns’ passing attack.\n\nThe post Kevin Byard III among five players to watch in Bears vs Browns Week 15 game appeared first on Marquee Sports Network - Home of the Cubs, Bears, Red Stars and Sky.",

    "description": "It is setting up to be a very interesting offseason for the Cleveland Browns, who have to decide whether or not to stick with Shedeur Sanders or draft another quarterback. One CBS Sports analyst weighed in in his latest mock draft.",
    "fullText": "Browns predicted to ditch Shedeur Sanders for 24-TD mobile quarterback in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThings have gotten more interesting at the quarterback position for the Cleveland Browns in recent weeks.\n\nThat's because Shedeur Sanders has been playing at an impressive level for a rookie since getting the starting job following Dillon Gabriel's injury, and so much so that the Browns have declared him as the starter the rest of the season.\n\nThat was the right move by the Browns, as it's quite clear Sanders has been playing much better than Gabriel was over his six starts and deserves a longer look.\n\nIf Sanders can keep this up, the Browns will have to decide if what will be a seven-start sample size is enough to move forward with Shedeur or if they're going to use one of their most valuable picks on another quarterback in 2026.\n\nCBS Sports' Josh Edwards sees the latter happening.\n\nIn his latest mock draft, Edwards has the Browns taking Oregon quarterback Dante Moore with the No. 4 overall selection, which would essentially mean the Browns aren't moving forward with the Colorado product.\n\nDante Moore started as a true freshman at UCLA, so while it is true that he has been on an Oregon team with superior athletes to its opponents, that is not the full picture. Also, in a lesser discussed narrative, Moore was born in East Cleveland. There has been a lot of talk about him returning to Eugene for another season, but it would be tough to deny top-5 overall money after offensive coordinator Will Stein left to take the head coaching job at Kentucky. The door is open for Shedeur Sanders to earn an extended look as well, but the sample size is small thus far.\n\nMoore is having another strong season, completing 72.5% of his passes for 2,733 yards and 24 touchdowns to six interceptions, which has led many to believe he's worked his way into the conversation as one of the top quarterback prospects, although he isn't a lock to come out of college.\n\nThe Draft Network describes Moore as a \"mobile quarterback who has good velocity on throws with accuracy to all three levels of the field.\"\n\nTDN is concerned about Moore's arm strength because he \"loses some velocity on throws that are deeper down the field,\" and the outlet also points to Moore's \"mechanics under pressure\" as another area that needs work.\n\nOutside of some legendary performances over the final four weeks of the year, we find it very hard to believe the Browns will pass up on a quarterback they love in next year's draft in favor of sticking with Sanders.\n\nIf that's the case and the Browns draft a quarterback following a strong finish to his season, Sanders is almost certainly going to be unhappy about that and then we'd have to start wondering if a trade might be in his future.\n\nWhat Shedeur does have going for him is that next year's draft class isn't great for the quarterback position, so it's possible Cleveland just doesn't take one because they aren't thrilled with the options when they're on the clock.\n\nThere are so many layers to this that makes it one of the most interesting situations in the NFL once we get to the offseason.\n\nWhat Cleveland does at the quarterback position is going to be one of the more interesting story lines this offseason, and that's before mentioning the Shedeur angle in all this.\n\nHow Panthers can clinch NFC South title over Bucs as soon as Week 16\n\nExtent of T.J. Watt's injury, status for Steelers game revealed by insider\n\nCeeDee Lamb injury update confirms Cowboys WR's Week 15 status\n\nTodd Bowles drops 7 F-bombs in heated post-game presser\n\nWhat Falcons' Week 15 win means for Rams' draft pick",

    "fullText": "LINCOLN, Neb. (Courtesy of Nebraska Huskers Athletics) – The No. 1 Nebraska volleyball team cruised into the NCAA Regional Finals with a 25-12, 25-11, 25-12 sweep of No. 16 Kansas on Friday night in front of a crowd of 8,800 at John Cook Arena at the Bob Devaney Sports Center.\n\nThe Huskers (33-0) were dominant from start to finish, never trailing in the match. NU hit .450 – its third-highest attack percentage of the year – and stifled the Jayhawks (24-11) to a season-low .029 hitting percentage. Nebraska also out-blocked Kansas, 10-1, out-dug the Jayhawks 48-30 and had six services aces and only three errors while KU had one ace and six errors.\n\nNebraska’s middles were dominant, combining for 21 kills on 28 error-free swings (.750 attack percentage) while adding eight blocks. Rebekah Allick had nine kills on nine swings to hit 1.000, and she added three blocks. Andi Jackson also had nine kills on .600 hitting with five blocks. Manaia Ogbechie produced three kills on four swings in the third set.\n\nHarper Murray added seven kills and had a match-high 10 digs. Bergen Reilly dished out 30 assists while Olivia Mauch had a season-high three aces.\n\nThree players led Kansas with six kills.\n\nSet 1: NU got off to a 4-0 start on Choboy’s serve with a kill by Allick and two blocks by Jackson, one with Adriano and one with Murray. After Kansas got on the board, NU scored a 6-0 run with Mauch serving a pair of aces to go up 10-1. Jackson’s fourth block – with Reilly – and a kill by the junior middle blocker made it 13-3 Big Red. The Jayhawks scored three in a row to cut it to 13-6, but four kills by Allick put NU ahead 18-7. Landfair set Allick for her sixth kill on six swings, and a solo block by the senior middle blocker made it 21-8. Jackson and Landfair tacked on kills for a 25-12 win.      \n\nSet 2: Adriano had an early kill and an ace, and Murray and Jackson each posted a kill and a block together as the Huskers built a 7-3 lead. KU pulled within 9-7, but a Murray kill started a 5-0 run with Allick providing two kills and a block with Adriano. The lead grew to 10 at 19-9 after a block by Allick and Adriano and a kill by Murray. An Adriano kill made it 20-9, and Jackson and Murray teamed up for a block and a 22-11 lead. The Huskers closed out a 25-11 win on a Choboy ace.\n\nSet 3: Sigler had two kills, and Landfair and Jackson pounded away for a 9-4 NU lead. Landfair tacked on another kill before one by Manaia Ogbechie put NU ahead 13-6. Ogbechie, Murray and Jackson added kills, and Murray served an ace to help the Huskers go up 20-9. NU went on to finish the sweep, 25-12.\n\nUp Next: Nebraska will take on No. 6 Texas A&M in Sunday’s NCAA Regional Final at 2 p.m. on ABC. The Aggies beat No. 9 Louisville, 3-2 in a reverse sweep, in the first match on Friday.\n\nWith the win, Nebraska advanced to an NCAA Regional Final for the 34th time in program history. The Huskers’ 34 regional final appearances are the most in NCAA history. Nebraska has made an NCAA Regional Final in 13 of the past 14 seasons.\n\nThe Huskers played their 175th NCAA Tournament match tonight. Nebraska and Stanford are the only two programs to play 175 NCAA Tournament matches.\n\nWith the win, Nebraska improved to 137-38 all-time in the NCAA Tournament. The Huskers rank second in NCAA history in postseason wins and winning percentage (.783).\n\nThe win was Nebraska’s 33rd consecutive victory. The Huskers are 33-0 this season, marking the third straight season Nebraska has won 33 matches. The 33 wins tie for the second-most victories in a season by a Husker team in the NCAA era (1981-present).\n\nNebraska improved to 34-7 all-time in NCAA Regional Semifinal matches, including a 17-1 record in matches played in Lincoln.\n\nThe Huskers improved to 90-7 all-time in home NCAA Tournament matches, including a 35-2 record at the Devaney Center.\n\nNebraska has won 90 home matches in the NCAA Tournament while only four other schools have 90 or more total victories in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNU has won 29 consecutive home matches in the NCAA Tournament, a school record.\n\nOverall, Nebraska has won 63 consecutive home matches dating back to Dec. 1, 2022. That ties for the fifth-longest streak in NCAA Division I history and ties for the second-longest streak in Husker history.\n\nWith the win, Nebraska improved to 13-0 against ranked opponents this season. The 13 victories against ranked opponents are tied for second in school history, one shy of the school record (14 in 1998).\n\nNebraska won the first two sets and is now 106-2 all-time in the NCAA Tournament when taking a 2-0 lead.\n\nNebraska was the first to 20 points in each of the three sets. The Huskers are now 95-0 this season in sets when reaching 20 points first.\n\nThe Huskers held Kansas to fewer than 15 points in all three sets. That marked the second time this season that Nebraska has held its opponents to fewer than 15 points in every set, with both occurrences coming against top-25 teams (also against No. 25 Penn State on Nov. 28).\n\nNebraska won the first set, 25-12. That marked the Huskers’ 46th consecutive set won at home this season. That is a school record for consecutive sets won at home in one season, eclipsing the 45 consecutive home sets won by the 2004 team.\n\nOverall, Nebraska has now won 48 consecutive sets at home which ties for the second-longest streak in school history, trailing only the 52 consecutive home sets won spanning the 2001-02 seasons.\n\nNebraska stuffed four of Kansas’ first 11 swings of the night, recording four blocks in the first eight rallies. The Huskers had as many blocks in the match’s first 15 rallies (5) as they did in their second-round sweep of Kansas State last Saturday.\n\nFueled by the block, Nebraska won 13 of the first 16 rallies of the match to take a 13-3 lead.\n\nNebraska finished with 10 blocks in the match, tying for its highest block total in 13 matches.\n\nThe Huskers hit .450 in the match, its third-highest attack percentage this season. Two of Nebraska’s three matches this season hitting .450 or better have come in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNebraska has now hit above .400 in nine matches this season, the most in a single season in the rally-scoring era (2001-present).\n\nThe Huskers played three middle blockers in the match in Rebekah Allick, Andi Jackson and Manaia Ogbechie. The middles combined for 21 kills on 28 error-free swings. Allick had a kill on each of her nine swings.\n\nAllick also had three blocks in the match, increasing her career total to 539 blocks and moving into 10th place on Nebraska’s all-time blocks list.\n\nHarper Murray had seven kills in the match, increasing her career total to 1,156. She passed Lexi Sun and moved into 10th place on Nebraska’s career kills list in the rally-scoring era.\n\nOlivia Mauch had a season-high three aces in the match.\n\nNebraska limited Kansas to a season-low .029 attack percentage. The Jayhawks’ previous low was a .104 hitting percentage against Kansas State on Oct. 24.\n\nThe Huskers have held 15 opponents under a .100 hitting percentage this season.\n\nKansas did not have a block until the 31st rally of the third set. The Jayhawks finished with one block, marking the third time this season a Husker opponent has totaled only one block.",

    "fullText": "Premier Sports Cup final: St Mirren v Celtic\n\nVenue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Sunday, 14 November Kick-off: 15:00 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sounds & digital\n\nCeltic manager Wilfried Nancy says victory in Sunday's Premier Sports Cup final against St Mirren would \"validate\" what he is trying to implement at his new club.\n\nBut he insists he will have \"many other\" chances to prove himself to their supporters.\n\nNancy became the first Celtic boss to lose his first two matches in charge as they were swatted aside by Roma in the Europa League on Thursday following last weekend's Scottish Premiership defeat by Heart of Midlothian.\n\nMany supporters had left by the time the full-time whistle blew and those that remained expressed their frustration at both the result and performance.\n\nGiven the importance of Nancy's first three matches in charge, some fans were confused by the timing of his appointment.\n\nThe Frenchman understands what is at stake at Hampden but insists he is not thinking about the prospect of a third straight defeat.\n\n\"For me? No,\" he said when asked about the importance of winning a trophy.\n\n\"For my players, yes. And for the fans, yes.\n\n\"Yes, I would like to win the trophy. I'm pretty sure that, if we don't win it, it's going to be difficult, because when we lose, this is painful.\n\n\"But, again, I am optimistic as a person. So hopefully we're going to do it. And also if it's going to validate what we are doing. But, if not, I don't want to think about this because, for the moment, I want to stay positive and this is the way I think.\n\n\"I'm going to have many, many other times to show, to do my stuff and to convince the fans that I am the right guy.\"\n\n'Nancy exposed to brutal life as Celtic manager as cup final looms'\n\nDoes Nancy 'know what he's walked in to' amid horror Celtic start?\n\nNancy inherited a side that had won seven from eight matches under interim manager Martin O'Neill, but he stamped his own identity on the team from the start, switching to a back three against both Hearts and Roma.\n\nWith some players shoehorned into unfamiliar positions, Celtic have struggled to click in attack and were dismantled at the back by Roma on Thursday in a dominant first-half display.\n\nStill, the former Columbus Crew head coach has seen enough to believe his system will come good.\n\n\"I watched the game and obviously we had a difficult moment, but we had also good moments,\" he said\n\n\"This game for me was important because it gives me the possibility to set the standard regarding what we want to achieve and it was good to compare certain things [with Roma].\n\n\"After that, the standard, we have it already. The desire to compete, the desire to train well, the desire to improve, this is the standard.\n\n\"The desire also to do what it takes to have good performance, we have it. We have to be better in terms of execution, but we are on the right track.\n\n\"For one week, I can see good stuff. We need also to improve on certain things, but it will come.\"\n\nGiven the two defeats leading into the cup final, Nancy admitted there will be a degree of doubt but dismissed the idea there was an added pressure on the game.\n\n\"It doesn't change,\" he added. \"A final is a final, it's not the same.\n\n\"Obviously the fact that we didn't win the last two games, mentally we can have a bit of uncertainty.\n\n\"But we're having a good discussion with the players and we know what we did well, we know what we need to improve and everything is clear.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

Forensic analysis in every waking hour. And for the St Mirren manager, suddenly, hope.\n\nA little over a week ago, as Martin O'Neill, the great redeemer, exited the club in a fanfare of gratitude and optimism, Robinson would have to face a team content in its own skin again.\n\nWhat he must see now is something altogether different.\n\nHe's got to be seeing weakness and a chance. Everybody else can see it.\n\nNancy had two ways to go when he took over - he could have done a steering job with O'Neill's team until the January transfer window, when he could start putting his own imprint on things.\n\nOr he could dive right in. And dive right in he has done.",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola has selected an unchanged side for the Champions League clash with Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nThe City boss goes with the same starting line-up that beat Sunderland 3-0 on Saturday in the Premier League.\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS FOR CITY V BRENTFORD\n\nVictory in game six of the league stage would see us move into the top-eight in the Champions League table as we aim to get one of the top spots to avoid the play-offs.\n\nCity travelled to Spain with a 21-man squad with Rodri, Mateo Kovacic and John Stones unavailable due to injury.\n\nREAL MADRID XI: Courtois, Valverde (C), Asencio, Rudiger, Carreras, Tchouameni, Ceballos, Bellingham, Rodrygo, Gonzalo, Vinicius\n\nSubs: Lunin, Fran Gonzalez, Endrick, Mbappe, Guler, Fran Garcia, Brahim, Cestero, Mastantuono, Martinez, Valdepenos\n\nCITY XI: Donnarumma, Nunes, Dias, Gvardiol, O’Reilly, Nico, Bernardo (C), Foden, Cherki, Doku, Haaland\n\nSubs: Trafford, Bettinelli, Reijnders, Ake, Marmoush, Ait-Nouri, Savinho, Khusanov, Bobb, Lewis\n\nCity are in the winning habit, with three victories on the bounce so Pep has stuck with a successful formula.\n\nThat should see Nico O’Reilly and Matheus Nunes as our full-backs either side of Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol.\n\nNico will playing in the holding midfield role with captain and Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden close by.\n\nErling Haaland will again lead the attack with Rayan Cherki and Jeremy Doku offering plenty of threat going forward for the Blues.\n\nIf this feels like a regular fixture, that’s because tonight’s clash will be the 15th time we’ve met since the 2012/13 season, making it the most-played Champions League game during that time.\n\nThat probably reflects our positions as the most successful teams in Spain and England in recent years and even with the familiarity, it certainly hasn’t bred contempt, with the encounter as mouthwatering as ever.\n\nThis will be the fifth successive season that we visit the Santiago Bernabeu with two draws and two defeats in our last four trips and our last win there in February 2020 so a win is due.\n\nCity go into tonight’s match sitting 12th in the Champions League standings and a victory in the Spanish capital would move us into the top eight and therefore avoid the play-offs for the round of 16.\n\nThe new format means those games can present a real pot luck of an opponent; last season we had the tricky task of facing tonight’s opponents who are also the record winners of the trophy.\n\nAhead of tonight’s game, the table shows we would currently face either Italian champions Napoli or Azerbaijani side Qarabag, so it’s a game to be avoided if possible.\n\nThis will be the 15th time that Real Madrid and City have faced each other in the Champions League. Since their first meeting in the 2012/13 season, it is already the most-played fixture in the competition in this period (14 games).\n\nCity have lost our last two games against Real Madrid, suffering defeats home and away against them in last season’s play-off round. This is as many losses as we had experienced in our previous 11 games against the Spanish side combined.\n\nPep Guardiola has faced Real Madrid on 27 previous occasions, winning 48% of those matches and only lost one of his first nine away games. However, he is winless in the most recent four against the Spanish side and has never gone five in succession without beating them.\n\nThis will be the first managerial meeting between Xabi Alonso and Guardiola. Alonso made 79 appearances in his playing career under Guardiola, all for Bayern Munich between August 2014 and May 2016.\n\nSince November 2024, City have lost six of our 12 games in the Champions League. Prior to this run of 12, their previous six defeats in the competition came over the course of 69 matches, between October 2018 and October 2024.\n\nReal Madrid are currently on the third-longest streak of scoring in consecutive home games in European Cup/Champions League history (38 games), behind a 44-game run by Real Madrid themselves (September 2011-October 2018) and one of 45 games by Juventus (April 1973-September 2000). The last visiting side to keep a clean sheet away to Real Madrid in this competition was CSKA Moscow in December 2018 (0-0 draw).\n\nKylian Mbappe has scored nine goals in five games in the Champions League this season; the joint-most by a Real Madrid player in their first five appearances in a single edition, along with Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013-14 (9).\n\nErling Haaland has scored more goals in the Champions League than any other player since his debut campaign in 2019/20 (54). Indeed, two of the only three players who have netted 50+ goals in the competition in this period could both square off in this match, with Real Madrid’s Mbappe also netting 50 times since then (Robert Lewandowski being the other).\n\nMbappe has been directly involved in eight goals in seven games against City in the UEFA Champions League (seven goals, one assist); only Lionel Messi has had a hand in more against us in the competition - nine in eight appearances.",

    "title": "YouTube TV is planning to launch a cheaper 'skinny' sports bundle following its battle with Disney",
    "description": "YouTube TV will offer a cheaper sports-focused package in 2026, which it can offer after tough negotiations with Disney and other media companies.",
    "fullText": "YouTube TV will unveil new prices soon. But this time, it will be good news for sports fans.\n\nYouTube is launching a set of cheaper, slimmed-down versions of its popular live TV service in 2026, which it's calling \"YouTube TV Plans,\" the video giant announced on Wednesday. One of the new plans will be a sports bundle that provides access to ESPN Unlimited, FS1, and NBC Sports Network.\n\nWhile YouTube TV isn't yet revealing pricing for these 10 or so genre-specific packages, they'll cost less than the Google-owned service's typical rate, which is $83 a month.\n\n\"Our goal is to let you tailor your subscription with more options,\" said Christian Oestlien, YouTube's head of subscriptions, in a statement. \"Whether you stick with our main YouTube TV plan with 100+ channels, focus on sports, combine sports and news, or select a plan centered on family or entertainment content, subscribers will be able to easily choose the plan that works best for them.\"\n\nYouTube TV secured the rights to form these so-called \"skinny bundles\" after hard-fought negotiations with Disney, Comcast's NBC, and Fox. YouTube TV's battle with Disney was especially intense, as it left subscribers without ESPN and ABC for 15 days.\n\nJustin Connolly, YouTube's global head of media and sports, said at a media event on Tuesday night that YouTube worked with its partners on \"ingesting the entirety of the sports programming\" in its service, so that YouTube TV can be a one-stop shop for sports fans. Besides aggregating live games, Connolly said YouTube is being fan-friendly by aiming to \"meet the consumer where they are\" on price.\n\nYouTube TV's price has steadily increased since it launched in 2017 at $35, though it's also added more channels. Last December, YouTube TV's monthly price rose by $10.\n\nOther TV providers have launched sports-focused skinny bundles, with some tradeoffs.\n\nFubo's $55.99 a month Sports + News bundle includes all of ESPN and Fox's channels, plus CBS and the NFL Network, but it doesn't have NBC or Warner Bros. Discovery's networks like TNT or TruTV. It also doesn't have the news networks CNN and MS Now (formerly MSNBC), though it has Fox News.\n\nSling TV's Orange & Blue bundle goes for $60.99 and has ESPN, Fox with cable sidekick FS1, WBD's channels like TNT and CNN, and the NFL Network. It also carries local channels like NBC and ABC in certain markets. But Sling doesn't have a deal with CBS, plus its main bundle doesn't include specialty sports networks like the SEC Network, the Big Ten Network, or NBA TV. Sling offers a Sports Extra add-on for $15 a month on its main plan, bringing the total to $76.\n\nDirecTV's MySports package costs $69.99 but is more comprehensive, with the full suites of ESPN, Fox, and WBD, plus all four major local broadcast networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox (with possible exceptions in certain markets). It also carries the flagship networks for four major US sports: the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL.\n\nSports fans could complement those skinny bundles by buying a digital antenna or by using streaming services like Peacock or Paramount+ that give access to NBC and CBS, respectively.\n\nESPN also offers a subscription to its entire suite for $29.99 a month, or a bundle with competing streamer Fox One for $39.99 a month.\n\nYouTube said its new sports plan will have ESPN's full suite of programming plus sports channels from Fox and NBC, with the option to add on NFL Sunday Ticket and RedZone for more money. Otherwise, it's unclear exactly which channels this bundle will have.\n\nAs YouTube TV's sports bundle enters the market, sports fans have more choices than ever. The challenge for them now is finding the right plan.",

    "fullText": "This story is part of the IndyStar project \"Only woman in the room:\" How Indy became top city in nation for women sports execs\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- These five women have combined for more than 125 years of experience in sports careers and beyond. We asked them to give their best advice, lessons learned and how to navigate being a woman in the male-dominated sports industry.\n\nTitle: Chief operating officer of USA Track & Field since 2012\n\nNotable career stop: Washington spent five years with the U.S. Department of Labor, starting as a staff attorney and ending her tenure as deputy associate general counsel.\n\nCareer highlight: Washington was a key figure as USA Track & Field was determining whether to move its national headquarters from Indianapolis. The organization announced last year it would remain in the city and move into IU Indy's new James T. Morris arena in the fall of 2026.\n\n\"Renee deserves a lot of credit for what they've been able to accomplish,\" said Julie Roe Lach, executive vice president of Pacers Sports & Entertainment, \"including choosing to keep their headquarters in Indianapolis.\"\n\nAdvice for younger self: \"I say it to young people all the time, the world is not over tomorrow. You think that you've got to decide what you're going to do now, and you don't. There is time. There's always a new chapter you can write.\"\n\nAdvice for women: \"You can be competitive as women, but if you're going to do that, be competitive against the whole field, not just the women in the field. That is just so important.\"\n\nMaking a mark: \"You have to understand the larger picture in almost anything that you do, which means that you have to ask questions and you have to be inquisitive. And that makes you do your job not just efficiently, you want to go beyond being efficient. It helps you know your organization, and it helps make you of more value than you might have ever thought.\"\n\nTitle: President of Andretti Global, chief operating officer of TWG Motorsports\n\nNotable career stop: Gregory spent nearly 14 years with NASCAR as executive vice president and chief marketing and content officer.\n\nFor most of Gregory's career, she's been the only woman or one of few women in the room, and she's felt eyes looking at her, though she said she never had an overt incident where she felt unfairly treated because of her gender. Early on, she would sit off to the side of the room, instead of at the table, because she didn't have the experience or confidence to be there.\n\nAdvice for women: \"There were times when you kind of look around and say, 'I can't pay attention to the fact that I'm the only woman in the room. I just need to do a good job and prove myself and deliver on my own merits and not get sidetracked and worried about the fact that you might be the only one.' You have to kind of just plow through that.\"\n\nStill a way to go: \"You see this explosion in women's sports, which is fantastic, and the fan consumption, and that's going to help. But when you get into some of the day in, day out, it's not quite as far along as you would think. It's going to catch up, but we still have some work to do. We used to say it doesn't have a finish line at NASCAR and that was on diversity in general. You have to be deliberate about it.\"\n\nBringing the A game: \"As women in our various fields, you have to be prepared. You have to be better, in my opinion. And you've got to come with your A game all the time, and that does put a lot of pressure on you. But when you do that, you perform better, and then you gain more credibility, and then you have that reputation to build on, but you've got to invest the time in that up front.\"\n\nTitle: Senior vice president Penske Entertainment, leading marketing, branding, communications, content and broadcast across the IndyCar series and at Indianapolis Motor Speedway\n\nNotable career stop: Melangton was the second woman in history to lead a Super Bowl as the CEO and president of the 2012 Indianapolis Super Bowl Host Committee. She once had a guy come up to her at a funeral and say, \"Are you that lady running the Super Bowl? That's just crazy to me that they hired a woman.\"\n\n\"And I started laughing,\" Melangton said. \"And instead of being offended, I said, 'Tell me why it's crazy.'\"\n\nLesson learned: Early in her career, Melangton was working for Indiana Sports Corp. as director of events and was asked to help create the Big Ten women's basketball tournament. She went to work with the league negotiating, discussing, planning and, in 1995, it was set. The first tournament would be played at Hinkle Fieldhouse.\n\n\"It was so funny, I didn't know anything about basketball. And the first day, the athletes were throwing the balls out and they said, 'Did somebody break all these balls in?'\" Melangton said. \"I thought, 'What? I don't know anything about that.'\" Melangton and her staff stayed up all night bouncing the basketballs on the court to get them broken in for the games the next day.\n\nAdvice for women: \"Be the most confident person in the room, be better than everybody else, and it takes gender off the table.\"\n\nIn the eyes of her colleagues: \"The authenticity that Allison brings to all of her relationships, whether she knows you for many, many years or is new, there's a confidence and a comfort level that she provides to other women, other female leaders that I think is just amazing,\" said Gregory. \"It's something that motivates me. She leads by example.\"\n\nTitle: Executive vice president of Pacers Sports & Entertainment\n\nNotable career stop: Lach spent more than a decade as commissioner of the Horizon League before being hired by the Pacers in October.\n\nHer start in sports: \"Basketball was always my love, from middle school. They say, 'When you find your passion, you lose yourself while you're doing it,' and I would just lose myself in the midst of the game because I just loved it.\" Lach was a basketball All-Star at Millikin University.\n\nSome of Lach's favorite memories growing up happened on Sundays. The family would go to church, go home and watch WWF, then her dad would drop her off at the gym for pickup games. She'd wait on the sideline to get chosen on a team.\n\n\"I was always the only girl, but it didn't bother me because I could play, I could hang. You'd have to put up with some of the usual shenanigans, but I learned a lot,\" Lach said. \"My dad's proudest moment and his hardest moment was when I got picked ahead of him. But that was always the joke. He'd say, 'I knew you'd finally made it when they were picking you because they wanted to win.'\"\n\nLach was part of creating Indiana Sports Corp.'s 2050 vision, which included making Indy the women's sports capital of the world.\n\n\"No city has claimed it, because no city has done, I would argue, as much as we've already done,\" she said. \"And it's not just sporting events, although that's important. It's women leading in sports.\"\n\nProudest accomplishment: \"It's probably more behind the curtain. Those of us, especially in sports, get emails or calls or are approached by students or people that want to work in sports. I have coffee or Zooms or calls with people at least once or twice a week looking for some mentoring of how do you break in? it is definitely a pay it forward type deal, but it's the right thing to do. I think we all have a duty, and I think that's something that matters.\"\n\nTitle: Owner of Baughman Consulting, which specializes in sports management, bid concept and creation, hospitality and special events. She most recently was lead event director for WNBA All-Star 2025.\n\nNotable career stop: Baughman spent nearly 22 years at Indiana Sports Corp., ending her tenure as senior vice president. Baughman has been a part of putting on Indy's biggest sporting events. Among them the Super Bowl in 2012, the NBA All-Star Game in 2024, the National College Football Playoff in 2022 and so many others.\n\nWhen college football's biggest game was played in Indy, Baughman held the title of president of the 2022 College Football Playoff Host Committee. When she got the job, she had a sense of pride. She knew she had proven herself.\n\n\"It was more just like, 'You're really good at this. We trust you. We want you to do this.' Not, 'You're a woman and we should consider putting a woman in the position,'\" she said. \"Which to me is really important because I want to be the best person doing what I'm doing not the best woman doing something.\"\n\nAsk questions: \"There's so much to be learned from other people. And I feel like no one knows everything. And to be genuine in what you're knowledgeable about and what you think you have a fair opinion on. And when you're really seeking some guidance, that doesn't make you weak or less. It actually is really smart.\"\n\nAt the WNBA All-Star weekend this year, Baughman could be seen rolling carts, helping set up and tearing down, carrying boxes and inventorying T-shirts.\n\n\"Work your tail off. Do everything. Don't be like, 'Oh, I manage, I don't do those things.' Do whatever you need to do and help other people learn how to do it by doing it with them,\" Baughman said. \"I don't really like layers and titles. You get a much better result if you can get people to do things collectively as a group, because it feels more like a shared outcome at the end of the day.\"\n\nSign of a good leader: \"Let other people shine, and get out of the way sometimes.\"\n\nIn the eyes of her colleagues: \"Susan is so creative. So many of the creative things you see in the city related to sports are all her,\" said Melangton. \"She is deeply passionate and pours her entire self into whatever she's working on.\"\n\nFollow IndyStar sports reporter Dana Benbow on X: @DanaBenbow.
