Follow here for live updates as our national recruiting team breaks down who is standing out among the elite prospects in the senior and junior classes.\n\nFULL 2026 Under Armour All-America Game roster breakdown\n\nJoin the discussion on the Rivals recruiting board here.\n\n7:30 p.m. ET: “Ohio State four-star LB signee Cincere Johnson flying downhill to blow up a play at the mesh point.

He ran stride for stride with him for 15 yards. Absolutely insane.” — Cody Bellaire\n\n7:20 p.m. ET: Maryland Five-Star Plus+ EDGE signee Zion Elee corrals 2027 LSU four-star QB commit Peyton Houston in 11-on-11. Nice speed off the edge by Elee. 2027 four-star RB Tranard Roberts is down with what looked to be a non-contact injury.” — Charles Power\n\n7:15 p.m. ET: “Notre Dame 2026 QB commit Teddy Jarrard hits a streaking 2027 Texas five-star WR commit Easton Royal for a long gain.

Alabama wins over LSU signee. Cornerback Censere Gaylord, an IMG academy 2027 talent, has been impressive in coverage.” — Marcus Benjamin\n\n7:10 p.m. ET: “Nice zip by 2027 Illinois four-star QB commit Kamden Lopati over the middle of the field to Eric McFarland who has a bunch of juice with the ball in his hands. McFarland recently reclassified up to the 2027 cycle.” — Charles Power\n\nIllinois 2027 4-star QB commit Kamden Lopati hits elite WR Eric McFarland for a big gain\n\nvia @CodyBellaire\n\nLive Updates: https://t.co/ivQCdyAPIZpic.twitter.com/00DodA9EYU\n\n— Rivals (@Rivals) January 1, 2026\n\n7:00 p.m. ET: “Moving out of position drills into the group period. Team Pearls doing some 7on7: BYU four-star QB signee Ryder Lyons targets Illinois RB signee Javari Barnett on a wheel route, but Barnett doesn’t turn around for the ball … 2027 Illinois four-star QB commit Kamden Lopati hits 2027 four-star WR Trenton Yancey on a comeback … 2027 four-star CB Hayden Stepp with good coverage of 2027 four-star WR Lawrence Britt downfield…\n\nRyder Lyons hits Tyreek King, a four-star WR signed to Tennessee, on the sideline. Lyons later hits 2027 four-star WR Kesean Bowman on a pretty ball downfield. Bowman makes a high point grab over Florida State four-star safety commit Mekhi Williams. Lyons misses high on the next throw.” — Charles Power\n\n6:55 p.m. ET: “Five-Star Plus+ prospect Mark Matthews, the top-ranked offensive tackle in the 2027 class, is practicing at left guard and right tackle. Maryland Five-Star Plus+ EDGE signee Zion Elee is a monster off the edge. Really explosive.” — Marcus Benjamin\n\n6:40 p.m. ET: “2027 Ohio State four-star safety commit Eli Johnson looks the part among the Team Roses DB group. The largest of the group and a smooth, twitchy mover in drills.” — Charles Power\n\n6:20 p.m. ET: “Lamar Brown, the No. 1 overall prospect in the 2026 cycle, will be one we’re excited to see perform in this setting. The LSU signee played more snaps along the defensive front this year, but he’s still green in terms of reps.” — Cody Bellaire\n\n6:07 p.m. ET: “On the hoof, Team Roses has an absolutely LOADED receiver group. Freaky looking body types and movement skills out of that group of pass-catchers. Players like USC four-star signee Boobie Feaster, 2027 five-star Texas commit Easton Royal and 2027 four-star WR Julian Caldwell standout physically and with their movement skills.” — Cody Bellaire\n\n6:05 p.m. ET: “2027 four-star wide receiver Lawrence Britt, the No. 17 WR in the junior cycle, flashing some soft hands early.” — Chad Simmons\n\n5:52 p.m. ET: “BYU four-star QB signee Ryder Lyons is here and throwing.

He’s the top 2026 QB in attendance with the bulk of the signal-callers being from the 2027 cycle.” — Charles Power\n\n5:42 p.m. ET: “2027 Five-Star Plus+ OT Mark Matthews is one of the more well-built OL of the group. Five-star Ohio State DL signee Khary Wilder is on the leaner side and is one who could be more of a DE, at least to start. Five-star LSU DL signee Richard Anderson looks to have trimmed down a bit during the season. 2027 five-star Texas Tech DL commit Jalen Brewster is a lean 300-pounder, he carries the weight well.” — Charles Power\n\n5-star LSU DL signee Richard Anderson going through warmups @UANextFootball https://t.co/SPi7l0kR1A pic.twitter.com/xCiIJnPi0o\n\n— Charles Power (@CharlesPower) December 31, 2025\n\n5:33 p.m. ET: “Oregon five-star TE signee Kendre’ Harrison immediately passes the eye test and stands out within the group. LSU Five-Star Plus+ lineman signee Lamar Brown stands out from a size and build perspective. The same can be said for 2027 Texas A&M four-star safety commit Kamarui Dorsey.” — Charles Power\n\n5:33 p.m. ET: “Temperature for tonight’s practice in Orlando is hovering right around 50°, could dip into the 40s later with slight wind but generally just a colder night out here.” — Cody Bellaire\n\n5:25 p.m. ET: “Practice is set to start around 5:45. First guy out was Oklahoma four-star EDGE signee Jake Kreul, and he flashed Horns down as soon as he saw the camera.” — Chad Simmons",

    "description": "UCLA head coach Cori Close was frustrated with the lack of media coverage after UCLA beat Ohio State on Sunday, but postgame after UCLA's win over Penn State on Wednesday was a different story.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - No. 4 UCLA head coach Cori Close made waves Sunday after the Bruins' thrilling victory over no. 19 Ohio State with her displeasure at the lack of media coverage for the matchup of two Big Ten powerhouses.\n\nThe Bruins outlasted the Buckeyes in an 82-75 victory on the road in a return to conference play with double-digit scoring performances by five different Bruins to secure the win. But after the game, Close was met with an empty conference room and just one reporter, Benjamin Royer of the Orange County Register, over the phone to discuss the game.\n\nClose was frustrated, to say the least.\n\n\"If I'm being really blunt with you, the energy in the building was great, but having no media here at all from either team or either -- no AP, nothing, doesn't say a lot. We're the only double-ranked game out today; the only one in the country, and we had no media day today. No media here... Like for the only game that had two ranked opponents to not have more coverage over this particular game -- disappointing honestly, \" Close said after UCLA's win (via Benjamin Royer of the Orange County Register).\n\nUCLA women's bball coach Cori Close said that I (from Los Angeles, not in Columbus), was the only media member to to talk with her after UCLA's win vs OSU. Close said she didn't mind if I printed her response, so here it is in full.\n\nClose's full remarks are in the photo below: pic.twitter.com/lQ3kiMcBXf\n\n— Benjamin Royer (@thebenroyer) December 28, 2025\n\nClose's words quickly took over over online discourse and revealed two key things: coverage of women's sports still suffers in the face of other sports, namely college football, despite the meteoric rise in popularity for women's basketball, and the overall media landscape is suffering from a lack of resources for road coverage.\n\nWhen the Bruins stepped onto the court next for a dominant 97-61 over Penn State, Close and senior center Lauren Betts were met with a different sight after the game: a Zoom conference full of reporters from outlets like the Orange County Register, Los Angeles Times, and of course, The Sporting Tribune.\n\nClose made it clear in her opening statement that her frustrations earlier in the week stemmed from her desire to continue to promote women's sports and the game that she loves and the passion she has for her team.\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA guard, Kiki Rice (1) dribbling during a NCAA basketball game against Cal Poly on December 16, 2025 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n\"The reality of what my comments were after the Ohio State game were, I have two really passionate agendas in regards to this: I want to be a pioneer of growing the game period. I want to really be a part of the surge that's happening and and I want to be a part of telling these amazing stories that these players have, and they're incredible young women as well as amazing basketball players,\" Close said.\n\nShe continued, \"This is nothing to take away from any men's program at all. I love men's sports just as much as I love women's sports. But, if there was a top five team all year long, and they were playing another ranked team, I don't care what time of year it would be, I think there would be more coverage there. So I just want to fight for our players getting that same proportionate coverage and exposure that I believe they've earned.\"\n\nWomen's basketball has experienced more growth than ever in recent years with stars like Caitlin Clark and Paige Bueckers, now both WNBA superstars with the Indiana Fever and Dallas Wings respectively, shining a massive spotlight on the sport at both the college and professional levels.\n\nUCLA has been a part of that growth as well. An elite squad with several of their starters projected to be first-round picks in the upcoming WNBA Draft, the Bruins under Cori Close have brought a stellar brand of basketball to Westwood. Last season's Final Four-reaching squad brought in over 88,000 fans to Pauley Pavilion to watch a team that ranked no. 1 in the country for most of the season and were led by a superstar in Betts.\n\nJordan Teller - The Sporting Tribune\n\nCenter Lauren Betts #51 high fives guard Kiki Rice #1 of the UCLA Bruins during an NCAA basketball game against the Oregon Ducks, Sunday December 7, 2025 in Los Angeles, Calif.\n\nBetts also spoke after the Penn State win on the issue of media coverage that the Bruins have contended.\n\n\"You have two really amazing teams, and I don't think that's something that should hopefully ever happen again [lack of coverage],\" Betts said. \"So, just continuing to grow the game in any way that we can, and to make sure that we speak out on situations like that. But, obviously I have a lot of respect for Coach Cori and what she had to say about it.\"\n\nClose has been a vocal advocate for the media and for coverage of her team and women's basketball as a whole, and the gratitude she has for reporters at her team's games is something she makes a point of stating in many postgame conferences.\n\nRobert Talamantes- The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA G Gabriela Jaquez (11) scores a fast break layup during an NCAA basketball game against the Michigan Wolverans, Wednesday January 1st, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThere are systemic issues facing the modern sports media landscape, issues acquiring access and resources among them, but just as there are issues there has also been a proliferation of outlets that serve a wide variety of niches in the athletic world. Close wants to serve both traditional and non-traditional outlets in terms of access and availability so that she can continue shining a light on the accomplishments her team has achieved and continue to elevate women's sports as a whole.\n\n\"I always want to be solution minded. I don't want to be just a complainer,\" Close said. \"I really want us to be a team that makes ourselves available, that gives good stories to tell... I think there needs to be access for non-traditional media outlets, as long as you're going for the right reasons, and you're really a part of wanting to tell the stories of these women. I think the days of limiting it to just traditional media outlets are over if we want to continue because.. there are so many squeezes on those traditional media outlets, I think we can't limit ourselves to what's worked in the past or how we've done things in the past.\"\n\nJohn Panganiban-The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA Bruins Coach Cori Close breaking down the game for Avary Cain (2) during an NCAA basketball game against Colgate, Sunday November 10th, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe impact of covering women's programs like UCLA goes well beyond entertainment factor. This new wave of women's sports popularity and the stories that athletes tell serves a humanitarian purpose as well. The inspiration that athletes can bring elevates the lives of the next generation that watches them.\n\nFollowing Betts' portion of Wednesday's conference. Close shared a story that illustrates that impact potential. Betts spoke with ESPN in an article published March 2025 about her mental health journey and after Wednesday's game, Close said that Betts met with one young girl waiting for an autograph that said Betts' article saved her own life. Betts came back to the locker room with happy tears in her eyes.\n\n\"That's just a real time example about why storytelling of these amazing women are so important.\"",

    "title": "A 2025 Year-in-Review of UNC sports in the AP Top 25",
    "description": "There’s been some ups and downs among UNC’s three big teams in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Usually in the early part of the week, one post that gets published here at Tar Heel Blog is our weekly rundown of the AP Top 25 rankings. With football now into bowl season — and UNC not particularly relevant in 2025 — and basketball season in full swing, we usually take a look at the newest AP Poll and highlight where the UNC men’s and women’s basketball teams landed.\n\nHowever, with there not being a particularly large amount of games last week over Christmas, the AP is not releasing new polls this week. Therefore, instead of just reposting the same rankings as last week, I thought we could use these final couple days of 2025 to look back at how the various Tar Heel teams performed in this year’s AP Top 25 rankings, which for the purposes of basketball at least, includes the end of last season.\n\nWeeks Ranked: 8 (out of a possible 20)\n\nHighest Ranking: #12 (first on 12/15, still currently)\n\nUNC’s 2025 in men’s basketball has been a tale of two halves. The Tar Heels quite famously struggled on the court for much of the stretch run of last year’s basketball season, as they barely squeaked into the NCAA Tournament, having to take part in the First Four. They won a game in Dayton, but then lost to Ole Miss in the first round, ending the season on a whimper.\n\nHowever, coach Hubert Davis remade the roster over the offseason, and so far it’s paid off. Caleb Wilson looks like a star, Henri Veesaar has been the perfect fit in the frontcourt, and the team has answers all over the court in general. Carolina is 12-1 on the season so far, and have a couple of potential big wins for the résumé come tournament time. They still have to prove it now in ACC play, but the Tar Heels are in a good place going into 2026.\n\nHighest Ranking: #8 (2/24 last season)\n\nOn the other side of things, the UNC women have appeared in every AP Poll in 2025. They were a good team last year, getting an NCAA Tournament #3 seed and advancing to the Sweet 16. (The less said about what happened there, the better.) They started out this year ranked, and while they’ve slid a little bit from where they started the year, they’re still on track to earn another high seed come tournament time.\n\nCoach Courtney Banghart’s team’s issue both this season and last is that they’ve been a good team, they just haven’t been able to take the step to great. They’ve played games against the UConns and South Carolinas of the world, they just haven’t been able to pull off a win. The potential is certainly there for the program to get to that tier, but they’re not there yet.\n\nEnd of 2024 season ranking: none",

    "description": "Will Smith, Miguel Rojas, Andy Pages, Luka Doncic and so many others delivered marquee moments that helped me endure a terrible 2025.",
    "fullText": "It was the last story I wrote before everything changed.\n\nIt was Jan. 5, 2025, and I was marveling at the Rams gumption in their short-handed loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\n“It was weird,” I wrote. “It was wild.”\n\nI was so witty. I was so wrong.\n\nTwo days later, I was fleeing for my life, steering my car down narrow Altadena streets with a fireball at my back and a nightmarish future sprawled across the smoke-filled streets ahead.\n\nThe year 2025 was more tumultuous than any silly football game and its accompanying overwrought metaphors. It was a year that knocked me flat, tearing me apart from so many things that once anchored me, setting me afloat in a sea of guilt and despair and ultimate uncertainty.\n\nToday, I have a home but no home. My days are filled with the beeps and growls of bulldozers. My nights are draped in the silence of emptiness. What was once one of the coolest secrets in Los Angeles has become a veritable ghost town, the vast empty spaces populated by howling coyotes and scrounging bears.\n\nA lot has changed in the 12 months since the Eaton Fire spared my house but destroyed my Altadena neighborhood. I say a daily prayer of thanks that I did not endure the horror of the 19 people who lost their lives and thousands more who lost their homes. I am beyond fortunate to live in what was left behind.\n\nBut virtually nothing was left behind. Venerable manicured homes have been replaced by weed-choked vacant lots. Familiar local businesses are now empty parking lots. There is the occasional sighting of new construction, but far more prevalent is “For Sale” signs that have seemingly been there for months.\n\nAfter living in the limbo of hotels and Airbnbs for two months while my home was remediated, I was blessed to return to four walls and running water, but beset with the guilt of having a front-row seat to the pain of so many who lost everything. I was spared, but nobody in Los Angeles was spared, and it wasn’t until halfway through the year that I noticed a consistent light from the strangest source.\n\nEvery night, I would watch the Dodgers. At least once every couple of weeks, I would attend a Sparks game with my daughter, MC. Soon, there would be Saturdays with one of our college football teams, then Sundays with the NFL then, the baseball playoffs, leading to the insane Game 7 and morphing into the annual Lakers winter drama.\n\nThe highs, the lows, the dramatics, the desperation, it was all there when nothing was there, it was the feeling that even with everything gone, you still belonged to something.\n\nFrom Dodgers exhilaration to Laker despair, from USC football frustration to UCLA women’s basketball greatness, sports has been the bright wallpaper on a year of Southland darkness.\n\nIt is sports that kept me grounded, kept me steady and somehow kept me believing.\n\nIn the worst year of my life, it was sports that saved me.\n\nThe path back to normalcy began two weeks after the Eaton fire, when I left my temporary hotel room to attend a press conference for the Dodgers’ latest Japanese import, Roki Sasaki.\n\n“Invincible,” I wrote about the team’s rebuilt roster, a word that was so comforting during such a time when everything in life felt tenuous.\n\nI came back to the hotel after the press conference, wrote my story then, like thousands of others in my situation, packed up and moved to another hotel.\n\nSoon thereafter I was awakened late one night with the news of the Lakers stunning acquisition of Luka Doncic. I wrote this column from a rental house while preparing to move to yet another new place. My clothes were in a plastic grocery bag. My house was still in shambles. In Doncic, as least, there was hope.\n\nSeveral days later I attended the Doncic press conference, asked a question, and Doncic asked me to repeat it. Turns out, it wasn’t a language barrier, it was a sound barrier. I was speaking too softly. It was then I noticed that the trauma from the fire had exacerbated my Parkinson’s Disease, which affected my voice, one of the many symptoms which later led me to acknowledging my condition in a difficult mid-summer column.\n\nGood news returned in early March when it was announced that the Dodgers had made Dave Roberts the richest manager in baseball, giving him a new four-year, $32.4 million contract. In a bit of dumb luck that hasn’t stopped me from bragging about it since, 10 years ago I was the first one to publicly push for Roberts’ hiring. In such unstable times in our city, Roberts had become the new Tommy Lasorda, and his presence became a needed jolt of smile.\n\nIn early April, I wrote a column I never thought I’d write — that Bronny James had been transformed from circus to contributor. I also wrote a column that I maybe wish I hadn’t written so soon, that JJ Redick was a Laker success.\n\nIn late May I sadly said goodbye to my second family when I wrote about the end of my 22-year run on ESPN’s popular “Around the Horn” game show. It wasn’t the first time in 2025 that a column brought me to tears, witness the video immediately after the fire. Agreed, I spent the year showing so much emotion for someone who had gotten so lucky. But I’m guessing I wasn’t alone.\n\nTwo weeks later I wrote about my new family, the group of boxers I have joined in my fight against Parkinson’s. That was the toughest column I have ever written, as I was acknowledging something I refused to admit for five years. But the fire had seemingly set the disease ablaze, and I could hide it no longer.\n\nThe year continued with columns about the soon-to-be-retiring Clayton Kershaw, the greatest Dodger pitcher with the greatest entrance song. Hearing “We Are Young” when he took the mound consistently gave me hope that, through the treacheries of a summer that marked the escalation of those insane ICE raids, we can continue to strive for rebirth.\n\nThat’s what sports consistently provided in 2025, the hope that from beneath the rubble, we could all fly again.\n\nI voiced this hope in a Rams preview column that predicted they would go to the Super Bowl. I later wrote a Rams column predicting they would actually win the Super Bowl. I stand by my stories.\n\nAll of which led to a series of Dodger playoff columns that hopefully reflected the building energy of a town enthralled. After their Game 7 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays, I was so spent that I hyperventilated for what felt like an hour.\n\n“In the end, they not only ran it back, they sprinted it back, they slugged it back, and then, finally, they literally Will-ed it back,” I wrote.\n\nIn hindsight those words could have been written not only about a team, but a city, fighting back, staying strong, the results of its struggle mirroring the Dodgers’ consecutive championships, punching through desperation, from struggle to strength.\n\nIn 2025, sports showed me that life can get better, life will be better, that if we hang in there long enough we can all hit that Miggy Ro homer, make that Andy Pages catch, stay forever young.\n\nAnd thus I offer a heartiest and hopeful welcome to 2026.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "The Indiana high school boys basketball upcoming 2025-26 season like others across the country, is in full swing as the winter sports seasons have commenced.\n\nContinuing to top Indiana high school boys basketball are the Fishers Tigers, which is off to a sizzling 8-0 start after going 30-1 last season. The Tigers are back with plenty of talent dotted along their roster, but who else should we watch for out of Indiana when it comes to the state’s top teams?\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory.\n\nHere’s a look at the top 25 high school boys basketball teams in the state of Indiana according to the Massey Ratings, which ranks teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule and margin of victory, as of Dec. 30.\n\nFishers Tigers last year were just a bucket away from repeating as IHSA Class 4A state champions, falling in a heartbreaking, 67-66 decision to Jeffersonville. The team returns plenty of talent from a year ago as they continue to hold the No. 1 spot in our second set of Indiana high school boys basketball rankings. The Tigers brings back a pair of junior guards in Jason Gardner Jr. and Cooper Zachary, whom combined for around 26 points per game a season ago. Coming off a 30-1 season, the Tigers remain the team to beat as they’re off to a strong start through eight games. Gardner Jr. leads the team currently in scoring at 21.3 points per contest.\n\nSpeaking of another Indiana high school boys basketball team that last year ended up falling to Jeffersonville along the way in the Class 4A state tournament was Lawrence North, as they fell to the eventual champions in a 56-49 decision. The Wildcats bring back one of the state’s top power forwards in senior Brennan Miller, who averaged 13.4 points and 8.6 rebounds last season. Also watch out for forwards Kai McGrew and Kenneth Lampley, respectively. Lawrence North has yet to drop a contest as of yet through six games.\n\nCarmel started off the season with a football-like score of a game against No. 12 Zionsville, winning 35-28 to tip things off. Since then, the Greyhounds have been off and running through the Indiana high school boys basketball season so far. The month of January is certainly going to test the mettle of Carmel as they have matchups slated against No. 4 Cathedral (Jan. 3), No. 5 Plainfield (Jan. 16) and No. 20 Westfield (Jan. 10), respectively.\n\nThe Cathedral Fighting Irish dropped down a spot in our first set of regular season rankings in Indiana as they started the preseason at No. 3. Detroit Mercy commitment Keaton Aldridge, who averaged 11.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists last season, is back in the lineup. Another key player that’s back for the Fighting Irish this season is guard Julien Smith, who was second on the team in scoring in 2024-25 at 13.5 points per game. Both players have come on strong this season for the Fighting Irish as Aldridge leads the team with 18.5 points, 9.5 rebounds a game and Smith is averaging 18.3, respectively.\n\nRounding out the Top 5 of the Indiana high school boys basketball rankings is the Plainfield Quakers, which went 16-8 in the 2024-25 season. The Quakers have a solid roster coming back that includes senior power forward Noah Smith, who is committed to DePaul. The three-star forward has provided the punch in the front court for Plainfield as Smith is averaging 20.6 points and 8.6 rebounds per contest this winter.\n\n6. Crown Point Bulldogs (6-0)\n7. Mt Vernon Marauders (10-2)\n8. Pike Red Devils (7-1)\n9. La Lumiere School Lakers (3-1)\n10. Ben Davis Giants (4-2)\n\n11. Noblesville Millers (5-4)\n12. Zionsville Eagles (5-4)\n13. Silver Creek Dragons (8-1)\n14. Crispus Attucks Tigers (5-2)\n15. Roncalli Royals (6-0)\n\n16. Riley Wildcats (5-0)\n17. Penn Kingsmen (5-2)\n18. Brownsburg Bulldogs (6-3)\n19. North Huskies (6-0)\n20. Westfield Shamrocks (3-3)\n\n21. Saint Joseph Huskies (7-3)\n22. North Central Panthers (4-3)\n23. Homestead Spartans (7-2)\n24. Northridge Raiders (7-1)\n25. Portage Indians (10-0)\n\nFor Indiana high school boys basketball fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "description": "After skiing and snowboarding for decades and teaching my kids the winter sports, I have great tips for first-time beginners hitting the slopes.",
    "fullText": "I've been skiing and snowboarding my whole life, and I've even taught my children how to tackle the slopes.\n\nEvery so often, while riding the chairlift, I look down upon some out-of-control skier in soaked-through jeans, a snow-flecked sweatshirt, and cotton gloves. A few moments later, they crash into some obstacle and tangle themselves among their skis and poles.\n\nIt reminds me that although these sports can be fun winter activities, if you're not properly dressed or prepared, you're putting yourself and others at risk.\n\nWhether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, here are a few tips for staying safe on the mountain.\n\nSlope safety begins at home. Before you leave, consider your outfit.\n\nYou'll definitely want waterproof snow pants and a jacket that will keep the wind and rain off of you, but your layers don't have to be anything fancy.\n\nTo start, you may be able to cobble together something warm from what you already own. Try wool sweaters, synthetic running shirts, and that random fleece vest that you own but never wear.\n\nI think it's pointless for a new skier to drop hundreds of dollars on gear, but there are a few body parts worth investing in (hands, feet, head). If you're going to spend money on anything, invest in good gloves.\n\nBeyond that, ski socks are priceless in keeping toes warm. A good neck gaiter and a basic pair of goggles can prevent your nose and eyes from dripping icicles, too.\n\nWhen picking out your gear, keep in mind that anything made of cotton has no place on the mountain.\n\nWhen cotton gets wet — an inevitability for first-time skiers and snowboarders who spend a lot of time on the ground or anyone who's prone to sweating — the material absorbs the moisture, remains wet, and makes you cold.\n\nChoose synthetic materials or natural fibers like wool that help to wick away water from the body and keep you warm.\n\nWhether you're renting or investing in your first pair of ski or snowboard boots, know that they should be snug.\n\nThe boots are meant to react to your feet's movements, so they have to be a little tight. However, they shouldn't be cutting off your circulation.\n\nIf they're uncomfortable in the rental shop, they're going to feel terrible on the mountain.\n\nDo yourself a favor and make sure they feel as close to perfect as possible before you hit the chairlift. The employees in ski shops should be able to help.\n\nOnce you arrive at the mountain, don't look to tackle anything above your level.\n\nIf you're a beginner, head straight for the bunny slopes. There's no shame in learning to turn, stop, and not kill yourself or someone else on the mountain's gentlest run.\n\nThe fastest way to get off the bunny hill is to take a one-hour lesson to help you acquire the basic skills to become a more competent rider.\n\nAfter you gain the fundamentals, progress in order. Conquering the bunny hill doesn't mean you're ready for black diamonds.\n\nHead to green-circle beginner trails to practice your turns and technique. After getting comfortable with those skills on that terrain, try the blue-square intermediate trails.\n\nPro tip: Keep in mind that trail markings are not universal from mountain to mountain. A black diamond in the Poconos usually isn't as difficult as a black diamond in Colorado.\n\nWe're heading into 2026 and not the aughts — a time when people didn't seem to truly understand that speed, hard surfaces, and bare skulls made for dangerous combinations on the slopes.\n\nWhether you're a beginner or a pro, you'll want a helmet. You can usually rent these if needed.\n\nTaking an in-person lesson is the best way to really get the hang of skiing, but here are a few tips and stances to get you started.\n\nFirst-time skiers need to remember two foods: pizza and french fries.\n\nKeep a gentle bend in your knees and shape your skis like a slice of pizza to achieve a more controlled stance, then proceed down the mountain at a reduced speed. Thinner pizza slices make you go faster, and wider ones slow you down.\n\nWhen you're ready to go faster, shaping your skis more parallel, like french fries, will send you straight down.\n\nSnowboarders have fewer food terms to remember, but you'll want to loosely bend your knees and carve back and forth across the mountain to limit your speed.\n\nThe trickiest part of snowboarding is shifting from your heel to your toe to change directions.\n\nMy best advice is to start slow, commit to every turn, and look where you want to go (not backward).\n\nThis story was originally published on December 3, 2024, and most recently updated on December 30, 2025.",

    "fullText": "The final Sunday in 2025 provided football fans with a memorable game that featured plenty of offensive firepower.\n\nWith how the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers moved the ball and scored, it felt like a game that would end with whatever team had the ball last.\n\nCaleb Williams and the Bears had their shot with 2:15 left in the game, down by four points.\n\nThe Bears quarterback led his team on a 15-play drive that ended on the 49ers’ 2-yard line after Williams attempted to extend the play to find an open receiver. With the 49ers’ defense closing in, Williams threw a pass into the end zone, but it fell short.\n\nWild ending to an incredible game. pic.twitter.com/Xe6pJkBfEa\n\nThe Bears lost 42-38, which eliminates them from contention for the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Still, as NFC North champions, they will host at least one playoff game at Soldier Field.\n\nHere are the five players who raised and lowered their stock in the Week 17 shootout at Levi’s Stadium.\n\nWilliams had one of his best passing performances of the season, completing 25 of 42 throws for 330 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nHis first TD pass of the day — to rookie Luther Burden III — was a perfectly thrown 35-yard strike in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWilliams’ second TD pass — to Colston Loveland in the second quarter– displayed some of his elite quarterback traits. Williams drew the 49ers’ defense offside with his cadence, kept his eyes downfield after the snap, then threw a dart to his rookie tight end for a 36-yard score.\n\nCaleb Williams gets the 49ers on the hard count.\n\nTouchdown, Colston Loveland\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWith how well the 49ers’ offense played, Williams needed to match Brock Purdy on the other side. For a majority of the game, that’s exactly what he did. However, he missed some throws.\n\nOn the final drive, Williams was heavily pressured on a first-and-10 play. He ran away from the pressure to his right but couldn’t complete a pass to wide-open Devin Duvernay on what might have been a game-winning TD.\n\nthis was 7 pic.twitter.com/WzuR5ONtEM\n\n— Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) December 29, 2025\n\nIt only took one play for the former All-Pro cornerback to change the game.\n\nJohnson jumped Jauan Jennings’ slant route and deflected Purdy’s first pass on the first play of the game into the air. T.J. Edwards intercepted the ball and returned it 34 yards for a pick six.\n\nT.J. EDWARDS, PICK-SIX ON THE FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nJohnson finished the game with zero receptions allowed on one target. He wasn’t targeted for the remainder of the game after helping cause the pick six, but he also played limited snaps in the second half.\n\nJohnson has given up just seven receptions on 12 targets for 142 yards in six games this season, and he has one interception. It shows just how important keeping Johnson healthy is to the Bears’ defense.\n\nThe Bears’ rookie wide receiver returned to action after missing last week’s win over the Green Bay Packers and quickly made an impact.\n\nEntering their third drive, the Bears had failed to record a first down. Then Williams found Burden for a 10-yard gain on second down. Three plays later, Williams connected with Burden on an explosive 35-yard TD pass, giving Chicago’s offense its first points of the game late in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nBurden finished as the game’s leading receiver with eight receptions on nine targets for 138 yards and the TD. He was injured on the final play of the game, and head coach Ben Johnson didn’t have an immediate update on the rookie’s condition.\n\nThe Bears’ veteran linebacker had the daunting task of trying to contain Christian McCaffrey. The entire defense, especially Edmunds, failed to keep the 49ers’ versatile playmaker in check.\n\nMcCaffrey finished the first half with 18 carries for 121 yards and one TD. He added two receptions for 20 yards as a pass catcher before halftime.\n\n: NBC\nNFL+// https://t.co/Zkva0Y3QRRpic.twitter.com/Lw0glXcnaP\n\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) December 29, 2025\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Edmunds allowed seven receptions on seven targets for 55 yards and two TDs.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense, which features plenty of motions and shifts, forced Edmunds and the rest of the Bears’ defensive front to react slowly, and San Francisco benefited throughout the game, finishing with 496 total yards (200 rushing, 296 passing).\n\nThe Bears cornerback dealt with a hamstring injury and an illness throughout the week, but he was able to start against the 49ers.\n\nHe’s had a remarkable season, but this wasn’t a good showing. Per Pro Football Focus, Wright gave up four receptions on five targets for 73 yards in just the first half.\n\nWright looked a step slow and couldn’t stay in front of opposing receivers.\n\nThe post Five Bears whose stock went up or down in NFL Week 17 loss to 49ers appeared first on Marquee Sports Network - Home of the Cubs, Bears, Red Stars and Sky.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMatt Ryan was the starting quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons for nearly 15 years from 2008 to 2021, and though the 40-year-old's playing days are long over, it looks like a reunion between Ryan and the Falcons could be on the way.\n\nAccording to FOX Sports' Jay Glazer, Atlanta has had conversations with Ryan about coming back to the franchise to serve in the front office. Ryan's role in the front office would be significant, and the former All-Pro signal-caller is heavily considering taking the job.\n\n\"Scoopage: Atlanta Falcons have had conversations with their former Pro Bowl QB Matt Ryan about rejoining the Falcons in a front office role. While two sides still discussing, people close to Ryan say he’s seriously considering this move and talks are ongoing. It would be for a significant role in the front office,\" Glazer said on X.\n\nRyan is a Falcons legend and clearly has an advanced football brain, as he played quarterback at a high level for multiple years and has become a respected analyst on CBS Sports since retiring in 2024.\n\nAtlanta hasn't made the playoffs since 2017. Funny enough, Ryan was the quarterback of the last Falcons' squad that qualified for the postseason.\n\nIt's clear that change is needed for the Falcons, and though Ryan can no longer play quarterback and lead the franchise to wins, he could serve as a key piece in the front office that turns the team around.\n\nThis offseason, Atlanta will need to evaluate their quarterback room, as Michael Penix Jr. is recovering from ACL surgery and Kirk Cousins is no longer a starting-caliber player. There's no better person to have in the front office with an uncertain quarterback situation than a former MVP signal-caller in Ryan.\n\nTreVeyon Henderson's Week 17 injury status, start or sit advice\n\nIs George Kittle playing tonight?

    "fullText": "A few days after Christmas Eve, sports director Markus Krösche gave all fans supporting Eintracht Frankfurt a belated Christmas present!\n\nAs reported by 'Sky' and 'Bild' on Sunday evening, Younes Ebnouatlib will transfer from SV 07 Elversberg to SGE in January. Only the medical check is pending.\n\nThe 22-year-old will cost a transfer fee of eight million euros, making him the most expensive Bundesliga transfer of this winter so far. Including bonuses, Elversberg could even receive up to ten million euros for Ebnouatlib.\n\nThe 1.91m tall striker is one of the biggest discoveries of this second division season, having scored 12 goals in 17 appearances. It is mainly because of him that SVE greets the new year from an outstanding second place in the standings.\n\nBut in the middle of the season, Ebnouatlib is now moving up a level. The rising star is expected to address the severe personnel issues in Frankfurt's attacking center.\n\nDue to the absences of Jonathan Burkardt and Michy Batshuayi, as well as Elye Wahi's lack of form, there is a significant gap in SGE's front line. Therefore, another goal scorer is likely to be signed in the coming days, with Arnaud Kalimuendo considered the most promising candidate.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "title": "How did curling become a Winter Olympics sensation? Inside the sports' unique history",
    "description": "More than 2.3 million people — or one of every 18 Canadians — participate in the sport of curling. A look at how the quirky sport became an Olympic star.",
    "fullText": "Jason Hills grew up in a rural hamlet in southern Alberta so small there were no traffic lights. Which wasn’t a problem because there wasn’t any traffic either.\n\n“There was nothing else really to do,” Hills said. “So if you weren’t curling you’d go hang out at the curling rink. It’s a community thing. It’s like everyone gets together.”\n\nIn much of the world curling is a curiosity, a sport which, like luge or the biathlon, surfaces every four years at the Winter Olympics — as it will do in February in Cortina D’Ampezzo, Italy — then quickly fades from view.\n\nIn Canada, however, it’s as much a part of the culture as poutine and maple syrup.\n\nMore than 2.3 million people — or one of every 18 Canadians — participate in the sport annually. That’s about 100 times the level of participation in the U.S. And more than 11 million Canadians watched the sport on TV in 2024, according to estimates from Curling Canada, the national governing body for the sport.\n\n“It’s just embedded in the fabric of Canada,” said Elaine Dagg-Jackson, an Olympic bronze medalist and now one of Canada’s top curling coaches. “Canadians have a real identity with what curling is and what it stands for. It’s a gracious sport where people are being polite. They shake hands before and after the game.\n\n“The curling rink was just a really good place to be in Canada. And still is. It just really suits the culture.”\n\nThe objectives of the sport are simple: Teams of two to four players slide 44-pound granite stones, also known as rocks, down a narrow 150-foot-long sheet of ice toward a target area called the house, aiming to get their stone closest to the center of the house. One or two players from the throwing team use carbon-fiber brooms to sweep the ice in front of the moving stone, influencing its path and speed.\n\nA round of play ends when each team has thrown eight stones; in Olympic curling, a match consists of 10 ends, eight in mixed curling, with games typically lasting two to three hours.\n\nThe simplicity of the sport is both its charm and its curse. Because there is no running, jumping or lifting of heavy objects, everyone from young children to octogenarians can, and do, compete in amateur curling in Canada.\n\n“It’s relatively inexpensive and it’s relatively accessible,” said Heather Mair, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo. “It’s not a hard sport to play and have fun at. It’s hugely entertaining. And you can really play your whole life.\n\n“I don’t know too many sports you could go out with your grandfather and participate. It can be really family-oriented as a sport.”\n\nBut while it looks easy, to excel at the highest levels, where millimeters separate winners from losers in competitions that can stretch for as long as seven hours over multiple days, the sport requires surprising strength, stamina, precision and agility.\n\n“It definitely takes a toll on your body,” Rachel Homan, a three-time Canadian Olympian and three-time world champion, said during a break in training on a bright Edmonton morning. “That part of the game is maybe overlooked; the physical toll it takes. It’s definitely demanding.”\n\nThe curling events at February's Winter Olympics will be held at the Cortina Olympic Stadium in Cortina D’Ampezzo, one of four event clusters in and around Milan. Canada, which has medaled in curling in every Olympics in the modern era, winning a record six golds, will send a dozen athletes — including Homan, the reigning world champion — to Italy to compete in the men’s, women’s and mixed doubles.\n\nThe U.S., which has won two Olympic curling medals, both in the men’s competition, will also have a dozen curlers in Italy competing in all three events. But if the sport is a national pastime in Canada, one that competes with hockey for fans and media attention, it remains something of an oddity in the U.S., where it draws huge TV audiences every four years during the Olympics, then fades from view until the next Winter Games.\n\n“It’s so frustrating to see curling become the next best thing to sliced bread for a month and then it comes off the radar for four years,” said Korey Dropkin, a five-time U.S. champion and a 2023 world champion in mixed doubles. “I want to see something that’s on national television in the U.S. every week. I want to be able to expose our amazing sport to the U.S. audience day in, day out.\n\n“I hope that in the near future we’ll be able to create more opportunities for exposure for curling.”\n\nCurling was born in Scotland in the early 16th century but grew up centuries later on the Canadian prairies, where the severe weather, rural landscape and boredom provided fertile ground.\n\n“In many parts of the country there’s long, long winters,” Dagg-Jackson said. “The farmers would be busy all summer, but in the winter they were looking for something to do. So the old adage in Canada is you could go to any town in rural Canada and find a grain elevator and a curling rink.”\n\nThe sport, which predates hockey by several decades, was brought to Montreal by Scottish emigrants during the colonial period, more than a half-century before Canada became a country. It then moved west as settlers pushed into what would become the central provinces, where the game was played on ponds and lakes before coming indoors.\n\nIn many ways the sport and the harsh conditions in which it thrived embodied the traditional values and traits — resilience, community, politeness, resourcefulness — that have come to define Canada’s unique “northern character.”\n\nMair, the Waterloo professor, has studied the role curling played in creating social and inter-generational connections and found the sport may have been more important from a mental perspective than from a physical one.\n\n“I don’t know if you can appreciate what a Canadian winter is like, but anything that gets us out of our homes and talking to one another is really, really important,” she said. “We know how necessary it is that we spend time socializing with one another, especially in the dark winter days.”\n\nAs a result, it quickly became hugely popular, but for reasons that went beyond sport. Most curling rinks, Mair said, provide social spaces where players can visit with the people they’re competing against.\n\n“So you’re sitting there for half an hour with people that you might never run into in any other part of your life and you start to build social relationships,” she said. “In really small rural communities, those are pretty essential. That’s kind of how it started.”\n\nIt’s also why the flat lands of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta became the earliest hotbeds of curling, which aligned well with the farming season. But the sport didn’t stay there. Curling clubs soon sprung up on Army bases and in fishing communities, in big cities and small towns, where it was taught in schools and played in retirement homes. (Curling has taken a different path in the U.S., where it has become popular in nontraditional winter-sports areas such as North Carolina, Florida, Texas and the San Francisco Bay area.)\n\n“There were entire generations, for the most part, who really had a sense of the game,” Mair said. “The[re] were plumbers and carpenters and teachers, they had regular day jobs and yet they were these really talented athletes who would take the sport to these elite levels.\n\n“So you could come from a teeny, tiny club and you might know someone who’s playing in the national championship.”\n\nThat romanticism inspired a radio play and novella by W.O. Mitchell, a writer and broadcaster who chronicled life on the Canadian prairies in the mid 20th century. In “The Black Bonspiel of Willie MacCrimmon,” which was also adapted for television, a cobbler from a small town in rural Alberta strikes a deal with the devil to trade his soul for curling success.\n\nBut as curling moved from the prairies to the cities, the object lessons the sport taught changed as well. If Mitchell’s tale is a decades-old take on the timeless tug of war between good and evil, “The New Canadian Curling Club,” a 2018 comedy by playwright Mark Crawford in which four immigrants show up for a learn-to-curl class, is a modern exploration of multiculturalism and acceptance.\n\nWhat the immigrants share, however, is a belief that understanding Canada starts with understanding curling.\n\n“It’s weird and wonderful. And like all good things, it takes a little time to appreciate,” Mair, who teaches in the department of recreation and leisure studies at Waterloo, said of the sport. “At first glance you’re not totally sure what’s going on. And then as the layers start to kind of unfold, you realize just how interesting and complicated and engaging it can be.\n\n“It’s fun. It really is. It’s quirky and fun. And I think we need more of that.”\n\nBut, she added, much of that has changed since curling entered the Olympics.\n\n“We’re at a bit of a crossroads,” she said. “Elite sport is doing just fine in a lot of ways. [But] we need to have a different conversation about community sport. It’s not about a pathway to Olympic gold. It’s about rebuilding our communities and providing safe and accessible sports for everything. And curling is just so special in that way.”\n\nCurling debuted in the Winter Games in 1924 with just three countries taking part; Great Britain, which fielded a team of Scottish curlers, won the gold medal. But the sport didn’t return to the official Olympic program for another 74 years and when it did, the exposure fueled interest in winter sports powerhouses such as China, Japan and South Korea, but also in Afghanistan, Andorra, Bolivia, the Virgin Islands, Kuwait and Mexico, which are all among the 67 members of the World Curling Assn.\n\n“There’s a little bit of perception from America that curling is small potatoes. And it probably is compared to the big four sports,” said Marc Kennedy, a world and Olympic champion from Canada who will be competing in his fourth Olympics in Italy. “But it’s a big deal. Arguably one of the fastest-growing sports internationally. It’s massive in Asia. Some of our most popular athletes are from Japan.”\n\nThat added competitiveness — 30 countries attempted to qualify for this year’s Olympic tournament — has not only raised the stakes and professionalized the sport, it also threatens to crush curling’s gracious and polite traditions in a stampede for the top of the medal podium. In last spring’s world championship in Canada, for example, Chinese athletes were accused of touching a stone with a broom, kicking a stone and illegal sweeping — all forbidden acts.\n\nIn most other sports, that would have been considered gamesmanship. In curling, the accusations alone were an affront to the sport’s tradition and dignity.\n\n“In curling you always divulge that you broke a rule … and apologize,” said Dagg-Jackson, the former Olympian turned coach.\n\n“It’s supposed to be a gentleman’s game. You’re supposed to call your own fouls,” added Chris Plys, a three-time U.S. Olympian. “Now we’re starting to see people doing questionable things.\n\n“It’s sad because the best part of the game is just how honest everything is. And there’s people out there [now] that are willing to do whatever it takes to win.”\n\nThose athletes certainly aren’t cheating for the money since curlers, even at the highest level, have often had to work regular jobs to pay the bills. That could change this spring with the launch of the Rock League, the sport’s first professional competition, which will begin play shortly after the Milan-Cortina Olympics.\n\n“The Rock League is going to be a huge new chapter to the sport,” said Dropkin, the Olympian who will captain the U.S. Rock League team. “That is going to present a whole lot of opportunities to curlers. Curlers now, curlers [in] the pipeline. They can actually make a living.”\n\nThe five-week circuit will feature six teams of five men and five women — one from the Asian-Pacific, two from Canada, two from Europe and one representing the U.S. — playing a variety of formats during stops in the U.S. and Canada. Competitors will not just earn money based on performance, but will receive salaries as well.\n\nHistorically the sport has relied heavily on prize money, which doesn’t go far. Kennedy’s winning five-man team at the 2025 Brier, the annual Canadian men’s championships, split $108,000 of the tournament’s $300,000 purse last March, which didn’t leave much after paying for travel and housing at the 10-day event.\n\nThe Dodgers will pay Shohei Ohtani more than that every time he comes to the plate over the next 10 seasons.\n\n“I don’t think any of us get into curling with the idea of making millions of dollars,” said Kennedy, 43, a father of two who sold his frozen-food franchise 14 years ago to support his curling career. “You’ve got a lot of curlers out there that still play for the love of the game and for the opportunity to represent Canada at the Olympics or World Championships.\n\n“If money was your motivation, then you’re probably in the wrong sport.”\n\nFor Homan, 36, a mother of three young children who has traditionally relied on sponsorships, stipends from the national federation and winnings from underfunded tours such as the Grand Slam of Curling to make ends meet, the Rock League has the potential to change not only her life, but her legacy as well.\n\n“In this league, being a part of it, might not mean anything for me financially right now. But it’s more about what you’re leaving behind and what you’re helping create,” said Homan, who will captain one of the league’s two Canadian teams.\n\nFinancing a professional league isn’t the only challenge curling will face coming out of the Milan-Cortina Games, though. Because while the Olympics may help the sport gather viewers, it has done little to reverse a steady decline in participation at the grassroots level, which is robbing the sport of its future athletes.\n\n“It’s just hard to get young kids introduced to it and have access to it,” Kennedy said. “Back in the ‘50s, ‘60s, ‘70s and ‘80s it was the community center. Everybody kind of learned curling, especially out west. That’s what was driving a huge part of our sport for a long time.”\n\nNot any more. Canada, like the U.S., has seen millions of people flee rural areas for big cities over the last several decades and as a result the local curling rink is no longer the civic hub it was when Jason Hills was growing up on the frigid plains of central Alberta. And what investment there is in the sport is now being directed to events such as the Olympics, the Grand Slam of Curling or the fledgling Rock League, not to building more community rinks.\n\n“Curling had to pivot a bit,” said Dagg-Jackson, who takes her five grandchildren curling. “It used to be all about membership, about the thousands and thousands of curlers across the country. Now those few competitive curlers that shine in the spotlight are known to all Canadians because they’re on television all the time and they draw attention to the sport.\n\n“Fifty years ago you just waited at the rink and people showed up because it was the place to be. Big events, Olympics, pro leagues, that’s the future of curling. But the culture and the lore, the history of curling, it’ll always be there.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "Letters to Sports: Playing the blame game in USC-Notre Dame debacle",
    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section share their thoughts on the USC-Notre Dame rivalry, the Rams, UCLA, Angels and college football.",
    "fullText": "Bill Plaschke writes, “If the Trojans truly want to return to greatness, being selected for the CFP is the goal. Not beating Notre Dame. Not even beating UCLA.” That's 100% wrong.\n\nAs a USC alum (1965) and longtime fan, those are the only things that do matter. I have often said that if USC beats UCLA or Notre Dame, the coach deserves another season. To give up this grand tradition in pursuit of the arguably artificial and profit-driven CFP would be an unforgivable sin.\n\nA USC national football championship without playing Notre Dame rings hollow — an asterisked title, a meal that never satisfies, a taste you can’t quite wash away. It may shine in the record books, but it will always feel unfinished to those who know what real college football tradition demands. Earth to Lincoln Riley: an undefeated season is still a loss without playing the Fighting Irish. What’s next? If UCLA becomes competitive, then there will be no crosstown game?\n\nSo the Fighting Irish own a series edge of 53-37, have won 3 in a row, 7 of the last 8, and 11 of the last 15 games. Yet Bill Plaschke now claims that Notre Dame is running away from the series and is afraid of \"Ole SC.\" To paraphrase the late, great Jim Healy, Plaschke is on the Leonard Tose highway!\n\nNotre Dame is the Burger King of college football — always having it their way. From backdoor deals with the corrupt [CFP] guaranteeing a playoff spot if they finish ranked in the top 12 to refusing to join a conference so that they can pocket all bowl game money, the Irish are treated like college football royalty. Glad USC told the Irish toddlers they can’t have ice cream for breakfast!\n\n“USC and Notre Dame recognize how special our rivalry is to our fans …\" A joint statement by the athletic directors of the two schools. Really? Fake news!\n\nNo USC-Notre Dame football game! Who’s next to be cut from the Notre Dame football schedule, Navy? Oh wait, the Irish can’t afford to drop Navy. That might hurt their chance$ at a playoff berth.\n\nI don't think firing the Rams' special teams coach is the answer. How about running some tackling drills with the defensive backs during the week. I know there's \"no crying in baseball,\" but is it now \"there's no tackling in football?\" Throw in some deep coverage drills too!\n\nSo it looks like athletic director Martin Jarmond has forced UCLA followers to accept his decisions made outside of public scrutiny once again with a contract extension for Mick Cronin. If you haven’t noticed, UCLA basketball has been sliding into mediocrity. Seats at home games are increasingly vacant. USC is outrecruiting UCLA. Prices for seats would make you think you are going to see a top-tier team. UCLA has been sitting on distant memories. How long will it take to fully trash those memories? Jarmond’s easy-way-out decision is dooming the basketball program.\n\nHaving been a Kings fan since Luc Robitaille's rookie year, I have seen some very good Kings teams and some very bad ones. But never have I seen a team with so much potential and skill be so absolutely lethargic and unwatchable this season. This team currently ranks 31st out of 32 teams in overall scoring and power-play percentage. How bad is it? As of Christmas Eve, in the last 5 games the team has a total of 8 goals and 8 assists, or 16 points, the sum total of all 18 skaters on the ice over 5 games. Connor McDavid, the leading NHL scorer, has racked up 15 points in his last 5 games … just one skater. The saying goes that the fish rots from the head. Time to show coach Jim Hiller and his entire staff the door. A fresh start, a new motivator. Is Darryl Sutter available again?\n\nRonald J Peters\nColorado Springs, Colo.\n\nIn his Dec. 22 analysis, Bill Shaikin implies that payroll is the difference between winning and losing baseball teams. For the Angels, the on-field problems are rooted in off-the-field issues that have gone largely unchecked for at least a decade. As Angel fans, we can only hope that the settling of the Tyler Skaggs lawsuit, a low 2026 payroll, and one-year contracts to the GM and manager indicate that Arte Moreno is readying the Angels for sale. New ownership and upper management are what’s needed, not a higher payroll.\n\nIt was fitting that rapper 50 Cent performed live during Oklahoma’s first-round College Football Playoff loss, since the Sooners basically showed up for only two quarters.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

    "description": "Carol Klenfner avoided sports most of her life after a car crash dislocated her hip. She picked up ping pong at 69 and has been thriving ever since.",
    "fullText": "Carol Klenfner had played ping pong on and off since growing up and into adulthood, but it wasn't until she was 69 that she picked up the paddle to compete.\n\nWithin just a few months of playing consistently, she began to notice a difference.\n\n\"I remember when I started playing ping pong,\" she told Business Insider's Sarah Andersen in April, \"I noticed that my reflexes were faster than they had been.\"\n\nNow, after more than a decade of playing and competing at the national level and earning more than 50 medals, she attributes the sport to keeping her mind sharp and engaged as she enters her 80s.\n\nAndersen followed Klenfner as she trained for the 2025 National Senior Games in Des Moines this summer:\n\nPing pong's speed demands full attention — the spin of the ball, the bounce off the paddle, and the angle of each return. That focus, repeated hundreds of times a day, has helped tune both Klenfner's body and mind, she said.\n\n\"If I'm in the bathroom and something falls off the medicine chest, my hand is there catching it before it even registers in my head,\" Klenfner said.\n\nKlenfner's experience aligns with what researchers have found on the effect of regular physical activity and strength training on the aging human brain.\n\nBuilding balance, coordination, and fine motor control can strengthen neural connections, reducing the risk of cognitive decline and frailty in older adults.\n\nWhat's more, picking up ping pong later in life gave Klenfner a renewed sense of adventure.\n\n\"The single most important thing that I've learned, and the advice that I would give to somebody who wants to pick up something new later in life, is that it's never too late to learn,\" she said. \"It's never too late to start something new.\"\n\nBefore tackling table tennis, Klenfner had spent most of her life avoiding sports. She was injured in a car crash in college that dislocated her hip. After that, running, playing tennis, and general athletics were off the table.\n\n\"It changed the trajectory of my life till now,\" she said of the event. \"I kind of stopped playing sports at that point.\"\n\nThen, in her late 60s, she saw the documentary \"Ping Pong\" on PBS, which follows a group of seniors, ages 80 to 100, going to the World Masters Championship.\n\n\"I watched that documentary and I said, 'Well, I can't play tennis anymore because of my back and my sciatica, but I think I could play ping pong,'\" she said.\n\nNow, at 80, she plays table tennis and trains several times a week.\n\nShe's competed in many events, including the Empire State Senior Games and the National Senior Games. She won gold for women's singles at the national games in Pittsburgh in 2023 and took fifth at the 2025 games in Iowa, which disappointed her but didn't deter her from continuing.\n\n\"Winning's better, but I love to play and playing is the goal,\" she said.\n\nKlenfner says she works out every day, morning and night. Space is limited in her small studio Manhattan apartment, but she gets creative.\n\nShe completes about 60 squats, including one-legged squats, each morning while her oatmeal warms.\n\nThen, she'll do some stretches specifically for her back and sciatica, followed by side planks to strengthen her oblique muscles, which are key for the side-to-side motion in ping pong, she says.\n\nAfter that, she'll typically head to either PingPod to practice with their coaches or her private Pilates trainer, whom she sees twice a week.\n\nIn the evenings, she completes sets of resistance exercises with a weight band that she attaches to the only door in her place: the bathroom door.\n\nKlenfner says there are three main reasons she's so committed to exercising daily: staying strong for her tournaments, staying strong for her life, and helping her mental health. \"I am happy when I'm moving,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm currently living the best chapter of my life in a lot of ways. I am doing what I want to do when I want to do it.\"",

    "description": "The trading card business is so big, the ecosystem has created specialized markets within it. Collectors can chase a specific team, or stick to vintage cards, among other options.",
    "fullText": "Trading sports cards is a game of negotiation for Greg Petikyan. Within seconds, he talked to multiple vendors at Frank and Son Collectible Show last month offering the same card: a 2025 Panini Donruss Saquon Barkley Downtown.\n\nThe first deal consisted of a 3-for-1 exchange, with an additional couple of hundred dollars to sweeten the deal or a straight purchase for $460. As the vendor looked through his phone for the value of the cards he asked for, Petikyan told him he’ll circle back.\n\nInstead, the entrepreneur offered it to Eric Mitchel, another booth owner, across the aisle and sold it. A rectangular cardboard collectible with the Super Bowl-winning running back in front of the Philadelphia skyline sold for $300.\n\n“Too late,” Petikyan said. “I’ll still buy those cards I asked for.”\n\nNothing personal, just business.\n\nTrading and collecting cards, an industry valued at $14.9 billion in 2024, is estimated to reach $52.1 billion within the next decade, according to Market Decipher report. The sports memorabilia business, as a whole, is estimated to reach a value of $271.2 billion by 2034.\n\nE-commerce platforms like Fanatics Live and Whatnot have turned business transactions involving the cards of sports legends into entertainment and helped grow the market. Heritage Auctions sold the most expensive card in August. The collectible known as the \"holy grail\" by basketball collectors was a 2007-08 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Dual Logoman Autographs Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant card.\n\nThe one-of-one sold for $12.932 million, a sum that topped a Mickey Mantle card that went for $12.6 million in August 2022. The Jordan-Bryant card is the second-most expensive sports collectible of all time, trailing Babe Ruth's 1932 World Series Jersey, which he wore when he called his shot, that cost $24.12 million.\n\nLast Friday, Heritage Auctions set a sales record for the year by crossing the $2 billion mark. The cards sold that day included a 2003 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Dual Logoman Jordan-Bryant card for $3,172,000 — this one was not autographed.\n\nThe trading card business has grown so much, the ecosystem has created specialized markets within it. Collectors can chase a specific team; stick to vintage cards; complete a set of prints with mistakes; chase specific relics of their favorite team; or even just buy cards to resell them for the sole purpose of buying more to flip.\n\n\"I know for a fact, a lot of men like to show off their collection,\" Adam Campbell, sports cards specialist with Heritage Auction, said. \"People love to have good, cool collections,\" he added.\n\nThe type of chase can change the direction of a business transaction, said George Peña, 53, another booth owner at Frank and Son, an old Sam's Club that now houses more than 200 vendors selling and showcasing collectible merchandise three days a week.\n\nKids go into his booth and negotiate with him. Most of the time he doesn’t necessarily need a card from them but engages with them to give them the experience.\n\n“Family members get all excited for them,” Peña said.\n\nBut when dealing with people like Petikyan, the stakes change.\n\n“Negotiations are a little different with those kinds of people because they want to make money and we want to make money,” he said as he quipped with Petikyan.\n\nSome collectors have turned into investors because the value of cards is so volatile. It changes in real time — it's fast, unpredictable and relentless. The moment Dodgers designated hitter and pitcher Shohei Ohtani hit three home runs and struck out 10 batters in Game 4 of the 2025 NLCS, the value of his cards went up. But it cuts both ways — the moment Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase was indicted on federal charges for wire fraud conspiracy and bribery, the value of his cards dipped.\n\n“The value of cards is not based on anything else, whatsoever, except for hype and buzz” Campbell said. “[It's] entirely arbitrary.”\n\nCollecting trading cards has been a part of the culture since Goodwin Tobacco Company released the first set of individual players’ baseball cards in 1886. The N167 Old Judge sets were inserted into tiny cigarette boxes to increase sales and to make sure the cards were not damaged in transit.\n\nSince the tobacco industry started the trade, sports cards have endured changes through generations, each defined by specific characteristics.\n\nThe vintage era, before the 1980s, ushered in simpler designs, lower print runs and sets featuring the legends of all the sports. Then came the junk wax period, marked by mass overproduction that devalued the product. The current ultra modern era evolved the market into investments, scarcity, and digitized the business with websites like Arena Club, which repackages pre-graded cards as slab packs.\n\nNo matter the changes, there remains a common thread within collectors throughout the years: opening packages and feeling a bump of euphoria when a chase card, a sought-after item, appears.\n\n“It’s the best feeling ever, imagine getting a $1,000 card for like 20, 30 bucks?” Petikyan said. “It’s like hitting a lotto ticket, but better, because it could go up in value depending on the player.”\n\nPetikyan, 27 from Montebello, runs a page called Strictly Pullz on the shopping app Whatnot where he opens boxes and auctions the items within them. Any card pulled from a team that's purchased by the individual will be shipped to them. On occasion, he inserts a card with higher value to hype a specific set.\n\nTo some, the business is intertwined with collecting.\n\n“I’ll use some of the money that I am able to make on the business side, to add to my personal collection,” Mitchel said. “Finding items for the personal collection, I wouldn’t find if I wasn’t out for the business part of it.”\n\nRegardless of motivation, pulling a card worth more than the price paid for will remain priceless.\n\n“I just bought a pack and I pulled a card worth $1,000,” Campbell said, speaking as a collector. “It can change your whole day, and maybe your whole week, maybe a whole month or even a whole year every time you open a pack.”\n\nBut, collecting cards is more than just the value of each, Campbell said.\n\n“Do this because you like sports, do this because you love collecting.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "MT. PLEASANT, S.C. (WCBD) – A lot to celebrate this holiday season as it was another great year for Lowcountry sports. It was tough to dwindle down the top ten stories of 2025 but we did our best.\n\nTop story #10 – 2025 was a banner year for Mt. Pleasants Debbie Antonelli, literally. In January the NC State alum was inducted into the Wolfpack basketball Ring of Honor for her contributions to the sport. On Halloween the town of Mt. Pleasant officially named the gym at town hall in her honor. “The Deb is a testament to Antonelli’s work promoting the game and the Special Olympics as she hopes to serve as an inspiration for other young girls like herself with a love of basketball.\n\nTop story #9 – Berkeley High School has been around since 1912, in its entire school history the Stags had yet to win a state title in basketball. That all changed one March afternoon in Florence when the Lady Stags defeated Greenwood for the SCHSL 5A D2 championship. Berkeley alum head coach Crystal Peace overwhelmed as her Stags finally reached the mountain top.\n\nTop story #8 – In James Island baseball’s last game in 4A in 2024, they won their third state title in school history. Fast forward to the last day of May as the Trojans were down to their last three outs in extra innings in the decisive game for the 5A D1 crown against Lexington. Collin Anderson drove in the tying run with a ringing double to right center. Later in the bottom of the eighth with Anderson on second, Jake Amman comes through with the biggest knock of his life driving in Anderson as the Trojans go back to back defeating the Wildcats in dramatic fashion. Can I get an Amman?\n\nTop story #7 – John McKissick holds the record for the most wins as a high school head football coach in the state, and probably will never be passed. Coach has company in flower town as Pinewood Prep head basketball coach Pat Eidson became the states all time winningest head coach in January. With a 67 – 31 win over Palmetto Christian, pat won his 944th game as a head coach. After stops at Easley Christian and Northside Christian, Eidson has been at Pinewood since 1990.\n\nTop story #6 – Coastal Carolina baseball was two wins away from their second national title in school history. After winning the Sun Belt regular season and tournament titles, the Chants breezed through the Conway regional before sweeping Auburn down on the plains in the Auburn super regional. Coastal’s win streak reached a remarkable 26 games in a row when they defeated Louisville to advance to the CWS finals falling in two games to the national champion LSU Tigers. Chanticleer alum, head coach Kevin Schnall guided CCU to the most wins in school history with 56 in 2025.\n\nTop story #5 – After coming oh so close to winning his first title on the PGA Tour, Academic Magnet alum Andrew Novak would fall in a playoff at the Heritage to Justin Thomas. Andrew would rebound the following week winning the Zurich Classic with playing partner Ben Griffin for his first title on tour. Novak capped off 2025 by winning another team event, the Grant Thornton Invitational with l-p-g-a’s Lauren Coughlin.\n\nTop story #4 – Dr. Quinn gave Nicols college the medicine in October as Stratford alum Montie Quinn set a new NCAA single game rushing record across all divisions as he ran for an absurd 522 yards on just 20 carries in Currie College’s 71 – 27 victory. Montie added seven touchdowns, his longest coming from 85 yards and finished the season with 2446 rushing yards. Once again leading the NCAA across all divisions.\n\nTop story #3 – SC State won the MEAC title for a second year in a row under Chennis Berry. The Bulldogs would play in the Celebration Bowl for a second year in a row as well. After falling by 21 in 2024, they trailed by 21 at the half against Prairie View A&M. SCSU responded in the third quarter tying things at 21 and would go on to force overtime. In the fourth OT, SC State scored the first two point try then stopped the Panthers attempt as pandemonium reigned and confetti fell as the Bulldogs claimed the HBCU national title for the first time since 2021.\n\nTop story #2 – While the Bulldogs won a title in the ATL, OCA won a third straight title in Orangeburg on State’s home turf. Oceanside punished BHP for a second year in a row winning back to back 3A state titles, the third overall title in a row as Brent LaPrad became the third different head coach to win a championship with the Landsharks. OCA became the first Lowcountry program to three-peat since Summerville from 1982-1984.\n\nTop story #1 – After winning gold in the 4×100 relay at the Paris Olympics in 2024, Georgetown’s Melissa Jefferson-Wooden became the fastest woman in the world as she set a new world record in the 100 meters at the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo with a blazing time of 10.61 seconds. Jefferson-Wooden would go on to win the 200 meters at the championship as well.",

    "fullText": "Dolphins (6-9) vs. Buccaneers (7-8), Sunday, 1 p.m., FOX\n\nLatest line: Buccaneers are favored by 5 1/2 points\n\nDave Hyde, Sports Columnist (Season record: 5-10): Buccaneers 27, Dolphins 24\n\nMaybe it’s as easy as Baker Mayfield vs Quinn Ewers. Like the Dolphins, Tampa Bay isn’t the team it wanted to be. But this game has playoff consequences for the Bucs, so there’s the difference.\n\nChris Perkins, Dolphins Columnist (Season record: 8-7): Buccaneers 24, Dolphins 14\n\nIt’s hard to predict a victory with Quinn Ewers at quarterback. Plus, the defense is coming off one of its worst performances and it won’t have safety Minkah Fitzpatrick again. Oh, yeah, the Bucs need to win to keep their playoff hopes alive, while the Dolphins have no playoff hopes.\n\nDavid Furones, Dolphins Writer (Season record: 7-8): Buccaneers 24, Dolphins 20\n\nIt’s a guessing game with which version of the Dolphins comes out. Quinn Ewers looked fine in his debut as a starter, but he didn’t get much help around him as the team collapsed in the third quarter against the Bengals last week. The Dolphins are playing for pride at this point, while the Buccaneers are still alive for an NFC South crown, so they need this game more and it might show on the field.\n\nKathy Laughlin, Sports Editor (Season record: 6-9): Buccaneers 27, Dolphins 17\n\nIt’s hard to see this one going Miami’s way after the dismal Bengals put such a hurt on the Dolphins last week. The reeling Buccaneers won’t even be thrown off by the hot temperatures at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nKeven Lerner, Assistant Sports Editor (Season record: 12-3): Buccaneers 27, Dolphins 17\n\nThe reeling Buccaneers have lost six of their last seven games, but still control their own playoff destiny. If they win their final two games against Miami and Carolina, they will win their fifth straight division title. But if they lose to the Dolphins and the Panthers beat the Seahawks this weekend, the Bucs will be eliminated. Facing elimination, I don’t see Tampa Bay losing to Miami. A loss also could cost coach Todd Bowles his job.\n\nSteve Svekis, Assistant Sports Editor (Season record: 7-8): Buccaneers 26, Dolphins 17\n\nThe Bucs are in a free fall, but are still alive, and desperate. While Baker Mayfield has been a shell of himself since injuring a shoulder against the Rams, Tampa Bay should still have enough against a Dolphins team that looked in free fall last week against the Bengals.",

    "description": "Social media and sports fans all over share their opinion on whether the one game suspension was enough for Coach Cooley",
    "fullText": "Should Ed Cooley’s suspension have been longer than one game? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nGeorgetown’s 80–77 loss to Xavier on December 20 was a tightly contested Big East matchup, but the final moments quickly shifted the attention away from the game itself. After the Hoyas missed a potential game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer, head coach Ed Cooley reacted in frustration by throwing a water bottle into the stands. The bottle struck a child sitting on an adult’s lap, later identified as members of the Nyahkoon family. Georgetown responded by suspending Cooley for one game, sparking debate across college basketball about whether that punishment was enough.\n\nOn the court, Georgetown showed a strong effort against Xavier. Malik Mack, Julius Halaifonua, and KJ Lewis carried most of the offensive load, keeping the Hoyas competitive throughout the night. However, late shooting struggles allowed Xavier to close out the win. While the loss itself mattered in the standings, Cooley’s actions after the final buzzer quickly became the main storyline.\n\nCooley issued an apology shortly after the incident, calling his behavior unacceptable and taking full responsibility. He also reached out directly to the Nyahkoon family, whom he described as close to him. The family accepted his apology, and Georgetown determined that a one-game suspension aligned with the school’s standards and expectations for conduct.\n\nYou’re kidding me Ed Cooley just beamed a water bottle 100 mph directly into a toddlers face 😭 #PrayForWaterBottleKidpic.twitter.com/jKIYTB3QPe\n\n— Nick Bateman (CBB guru) (@nickbateman33) December 21, 2025\n\nThe suspension was served Monday night when Georgetown faced Coppin State without Cooley on the sideline. The Hoyas responded with a dominant 97–67 victory, building a 53–25 halftime lead and controlling the game from start to finish. Julius Halaifonua led the way with 20 points and eight rebounds, while Isaiah Abraham and KJ Lewis provided strong all-around performances. While the win showed Georgetown’s ability to move forward, it also reopened questions about whether the punishment matched the severity of the incident.\n\nThose who believe the suspension should have been longer point to safety concerns. Throwing an object into the stands especially when it hits a child is a serious lapse in judgment. Coaches are leaders and public figures, and moments like this can reflect poorly on a program and the sport as a whole. From this perspective, a multi-game suspension could have sent a stronger message about accountability and fan safety.\n\nSupporters of the one-game suspension focus on Cooley’s response. He did not avoid responsibility, apologized publicly and privately, and accepted the punishment without protest. Georgetown appeared to view the incident as a one-time emotional mistake rather than a repeated issue, choosing to balance discipline with stability within the program.\n\nSimilar situations across sports show that discipline is not always consistent. NHL coach John Tortorella once received a one-game suspension for throwing water toward fans. In the NFL, Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper was fined $300,000 for throwing a drink toward spectators. In other cases, longer penalties have been handed down when intent or repeat behavior was involved. These examples highlight how leagues and schools often weigh context, harm, and response differently.\n\nSo, should Ed Cooley’s suspension have been longer than one game? There are reasonable arguments on both sides. If a similar incident were to happen again, it would likely result in a much harsher punishment, as this suspension was viewed by many as relatively light.\n\nA longer ban may have sent a stronger message about player and fan safety, but Georgetown clearly weighed several factors in its decision. Cooley’s immediate apology, the family’s acceptance of that apology, and his positive track record all played a role in how the university handled the situation.\n\nIn the end, this case highlights how difficult it can be to balance accountability, emotion, and context in sports. While opinions will differ on whether the punishment fits the incident, the debate underscores an ongoing challenge for schools and leagues when moments of frustration cross an important line.\n\nRick Pitino reacts to St. John’s opening win\n\nOhio State loses point guard commitment\n\nAJ Dybansta makes debut for BYU\n\nJalen Rose on TNT college basketball coverage",

    "description": "Amazon, YouTube TV, and Netflix dominate US sports streaming, accounting for 65% of the $6.5 billion spent by streamers on sports rights.",
    "fullText": "The NFL is giving sports fans a triple header for Christmas this year, starting with the Dallas Cowboys vs. the Washington Commanders at 1 p.m. ET, plus a Snoop Dogg halftime performance. But you have to \n\nThe tech giants have eaten the entertainment world, and now they're coming for sports.\n\nTogether, Amazon and YouTube TV account for 65% of the $6.5 billion that streamers will spend on sports rights for US audiences in 2025 (34.4% and 30.6%, respectively), according to Ampere Analysis. The third biggest share went to Netflix, with 11.3%. Disney's ESPN+ and Comcast's Peacock held a distant fourth and fifth place.\n\nAmazon and YouTube have actively pursued significant deals for sports rights in recent years, with Amazon paying $11 billion for the NFL's Thursday Night Football and $19.8 billion for NBA rights, and YouTube paying $14 billion to secure NFL \"Sunday Ticket\" rights.\n\nNetflix has also been active, scooping up NFL Christmas Day games and the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, although it prefers to treat sports as part of a broader live events strategy that includes comedy specials and awards shows rather than \"renting\" full seasons of sports rights. A person familiar with Netflix's spending said they pegged it at about $600 million versus Ampere's calculation of $738 million.\n\nAmpere's data comes with a few caveats. Its measurements of eight platforms exclude spending for rights distributed internationally — such as Amazon's spending on NFL rights outside the US, or on the UEFA Men's Champions League within the UK — and for DAZN's acquisition of the global FIFA Club World Cup 2025 rights for $1 billion.\n\nBroadcasters remain the largest buyers of sports rights in the US, although streamers are making inroads.\n\nNearly half (47%) of US broadcasters' content spending — $24 billion — went to sports rights in 2025, per Ampere. Most of US streamers' content budgets still go to TV shows and films. This year, 10% of their content budgets overall went to sports in 2025, up from 6% in 2024. Even for Amazon, sports were about 19% of its spending on content, approaching the amount it spends on movies.\n\nSports can help streamers grow engagement and keep audiences subscribed. However, the rising cost of sports means less money for an already stagnating entertainment TV ecosystem that has been producing fewer shows since the end of Peak TV in 2022.\n\nDisney said in its fourth quarter earnings call that it would spend $24 billion in the next fiscal year, driven in large part by sports rights. CFO Hugh Johnston justified paying a more than 73% step up for NBA rights in its 2024 deal by pointing to their value to audiences and advertisers, despite the cost creating \"a little bit of bumpiness during the course of the year.\"\n\nNetflix compared its recent NFL deal to the cost of its movies, which it's been making fewer of. Asked about the cost of the deal at an investor conference last year, Netflix exec Spencer Wang said he would characterize each game as \"roughly the size of one of our medium-sized original films.\"\n\nThe shift of sports to streaming platforms looks likely to continue.\n\nAmpere forecasts global spending on sports rights to increase by 20% to $78 billion worldwide by 2030. Spending will be driven by the US, where new NBA and MLB rights will be up for grabs in the coming years. Talks for the next round of NFL negotiations could start as early as 2026, as the league seeks to maximize the value of its media rights.\n\nYouTube TV is also expanding its play for sports fans, announcing a new sports bundle along with other niche packages that cost less than its regular $83-per-month service.",

They normally play together on the Exeter Chiefs, but are currently battling it on the pitch playing for opposing teams at the Women’s Rugby World Cup, where Jacoby is playing for the U.S. and Cramer is competing for Australia.\n\nRugby stars Julia Schell and Rachel Malcom have been in a long-term relationship for the past year and a half. The pair started dating while playing together on the Exeter Chiefs (does Cupid also play on this team?!), but are in the middle of a fierce competition, playing for opposing teams in the Rugby World Cup.\n\nKelsey Jones and her partner, Sarah Beckett, may be dating, but that doesn’t mean they won’t compete against each other just as passionately, and they love each other. They usually play together for Gloucester-Hartpury, but at the 2025 Six Nations Championship, the two rugby champs competed against each other on rival teams.\n\nLovebirds Cliodhna Moloney-MacDonald and Claudia Moloney-MacDonald got married in May 2025 on the Greek Island of Rhodes. After getting married, the two women hyphenated their last names so that when they played against each other in the Rugby World Cup, both of their uniforms had the same last name. When they aren’t going head-to-head on opposing teams, they are playing together for the Exeter Chiefs.\n\nAt the 2024 Paris Olympics, Alev Kelter not only took home a Bronze medal, but she also proposed to her girlfriend, Kathryn Treder. The two rugby stars are joined at the hip in life and on the pitch. They are both representing the U.S. at the 2025 Rugby World Cup and are set to play together in the inaugural season of Elite Women’s Rugby for the Bay Breakers\n\nEnglish rugby players Marlie Packer and Rosie Galligan got engaged in 2025 in a beautiful lakeside proposal that the happy couple shared on Instagram. But Packer and Gilligan aren’t just partners in life, they are also competing together for England in the Rugby World Cup and are teammates on the Saracens.\n\nRugby couple Mckenzie Carson and Sarah Bern are known as fierce competitors on the field when their opposing teams face off — Carson plays for Gloucester-Hartpury and Bern is a star on the Bristol Bears — and lovers off the pitch. Most of the time, Carson and Bern play on different teams, but at this year’s Rugby World Cu,p they’ve gotten the opportunity to see what it’s like to be teammates while competing for England’s Red Roses.\n\nDan Mullan - RFU/The RFU Collection via Getty Images\n\nHolly Aitchison and Hannah Botterman\n\nCollege sweethearts Holly Aitchison and Hannah Botterman first bonded over their love of rugby while playing for Hartpury College together. Now, a decade later, their love story is making headlines alongside their athletic accomplishments. The couple is currently playing together in the Rugby World Cup, where they are representing England, but soon they’ll be playing on rival teams since Botterman plays for the Bristol Bears and Aitchison is joining the Sale Sharks ahead of the 2025-26 season.\n\nStar player Dannah O’Brien has been competing for Ireland in the Rugby World Cup without her significant other, but she normally plays alongside her partner Katie Whalen for Leinster.\n\nItalian player Giordana Duca is in a relationship with her teammate Michela Sillari. The couple make great teammates in life and on the pitch, play together in the delayed 2021 Rugby World Cup, competing on the same team in the Six Nations Championship, and battling it out side-by-side at the 2025 World Cup games.\n\nTeammates Leia Brebner-Holden and Elis Martin play together for Loughborough Lightning and at the 2025 Rugby World Cup, but they used to be rivals when Brebner-Holden was playing for Gloucester-Hartpury and Martin was competing for Loughborough Lightning without her.\n\nWelsh rugby players Jasmine Joyce-Butchers and Alisha Joyce-Butchers got married in 2023, and at the beginning of 2025, they started their IVF journey. Now, the happy couple, who play together for the Bristol Bears, is expecting their first child in November.\n\nNot only are rugby stars Kayleigh Powell and Lucy Burgess dating, but they used to both play for the Bristol Bears, and now they’re competing together for the Harlequins.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: 42 lesbian sports power couples who are winning at life and love\n\n10 lesbian sports movies that are total game-changers\n\n20 Super Hot Gay Athletes Who Make Us Sweat\n\n'Matilda' star Mara Wilson goes viral for scathing critique of Trump's trans sports ban​",

    "fullText": "Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy.\n\nHe thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance.\n\nAfter earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams.\n\nCardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making.\n\nKress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a \"dream job.\" She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the \"culmination\" of her career, offering \"unparalleled exposure\" to global policymakers and business leaders.\n\nJack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase\n\nLevendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron.\n\nIn that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions.\n\nMenasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries.\n\nToday, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' private capital and liquidity solutions group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions.\n\nJackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley\n\nBefore joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking.\n\n\"I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two,\" she told Business Insider. \"I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas.\" So she made the pivot to Wall Street.\n\nAfter holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks.\n\nGolf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents.",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) – Being a Kansas City Chiefs fan is often about loyalty and emotional commitment. But with the Chiefs announcing Monday that they would leave the historic Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri and move into a not-yet-built $3 billion stadium on the Kansas side of Kansas City, Kansas-based fans soon won’t need to root for their team across state lines.\n\n“That creates energy that I don’t think we really understand or really appreciate until it starts happening, until the stadium gets built, they play their first game, they play their first season,” Kevin Jenks, the president and CEO of the Wichita Sports Commission, said.\n\nThe Chiefs spent more than five decades playing at Arrowhead. They intend to build their new stadium in Wyandotte County, in the same area as Kansas Speedway and the Legends retail district.\n\n‘I just love Arrowhead’: Some Chiefs super fans not sold on move to Kansas\n\nEven though Wichita will be a few hours away from the new field, the hope is that the team’s presence can strengthen the area’s sports identity. Wichita Sports Commission hopes that includes strengthening ongoing partnerships with the franchise.\n\n“The Chiefs have been big proponents of getting flag football into high schools, and we were a part of that locally with some Wichita schools,” Jenks said. “We are still continuing to promote and be a part of that process.”\n\nDr. Larry Straub, an associate professor of business management at Newman University, says the Chiefs’ presence is likely to improve Kansas’ national image. However, he’s skeptical that the financial boom that comes with a major sports team moving in will echo around the state.\n\n“From an economics standpoint, I think the closer you are to Kansas City, the more benefits you’re going to have,” Straub said.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

    "fullText": "It was a year of dominance for women’s sports in 2025.\n\nYou couldn’t blink without missing some display from a big-time athlete stepping up in a big-time moment: Mikaela Shiffrin bagging her 100th career win. Iga Świątek winning Wimbledon with a double bagel. A’ja Wilson, Paige Bueckers, Trinity Rodman, Lottie Woad — name a sport, and there was excellence to be found, records to be broken, trophies to be stockpiled.\n\nAnd in 2025, everyone was watching. From the summer of tournaments in women’s football across Europe, South America and Africa to rinks and courts across the globe, attendance and TV ratings remain on the rise.\n\nFor the first time, the National Women’s Soccer League cracked one million viewers for its championship game, all of whom were treated to the magic of Rose Lavelle’s left foot. Try watching footage of any of the fan walks in Switzerland from Euro 2025 without a smile — an impossible challenge.\n\nWomen’s basketball has always been bigger than any single player, and from the college game to the pros, everyone capitalized on the massive boost from 2024. UConn and the Aces rose to the top once again, with plenty of drama and excitement along the way.\n\nNew leagues and competitions sparked joy. Napheesa Collier and the Lunar Owls cried, “Hootie Hoo!” at Unrivaled, Bayern Munich danced their way through the first World Sevens and new leagues in volleyball and softball joined the ecosystem, with even more ready to enter the fray in 2026.\n\nIt feels impossible to sum up another beautifully chaotic year in women’s sports, but that challenge didn’t stop us. Here, The Athletic’s writers from across the globe pick the moments that stood out for them in 2025.\n\nAnd the best part? We know this list will be even harder to write in 2026.\n\nThis wasn’t the way it was supposed to happen.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin was supposed to reach her century of World Cup race wins at the start of the season, near her childhood home and the school that helped make her a champion in Vermont.\n\nInstead, the races in Killington in November 2024 nearly ended her career. A violent crash sent her tumbling across the snow. She suffered a puncture wound in her abdomen; whatever caused it nearly tore through her colon.\n\nShiffrin spent the next nine weeks recovering physically, before returning to the slopes in February, fit in her body but a shadow of her former self, unable even to make it down a giant slalom hill.\n\nShe arrived in Sestriere, Italy, with low expectations, but after the first run, she had a lead of just under a 10th of a second. That meant she had to go hard or go home in the second run.\n\nOf course, she went hard, and secured that unprecedented 100th victory.\n\n“The mountain ahead of me is steep and long,” Shiffrin said during a news conference after the race. “I just have to take this day and be grateful for it. Because it’s a small moment in the middle of many tough moments that makes me feel like maybe I can be good again.”\n\nMaybe? Shiffrin started the 2025-26 season winning four consecutive slalom races. Now she has 105 wins — and counting.\n\nUConn star Paige Bueckers earned the storybook ending to her collegiate career as the Huskies demolished UCLA and South Carolina in the 2025 Final Four to win their 12th title in program history. ESPN’s Ryan Ruocco had been sitting on the final call of “the book of Bueckers”, as the UConn guard had been destined for stardom for years.\n\nBueckers was the top recruit in a loaded 2020 high school class (one that included Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink in its top five) and immediately fulfilled that promise by winning national player of the year honors as a freshman. Her debut season ultimately ended in disappointment in the national semifinals, as the Huskies’ title drought extended to five years, and the real struggle was yet to come. Over the next three seasons, Bueckers was betrayed by her own body with multiple leg injuries and her teammates’ inability to stay healthy, causing her to delay her entrance into the WNBA and play a fifth and final year at UConn.\n\nThe payoff came in 2025. With a healthy Azzi Fudd and freshman phenom Sarah Strong by her side, Bueckers led the Huskies to the promised land as UConn won its first championship in nine years.\n\nAfter four Final Fours and three All-American seasons, Bueckers cried on coach Geno Auriemma’s shoulder as she exited her last game with victory in hand, adding the ultimate item to her historic college resume. Eight days later, Bueckers was the obvious No. 1 pick in the WNBA Draft, en route to being named an All-Star, all-WNBA and rookie of the year.\n\nWhile Turki Al-Sheikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority, continues to ignore its existence, women’s boxing plants its feet and keeps on punching, producing historic moments such as the night of July 11 this year, when one of the greatest female fighters of all time, Katie Taylor defended her undisputed junior welterweight title against Amanda Serrano inside Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe entire night was a showcase of women’s boxing, with the trilogy fight between Taylor and Serrano headlining the first all-female boxing card to be held at the Garden, featuring three undisputed and two unified title fights. It all took place in front of a sellout crowd of 19,721, split between Irish and Puerto Rican fans, with millions more watching the Netflix-streamed show (nearly six million globally tuned in from opening to closing bell).\n\nThe main event went Taylor’s way via majority decision after a tight 10-round battle, giving the Irishwoman a three-fight sweep over the unified featherweight world champion, though this was undoubtedly the most convincing win of the three. Despite the single-sided outcome, their trilogy will go down in history as one of the most significant battles in women’s boxing history, showing the sport deserves its place in the brightest of spotlights.\n\nEngland were heading home. Within 25 minutes, they were 2-0 down against Sweden in soccer’s European Championship quarterfinals. They had dug themselves a deep hole and it seemed there was no way back. All Sweden had to do was hold on for 11 minutes…\n\nBut then up popped Lucy Bronze at the back post. Still at 2-1, Sweden could nick it. Then came England’s saviour, 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang, levelling the game at 2-2.\n\nA collision, bloody nose, cramp and Bronze strapping her own leg added to the drama of extra time before a topsy-turvy penalty shootout that went to sudden death. Hannah Hampton should be credited for saving two spot kicks but I have never seen someone strut up to the spot, whip off a bandage and dispatch their penalty with such ruthlessness as Bronze did. She later revealed she had been playing with a broken bone in her leg.\n\nThe Lionesses should have been down and out. Through sheer grit, they rose again on their way to becoming European champions. Again.\n\nOn an October Friday night in Phoenix, A’ja Wilson strutted around the underbelly of Mortgage Matchup Center, rattling a pink tambourine. The Las Vegas Aces had won their third title in four seasons and Wilson, the league’s first four-time MVP, was basking in the victory, parading around the stadium. She was heard as loudly as her play was impactful.\n\nThere was little drama entering that evening’s contest in large part because of what Wilson did two nights earlier. With 0.3 seconds remaining in Game 3 of Las Vegas’ WNBA Finals matchup with the Phoenix Mercury, and Las Vegas leading the series 2-0, Wilson sank the biggest shot of her career. She drove left from the elbow, spun away from the rim to create space, and elevated for a short jumper over the outstretched arms of Phoenix’s Alyssa Thomas.\n\nFor the briefest of seconds, the ball rattled around the rim. Then it fell, giving Las Vegas a two-point lead and a decisive advantage in the series. They would close it out 48 hours later.\n\nThe shot was the moment of an, at times, underwhelming finals (in part because of Las Vegas’ dominance), and a defining moment for Wilson. The play call had been simple: put the ball in the MVP’s hands. The memory of what happened will last for years to come.\n\nThe PWHL welcomed two new teams in Vancouver and Seattle — the league’s first wave of expansion after two seasons of early success and rapid growth — and brought on seismic change.\n\nRosters were torn apart, with superstars Hilary Knight and Sarah Nurse on the move due to the league’s player dispersion process. Each team lost four players from its 2024-25 roster through the expansion draft and exclusive signing window, which was designed to ensure the PWHL’s newest teams could compete on day one.\n\nWhile there have been some growing pains early in the 2025-26 season, Seattle and Vancouver have two of the most talented rosters in the PWHL. They’re also already two of the league’s most successful teams from a business perspective.\n\nIn its first-ever game on Nov. 21, the Vancouver Goldeneyes sold out the Pacific Coliseum (14,958) and drew the largest crowd of any game played at a regular PWHL home venue. One week later, the Seattle Torrent beat that record with 16,014 at Climate Pledge Arena, which also set a record for attendance at a professional women’s hockey game in the United States.\n\nAccording to the league, Seattle had the most single-day jersey sales in PWHL history when the team’s inaugural jerseys went on sale Oct. 21. Vancouver was right on its heels, and has sold the most season tickets league-wide. Seattle, the league said, is third, behind Toronto.\n\nAnd more change is soon to come in 2026.\n\nThe league could add between two and four teams by next season, according to executive vice president of business operations Amy Scheer, who went public with the plans when addressing Ottawa city council last month and doubled down on those plans in an interview with CNBC.\n\n“We are expanding again, it’s either two to four teams,” she said. “If I were a betting woman, I’d say it’d be four teams. And then I think we’ll hold at 12 for a bit.”\n\nAll sporting events produce joy and misery on some level. And then there is the 2025 Wimbledon women’s singles final.\n\nOn one side of the net, Iga Świątek cemented her status as the greatest player of her era with a dominant 6-0, 6-0 win, capturing the most important title in tennis — and the one that she least expected to win.\n\nAfter the most difficult period of her career, her status as the best since Serena Williams became inarguable.\n\nIt doesn’t get more perfect than that.\n\nOn the other side of the net was Amanda Anisimova. A year prior, she had been outside the top 300 and had failed to qualify for Wimbledon. Now she’d made the final — and froze, on the most hallowed stage in tennis, in front of millions of people around the world.\n\nAnisimova’s mother rarely attends her matches out of superstition. She’d flown across the Atlantic for this one. Ugh.\n\nBut then, Anisimova, who lost her father to a sudden heart attack at 17, gave a tearful speech that was sad and rousing all at once, a tribute to her mother for her love and loyalty that announced her to the world as a sports star in her lowest tennis moment.\n\nAnd seven weeks later, at the U.S. Open, Anisimova found Świątek across the net again — and managed to exorcize the ghosts of the grass with a win.\n\nAs the primary story of the NWSL offseason, Trinity Rodman is the free agent figuring out if she can stay with the Washington Spirit and get paid what she’s worth. Remembering her emotional return to the field in August is the perfect reminder of why so much of the conversation revolves around her.\n\nAfter months recovering from a lingering back injury, Rodman returned to the pitch at Audi Field, but was not fit enough to start. Instead, 15 minutes was all she needed to score a game-winning goal over the Portland Thorns, immediately bursting into tears as she was swarmed by her teammates in celebration.\n\nRodman is the shooting star of the NWSL, and now the flashpoint for the existential question of how the league retains its biggest talent — but she’s also just a 23-year-old human, trying to play the game she loves.\n\nOn a wet track at the Japan National Stadium in September, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone ran her way, once more, into the record books.\n\nThe 26-year-old had boldly switched from the 400-metre hurdles to the one-lap flat, moving out of an event in which she holds the world record and forfeiting an almost certain gold medal over the barriers.\n\nIn her way stood Olympic champion Marileidy Paulino and defending world champion Salwa Eid Naser. Paulino clocked 47.98secs, but McLaughlin-Levrone stunned them both, flying round in 47.78secs, the second-fastest time by a woman and only 0.18s off Marita Koch’s 1985 world record.\n\nIt was the first race where two women had run 400m in under 48 seconds.\n\nDuring another French Open blighted by allegations of sexist scheduling, Loïs Boisson offered the best possible rejoinder.\n\nThe wild-card entry, ranked No. 361 at the time, became the first Frenchwoman since 2011 to reach the semifinals, and her run became one of the stories of the tournament.\n\nOn one level, it was personal: Boisson had a wild card in 2024, but tore a knee ligament just before the tournament. She did not even watch it on TV.\n\nBut it also came in the context of zero women’s matches being selected for the coveted night slot on Court Philippe-Chatrier, the main stadium, for the second year in a row. Women’s matches also opened play — a slot with the stands at their most empty — every day of the tournament that both men’s and women’s matches were played. Tournament officials maintained that the decisions were not a comment on the quality of women’s tennis.\n\nBoisson’s fourth-round match, against then-world No. 3 Jessica Pegula, was declined for the primetime slot by the tournament, multiple people briefed on discussions between Amazon and the French Open told The Athletic at the time.\n\nSo Boisson started the biggest match of her life in front of swathes of empty seats, which steadily filled as news of an upset swept across Roland Garros and Boisson became the first home women’s quarterfinalist at Roland Garros for eight years.\n\nBoisson then beat No. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva to reach the semis, where she lost to eventual winner Coco Gauff. But her stirring performances captured the imagination of supporters and showed the potency of women role models being given the sport’s biggest stages — especially at their home event.\n\nLottie Woad began the year as the reigning amateur world No. 1 of women’s golf. She will end it ranked 11th on the Rolex professional world rankings.\n\nIn July, we saw a “Woad summer”: the Englishwoman, 21, started July by winning the Irish Open by six strokes. One week later, she finished third at the Evian Championship, one of the women’s game’s five majors. The best part? She was still an amateur at both events, so had to forego earnings of around half a million pounds ($660,000).\n\nBut it wasn’t riches Woad — who has since earned $831,400 — sought, it was the holy grail: an LPGA Tour card.\n\nThen, on the last weekend of July, Woad won the Scottish Open at Dundonald Links by three shots. It was her professional debut and the first time since 2018 that a women’s golfer had won their inaugural event after turning pro – that has only happened twice before.\n\n“If you don’t know who Lottie is, you don’t follow golf,” Amy Bond, Woad’s coach at Florida State University, told The Athletic at the time. Plenty of people know her name now, that’s for sure.\n\nBefore the WNBA’s mid-season showcase, players participating in the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game took the floor in Indianapolis revealing a message on their shirts: “Pay Us What You Owe Us.” The shirts made a clear statement, one that resonated across the sporting landscape and brought waves of attention to the ongoing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) discussion between the players union and the league.\n\nThe WNBA is generating record revenue and expanding. Franchise valuations are soaring. Amid the growth period, players are seeking a significant change not just in how much they are being paid, but to the salary system that determines what they are being paid.\n\nTensions between the two sides continued to escalate throughout the summer and into the fall, highlighted by a press conference on the eve of the WNBA Finals when Minnesota Lynx Napheesa Collier lambasted WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert and the league office. Collier said the WNBA has “the worst leadership in the world.” Engelbert was pressed to answer questions about her job status.\n\nAnd while those questions have publicly dissipated, the two sides remain on edge. They have agreed to two extensions of the deadline in recent months, but gaps remain and it is unclear when a new agreement will be reached.\n\nThe women’s rugby union World Cup in England was a watershed moment, a line drawn in the sand that marked a before and after.\n\nA record 81,885 fans attended the final in which England beat Canada 33-13 at London’s Twickenham Stadium, the largest women’s rugby crowd in history. It represented a 518 per cent increase from 15 years ago, when England hosted the 2010 World Cup final at the Twickenham Stoop, which has a capacity of 14,800.\n\nWhat’s more, 50 per cent of fans had never been to a women’s rugby match before. Across the tournament, 444,465 tickets were sold, three times more than the 2022 World Cup.\n\nParallels can be drawn with England women’s triumph on home soil at soccer’s Euro 2022. “What we are trying to prove is that it’s not just a one-off with football,” England winger Abby Dow told reporters. “It’s women’s sport as a whole and it is here to stay.”\n\nThere’s just something about a Gotham run in the playoffs coming in on the final day of the regular season as the final team to clinch the postseason. They won it all in 2023 that way, and managed to repeat the feat in 2025 thanks to clutch performances from Rose Lavelle, Jaedyn Shaw, Emily Sonnett and Ann-Katrin Berger.\n\nAdd in an instant classic of a quote from Shaw, dropped after Gotham upended the Kansas City Current (winners of the NWSL Shield by a whopping 21 points in a historically great season) in Kansas City. Then, they went to Orlando and beat last year’s champions, led by Marta. Finally, the win in San Jose over the Washington Spirit thanks to a Lavelle banger late in the match. An instant classic of a playoff run ending in lifting the Tiffany trophy for the second time in three years.\n\nThey’ll add it to the hardware cabinet, alongside May’s trophy for winning the inaugural Concacaf W Champions Cup. Continental champions and domestic bragging rights — it’s a solid way to wrap 2025, and maybe the start of another NWSL dynasty.\n\nWhen India lost three games in the group stage of their home cricket World Cup, pressure grew. But the team captained by Harmanpreet Kaur, who would go on to make the winning catch in the final against South Africa, reset themselves on their way to a stunning victory in Navi Mumbai.\n\nThe final itself at the DY Patil Stadium was intense. India lost the toss and batted first. A two-hour rain delay stood in their way but when it cleared, they got off to a flier. Shafali Verma hit 87 off 79 balls to set India up for glory as they put up a score of 298-7, the second-highest total in a World Cup final. Smriti Mandhana scored 45 to take her total for the tournament to 434 runs, the most by a player at a World Cup.\n\nSouth Africa, led by captain Laura Wolvaardt, who posted 101 runs, didn’t give up. But the host nation had Deepti Sharma in stellar form and she took five wickets to stop South Africa as India won by 52 to become world champions for the first time.\n\nWhen Lindsey Vonn and her damaged knees barreled out of the start gate at the 2019 World Championships in Sweden for one last time, it was the denouement of one of the greatest careers in Alpine skiing history.\n\nAt the finishing line in the Swedish resort of Are was Ingemar Stenmark, whose then-record of 86 World Cup wins she was four short of equalling. She had begged him to come, she would later tell a crowded news conference. Her father, Alan, and sister, Karin, were there, too. She had always wanted to break Stenmark’s record but this was meant to be the last race for a champion whose body was, she said, “broken beyond repair.”\n\nCompeting in such a brutal event had taken its toll. The injury list over the years was lengthy: broken right arm, fractures in the left knee, broken left ankle, torn ligaments, broken bone in the right leg, concussion.\n\nBut then came a partial knee replacement in 2024 and one of the greatest comebacks in modern sport.\n\nWith titanium in her right knee, the most famous skier of her generation, the first American to win the women’s Olympic downhill, was pain-free for the first time in years.\n\nBut Vonn isn’t merely competing again. She is fast. Not only did she win the year’s first World Cup downhill in Saint Moritz, Switzerland, this month, but she also did so by nearly a second. The next day, she finished on the podium again in the downhill.\n\nWith the 2026 Olympics under two months away, the 41-year-old is a contender and that is remarkable — or, as she said in February, a “miracle.”\n\nLet us know which of these picks was your favorite of 2025 — and tell us about any we have missed! — in the comments below.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nGotham FC, WNBA, Golf, Boxing, Women's Soccer, Women's College Basketball, Olympics, Women's Euros, Women's Hockey, Tennis, Global Sports, Cricket\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "A host of top sports stars and governing bodies have expressed fears that playing fields across England could be built on and disappear if proposed planning reforms come into force.\n\nFormer Lioness Jill Scott, and Olympic champions Sir Mo Farah and Alex Yee are among those to sign an open letter saying they are \"deeply concerned\" by the potential removal of statutory protections for the facilities.\n\nOther signatories included the heads of the Football Association (FA), the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA).\n\nThe government is considering stripping funding agency Sport England of its right to be consulted before a playing field is built on.\n\nIt is part of a plan by ministers to speed up planning decisions as it looks to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.\n\nBut with a consultation underway, the signatories said: \"Playing fields are irreplaceable - and Sport England's statutory consultee role is an important line of defence.\n\n\"Weakening this protection risks accelerating the loss of the very spaces that make grassroots sport and physical activity possible, at a time when participation is growing and demand has never been higher. \"\n\nSport England declined to comment, but this month said it protected more than a thousand playing fields across the country last year. Tasked with increasing physical activity, it has had to be consulted on planning decisions for the past 30 years after an estimated 10,000 playing fields were lost in the 1980s and early '90s.\n\nThe letter has been written by Fields in Trust, a charity that works with local authorities and communities to protect parks and playing fields from development.\n\nIts president, former midfielder Scott, said: \"Bringing together so many people for this letter has been incredibly personal to me. Too many communities risk losing these very spaces. I urge the government to listen carefully. We're not asking for the impossible. We're asking them to protect what already exists, for the generations who will come after us.\"\n\nThe signatories - which also include Eilish McColgan, Sir Matthew Pinsent, Tessa Sanderson, and the heads of UK Athletics, British Cycling and Parkrun, are calling on ministers \"to ensure that any planning reforms retain a meaningful mechanism to protect playing fields and sports facilities for future generations.\n\n\"This is about social justice. The people who need green space the most often have the least access. Without these protections, the health and wellbeing of communities will suffer. \"\n\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: \"There are already strong protections in place for playing fields which we are proposing to keep and we are investing £400m into grassroots sport.\"\n\nBBC Sport has been told no decision will be made until the results of the consultation are fully considered. The government is proposing to remove the Gardens Trust and the Theatres Trust as statutory consultees as well as Sport England, which is expected to reduce more than 3,000 consultations annually.\n\nThis month, the government said there will need to be a sharp surge in housebuilding to meet its promise to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.\n\nBuilders have warned the government will miss its target, after the number of new homes started fell from 207,000 to 139,000 after Labour took office - the lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLast week, Women in Sport said: \"Now is not the time to be putting our playing fields and pitches at risk.\n\n\"Any loss of this space now would come at a critical moment, excluding more women and girls from sport and stunting the growth of one of the UK's biggest success stories.\"\n\nIt is among a number of sports bodies urging members to support a petition titled 'Do not remove Sport England as a statutory consultee for planning applications'.\n\nIt has been signed by almost 16,000 people.",

    "fullText": "Hugo González has made quite an impression on Boston Celtics fans and the rest of the NBA during his rookie season.\n\nIt’s becoming obvious that Hugo’s teammates on the Celtics love him too; how could they not? González plays with a fiery intensity, fearlessness, and desire to win that reminds you what sports are all about.\n\nOn Monday, Celtics center Neemias Queta became the latest player to heap praise upon González.\n\nQueta RAVED about Hugo González this morning at shootaround: \"I knew a couple of people at Real Madrid … that's all they (raved) about, how hard he can play. I've been familiar to a little bit of the stuff that he had going on, but it's amazing to see it live.\"@CLNSMedia pic.twitter.com/ZQ9YXzCWY9\n\n— Celtics on CLNS (@CelticsCLNS) December 22, 2025\n\n“I knew a couple of people at Real Madrid … that’s all they (raved) about, how hard he can play,” Queta said on Monday. “I’ve been familiar to a little bit of the stuff that he had going on, but it’s amazing to see it live.”\n\nCeltics fans are still getting to know González and learning the teenager’s backstory to becoming a first-round pick.\n\nBorn in February 2006 in Madrid, Spain, González emerged as one of Europe’s top young talents through Real Madrid’s renowned youth system. Joining the club at age nine, he quickly rose, debuting professionally in the Liga ACB at just 16 in October 2022, becoming one of the youngest players in Real Madrid history. He excelled in junior competitions, leading Real Madrid U18 to back-to-back Adidas Next Generation Tournament titles in 2023 and 2024, earning MVP honors in the latter.\n\nQueridos Madridistas,\n\nQuiero dar las gracias a toda la entidad del Real Madrid por su cariño y trato durante estos ocho años y, no menos importante, enseñarme a jugar al baloncesto y formarme con unos valores. \n\nEsta etapa se cierra hoy y estoy muy orgulloso de haber cumplido un… pic.twitter.com/8edZSXOBHs\n\n— Hugo González Peña (@hugoglezz_) June 30, 2025\n\nOn the international stage, González contributed to Spain’s silver medals at the 2022 FIBA U17 World Cup and subsequent youth events. In February 2025, he debuted for Spain’s senior national team, scoring 11 points in a EuroBasket qualifier.\n\nSelected 28th overall by the Boston Celtics in the June 2025 NBA Draft, González participated in Summer League before making his regular-season debut. His rookie year has featured fluctuating minutes, with a first career start in October and a breakout performance on December 20, against Toronto, posting his initial double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) in a Celtics victory.\n\nGonzález, Queta, and the rest of the 17-11 Celtics will continue their season on Monday evening when they host the 6-22 Indiana Pacers at TD Garden. Boston will be going for its third-straight victory.\n\nMike Vrabel Has Hilarious Reaction To Will Campbell’s Viral Stunt At Celtics Game",

    "description": "The Times' sports reporting staff selects their favorite story from 2025, a showcase of stories that hold a special place with 17 writers.",
    "fullText": "There are no shortage of year-end lists that employ metrics — unique visitors, page views, minutes spent — to measure the most popular stories of the year.\n\nThe most enjoyable lists, however, are less quantifiable and divined instead by the writers themselves and what they have found most rewarding.\n\nThe following 17 Times staff writers and columnists, listed alphabetically, share their favorite sports stories from 2025.\n\nWhy these stories stuck with me: I actually have two stories from 2025 that I think rise a little above the daily noise, yet in a strange way they are related. The first is about baseball's one-hit wonders, players who played just one game in the major leagues but have seen that appearance shape the rest of their lives. The second is about former Dodger Mike Davis, who spent 10 years in the big leagues but has seen his career defined by one plate appearance, one which ended in the best-remembered walk in the team's history.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: This story captured a sliver of the irreverent joy that Bill Walton brought to everyone he touched, including me.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: Lizbeth Ovalle’s story is one of my favorites because this year she became the player with the highest transfer fee ever paid by a women’s soccer team. She is from Mexico, a country where women’s soccer still faces many disadvantages compared to the men’s league. Ovalle represents how women’s soccer is gaining relevance worldwide, even in places where support has been limited. Earlier in her career, at age 14, she endured 10-hour bus rides to train with the Mexican national team, receiving no pay beyond transportation. The Orlando Pride player recently won the 2025 FIFA Marta Award (FIFA Goal of the Year) for her stunning acrobatic goal, known as the “reverse scorpion kick,\" while playing in Liga MX with Tigres.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: The fun of doing this story is talking to the 20-plus industry executives and experts to find out what would happen to racing nationally if California horse racing were to go away. The story received a lot of attention and even got some attention from NBC, the network that covers the Kentucky Derby. As a reporter, one of the fun challenges is to distill tens of thousands of interview words into a story that makes sense. So, thanks to the Times editors who allowed the story to be of magazine length.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: In a rare visit to Reno, Nev., I spoke with Canelo Álvarez, who showed great pride as he reflected on two decades of building an extraordinary career — the resilience, the sacrifices and the legacy he hopes to leave behind. The piece also gave me rare insight through conversations with his brother Ricardo and his longtime trainer Eddy Reynoso, who shared intimate memories and moments that shaped him inside and outside the ring. Bringing all their voices together made the story feel personal, layered and special.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: What I liked about this was Cooper Kupp, an iconic player and a cornerstone to the Rams rebuilding a fan base in Los Angeles, gave me an exclusive and insightful window into a difficult and painful segment of his life — his parting with the team. He hadn't opened up publicly before this, and I was pleased to have built that relationship and trust so that he was comfortable doing so with me.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: The Dodgers' infusion of Japanese talent has been transformational to the franchise in many ways. But to Dave Roberts, it led to a particularly profound personal awakening, helping one of the most successful managers in MLB history reconnect with familial roots in a way that goes far beyond baseball.\n\nWhy these stories stuck with me: Covering the wrongful-death trial of former pitcher Tyler Skaggs vs. the Angels had elements similar to writing about ballgames: Describe what happened in the courtroom. Finding a story beyond trial testimony was difficult, but my Dec. 15 story predicting a settlement and explaining the secretive, outsized influence of the Angels' insurance companies met the challenge. Four days later the case settled while the jury was deliberating. My story on the rapidly unfolding events and reaction to the outcome ran on A1.\n\nWhy this column stuck with me: It’s unfortunate I had to write this. But our job as journalists is to chronicle what’s happening, and based on what many people told me after it was published, I’m glad I was able to put what they were feeling into words.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: Of all the touted freshmen I’ve covered in my years on the college football beat, Jahkeem Stewart might be the most fascinating. Already a physical marvel as a sixth-grader, he took an unusual path to USC, having played in only a dozen high school games. This was a fun story to report, partly because it also came with great video of Stewart as a young football player, steamrolling pretty much everyone in his path.\n\nWhy these stories stuck with me: Stories are like children — all of them are your favorite. The opportunity to convey how athletes can positively influence and inspire others in their community is always rewarding. Speaking with fans and Polynesian athletes and coaches such as Jesse Sapolu, Norm Chow, Manti Te'o, Marcus Mariota and Jaylen Maiava provided a window into Puka Nacua's impact. And though young Rams defensive linemen and the famed “Fearsome Foursome” are separated by more than a half century, the respect and the homage the young players paid to Rosey Grier — the last living member of the Fearsome Foursome — and Deacon Jones, Merlin Olsen and Lamar Lundy — was heartwarming to report.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: The most common question I got while covering the Chargers had nothing to do with Jim Harbaugh or Justin Herbert. Everyone wanted to know who was in charge of the social media accounts. Investigating weird, funny corners of the internet is my favorite way to remind myself (and hopefully others) that sports don't always have to be serious.\n\nWhy this column stuck with me: I chose “I’m Fighting Parkinson’s One Punch At A Time” because it was a story that took four years to write but one that has resonated immediately and endlessly.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in the winter of 2021, I decided to keep the diagnosis a secret. Initially I didn’t even tell my own three children. I didn’t want people feeling sorry for me, or looking at me differently or, worse, treating me differently. I wanted to continue with my normal life while fighting the disease in private.\n\nAs part of this fight, I attended a boxing class for Parkinson’s patients. The class was filled with 80-year-old women pounding on a heavy bag, 75-year-old men dancing across the floor, elderly and trembling people working hard to stave off the effects of PD. They quickly became my heroes, and deserved to be illuminated as inspirations to others. I finally realized that I could tell their story and maybe push others to come out of the PD shadows and seek the same therapy.\n\nAnd, well, if I was going to write about others with Parkinson’s disease, I would have to come clean about myself. So, with help from boxing instructor Jody Hould and sports editor Iliana Limón Romero, I did. And I’m glad I did. I’ve since heard from countless people that the story moved them to admit their illness and begin boxing therapy or other types of PD workouts. My diagnosis was a punch in the gut. But thanks in part to the encouragement that came from this story, I’m fighting back.\n\nWhy this column stuck with me: The Dodgers did not much care for this story on how increasingly unaffordable Dodger Stadium has become for families. If we're so unaffordable, they said, how come we pack our stadium every night? It's a fair point: Ticket prices are a function of supply and demand, and demand for Dodgers tickets is driven by Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers' dynasty. And the owners of the Dodgers, unlike the owners of too many other teams, put that money back into the team. Still, the Dodgers have a choice whether to maximize revenue or lower some prices so kids can come and the team can develop a new generation of fans. After the Dodgers hit a team-record 4 million in attendance last season and won baseball's first back-to-back championships in 25 years, the affordability challenge will only become more challenging next year.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: In August was year No. 49 for me covering high school sports in Southern California, so on a beach in the summer, I wrote down some memories how it all started. Next fall will be a countdown of 50 best memories/stories for 50 years.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: I enjoyed getting the backstory of this unusual mural. Some great photos by Juliana Yamada made the article look really good.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: In one of the biggest and most shocking trades in NBA history, being the first to get this honest reaction from Anthony Davis about being traded to Dallas for Luka Doncic showed that building and maintaining relationships can pay off.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Kansas lawmakers are poised to vote Monday on a proposal that could lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line from Missouri, and replace popular but aging Arrowhead Stadium with a new facility capable of hosting major year-round events.

    "fullText": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas lawmakers are poised to vote Monday on a proposal that could lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line from Missouri, and replace popular but aging Arrowhead Stadium with a new facility capable of hosting major year-round events.\n\nThe meeting of the Legislative Coordinating Council, which includes the state's top lawmakers, is expected to be attended by Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and other team officials. If the proposal is passed, the Chiefs could move swiftly in announcing plans to depart their 53-year-old home at the Truman Sports Complex for a stadium that could cost upwards of $2 billion.\n\nThe state's proposal would allow for STAR bonds to be issued to cover up to 70% of the overall cost of the project. They would be paid off with state sales and liquor tax revenues generated in a defined area around around the sports complex.\n\nThe same bonding process was used to build Kansas Speedway and the surrounding shopping and entertainment district, known as The Legends, in Kansas City, Kansas — the area where a future stadium for the Chiefs is most likely to be built.\n\nThe area is also home to Children's Mercy Park, where Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer plays its home matches.\n\n“The state of Kansas is in active discussions with the Kansas City Chiefs about the prospects of building a new stadium and other facilities in Kansas,” the Kansas Department of Commerce said last week. “No final agreement has been reached, but this would be a massive economic win for Kansas and benefit Kansans for generations to come. We are aggressively pursuing this opportunity.”\n\nThe move by the Chiefs would be a massive blow to Missouri lawmakers and Gov. Mike Kehoe, who have been working on a package of their own to prevent a second NFL franchise in a decade from leaving their borders. The Rams departed St. Louis for Los Angeles a decade ago in part because of their inability to secure funding to help replace The Dome at America’s Center.\n\nKehoe backed a special legislative session in June to authorize bonds covering up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, plus up to $50 million of tax credits for each stadium and unspecified aid from local governments.\n\nThe special session came in response to Kansas lawmakers approving their bond package.\n\nThe Chiefs originally planned an $800 million renovation of Arrowhead Stadium in a joint effort with the Kansas City Royals, who are similarly planning to build a new facility to replace Kauffman Stadium — which sits a couple of hundred yards across a parking lot from Arrowhead Stadium — when the two teams' leases with Jackson County, Missouri, expire in January 2031.\n\nBut after county voters soundly defeated a local sales tax extension last year, the Royals and Chiefs began work on separate plans.\n\nThe Royals will not be discussed by Kansas lawmakers Monday, but momentum appears to be building behind their own move across the state line. An affiliate of the club already has purchased the mortgage on a tract of land in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nQuinton Lucas, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, has been working to keep both franchises on the Missouri side of the state line. He said in a statement over the weekend that negotiations had continued with the Chiefs throughout last week.\n\n“We’ll reserve further comment until we hear from the Kansas City Chiefs,” Lucas said.\n\nHunt has long said his preference was to renovate Arrowhead Stadium, which was beloved by his father and team founder, the late Lamar Hunt. It is considered one of the jewels of the NFL, alongside Lambeau Field in Green Bay, and is revered for its tailgating scene and home-field advantage; it currently holds the Guinness World Record for the loudest stadium roar.\n\nThis summer, Arrowhead Stadium will host six World Cup matches, including matches in the Round of 32 and quarterfinals.\n\nThe Hunt family has warmed in recent years to the idea of leaving their own mark by building its replacement, though. Not only would a new, state-of-the-art stadium provide new revenue streams, through luxury seating and accompanying development, but a fixed or retractable roof would allow it to be used year-round. That would mean the potential to host concerts and events, college football bowl games, the Final Four and one of Lamar Hunt's long-held dreams: a Super Bowl.\n\nHanna reported from Topeka.

He also subtly offered a radical statement: Latinos don't just belong in this country, they're essential.\n\nAt a time when questions swirl around this country‘s largest minority group that cast us in a demeaning, tokenized light — how could so many of us vote for Trump in 2024? Why don't we assimilate faster? Why does Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh think it’s OK for immigration agents to racially profile us? — the fact that two of the best college football players in the country this year were Latino quarterbacks didn’t draw the headlines they would’ve a generation ago. That’s because we now live in an era where Latinos are part of the fabric of sports in the United States like never before.\n\nThat’s the untold thesis of four great books I read this year. Each is anchored in Latino pride but treat their subjects not just as sport curios and pioneers but great athletes who were and are fundamental not just to their professions and community but society at large.\n\nShea Serrano writing about anything is like a really great big burrito — you know it’s going to be great and it exceeds your expectations when you finally bite into it, you swear you’re not going to gorge the thing all at once but don’t regret anything when you inevitably do. He could write about concrete and this would be true, but his latest New York Times bestseller (four in total, which probably makes him the only Mexican American author with that distinction) thankfully is instead about his favorite sport.\n\n“Expensive Basketball” finds Serrano at his best, a mix of humblebrag, rambles and hilarity (of Rasheed Wallace, the lifelong San Antonio Spurs fan wrote the all-star forward “would collect technical fouls with the same enthusiasm and determination little kids collect Pokémon cards with.”) The proud Tejano's mix of styles — straight essays, listicles, repeated phrases or words trotted out like incantations, copious footnotes — ensures he always keeps the reader guessing.\n\nBut his genius is in noting things no one else possibly can. Who else would’ve crowned journeyman power forward Gordon Hayward the fall guy in Kobe Bryant’s final game, the one where he scored 60 points and led the Lakers to a thrilling fourth-quarter comeback? Tied a Carlos Williams poem that a friend mistakenly texted to him to WNBA Hall of Famer Sue Bird? Reminded us that the hapless Charlotte Hornets — who haven’t made it into the playoffs in nearly a decade — were once considered so cool that two of their stars were featured in the original “Space Jam?” \"Essential Basketball\" is so good that you’ll swear you’ll only read a couple of Serrano's essays and not regret the afternoon that will pass as quickly as a Nikola Jokic assist.\n\nI recommended “Mexican American Baseball in the South Bay” in my regular columna three years ago, so why am I plugging its second edition? For one, the audacity of its existence — how on earth can anyone justify turning a 450-page book on an unheralded section of Southern California into an 800-page one? But in an age when telling your story because no one else will or will do a terrible job at it is more important than ever, the contributors to this tome prove how true that is.\n\n\"Mexican American Baseball in the South Bay\" is part of a long-running series about the history of Mexican American baseball in Southern California Latino communities. What's so brilliant about this one is that it boldly asserts the history and stories of a community that too often get overlooked in Southern California Latino literature in favor of the Eastsides and Santa Anas of the region.\n\nAs series editor Richard A. Santillan noted, the reaction to the original South Bay book was so overwhelmingly positive that he and others in the Latino History Baseball Project decided to expand it. Well-written essays introduce each chapter; long captions for family and team photos function as yearbook entries. Especially valuable are newspaper clippings from La Opinión that showed the vibrancy of Southern Californians that never made it into the pages of the English-language press.\n\nMaybe only people with ties to the South Bay will read this book cover to cover, and that’s understandable. But it’s also a challenge to all other Latino communities: if folks from Wilmington to Hermosa Beach to Compton can cover their sports history so thoroughly, why can’t the rest of us?\n\nOne of the most surprising books I read this year was Jorge Iber’s “The Sanchez Family: Mexican American High School and Collegiate Wrestlers from Cheyenne, Wyoming,” a short read that addresses two topics rarely written about: Mexican American freestyle wrestlers and Mexican Americans in the Equality State. Despite its novelty, it’s the most imperfect of my four recommendations. Since it's ostensibly an academic book, Iber loads the pages with citations and references to other academics to the point where it sometimes reads like a bibliography and one wonders why the author doesn’t focus more on his own work. And in one chapter, Iber refers to his own work in the first person — profe, you’re cool but you're not Rickey Henderson.\n\n“The Sanchez Family” overcomes these limitations by the force of its subject, whose protagonists descend from Guanajuato-born ancestors that arrived to Wyoming a century ago and established a multi-generational wrestling dynasty worthy of the far-more famous Guerrero clan. Iber documents how the success of multiple Sanchez men on the wrestling mat led to success in civic life and urges other scholars to examine how prep sports have long served as a springboard for Latinos to enter mainstream society — because nothing creates acceptance like winning.\n\n“In our family, we have educators, engineers and other professions,” Iber quotes Gil Sanchez Sr. a member of the first generation of grapplers. “All because a 15-year-old boy [him]…decided to become a wrestler.”\n\nHeard that boxing is a dying sport? The editors of “Rings of Dissent: Boxing and Performances of Rebellion” won’t have it. Rudy Mondragón, Gaye Theresa Johnson and David J. Leonard not only refuse to entertain that idea, they call such critiques “rooted in racist and classist mythology.”\n\nThey then go on to offer an electric, eclectic collection of essays on the sweet science that showcases the sport as a metaphor for the struggles and triumphs of those that have practiced it for over 150 years in the United States. Unsurprisingly, California Latinos earn a starring role. Cal State Channel Islands professor José M. Alamillo digs up the case of two Mexican boxers denied entry in the United States during the 1930s, because of the racism of the times, digging up a letter to the Department of Labor that reads like a Stephen Miller rant: “California right now has a surplus of cheap boxers from Mexico, and something should be done to prevent the entry of others.”\n\nRoberto José Andrade Franco retells the saga of Oscar De La Hoya versus Julio Cesar Chávez, landing less on the side of the former than pointing out the assimilationist façade of the Golden Boy. Mondragón talks about the political activism of Central Valley light welterweight José Carlos Ramírez both inside and outside the ring. Despite the verve and love each “Rings of Dissent” contributors have in their essays, they don't romanticize it. No one is more clear-eyed about its beauty and sadness than Mondragón’s fellow Loyola Marymount Latino studies profe, Priscilla Leiva. She examines the role of boxing gyms in Los Angeles, focusing on three — Broadway Boxing Gym and City of Angels Boxing in South L.A, and the since-shuttered Barrio Boxing in El Sereno.\n\n“Efforts to envision a different future for oneself, for one’s community, and for the city are not guaranteed unequivocal success,” she writes. “Rather, like the sport of boxing, dissent requires struggle.”\n\nIf those aren’t the wisest words for Latinos to embrace for the coming year, I’m not sure what is.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "Letters to Sports: No defense for the Rams, or Bill Plaschke's prediction",
    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section share their thoughts on the Rams, Dodgers, UCLA and Mick Cronin, as well as the NBA Cup.",
    "fullText": "Once again, Bill Plaschke has literally jinxed another Southern California sports team with his proclamation questions regarding the Rams:\n\nWho’s going to stop the unstoppable offense?\n\nWho’s going to score on the persistent defense?\n\nWho’s going to outwit the coaching genius?\n\nI have the answers, and it's not just Seattle. It's their special teams, their defensive backs and it's coach Sean McVay's play-calling. Well, maybe the referees … but that's for another day.\n\nThanks again for the poison-pen article, Bill.\n\nJust four days after Bill Plaschke promised that the Rams would win the Super Bowl, the team blew a big lead and lost in a stinker to the Seahawks. Like my mother told me when I was a kid: Be honest, respect others, and bet against Plaschke — you'll win every time!\n\nCan we quit the Rams praise now? They can’t tackle anyone that gets past the line of scrimmage. Coach Sean McKay and defensive coordinator Chris Shula went into a shell as the Rams lost the game to the Seahawks and any chance of a long playoff run.\n\nHow many more times do we need to see Emmanuel Forbes chasing a receiver because of a blown coverage or missing an assignment and giving up a big play. The secondary is the weak link in the Rams defense and he’s absolutely a broken link. Chris Shula, please put someone else back there. The mascot Rampage would be a better choice than Forbes.\n\nBill Plaschke writes of the Rams: \"Who's going to score on the persistent defense?\" Maybe the Lions with 34 points?\n\nWilliam P. Bekkala\nWest Hollywood\n\nBill Plaschke's Rams encomium is puzzling. During the course of the game I watched, Detroit moved through the Rams defense like Sherman through Georgia. This was, at best, park football. The first team that exploits the Rams defense as the Lions did and consistently moves the ball on offense will defeat the Rams.\n\nJust when the Rams thought that they solved their kicking situation, they lost another game because of a missed field goal. After the game, they must have been kicking themselves.\n\nIt looks like the Bills are going to win the Super Bowl, because Plaschke wrote, \"The Bills? Not ever.\"\n\nThose who think what the Dodgers are doing is sound financial decision-making only have to look a little in front of their noses. The Dodgers have now committed over a billion dollars in deferred salary. What happens when that bill becomes due? They will commit another billion in the same buy-it-now, pay-it-later mode.\n\nOther teams can’t and shouldn’t follow this lead, which eventually fans pay for in higher prices for everything Dodger related. We will have their management to thank for the impending 2027 MLB labor stoppage and no baseball at that time.\n\nJust when you think that things could not possibly get any worse in Westwood, UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond adds five more years to Mick Cronin’s contract.\n\nKudos to the Knicks for apparently deciding not to hang a banner to signify their NBA Cup championship, despite not winning a title since 1973, whereas the Lakers have won 11 since that time. Hopefully new ownership of the Lakers will reverse course and take down the Lakers’ barren banner for their 2023 Cup championship.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

    "description": "Linda Martindale, a boys high school coach, mental fitness expert and mom to collegiate players, says college athletes have this special ingredient.",
    "fullText": "Linda Martindale wasn’t brave, at least she didn’t think she was after she had been hired as a varsity boys basketball coach.\n\n“Once the game started, I was fine,” says Martindale, now in her sixth season leading Lincoln-Sudbury (MA), “but walking into the gym and people thinking I'm the scorekeeper or whatever, I had to sort of overcome this feeling of, ‘Do I belong in the gym?’ ”\n\nShe made the three words her mantra, and she convinced herself she was brave. You need to be as an athlete, or a coach, in today’s world of youth sports.\n\n“I have fond memories of my athletic career, but I also know there was a lot of heartache and it was very difficult,” says Martindale, who played Division II basketball at Alaska-Anchorage and in the old Pac-10 at Arizona in the late 1980s and early 1990s. “But nowadays, it's totally different. Your whole career is splashed all over social media.”\n\nMartindale’s father devoted his life to coaching baseball and football, driving her and her three siblings to be punctual and polite. He was hard on them, she says, but led with love.\n\n“If I had a bad game, the people in the stands knew and my parents knew, and that was it,” Martindale tells USA TODAY Sports. “You'd come home and your parents would say, ‘How did the game go?' You could self-report that. Easy to deal with.\n\n“My oldest son would literally get DMs from strangers that say horrible things if he missed a free throw in the clutch. The landscape is very different. And it obviously trickles down to youth.”\n\nMartindale got certified as a mental fitness coach to help ease the pressure on her three sons and one daughter (all of them have played college sports) but also other young athletes.\n\nShe works with sports teams at Division I Holy Cross and D-III Curry College, as well as individual athletes. She says there’s a secret beyond the physical component to playing sports in college.\n\nWe offer 10 ways, through consultation with Martindale, for parents to help athletes get there.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nWhen Martindale walked into the gym feeling the male eyes on her, she felt she needed an inner coach.\n\nYour coach on the court or field will tell you what to do but, Martindale says, the one in your head will kick you in the butt to help get you where you need to go.\n\nJenny Levy, who has won four national titles as North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, believes so strongly in an inner coach she likes when her players form their own mantras.\n\n“Confidence looks good on you,” she heard her players say to each other in 2013, the year they broke through.\n\n“A lot of coaches will say, ‘This is our saying,’ ” Levy told Martindale on Martindale’s ‘Game Changers’ podcast. “And I think that’s fine – to each his own – but I actually let our team organically come up with their own little things. This is the team having a good time together.”\n\nThe inner voice tells you it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, only what you do.\n\nTo come up with your own mantra, Martindale says, ask yourself why you play a sport? Look for performance cues to grind that thought into you.\n\n“It's not fun to lose, but it's still really fun to compete and to play,” Martindale says. “OK, good, let's start with that. So at least you can say it's not fun to lose, but it's really fun to prepare for the game. We've now established that the majority of the time is fun. Now we can get through the parts that aren't fun.”\n\nWas that ‘fun’? How Coco Gauff’s tough US Open embodies what the word means\n\nKids respond to the truth. We don’t need to always sugarcoat it.\n\nInstead of saying, “It’s not so hard,” acknowledge that something is.\n\nMaybe you’re afraid that you might lose or you’re going to make a fool of yourself in front of everybody.\n\n“I'm happy that you can articulate a fear,” Martindale might tell an athlete. “Now, let's squash it. What are you really afraid of? Is it really embarrassing to lose, or is it embarrassing not to play at all?\n\n“It would be embarrassing if you threw yourself on the floor and screamed and cried in the middle of the game. But nobody thinks it's embarrassing that you sat on the bench, cheered on your team, and then fought another day to try to get some minutes.”\n\nA current role doesn’t mean an ultimate role. Martindale goes back to Tom Brady.\n\nHe was once buried deep on Michigan’s depth chart. But he focused on nailing reps he got in practice. He was at game speed when he found himself starting.\n\n“As parents, we say, ‘I don't think you should have to be the backup quarterback,' \" Martindale says. “ 'I think you should be the quarterback.’ This is not helping. What you need to do is crush being the backup. And then your time comes and you're ready instead of spending so much time worrying that you don't have the role that you want (and) you're not ready for it.”\n\nAnother of her podcast guests, Luke Avdalovic, a former walk-on basketball player at Northern Arizona University, told her: “I had a teammate named JoJo Anderson and he told me, ‘If you want to find a role into this team, find one thing that you’re really good at. Make sure you’re head and shoulders better than every single other person on the team. Then they can’t take you off the floor.’ ”\n\nAvdalovic became a top sharpshooter who rose to the NBA G-League.\n\nAvdalovic has shot so much over the years he feels he’s never really in a slump. Some days he shoots better than others, but that is just the law of averages.\n\n“You can't be a pitcher if you can't pitch poorly,” Martindale says. “You can't be a shooter if you can't miss. It's just not possible (to) be perfect. So what do you do when you're imperfect?”\n\nThe next time your son or daughter has a bad game, ask them, “Did you compete hard?”\n\nYou don’t want them to lose or fail but they need to know how to do both. As parents, and as coaches, our best support can come out of struggles.\n\nYou know the term if you’re a baseball fan. Suddenly, Steve Sax or Chuck Knoblauch can’t make a routine throw from second to first base, or Rick Ankiel can’t throw a strike.\n\n“Yips is not a real thing,” Martindale says.\n\nStruggles come alive, she says, when we say them out loud. Instead, if you’re a parent or a coach, tell your athlete: “I really believe in you. Just keep throwing, you'll get it back, you'll find a rhythm.”\n\nWhen kids feel deep-rooted support, they have more confidence in themselves.\n\nMartindale says today’s world for young athletes is like taking the SATs while your score is being put on a scoreboard.\n\nSometimes, it seems, we expect our kids to be good at everything. Martindale asks the ones with whom she works, “What class are you good at?”\n\nShe doesn’t necessarily mean classes in which they have an “A,” but the ones they enjoy most.\n\nSometimes it takes looking at things through a less critical lens. We have an “A” in science, but we enjoy the challenge of English Lit, in which we have a B-, which energizes us to try and bring up the grade.\n\nEugene Glisky, Martindale’s father, had his ashes buried on the field where he coached near Toronto. She suspects he changed the lives of many young men.\n\nBut she stops short of calling a team a family.\n\n“When a coach says to a parent, ‘I'm gonna treat your son or daughter like my own,' I want to say, ‘No, thank you. I don't need you to treat my son like he’s your own,’ ” Martindale says. “He has a great father. What I really want you to do is treat him like a player and a human being.\n\n“It's a team, which is amazing and I love my kid being part of a team. But it's not a family. Why? Because what happens when your family cuts you?”\n\nThere are times when we need to be Coach, and times when we need to be Mom or Dad. Martindale had to be Coach when Judson, her oldest who now plays basketball for Manchester Basketball Club in the United Kingdom, came out of a game when he was younger and looked at her like, “Why are you pulling me?\n\nHe threw his water bottle, and she turned and said: \"You can take your sneakers off. You're done.\"\n\nThe same coach, though, drove him home from a different game, criticizing him for what he didn’t do while failing to realize he was sick.\n\n\"So many examples of total failure by me,\" she says. \"What kind of mother would be talking to their kid about some offensive set when clearly they needed a mother?\"\n\nLevy, North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, does parent Zoom calls. Before the first one, she asked her players what they wanted her to tell them.\n\n“They said, ‘We don’t want to talk about the game at the tailgate after,’ ” Levy told Martindale. “ ‘We don’t want any parent to have this sad conversation after the wins because their kid didn’t play. We want the parents to sit together. We want them to be positive on the sideline.’ ”\n\nLevy says the players gave her a Letterman top 10 of parent no-no’s, which she shared on the Zoom.\n\n“I think they were pretty shocked,” says Levy, who coaches her daughter, Kate, on the team. “Our kids were like, ‘Last year was not OK. This is what we want and this is what we need this year.’\n\n“And then if we saw it, I had permission from our players to call the parent and say, ‘Hey, you’re at the tailgate and your behavior was below the line for our program.’\n\n“What if I acted like that as a parent? What if I did that in the middle of a tailgate?”\n\nLevy’s point: A kid could be completely happy but if the parent is unhappy with their role, then the kid’s unhappy. And if the parent isn’t feeling like their kid is getting a fair shake, or they’re being really negative toward coaches or teammates, the kid internalizes the feeling.\n\n“Your influence is not neutral, parents,” Levy says.\n\nDuring a clip Martindale shared of her speaking to athletes, she says, “There has to be wins in there. Otherwise, you can't go an entire season and be like, ‘If we don't win a game, this whole season is a waste.’ ”\n\nShe is not necessarily talking about checks in the “W” column as much as what we perceive as personal wins. Maybe you tell a teammate you loved the way he blocked a punt or moved into position on defense. If we don’t have wins, even within losses, you don’t learn how to win.\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nMartindale believes there are five pillars of mental fitness: 1. Staying in the moment; 2. Controlling the controllables; 3. Seeing mistakes as opportunities; 4. Not judging yourself (or others) too harshly and 5. Comparison (positively).\n\nShe says she was once a failure at all of them. Has she since learned a special ingredient we need to have to play college sports?\n\nMartindale thinks Angela Duckworth, director of the Penn-Wharton Behavior Change for Good Initiative, said it best.\n\n“It’s grit,” Martindale has said. “I'm obsessed with grit, because we know it's a single defining characteristic of successful people.\n\n“Can you get up after you get knocked down? The athletes who are successful at every level of college, I think, have this kind of dog mentality that is about grit. And of course, you have to be skilled and you have to be athletic but when we really look at who performs best when it counts, it's people who have failed. Over and over and over. And then now they succeed.”\n\nWe can’t beat our kids up over mistakes. Let them hear the voice in their head that gives them the grace to move forward from them.\n\nThen, as Martindale says: “Watch them fail and then watch what they do after they fail.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "fullText": "Girona FC returns to Montilivi this Sunday, December 21, at 2:00 PM to face one of the most challenging opponents in the EA Sports League 2025-26, Atlético de Madrid. The match comes at an intense moment in the season, with both teams determined to earn valuable points towards their respective football goals.\n\nGirona approaches this match after a very positive weekend, with a notable away victory against Real Sociedad (1-2), their first win of the season away from Montilivi. This triumph comes in a context where Girona has competed with determination in recent league matches, also achieving notable draws such as the 1-1 against Real Madrid and the 1-1 against Betis.\n\nMeanwhile, Atlético de Madrid arrives at Montilivi with a solid trajectory in the league despite some recent difficulties. In the previous matchday, the team led by Diego Simeone returned to winning ways with a 2-1 victory over Valencia, with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Koke, regaining confidence after some matchdays with irregular results. This triumph has boosted the team's confidence and helped them remain among the top teams in the LaLiga standings. The Madrid team has also competed internationally, achieving an important result for their European aspirations in the Champions League group stage by winning 2-3 away against PSV.\n\nAmong the most memorable matches is a thrilling 4-3 victory by Girona against Atlético played at Montilivi in January 2024, a duel with goal alternations and intensity, in which the Girona team delivered a memorable offensive performance. On the other hand, in the 2024-25 season, the home match ended with an adverse result (0-4) against Atlético on matchday 38 of the league, a game where the Madrid team showed great offensive effectiveness.\n\nAnother recent example was at the beginning of that same season, when Girona visited the Metropolitano and, despite competing, ended with a 3-0 defeat against the Madrid team.\n\nThe Girona fans will have a date with high-level football at home this Sunday, with the team's commitment to compete intensely from the first minute. As the season progresses and with every point at stake in LaLiga, this preview of the match against Atlético de Madrid sets up a clash that promises excitement, strategy, and dedication from both squads, with Montilivi as the stage for the showdown.",

    "fullText": "Love him or hate him — Jake Paul knows how to draw a reaction out of people. Friday's latest sideshow fight was no different.\n\nIn a matchup that baffled the fight world, former two-time unified heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua made easy work of Paul, dropping the YouTuber-turned-pugilist four times en route to a brutal sixth-round knockout live on Netflix. Joshua was an overwhelming BetMGM favorite coming into the weekend for good reason — the Englishman, who stands 6-foot-6 with a monstrous 82-inch reach, towered over Paul in both stature and résumé, and he put those advantages to good use.\n\nAfter a slow start, Joshua battered Paul around the ring in a bizarre and lopsided fight that saw Paul repeatedly dive for Joshua's legs as if he was shooting an MMA-style double-leg takedown. Paul said afterward that he believed he suffered a broken jaw due to Joshua's powerful punches.\n\nNot surprisingly, given how high-profile Paul's fights have become, the sports world had plenty to say about six rounds it witnessed Friday. Check out some of the reaction to Joshua vs. Paul below.\n\n— Aljamain Sterling (@funkmasterMMA) December 20, 2025\n\n— Mike Pierce (@MikePierce170) December 20, 2025\n\nGreat job AJ 🤝Tremendous heart Jake\n\n— Bill Haney (@BillHaney77) December 20, 2025\n\nWhy are people complaining?

    "fullText": "Netflix has signed ESPN’s Elle Duncan as its first sports anchor. As part of her multiyear deal, she will lead on-air coverage for Netflix Sports across the streamer’s diverse portfolio of growing sports coverage.\n\nHer first on-air hosting gig will be in early 2026 with “Skyscraper Live,” where free solo climber Alex Honnold will attempt to scale Taipei 101, the tallest building in Taiwan.\n\n“Joining Netflix feels like being invited to an already legendary party and somehow getting handed the aux cord!” Duncan said. “For a lifelong utility player, a multisport assignment is a full-circle moment, and being trusted with something this one-of-a-kind feels incredibly special and surreal. I’m bringing boundless energy, storytelling and bad puns no one asked for but will be subjected to anyway.”\n\n“Also, I was told this fast-tracks my kids to meeting the KPop Demon Hunters, so … win-win,” she added.\n\nDuncan comes from ESPN, known for her work on “SportsCenter,” “College GameDay” and “WNBA Countdown.” She specifically covered college and professional basketball, hosting “College GameDay” for women’s basketball across the country.\n\nNetflix has expanded its sports portfolio signing deals with the NFL, MLB, the Women’s World Cup, WWE, FIFA and more, so Duncan’s coverage slate will be diverse.\n\n“Elle Duncan’s proven ability to seamlessly move between hard-hitting sports analysis and warm, personality-driven cultural hosting makes her a perfect fit at Netflix,” Gabe Spitzer, vice president of sports at Netflix, said. “She immediately adds credibility and familiar star power to our global programming slate.”\n\nThe television host started her career in Atlanta, as an anchor for NESN and spending six years as an Atlanta Hawks sideline reporter. She joined ESPN in 2016, where she hosted the 6 p.m. ET edition of “SportsCenter” and held key roles across college and professional basketball. Her final “SportsCenter” appearance was Tuesday.\n\nThe post Netflix Taps ESPN’s Elle Duncan as First Sports Anchor in Multiyear Deal appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "FOX Sports and IndyCar have announced the race broadcast start times for the upcoming 2026 season.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, IndyCar will have a record 19 network windows, with all 17 races featured on broadcast television. It is also the second time in as many years that IndyCar will be the only premier motorsports series in North America with all races broadcast on network television.\n\nUnique to this upcoming season is the summer stretch that also features FOX Sports’ coverage of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The opening match on Sunday, June 21, will lead into the IndyCar Series round at Road America set for 2 pm (all times Eastern). That theme continues as one game in the World Cup’s round of 16 follows the 12:30 pm start time for the race at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course on July 5.\n\nThe only broadcast time unconfirmed is the Music City Grand Prix at Nashville Superspeedway on Sunday, July 19, with the 400-mile race immediately following the FIFA World Cup Final. A start time will be confirmed at a later date.\n\nThe 2025 season was the first year of IndyCar’s multi-year partnership with FOX Sports, with viewership increasing 27% from the previous season. It was the “fastest growth curve of any major sport,” according to the press release.\n\n“Once again FOX Sports is providing an unparalleled platform to showcase the most competitive and dynamic racing series on the planet,” Penske Entertainment Corp. president and CEO Mark Miles said. “On the heels of significant milestones and momentum last year, this new season will provide meaningful opportunities to reach new audiences and build upon the best growth trajectory in all of sports.”\n\nOther notables of the broadcast schedule include the second round of the season at Phoenix Raceway, which will be a unique shared weekend with NASCAR. IndyCar’s return to the 1-mile oval for the first time since 2018 will see race coverage for North America’s premier open-wheel championship begin at 3 pm Sunday, March 7.\n\nThe inaugural Grand Prix of Arlington is set for Sunday, March 15, with a 30-minute prerace beginning at 12:30 pm.\n\nCoverage for qualifying for the 110th Running of the Indianapolis 500 begins at 4 pm on Saturday, May 16 and Sunday, May 17. Additionally, “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” on Sunday, May 24 will feature an extensive six-hour broadcast for the second consecutive year, beginning at 10 am.\n\nIndyCar boss Doug Boles explains new officiating system\n\nIndyCar’s debut round on the Streets of Markham at 12 pm on Sunday, August 16.\n\nLastly, the 2026 season finale is set for Labor Day weekend in a return to Laguna Seca, with coverage beginning with a prerace show at 2:30 pm on Sunday, Sept. 6.\n\n\"There is so much to look forward to on the 2026 NTT IndyCar Series schedule, including our first race at Arlington,” said Pato O’Ward, driver of the No. 5 Arrow McLaren Chevrolet. “As we have already seen in this new partnership, it is one of the most exciting, new additions to our calendar in recent years, and FOX Sports will provide the perfect showcase for our fans watching on TV. The new season can’t get here soon enough.\"\n\nCoverage of all IndyCar practice and qualifying sessions will be featured on either FS1 or FS2, FOX One and the FOX Sports app. The coverage schedule for Indy NXT, the development category for IndyCar, will be announced at a later date.\n\n“I’m a big sports fan, so having the 2026 IndyCar schedule share the stage with FOX’s coverage of the World Cup next summer is going to be exciting,\" said Kyle Kirkwood, driver of the No. 27 Andretti Global Honda. \"2025 was a breakout year for me, and it was especially rewarding to see it all play out on FOX in their first IndyCar season.

    "fullText": "Former model Stacey Williams said Donald Trump groped her at Trump Tower in 1993 while her then-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein watched on in what she described as “some sort of twisted game.”\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the Friday deadline to release the remaining Epstein files, the 57-year-old former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model opened up to The Daily Beast Podcast about her brief relationship with the late sex offender when she was in her twenties and he was in his forties.\n\nWilliams told host Joanna Coles that she met Epstein at a dinner party with other models, “and that’s how I started dating him, which led to, obviously, months later, him walking me into Trump Tower to be groped, assaulted by Donald Trump while the two men stood there and walked and talked as it was happening.”\n\nEpstein and Trump were close friends for many years until a bitter falling-out, supposedly over Epstein poaching Trump’s staff.\n\nIn retrospect, Williams said, it made sense why Epstein kept directing her toward Trump Tower while they were out on a walk and convinced her to “just drop by and see him.”\n\n“I do remember little snippets of Trump saying, ‘Oh yeah, her career is on fire.’ You know, that thing that he does: ‘Everything’s the best,’” she said. “And Jeffrey just kept—he didn’t intervene. He watched it, and then he raged at me in the elevator and on the way down that I allowed it to happen. You know, either it was some sort of twisted game, and he didn’t get the result he wanted. Maybe it was a bet. I don’t know, but I’m confident that that is what occurred.”\n\nShe ended her romance with Epstein soon after.\n\n“I just said, ‘Jeffrey, you are extremely mentally ill and you need to get help. There’s something deeply wrong with you. And stop calling me. I don’t want anything to do with you.’ And he, oddly enough—this is hard for people to understand—but he got weepy. He was very sad.”\n\nThe model previously told The Daily Beast Podcast that Trump “came out of his office right outside of, in sort of the waiting area, and started groping me while the two of them continued having a casual conversation… He’s just moving his hands sort of up and down my body and, like, smiling at him. And Jeffrey smiling back.”\n\nWilliams first went public with her allegations against Trump on a “Survivors for Kamala” Zoom call last year. Though she told NBC News at the time that she had no communications with the Kamala Harris campaign team, that didn’t stop the White House from accusing her of having political motivations.\n\n“These accusations were unequivocally false when they were first contrived and nothing has changed. Democrats and the mainstream media are desperately trying to use this hoax as a distraction to talk about anything other than President Trump’s tremendous successes,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the Daily Beast.\n\nLast year, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt similarly said, “These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris Campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false.”\n\nUnder the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump’s Department of Justice must release the federal investigation files related to the disgraced financier by Friday.\n\nThe co-author of the law, California Democrat Ro Khanna, warned that Justice Department officials “could be subject to prosecution given the federal law” and “hauled in front of Congress, the Oversight Committee” if they fail to release the files on time.\n\nNew episodes of The Daily Beast Podcast are released every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday.

    "title": "Why tonight’s BBC Sports Personality of the Year could ignite the culture war",
    "description": "Comment: After the year of his life, the award should go to Rory McIlroy – though it does not make it a scandal if the public decides to crown someone else",
    "fullText": "Rory McIlroy will be feeling confident when he takes his seat in the audience at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award tonight. We will know that simply because of his presence in the room, and because it is an honour that still carries enough significance and prestige that you want to be there if there’s a good chance you’re going to win.\n\nOthers may disagree. McIlroy, in the past, has been among them. But then, for some, bashing the Sports Personality of the Year contest is as much of an annual ritual as the prize itself, an opportunity to take cheap shots at the BBC, among other things.\n\nMcIlroy has enjoyed an exceptional year, the stuff of dreams, spearheaded by two successes at the Masters and Ryder Cup so astonishing that they may as well have been scripted. There’s no argument against that.\n\nHe won the Masters but did so on an agonising final round that displayed his vulnerabilities and the strength to overcome them, the qualities that make him such an endearing, inspiring champion. Leading Europe to an away Ryder Cup victory, against that American crowd at Bethpage Black, further strengthens his credentials and claim to a season that stands above the rest.\n\nAnd with McIlroy, there is also the sense of if he isn’t crowned SPOTY this year, then when will he ever be? There may be an acknowledgement of legacy and past achievements now that he has completed golf’s career slam. Certainly, given Andy Murray won SPOTY three times and Lewis Hamilton has done so twice, few would argue that McIlroy would not belong in their company in terms of British sporting greats of the past 20 years.\n\nSo, sure, the Northern Irishman should probably win, but this is also a public vote, decided on the night, and the history of this award can tell us it is rarely that straightforward.\n\nAt which point, it is worth considering what may happen should McIlroy lose out, or, rather, what the reaction would be depending on who he could lose out to. The Daily Mail has already declared there would be a “stain” on SPOTY should McIlroy not win the award this year.\n\nWhy? Yes, McIlroy has the strongest case in terms of his achievements. Yes, his victory at Augusta and what Europe achieved at Bethpage Black stirred emotions and created unforgettable drama. But, increasingly, the biggest factor in SPOTY voting can be the divide between sport that is behind a paywall and sport that is open to the largest audience possible, and it is a line that McIlroy, through no fault of his own, falls on the wrong side of.\n\nIt is why Chloe Kelly or Hannah Hampton (unless they split the vote) may stand as the biggest threat to McIlroy after another major tournament victory for the Lionesses. It is why Ellie Kildunne is an excellent outside contender, and why her world champion Red Roses may beat both Europe’s Ryder Cup team and the Lionesses to team of the year.\n\nSport is ultimately at its best when it brings people together. Its power is greatest when it can uplift and inspire. Ultimately, the most-watched moment of 2025 was Hampton saving from Aitana Bonmati and Mariona Caldentey and Kelly thumping her penalty into the net as the Lionesses won the Euros again – becoming the first England football team to win a major tournament on foreign land. The victory that had within it the capacity to influence society was the Red Roses lifting the World Cup at a sold-out Twickenham, a dominant, jubilant team celebrating how it had broken down barriers while demonstrating that strength and athleticism come in different shapes and sizes.\n\nAn accusation often levelled at the BBC is that its diminished offering of live sport means it has lost other events that consistently conjured this magic, such as the Masters. But in turn, the decision to platform the Women’s Euros and Women’s Rugby World Cup has seen audiences, particularly female viewership, hit record numbers. The success of a Lionesses or Red Roses team can now become a national event in the same way as men’s football or men’s rugby. It’s almost as if making live sport accessible and these athletes visible, following decades of marginalisation and catering to the male audience, has brought in new fans and levels of interest across a broader range.\n\nThis should be celebrated. But then, this is the BBC. To some, even the all-female presenting line-up of tonight’s event, in Gabby Logan, Clare Balding and Alex Scott, is evidence of an organisation and SPOTY award that has gone overly woke and lost its shine. You can probably imagine, then, what the reaction would be should either Kelly or Hampton follow Beth Mead in 2022 and Mary Earps in 2023 and win, even if more than 16 million people watched the Lionesses’ latest tournament victory.\n\nHow the votes between Kelly and Hampton are split will be another factor as, for the first time, two members of the same team have been named on the final shortlist. Why both? It may be down to England’s bewildering summer of survival and Kelly’s rather curious role within it, the star who delivered on the biggest moments but yet did not start a match. Over the course, Hampton was integral to keeping the Lionesses alive, and the goalkeeper was unlucky not to win player of the Euro 2025 – she was certainly England’s.\n\nThe truth is that any of the six on the final shortlist would deserve to win. That includes the two individual world champions, one crowned at the start of the year and the other less than a fortnight ago, in Luke Littler and Lando Norris, both of whom are immensely popular as well. But, after the year of his life, it should be McIlroy. It does not, though, make it a scandal or bring a “stain” on the award if the public decides to crown someone else.",

    "fullText": "Scarlet Knights across a wide variety of fall and winter sports earned recognition this past week, headlined by national podium finishes, conference and national honors, and academic acknowledgements. This includes preseason, midseason, and postseason awards, watch lists, and national medals.\n\nRutgers divers Bailee Sturgill and Katerina Hoffman had a standout showing at the 2025 USA Diving Winter Nationals, teaming up to earn a silver medal in the synchronized platform event with a second-place score of 488.91. Additionally, Sturgill added a second silver medal on synchronized 3M, as she teamed up with Lilly Witte of Indiana. The duo had a final score of 528.12, trailing the winning duo by roughly 31 points.\n\nSturgill and Witte won the synchronized 3M event in May during the USA Diving Nationals, but were unable to go back-to-back. Sturgill also competed on the 3M dive, while Hoffman also competed in the 1M and 3M events.\n\nSturgill was previously named the Big Ten Diver of the Week after winning the 3M dive against Princeton in November. She currently holds a spot on Rutgers’ all-time top-10 list in the 1M, 3M, and platform dive.\n\nAt the 2025 Winter Junior Nationals, Emilana Gonzalez finished fifth in the 50-meter freestyle at the East Regionals on the campus of Indiana University. She posted a time of 22.40, which was the second-fastest time in Rutgers program history. Several other Rutgers signees competed at the US Junior Nationals, as the Scarlet Knights recently announced a talented eight-person class.\n\nStar running back Antwan Raymond picked up a major college football award, winning the Cornish Trophy as the most outstanding Canadian player in NCAA football. He was also named a semifinalist for the Doak Walker National Running Back Award. Safety Jett Elad was also named as one of the five finalists for the award.\n\nRutgers football previously earned key All-Big Ten honors as star wideout KJ Duff and Raymond were selected Second Team All-Big Ten by both coaches and media. In addition, OL Kwabena Asamoah, WR Ian Strong, and DB Bo Mascoe were selected as Big Ten Honorable Mentions by coaches and media.\n\nElad and placekicker Jai Patel were selected by conference coaches as Big Ten Honorable Mentions, while the media selected punter Jakob Anderson and linebacker Dariel Djabome for the same honors. Offensive lineman Gus Zilinskas was also given the Big Ten Sportsmanship Award.\n\nRutgers star defender Puck Winter was named a 2025 Second Team All-American by the NFHCA yesterday after recording 31 defensive saves as a four-year starter for the Scarlet Knights. She scored 17 career goals with four assists for 38 points, with five goals, three assists, and six defensive saves in 2025, ranking second in the Big Ten and fifth nationally. Winter was also previously named the National Defensive Player of the Week.\n\nEarlier this offseason, Puck Winter and captain Paulina Niklaus were also named First Team All-Mid-Atlantic Region, First Team All-Big Ten, and First Team All-ECAC. Olivia de Zwaan, Emily Nicholls, and Martha Goodridge won Freshman of the Week during the season, with Nicholls and Winter also earning Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week.\n\nGraduate student Emily Leese and senior Gabrielle Dildy were each named Big Ten Gymnasts to watch by the conference on Tuesday. Dildy made the list for the second straight year after a 2025 season in which she qualified as an individual on beam at the NCAA Regional Championships.\n\nHer score of 9.850 also helped Rutgers qualify for NCAA Regionals for the first time in 11 seasons. She earned several team awards, including Most Valuable Gymnast, and led the Scarlet Knights with a 9.850 on floor and 9.800 on vault at the conference meet last season. She has career highs of 9.900 on vault, beam, and floor.\n\nLeese is ready to make her return to competition after missing the 2025 season rehabbing from injury. She owns the program record in the vault with a 9.925, which Leese accomplished in both 2023 and 2024. She qualified for the 2023 NCAA Regionals on vault and boasts a 9.925 career high on floor and a 9.850 on beam. She is also a team captain for the second straight year and has a multitude of academic Big Ten honors to her name.\n\nRutgers will open their 2026 season with a tri-meet shortly after the New Year, hosting Temple and Brockport at Jersey Mike’s Arena on January 4th.\n\nRutgers also celebrated academic excellence this week with 141 student-athletes named to the 2025 Fall Academic All-Big Ten list, representing a wide range of programs, including football and other fall varsity sports.\n\nCassidy Kidd (women’s cross country), Graham Kois (men’s soccer), and Rachel Quigley (women’s soccer) were highlighted on the Big Ten’s list for their perfect 4.0 GPAs. 65 football players were named to the list, including Sean Cooper, Bryan Felter, Henry Hughes Jr., Tyler Needham, Michael O’Connor, and Gus Zilinskas, who earned the honor four times as Rutgers student-athletes.\n\nEach of the 141 student-athletes was on a fall varsity team, enrolled full-time at the institution for a minimum of 12 months, and received a cumulative term GPA of 3.0 or higher, showing the university’s commitment to balancing strong athletics and academics.\n\nTo support me and my work, please follow @arnavsarkar100 on X!",

When asked for his prediction, Paul kept it bold and simple: \"It’s going to be the biggest upset in sports history.\"\n\nPaul doubled down on his prediction, comparing his impending victory to the monumental Giants-Patriots Super Bowl upset of 2007 and dramatically calling the event \"the Boston Tea Party 2.0.\" As always, he was not afraid to say what was on his mind, providing some soundbite-worthy moments throughout the night.\n\nMeanwhile, the veteran Joshua— stepping back into the ring after a September 2024 loss to Daniel Dubois— remained composed, focusing on his professional approach.The tension was palpable when Joshua's viral quote, \"If I can kill him, I’ll kill him,\" was brought up; he had an icy calm response, stating simply, \"It’s my job.\"\n\nFinally, as the two faced off, it was exactly what fans came to expect: a smaller, confident Paul against a silent former heavyweight champion of the world. Soon enough, the two will decide it in the ring.\n\nThe Sporting News followed all the action from Wednesday night’s press conference. Check out the key quotes and action below.\n\nMORE: Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua tickets guide\n\n7:25 p.m.: Paul and Joshua are officially face-to-face.\n\nThe 6' 1\" Paul stares up at his opponent, who is much taller and weighs much more. \"The Problem Child\" speaks, while Joshua is cool and composed.\n\nJake Paul and Anthony Joshua facing off.

    "fullText": "SCOR, the interactive sports ecosystem, launched Fun.SCOR.io – a mobile and Web ecosystem.\n\nThe gaming firm has launched its much-awaited unified ecosystem across two chains for improved accessibility.\n\nThe native token SCOR is now live on OKX, Gate, and Bybit.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of blockchain gaming, SCOR is making some notable moves that could shake up the landscape for sports fans and crypto enthusiasts alike.\n\nThey’ve just rolled out Fun.SCOR.io, a new web and mobile platform that serves as a one-stop shop for their extensive ecosystem of sports-themed mini-games.\n\nThe on-chain sports giant debuts its central web and mobile platform, empowering its massive player base with true wallet freedom via a simultaneous deployment on two major blockchains. The native token, SCOR, is now available on Bybit, OKX, and Gate.\n\nWith over 2 million active users already on board, it’s building on existing integrations in messaging apps and now providing players with a dedicated space to participate in tournaments, collect athlete characters, and prepare for PvP battles in the future.\n\nThe new web and mobile platform enables fans to play a variety of minigames with a pro sports theme, collect on-chain professional athlete characters, compete in tournaments, and soon participate in skill-based PvP challenges.\n\nTom Mizzone, Founder/CEO of Sweet, the developer of the SCOR ecosystem, said;\n\n“With the launch of Fun.SCOR.io, we are effectively opening the stadium doors to the broader Web3 world. A platform this size requires robust infrastructure, that is why we are going multichain on day one. By deploying on both Base and Mantle, we are ensuring our 2 million users enjoy a seamless, low-cost experience with true asset portability, regardless of which wallet or network they prefer.”\n\nThe real game-changer here is SCOR’s move to go multichain from day one, rolling out simultaneously on Base and Mantle.\n\nBase, the Ethereum Layer 2 from Coinbase, offers extremely low fees and lightning-fast transactions, making it ideal for high-volume trading. Mantle, with its modular design, adds another layer of scalability and efficiency.\n\nThe Fun.SCOR.io ecosystem launch provides gamers with a plethora of options, including the ability to connect any self-custody wallet on either chain. Thanks to the SCOR-ID system, gamers’ progress and assets flow seamlessly across both chains.\n\nFun.SCOR.io is now live, serving as the central hub destination for the ecosystem’s skill-based sports gaming.\n\nUsers can connect via their preferred self-custody wallets on either Base or Mantle, enjoying the specific benefits of each network.\n\nSCOR’s multi-chain play feels like a practical evolution toward more open and user-friendly Web3 sports experiences.\n\nWith such a strong user base already engaged, it could push the whole sector away from single-chain limitations and toward something truly interconnected. Exciting times are ahead for sports fans who are dipping into blockchain.\n\nThe post SCOR Launches Fun.SCOR.io as 2M-User Sports Ecosystem Goes Multichain on Base and Mantle appeared first on ccn.com.",

Netflix has been readying a slate of shows for early 2026 as it looks to enter the space dominated by YouTube.\n\nNone of the podcasts prominently features Barstool's famous founder, Dave Portnoy, who hosts \"The Unnamed Show.\" The deal also doesn't include Barstool's popular \"Million Dollaz Worth of Game,\" which ranked 33rd in US audience reach in the third quarter, as measured by Edison.\n\nPortnoy said in a statement that he hoped the deal would drive new audiences for the shows. Netflix pointed to the shows' \"unfiltered commentary, sharp takes, and undeniable humor\" as a reason behind the deal.\n\nNetflix has made similar deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia. As with those deals, the video versions of the Barstool shows will be pulled off YouTube and run exclusively on Netflix. The audio versions will remain available elsewhere. The deal includes new episodes and certain library episodes of each show.\n\nNetflix's move into video podcasts is part of a broader effort to expand its content offerings beyond its core of TV series and movies. The streamer has added content from YouTubers like Mark Rober, event-focused sports fare, and games as it looks to boost engagement time. Netflix is also aiming to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studios business.\n\nThe Barstool deal brings the total number of shows involved in Netflix deals to at least 33. Netflix has told some Hollywood agents that it wants to have 50 to 75 titles ready to go early next year.",

All my brothers did sports. So I’ve been doing them since third grade.”\n\nShe’s played numerous sports throughout the years, but truly found her stride in cross country, even setting a school record her freshman year. But before her season even started this year, she tore her ACL, an injury that can put athletes on the bench for more than 9 months.\n\n“It’s been an emotional journey because running is my big thing,” Harris said. “I didn’t know if I’d be able to run this season with my team and keep our streaks alive and just be there for my team because that’s what I love doing.”\n\nThrough her recovery process, she said she found out she might be able to compete this season.\n\n“I got told by my doctors that if I put in the work at physical therapy this summer, that I would be able to get back to running before surgery,” Harris said.\n\nSo that’s what she did, working every week to get better and better to overcome this injury while pushing her team to grow together through a difficult season.\n\n“In a strange way, the injury has grown us all because as a coaching staff, we’ve been able to see our kids rally around one another, and other kids got stronger and maintained that going into the season,” Girls’ athletic coordinator JB Littlejohn said.\n\nDuring this recovery, Harris became an inspiration to her teammates and peers.\n\n“She was our athlete of the Year last year as a freshman,” Littlejohn said. “Her competitive nature, combined with her work ethic, you put that with the natural talent, that’s why we’re seeing what she’s doing.”\n\nThrough determination and hard work, Landry and her team made it all the way to the state cross country meet.\n\n“It was very like congratulating, and I felt like my efforts and everything that I went through paid off finally,” Harris said.\n\nYou can now stream KETK and FOX51 News live 24/7 on your smart TV with KETK+, our brand-new app!
