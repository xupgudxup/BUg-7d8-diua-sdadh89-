    "fullText": "FOX Sports is releasing a new one-hour documentary called “YOU SEE L.A.” that will highlight UCLA women’s basketball historic run to the Final Four last season. It was the Bruins’ first trip to the Final Four in the NCAA era, and the first time UCLA earned the No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament in program history.\n\nThe documentary will premiere on March 1, 2026, at 5:00 PM PST on FS1 after UCLA’s rivalry game against USC at the Galen Center. The premiere will also kickoff the month of March, which is Women’s History Month.\n\n“YOU SEE L.A. reflects the kind of storytelling that is core to FOX Sports, stories that capture the emotion, humanity and cultural impact of sports. This film is not only about a remarkable season on the court, but also about leadership, community, the power of women’s sports, and the resolve of a team representing something bigger than themselves. We’re proud to share a story that reflects the heart of this team and this city to audiences nationwide,” said FOX Sports Vice President Barry Nugent.\n\nThe documentary explores how UCLA’s history, including the teachings of legendary coach John Wooden, continues to inspire new generations. It will highlight all the different people who have contributed to building a glorious UCLA women’s basketball program.\n\n“This film shines a light on the strongest part of UCLA Women’s Basketball: our people,” UCLA coach Cori Close said. “YOU SEE L.A. celebrates the character, courage, and competitive fire that defined last season, and I couldn’t be more proud for the world to witness the humanity behind our success.”\n\nFOX Sports is collaborating with AV8 Productions, Allez! Sports and Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine to produce “YOU SEE L.A.”\n\nThe list of producers includes several well-known names from both the sports and entertainment world.\n\nSome of the executive producers are Jeff Luini, Kelsey Trainor, Harshal Dave, Alan Bloom, Chandler DeWitt, Ally Davis, Melissa Forman, Brad Zager, Barry Nugent, Sara Rea and Sue Kinkead.

    "description": "The LA Galaxy return to Dignity Health Sports Park on Wednesday to face Panamanian club Sporting San Miguelito in the second leg of the opening round of Concacaf Champions Cup.",
    "fullText": "After a frustrating draw with NYCFC that felt more like a loss Sunday, the LA Galaxy are back in action at Dignity Health Sports Park on Wednesday night. This time, for the second leg of their Concacaf Champions Cup opening round against Sporting San Miguelito.\n\nAfter the first leg, LA hold the advantage, last week's 1-1 draw in Panama means a win, or any scoreless draw, sends the Galaxy through to the round of 16, where Jamaican club Mt. Pleasant, the 2025 Caribbean Cup champion, awaits.\n\nIn Concacaf Champions Cup play, the away goals rule acts as the primary tiebreaker for two-legged knockout rounds (Round One through Semifinals). If the aggregate score is tied after two legs, the team with more away goals advances. If away goals are also equal, the tie goes directly to penalties.\n\nBut as head coach Greg Vanney made clear, the away goal conceded in the first leg makes this a precarious lead.\n\n“I think it's really up to them. It's a catch-22,” Vanney said of San Miguelito’s approach. “Ninety minutes is a long time, so I don't think you necessarily have to come out flying... It's really up to us to have the solution to whichever way they come.”\n\nFor a Galaxy side still trying to find its rhythm, that unpredictability is the central challenge. The team returned from Panama and looked sharp early against NYCFC, with new striker João Klauss scoring inside two minutes. But as Vanney noted, that sharpness faded.\n\nYour @LARiotSquad Player of the Match, João Klauss ⭐️ pic.twitter.com/2uKGPBkqbA\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 24, 2026\n\n“We haven't had two back-to-back training sessions in a row since somewhere in Coachella,” Vanney explained. “We're actually trying to evolve a little bit inside of these games and solve some different looks.”\n\nThe \"look\" in Panama was a disciplined, bunkered approach from San Miguelito that the Galaxy couldn't fully break down, surrendering a goal that gave the visitors a precious away tally.\n\nThe \"look\" against NYCFC was a high press that the Galaxy solved early, only to stall after going down to ten men following a lengthy VAR review. The result was another draw, leaving the Galaxy with more questions than answers.\n\nNext up: @TheChampions at home on wednesday ⏭️ pic.twitter.com/aUmWrPJrLN\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 23, 2026\n\n“We got off to a great start, and we just didn't deal with the ball well. I thought we defended really well for large stretches,” Vanney reflected on the NYCFC match. “We're evolving, and tomorrow is another opportunity to take a step.”\n\nThat step will require the Galaxy to dictate the tempo against a San Miguelito team that now has a clear objective: find a goal and hunker down defensively.\n\nVanney believes these dense, high-stakes fixtures are the perfect classroom for his squad.\n\n“What's beautiful about these moments is the team is facing different challenges,” he said. “Playing against a low block in Panama, your team has to change its mentality because they have to add speed into the game with the ball... These are great opportunities for our guys that are going to build a solid foundation.”\n\nThe Galaxy's midfield is slowly getting replenished, Vanney told reporters Isaiah Parente and Elijah Wynder are progressing and could be \"part of the group\" on Wednesday. He added Erik Thommy could make his debut Saturday against Charlotte and defender Chris Rindov was \"a little further behind\"\n\nKickoff is set for 8:30 p.m. from Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nLocation: Dignity Health Sports Park, Carson, Calif.\n\nRadio: LA Galaxy Youtube Channel.",

    "fullText": "Pitching remains the backbone of championship baseball, and every season brings a reshuffling of which clubs truly control the mound. In its latest evaluation of starting staffs entering the 2026 season, CBS Sports ranked Major League Baseball’s most formidable rotations based on talent, depth, health outlook, and overall upside. The result is a revealing snapshot of where pitching power is concentrated across the league — and where volatility still lurks beneath the surface.\n\nSome rotations earn their place through proven dominance, built around Cy Young–caliber aces and established postseason performers. Others rise because of emerging stars, improved depth, or high-ceiling arms that could dramatically outperform expectations. What makes this ranking especially compelling is how it blends stability with uncertainty. Several teams near the top have overwhelming talent but still carry durability concerns, while a few lower-ranked staffs could climb quickly if young pitchers take another step forward.\n\nThe list also reflects broader trends shaping modern roster construction. Organizations increasingly prioritize layered pitching depth rather than relying on just one superstar. Development pipelines, injury recovery timelines, and workload management strategies now influence rankings almost as much as raw performance. In many cases, a rotation’s long-term outlook matters just as much as its immediate projection.\n\nUltimately, these rankings don’t just measure pitching quality — they reveal which teams are best positioned to control games from the first inning onward. And in a sport where dominant starting pitching can redefine an entire season, that advantage can be decisive.\n\nNew York’s rotation is packed with recognizable names but loaded with uncertainty. Injuries, recovery timelines, and workload concerns make long-term reliability difficult to project. When everything aligns, the talent level is unquestionably elite. The challenge is keeping that version of the staff intact over a full season.\n\nToronto’s rotation has legitimate top-of-the-rotation firepower and strong supporting depth. Their upside is enormous when multiple starters are locked in at once. The issue has been sustaining peak performance over time. Consistency will determine whether they rise or remain stuck in the middle tier.\n\nPittsburgh’s staff is fueled by youth, electric stuff, and growing confidence. The ceiling is extremely high thanks to emerging frontline talent. Development remains the key variable, but the progress is undeniable. This is a rotation transitioning from promising to legitimately dangerous.\n\nCincinnati’s rotation reflects steady organizational growth. Young arms are beginning to translate raw ability into dependable production. Momentum is building across the entire group, not just individual pitchers. If that trend continues, they could climb quickly.\n\nPhiladelphia brings elite upside but also significant health and performance questions. Key contributors returning from injury or decline shape the staff’s overall outlook. At their best, they can rival almost any rotation in baseball. Their ranking hinges on how much of that ceiling actually appears.\n\nSeattle succeeds through structure, depth, and environment. Their rotation may not rely on one dominant ace, but the collective effectiveness is relentless. They consistently suppress scoring and carry heavy workloads. It’s a system that wins through sustained pressure rather than bursts.\n\nThe Rangers represent one of the most volatile but fascinating rotations in the league. Several starters possess ace-level talent, yet durability questions remain. If enough pitchers stay healthy and perform to expectations, they could surge dramatically. Few rotations have a wider range of possible outcomes.\n\nDetroit combines top-tier star power with meaningful reinforcements around its ace. Their rotation blends proven dominance with experienced support and veteran presence. When fully aligned, it’s one of the most intimidating staffs in baseball. Opponents face very few comfortable matchups.\n\nBoston’s rotation stands out for both quality and structural balance. They feature frontline excellence without sharp drop-offs deeper into the staff. Reliability and depth make them dangerous over long stretches. This is a rotation designed for sustained contention.\n\nThe Dodgers set the standard with overwhelming star power and elite depth. Multiple pitchers can perform at ace level, giving them unmatched flexibility. Even injuries rarely derail them thanks to organizational depth. This is a rotation built to dominate both the regular season and October.\n\nCBS Sports’ 2026 rotation rankings highlight just how decisive starting pitching remains in shaping the competitive landscape of Major League Baseball. From the Dodgers’ overwhelming dominance to the rising potential of younger staffs like Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, the list reflects a league defined by both established excellence and rapid evolution. Depth, durability, and development pipelines now matter as much as pure star power, and several teams sit just one breakout season away from reshaping the hierarchy. As the season unfolds, these rankings will inevitably shift — but they offer a clear starting point for understanding where pitching strength currently resides. In a game where control of the mound often determines everything else, these rotations represent the teams most equipped to dictate how 2026 baseball will be played.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post MLB latest power rankings by CBS Sports appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Happy Monday, everybody. Hope your week has gotten off to a great start.\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes had some notable happenings in the sports world since the last time I touched base, so let’s get right to them.\n\n1) Holy moly. What a night it was in Coral Gables last Tuesday night.\n\nI had my phone and tables set up side by side and was watching the dramatics unfold in both Canes baseball and Canes hoops at the same time.\n\nMiami baseball found themselves down 5-0 going into the eighth inning against UCF, and while it felt over, I figured I’d watched it this far and would stick with it. And boy, I’m glad I did. With two outs, Jake Ogden clubbed one out to left to get back inside slam range and make it 5-2 going to the ninth.\n\nMeanwhile, Miami kept seesawing back and forth with the Virginia Tech Hokies on the hardwood. The stubborn Hokies continued to hold a slim lead that Miami would quickly erase, only to see VT jump back again. It felt like a game that, in the stars, was supposed to go Tech’s way. At least those were the vibes.\n\nBut then, UCF’s pitcher got wiiiiiiiild and plunked three Canes in the bottom of the ninth. Michael Torres got a ball past the infield for a single to plate two and tie the game. Suddenly, it felt like it could be Miami’s night.\n\nMARK LIGHT MAGIC!!!! pic.twitter.com/93Htyjuf5S\n\n— Miami Hurricanes Baseball (@CanesBaseball) February 18, 2026\n\nNext door, up 67-66 with 3.6 seconds left, Tech drove the ball to the hoop. Except their man fell down and half-stumble/threw up a shot that missed. Tech missed the offensive rebound, and time expired on a crucial win at Watsco Center.\n\nThe Canes survive! They beat Virginia Tech 67-66 to improve to 21-5 overall! 10-3 in the ACC. Another late comeback win for Miami. pic.twitter.com/5wiXzHBzPR\n\n— Will Manso (@WillManso) February 18, 2026\n\nAmusingly enough, the baseball broadcast caught the fans making their way from the Wat over to Mark Light for the conclusion of the baseball game.\n\nAnd then Vance Sheehan sent everybody home in elated fashion with a two-run bomba off the scoreboard in left for a walk off 8-7 win in 13 innings.\n\nAdversity shaped him. Clutch defined him.\n\nNearly seven years removed from undergoing surgery for a brain tumor, Vance Sheahan (@SheahanVance) delivered a signature win for @CanesBaseball on Tuesday.\n\n🔗 https://t.co/ss5iB6WnBr pic.twitter.com/AToe04oV0U\n\n— D1Baseball (@d1baseball) February 19, 2026\n\nNights like this don’t come around often, and for those who got to go to one (or both), man, I am envious. A tremendous night for Miami athletics.\n\n2) Saturday night was, unfortunately, tough for the Hurricanes on the hardwood in Charlottesville .\n\nBut they gave the Wahoos everything they had and took that game right to the wire. Miami tied it up at 83 on a driving basket by Malike Renau with seven seconds left. Unfortunately, what happened in the Canes’ favor the Saturday before burned them against Virginia. With under four seconds left, Tre Donaldson fouled Jake Mallory on a three, and Mallory sank all three free throws for the winning margin.\n\nStill, that’s not a game you expect to win, although it would have been basically a tourney clincher if they’d gotten it.\n\nNext up is at FSU on Tuesday night. The Seminoles have been playing well lately, and Miami, well, almost never seems to beat them in basketball. This team needs to get this one in Tallahassee after coming up short in Coral Gables against them earlier in the year. A loss could push Miami back towards the bubble after working hard to get off it.\n\n3) Boy, how the Canes are crushing the baseball right now.\n\nI’ll just leave this here for you.\n\nCuvet's grand slam is Miami's 21st HR this season in their 9th game\n\nCanes hit their 21st HR in game 18 last year. They had 8 HR after their 9th game#GoCanes\n\n— Canes Research (@CanesResearch) February 22, 2026\n\nI was doing some stuff around the house yesterday, so I just caught bits and pieces, but holy Cannoli, did the Canes’ offense go nuclear. 30-5 over Lafayette.\n\nWe’ve seen Daniel Cuvet, Alex Sosa, Torres, Sheahan, and others come through at the plate this year so far, but boy, there’s one particular Cane to keep a close eye on as you go forward. Dylan Dubovik went nuclear against Lafayette, with five of his nine hits in 11 ABs going for extra bases. The local freshman from Coral Springs could be in the midst of an early career breakout.\n\nIs this good? @NCAABaseball @ACCBaseball pic.twitter.com/psA6fnlUGJ\n\n— Miami Hurricanes Baseball (@CanesBaseball) February 23, 2026\n\nWe’ll see how he and the rest of the 9-0 Canes do this weekend as the competition steps up — the Florida Gators come to town this weekend for a three-game series.",

    "fullText": "The Chargers will most likely address the interior part of the offensive line, especially the guard spots, with Bradley Bozeman and Mekhi Becton being potential cut candidates.\n\nShould they go the free agency route, Sports Illustrated's Connor Orr believes the Bolts will sign veteran Joel Bitonio, whom he tabbed in his bold predictions for all 32 teams in the NFL.\n\nJim Harbaugh is not going to put Justin Herbert at risk again like he was forced to last season. Bitonio can spearhead the offensive line’s transition to a Mike McDaniel system—Bitonio was drafted during McDaniel’s season as the Browns’ receivers coach—and could be a critical, dependable asset amid constant injury woes.\n\nBitonio is not getting any younger, set to be 35 this season and is considering retirement, but he is durable and is still moving as if he were ten years younger.\n\nA stalwart presence along the Browns' offensive line for the past decade, Bitonio finished the 2025 season ranked as PFF's 8th-best pass-blocking guard. He has also ranked in the 91st percentile in PFF run-blocking grade over the past three seasons.\n\nOffensive coordinator Mike McDaniel was on the Browns' staff as the wide receiver coach in 2014, Bitonio's first season in Cleveland, so the familiarity is there. Plus, Bitonio is a great fit in McDaniel's zone scheme.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: NFL analyst's 'bold prediction' sees Chargers bolstering guard spot",

Under the guidance of head coach Daren Sammy, the Caribbean side have spoken about creating their own slice of history, but consistency will be crucial as the competition intensifies.\n\nThe West Indies enter the match on the back of four consecutive wins, putting behind a disappointing run in bilateral series before the tournament. Shai Hope and Shimron Hetmyer have led the batting charge, while Jason Holder and Roston Chase have provided balance with their all-round skills. Romario Shepherd has also impressed with both bat and ball, particularly on Indian surfaces where he has IPL experience.\n\nZimbabwe, on the other hand, have been one of the biggest revelations of the tournament. The Sikandar Raza-led side have pulled off memorable victories over former world champions Australia and Sri Lanka, earning respect and recognition on the global stage. Young batter Brian Bennett has been their standout performer with the bat, while Blessing Muzarabani and Brad Evans have been among the leading wicket-takers in the competition.\n\nWith short boundaries and a batting-friendly pitch expected at the Wankhede Stadium, West Indies are likely to target a big-hitting approach, but Zimbabwe’s confidence and resilience suggest they are capable of pushing their opponents to the limit.\n\nWest Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match: Live streaming details\n\nWhen will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe West Indies vs Zimbabwe Super 8 match will be played on Monday, February 23, 2026.\n\nWhere will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe match will take place at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India.\n\nWhat time will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match start?\n\nThe match is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss at 6:30 PM IST.\n\nWhich TV channels will broadcast the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nThe game will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network in India.\n\nHow to watch live streaming of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nFans can watch the live stream on the Jio Hotstar app and website.\n\nWhere can we follow the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match online?\n\nLive ball-by-ball updates and coverage will be available on TimesofIndia.com.",

    "description": "The Sporting Tribune's Arash Markazi reflects on his 25-year friendship with Jim Hill as the broadcasting legend celebrates 50 years of covering sports in Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES – Jim Hill wouldn’t want me to write this column, but this is one of the few times I must ignore the advice of a man I have looked up to for as long as I can remember watching sports in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, the Los Angeles Lakers unveiled a statue of Pat Riley, the head coach of the Showtime Lakers, in a ceremony attended by Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Byron Scott, Michael Douglas and Michael McDonald, among others. Lionel Richie even took his courtside seat before the Lakers played the Boston Celtics, as John Tesh’s “Roundball Rock” blared through the arena. If the party had leaned any further into the 1980s, it might have been drenched in neon and simulcast on MTV.\n\nThe ceremony took me back to my childhood, watching Jim cover the Showtime Lakers for KCBS 2 and KABC 7. This month, Jim is celebrating his 50th year covering sports in Los Angeles. Next month, I’ll turn 46. Nearly every memory I have of sports in this city — from the Lakers’ 11 NBA championships to the Dodgers’ ifve World Series titles since 1980 — is connected to Jim talking to players in the locker room after the game.\n\nThe only thing more surreal than covering the teams I grew up watching today is doing it alongside Jim and calling him a friend.\n\nI always dreamed of becoming a sportswriter in Los Angeles. At USC, I won the Allan Malamud Memorial Scholarship and the Jim Murray Memorial Scholarship, named after my two favorite Los Angeles Times columnists. Both Malamud and Murray died while I was a student at Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. I never had the chance to meet them let alone cover a game alongside them.\n\nTelevision never felt attainable to me. I grew up with a stutter so severe that I would invent excuses to skip class on days when I had to present a book report. On the first day of school, when students were asked to stand and say their name, I would sometimes pretend I needed to go to the nurse’s office.\n\nI’ll never forget the first time I saw Jim as a member of the media before a 2001 Lakers-Clippers game at Staples Center. I was a USC student freelancing for SLAM magazine. We were seated next to each other. He slapped me on the knee like we were old friends and introduced himself, as if I didn’t already know exactly who he was.\n\nWe stayed in touch as my career evolved as I became a staff writer at Sports Illustrated, senior writer at ESPN and a columnist at the Los Angeles Times. At every step, Jim would put me on the air, making me more comfortable with a microphone and a camera representing thousands of households. The kid who once struggled to say his own name was suddenly talking sports with Jim Hill on CBS in Los Angeles.\n\nAs someone who grew up in Los Angeles watching Jim Hill, it was pretty cool co-anchoring Sports Central on CBS after the Lakers-Celtics game on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/jqTe5ze7p8\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) February 25, 2020\n\nWhen I became an adjunct professor at USC, Jim was a regular guest speaker. I wanted my students to hear the same advice he once gave me: It’s all about relationships and hard work — and how inseparable the two are.\n\nThe contact list on Jim’s iPhone reads like a Hall of Fame program — legendary players and coaches, Academy Award-winning actors and directors, even a former United States president. But the relationships he nurtures daily are with beat writers and public relations directors across the city. While many anchors prefer the comforts of the studio, Jim has always preferred being in the thick of the action — at every game, every press conference, often seated in the front row, asking the first question.\n\nOne of the greatest honors of my career came during the 2020 World Series, when I was asked to fill in for Jim as the Dodgers faced the Tampa Bay Rays in Arlington, Texas. As thrilling as it was to watch the Dodgers win their first title since 1988, the celebration felt muted 1,500 miles from home during a global pandemic.\n\nWe made up for it in 2024 when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees to win the World Series less than a month after my wedding. After finishing our postgame interviews in the clubhouse, Jim poured a bottle of champagne over my head while on the air and wrapped me in a hug.\n\nHighlight of the night? Jim Hill pouring a bottle of champagne on me while on air. 😂🍾 pic.twitter.com/Q9Gl7oq4YO\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) October 31, 2024\n\nSunday was a celebration of Pat Riley and the Showtime Lakers. But as I watched Jim work the room after the ceremony as the only member of the media who covered every championship that team won it felt like something more.\n\nIt felt like a celebration of 50 years of Jim Hill telling the story of Los Angeles sports — and, in so many ways, shaping the dreams of a kid who grew up watching him do it.",

    "fullText": "EDITOR’S NOTE — The victory by the U.S. men’s hockey team over the heavily favored Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics is widely regarded as one of the greatest upsets in sports history. With the American men winning Olympic hockey gold for the first time since — 46 years to the day — The Associated Press is republishing two stories from that night as printed Feb. 23, 1980, in the Pottsville (Pa.) Republican:\n\nLAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) — Driven by their own emotion and the cheers of a frenzied, star-spangled crowd, the United States hockey team has delivered what may well be the most stunning upset in Olympic history and stands on the verge of a medal at the 1980 Winter Games.\n\nCall it Team Excitement. This ambitious, energetic squad of college kids ignored adversity and bounced from behind on third period goals by Mark Johnson and Mike Eruzione to score a stunning 4-3 upset victory over the defending champion Soviet Union Friday night.\n\nWith roars of “USA! USA! USA!” ringing in their ears, America’s comeback kids rode the red-hot, 36-save goaltending of Jim Craig to a sensational victory that set off a wild celebration, first on the ice and then all over this Olympic town.\n\nJust as the hockey game ended, fireworks exploded over Mirror Lake – part of the traditional awards ceremony saluting Friday’s medal winners, including American slalom racer Phil Mahre. But the coincidence was just too good for the flag-decked crowd that spilled happily into the narrow streets of this tiny village after the American hockey victory.\n\n“In all due respect to that team and to the (American) silver medal team in 1972, this has to be the biggest win in our Olympic history,” said Coach Herb Brooks.\n\nWhen the United States swept to the Olympic gold in 1960, the Soviet Union was not yet the hockey powerhouse it is today. The Russian team America beat 20 years ago was still refining its game. The one America beat Friday night is acknowledged by most hockey people to be the finest unit in the world – and that includes professionals, who these Soviets have often handled with ease.\n\nBrooks knew all that when he delivered his pre-game speech to his team. It was simple and to the point. This is what he told newsmen: “You are born to be a player. You are meant to be here. This moment is yours. You’re meant to be here at this time. Let’s have poise and possession with the puck.”\n\nAnd then he sent Team Excitement on the ice.\n\nThree times the young Americans fell behind by a goal and each time they came back, first on a goal by Buzz Schneider and then one by Mark Johnson.\n\nJohnson’s goal came with a single slim second left on the clock in the first period. But the Soviets regained the lead again in the second period and limited the Americans to two shots on goal in those 20 minutes. Again, they seemed in control.\n\nThen, midway through the final period, Johnson and captain Mike Eruzione scored goals just 81 seconds apart, putting the United States in front.\n\nStill, there were 10 minutes to play and that can be an eternity. It seemed like one for the Americans, who turned back every Soviet thrust and then exploded in joyful excitement at the final buzzer. They tackled each other and rolled happily on the ice like so many excited kids, while the Soviets stood and waited for the traditional handshaking ceremony.\n\nThe loss was the first in Olympic competition for the Soviets since 1968 and left the Americans needing only a victory over Finland Sunday to clinch the gold. But the Russians still have a shot at the gold. To win it, they would have to beat Sweden Sunday and hope that Finland defeats the United States.\n\nSweden tied Finland 3-3 in Friday night’s other medal round game. That left the United States with three points, the Soviets and Swedes with two and Finland with one in the mini-tournament to determine the medals.\n\nLAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) — For a change, it was the Soviet hockey players who looked on in envy. Downcast, they leaned on their sticks, awaiting the ceremonial handshake that concludes every international contest.\n\nUsually, it is they who act the gracious winner’s role. But this time, this one Friday at the Winter Olympics, it was the Americans’ turn; their 4-3 victory had made the conquerors the conquered.\n\nHockey gold medal hopes are alive and well in Lake Placid. The Americans are one victory over Finland away from making their gold medal dream a reality.\n\n“I’m going to bite myself to make sure it’s true,” said right wing John Harrington.\n\nOh, it’s true all right – just as true as the dramatic pre-game pep talk by Coach Herb Brooks; as true as the winning burst of third-period goals by Mark Johnson and Mike Eruzione in a 1:21 span ... just as true as the phone call from President Jimmy Carter to the clamorous American dressing room.\n\n“He said we had made the American people very proud; that we reflected the ideas of the country and what we stand for,” said Brooks, who – along with the entire American Olympic delegation – has been invited to the White House Monday.\n\nThe invitation stands no matter what happens Sunday, and any number of things might. The Americans, this dramatic victory theirs forever, could still finish out of the medals chase if badly beaten by Finland. They could win a bronze, or a silver, or a gold.\n\nThis is how it stands: After Friday’s two medals round games (Sweden and Finland tied 3-3 in the other), the Americans have three points, the Soviets and Swedes two, and Finland one. If Sweden ties the Soviet Union Sunday and Finland beats the Americans, all would have three points. If Finland’s victory is a big one, the infamous “goal differential” (goals given up subtracted from goals scored) would break the tie and leave the U.S. with nothing to show for its smashing, upset triumph Friday.\n\nIf virtually anything else happens other than a lopsided U.S. loss, the Americans will win a medal.\n\n“But we’ll worry about that tomorrow,” said Mark Johnson after the Americans had knocked goalie Vladislav Tretiak out of the game, rallied from three one-goal deficits, and stunned the Soviet team that has won the last four Olympic golds and was heavily favored to repeat.\n\nIf the Soviets went ahead, the Americans rallied. Finally, on a power play at 8:39 of the third period, a Dave Silk pass bounced off the skate of defenseman Sergei Starikov and bounded right to Johnson. A five-foot shot was all it took for a 3-3 tie, and Eruzione netted a 25-footer at the 10-minute mark to settle the issue.\n\nFor the fifth time in the six games they have played her, the Americans gave up the first goal. Vladimir Krutov tipped an Aleksei Kasatonov shot past goalie Jim Craig at 9:12 of the opening period.\n\nBuzzy Schneider brought the United States back at 14:03, powering a 55-foot shot over Tretiak’s left shoulder and marking the beginning of the end for the internationally acclaimed net-minder. Tretiak’s vulnerability is long shots, and his muff of another one helped the Americans tie it with one second left in the period.\n\nSergei Makarov had fought away from a Johnson check to flip a 15-foot shot past Craig at 17:34, but – with the clock winding down and the crowd of 8,500 screaming “U-S-A, USA,” the U-S-A stormed back. Dave Christian took a 100-foot shot on Tretiak, who kicked it directly in front of Johnson.\n\nA few fakes later, the game was tied 2-2 and Tretiak was gone. Vladimir Myshkin, who beat the National Hockey League all-stars 6-0 to win the Challenge Cup for the Soviets last February, took over.\n\nHe fared no better, and the Soviets suffered their first loss in an Olympic hockey game since 1968, when the Czechs beat them 5-4 at Grenoble, France.\n\nPeople charged into the streets when it was over, waving the flags they had brought to the game, hollering the chant that is their trademark and going every bit as crazy as the players did themselves.\n\n“We went nuts,” said (Rob) McClanahan. “ What do you do when you win a game like this? You whoop it up. You hug each other. You shake hands.”\n\nAP Corporate Archives contributed to this report.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

Dishes in the sink still to do.\n\nAnd yet, as you watch athletes hurl themselves down a snow-covered mountain in the pursuit of glory at the Winter Olympics, you're thinking: \"pfft, I could do that\".\n\nWell, why not see if you really could?\n\nFor almost two decades UK Sport has held in-person talent ID sessions for aspiring athletes, designed to test their physical performance and match them up with the sport that would suit them best.\n\nIt is exactly how skeleton gold medallists Matt Weston and Tabitha Stoecker discovered they were well suited to sliding head first down an ice slope at 80mph.\n\nBut here's the thing - anybody can apply online to attend a session.\n\nSo how does it work, and could you really be Great Britain's next Olympic or Paralympic star?\n\nUK Sport's Talent ID days are designed to take those with natural athleticism and sporting talent, figure out where their major strengths are, and match them up with a sport they may never have tried or even heard of before.\n\nThe analysis at a Talent ID day includes a series of tests measuring power, stamina, speed, and agility.\n\nAnybody aged 17 or over can apply online, and athletes who drop out of one sport in the early stages of their career are often invited along to see if something else may work for them.\n\nExaminers also assess each athlete's character, scoring their ability to regulate emotions, control their performance and under pressure, and understand and respond to feedback.\n\nThough applications are open to anybody, eventual selection for a sport still requires a high level of natural ability.\n\n\"Talent ID is an opportunity for us to find athletes a little bit later in the journey than you might normally join a programme,\" says Dr Kate Baker, director of performance and people at UK Sport.\n\n\"If you're not super fast, or able to build fast twitch muscle quickly, you're probably not going to make it in skeleton.\n\n\"Then we've got sports like cross-country skiing, which require extraordinary aerobic capability. So if you are someone who loves a long run and can go forever, then it's those kind of sports that you're probably going to want to look towards.\"\n\nThe approach has yielded plenty of medal success for Great Britain since its launch, and has been especially beneficial for winter sports, which athletes may never have had an opportunity to try out before attending Talent ID.\n\nWeston switched to skeleton nine years ago, having previously competed in elite junior categories in taekwondo, while Stoecker has trained as a circus performer.\n\nIn the 48 hours after Weston and Stoecker won gold, the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association had 4,000 applicants to their Talent ID campaign.\n\n\"I did flying trapeze, acrobatics, and I absolutely loved the performance element of it all,\" Stoecker says.\n\n\"Then I saw an advert on Instagram for the Talent ID process and was selected for skeleton - I guess the rest is history!\"\n\nTalent ID is also used to recruit athletes with disabilities aiming to compete at the Paralympics.\n\nParalympians who came through the pathway include Emma Wiggs, who was working as a teacher when she was matched with sitting volleyball at a Talent ID day in 2010, before leading the women's team to an eighth-place finish at the 2012 Games in London.\n\nWiggs eventually switched to para-canoeing after trying out more sports, winning gold in the KL2 at the 2016 and 2020 Games.\n\n\"When people apply to our main database, we gather information about their disability and invite them to events they are eligible for,\" says Ben Quilter, who competed in judo for ParalympicsGB and is now part of UK Sport's recruitment team.\n\n\"We group together sports with similar physiology, skill aspects or age requirements, and then put events on where people can come along and try a few different sports at the same time.\n\n\"We look at the impairment type, because the difference with Paralympic sport is you can acquire an impairment at various stages of life.\"\n\nBut Talent ID sessions do not necessarily work for all sports, some of which require a natural technical aptitude learned at a young age.\n\n\"We're not sure yet whether it will work for curling [for example],\" says Baker.\n\n\"When you look at skill-based sports - technical or tactical sports - generally people have been doing those for a bit longer.\n\n\"Most of those men and women that you're seeing out on the rinks have been doing it since they were tiny, and it's really in their bones.\"\n\nBut that does not mean that people cannot succeed in something they had never considered before.\n\nBefore 2008, rower Helen Glover had no experience in a boat, but had competed in hockey, tennis and swimming.\n\nGlover went on to become on to become a two-time Olympic, three-time world, and five-time European champion.\n\n\"I hope my story can be an inspiration for kids in PE or at home thinking about taking up a new sport,\" Glover previously told the BBC.\n\n\"Just go on, go for it - you don't know what's going to happen.\"",

    "fullText": "Creators say they’re offering Africans a ‘hopeful, utopian feeling’ of retrieving objects looted by colonial armies\n\nA new South African video game lets players take back African artefacts held in western museums in a series of heists, amid a growing campaign to repatriate treasures looted by colonial armies.\n\nPlayers of Relooted become South African sports scientist and parkour expert Nomali, as she leaps and dives through museums to retrieve 70 real objects. They include an Asante gold mask that was taken by the British army when it destroyed the Asante empire’s capital, Kumasi, and is now in the Wallace Collection in London. Another object is the skull of the Tanzanian king Mangi Meli, which was taken to Germany after its colonial regime executed him in 1900.\n\nHundreds of thousands of culturally and spiritually significant items were looted from Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries, when European countries carved up the continent into colonies. A 2018 report commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, estimated that more than 90% of Africa’s material cultural heritage was held outside the continent.\n\nBerlin’s Ethnologisches Museum and Cambridge University are among the institutions to have returned Benin bronzes to Nigeria, for example. Others, including the British Museum, have resisted calls to return bronzes and other looted objects.\n\nBen Myres, chief executive of Nyamakop, which developed Relooted, said: “Real-life repatriation is enormously complicated and it’s been ongoing for decades, in some cases even a century or more … We’re giving people this hopeful, utopian feeling … of what it’s going to feel like when all these artefacts finally come home.”\n\nMyres started creating the game in 2018 after his mother returned from the British Museum outraged at seeing the Nereid Monument, a Lycian tomb from Turkey. The museum says it was brought to the UK “with the full permission of the Ottoman Turkish authorities”.\n\n“She was shocked by the audacity of stealing a building … and she very flippantly said you should make a game about taking this back to where it belongs,” he said.\n\nThe game was created by a team from more than 10 African countries, while voice actors were hired from the countries of the characters that make up Nomali’s heist crew.\n\nMohale Mashigo, the game’s narrative director, said: “If we were going to go as far as researching real artefacts, getting a pronunciation guide for the artefacts, creating these characters from Cameroon, DRC, Malawi and [more], I wanted to make sure it sounded like different voices from different places.”\n\nMashigo created an “Africanfuturist” vision of the continent at the end of the 21st century, with cities and countries that “work for people”, rather than the more fantastical genre of Afrofuturism.\n\nIn contrast, Europe and the United States were intentionally made generic, as “The Old World” and “The Shiny Place” respectively. “We wanted to parody the way the west represents Africa,” Myres said.\n\nThe museums are also not real, apart from the Museum of Black Civilisations in Dakar, where players return the looted objects to an symbolically empty hall before they make their final journey to their home country.\n\nFor the game producer, Sithe Ncube, it was important that the Kabwe Skull, a 300,000-year-old fossil discovered in her country, Zambia, was included. The skull, also known as Broken Hill Man, is in London’s Natural History Museum.\n\nShe said: “Even before I started working at Nyamakop … I just felt like … someone should get it back and it would be cool for someone to do this in some form of media, in a game.”\n\nCreating Relooted was an eye-opening experience, Ncube said. “Learning about the scale of artefact looting in Africa, up to now I still can’t wrap my head around the numbers. It seems quite ridiculous and probably underestimated as well.”",

    "description": "Peacock has approached specialty streamers about selling subscriptions to complement its reality TV and sports-heavy programming.",
    "fullText": "Peacock's next growth bet isn't a blockbuster show or sports deal.\n\nNBCU's flagship streaming service is plotting to sell add-on subscriptions to other specialty streamers on its platform, four people familiar with the plans told Business Insider.\n\nPeacock has approached streamers about selling subscriptions to offer viewers content that complements its reality and sports-heavy line-up, these people said. Peacock expects to start with one streamer this year and is likely to limit the offering to a small number of partners.\n\nStarz, which already has multiple distribution partnerships, is one that's being considered, two insiders said. Starz declined to comment.\n\nTwo people briefed on Peacock's pitch saw it as a way for smaller streamers to reach new subscribers in a relatively uncluttered environment, and they hoped Peacock would eventually offer features such as the ability for streamers to offer free samples of their shows.\n\nThey described Peacock's terms as favorable compared to Amazon, which has a large business selling subscriptions to programmers big and small, from HBO Max to Crunchyroll. Amazon's channel terms vary by partner, but two partners told Business Insider in 2025 that Amazon's subscription revenue cut was over 50% in their deals.\n\nPeacock's plans come at a time when streaming services — especially outside market leaders Netflix and Disney — face pressure to consolidate as they look to continue growing their subscriber bases while remaining profitable. Overall, paid streaming growth in the US has cooled, while cancellation rates have risen in the wake of price hikes.\n\nTV viewership growth for streamers in the US is largely stagnant, and subscribers are navigating an increasingly complex landscape. Streaming services are trying tactics like discounts and bundling to keep people from leaving their platforms.\n\nSome other streaming platforms have adopted a marketplace approach that's broader than what Peacock is contemplating. Amazon is by far the leader. Last year, Amazon reported that its \"Channels\" program accounted for about 25% of US streamer sign-ups, citing Antenna data. Roku, YouTube, and device makers like Samsung and LG also let people \n\nPeacock, for its part, already sells add-on subscriptions to NBC Sports Regional Sports Networks, which it shares a corporate parent with. It also sells a bundle with Apple TV+ that involves cross-platform sampling and a discounted price.\n\nPeacock, with less than 2% of TV watch time in the US, has struggled to grow its share of the TV pie, according to Nielsen. That makes it the second-smallest of the subscription streamers Nielsen measures, ahead only of Warner Bros. Discovery (1.4%), which includes Discovery+ and HBO Max.\n\nUS-only Peacock also has relatively few subscribers, with about 44 million. Its nearest rival, Paramount+, has around 79 million global subscribers, and both are well behind Netflix, which is No. 1 with more than 325 million subscribers.\n\nStill, Peacock has far more subscribers than many specialty streamers. AMC Networks, for example, reported about 10 million subscribers across its portfolio of streamers, including AMC+, Acorn TV, and Shudder, as of the end of 2025.\n\n\"Peacock has been struggling,\" said Alan Wolk, a media industry analyst. \"There haven't been a whole lot of reasons to watch it, so giving people another reason to subscribe is a smart idea. If you ask consumers what's your biggest frustration with streamers, it's always, 'I can't find anything.' So the more you can put things together under one interface, the happier people will be.\"\n\nA global survey by Nielsen in November found more than 46% say it's harder to find the content they want to watch because there are too many streamers, rising to 51% in the US, with people spending 14 minutes searching for what to watch and 49% likely to cancel because they can't find something.\n\nThe survey also showed 66% of people expressed interest in a guide to present content information across all services.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "description": "Here are some of the most unusual Winter Olympic sports in history, from ski ballet and military patrol to dog sled racing and skijoring.",
    "fullText": "The Milan Cortina Winter Olympics are well underway, and it might be the most that most people will hear about curling or bobsled, at least for the next four years.\n\nFor many viewers, the 2026 Olympic Games have showcased just how peculiar some winter sports can be, from the flight of ski jumping to the rigor of ski mountaineering, a new event this year.\n\nAs unfamiliar as the current lineup of winter Olympic sports might be for some, Olympic Games history reveals even more unusual showcases, like skiers riding behind horses or performing their ballet moves on the snow.\n\nPrior to the 1992 Games, the events featured what were known as \"demonstration events\" where athletes showed off their abilities in a discipline without being awarded official Olympic medals — often to celebrate regionally popular sports in the host country or to test the appeal of more experimental disciplines.\n\nThese eight sports were among the most unusual demonstrations ever held at the Winter Olympics, with some serving as official medal events while others remained only as demonstration sports.\n\nYears: 1924 as an official medal event; 1928, 1936, and 1948 as a demonstration sport.\n\nMilitary patrol combined cross-country skiing with rifle shooting in a team event modeled after alpine military exercises.\n\nFour-man units, typically active-duty soldiers from each country, skied long distances over mountainous terrain, stopping periodically for rifle shooting tests that could add time penalties.\n\nAs the Games moved toward standardized international competition, military patrol was gradually refined into the modern biathlon sport, which debuted as an official Olympic sport in 1960.\n\nYears: 1948, as an official medal event\n\nIntroduced at the 1948 St. Moritz Games, the winter pentathlon combined five disciplines: cross-country skiing, downhill skiing, shooting, fencing, and horse riding.\n\nThe format mirrored the modern pentathlon's test of versatility, and asked athletes to demonstrate endurance, speed, precision, and tactical skill across snow and ice.\n\nThe event attracted limited international participation and was never held again.\n\nYears: 1988 and 1992 as a demonstration sport\n\nSki ballet, later known as acroski, featured choreographed routines performed on gentle slopes to music, blending spins, jumps, and intricate footwork.\n\nJudges scored athletes on technical precision and artistic expression, much as in figure skating.\n\nWhile moguls and aerials — which were other disciplines within the broader freestyle skiing category — evolved into medal sports, ski ballet was dropped after 1992.\n\nYears: 1992 as a demonstration sport\n\nSpeed skiing was a pure test of velocity on snow showcased at the 1992 Albertville Games, with athletes descending a steep, straight course in a tight aerodynamic tuck while reaching speeds of up to 130 mph.\n\nConcerns about safety, along with its narrow competitive format compared with other alpine disciplines, kept it from becoming a permanent Olympic event.\n\nYears: 1928 as a demonstration sport\n\nUnlike modern versions that use harnessed riders, the Olympic exhibition of skijoring at the 1928 St. Moritz Games involved a mounted jockey guiding galloping horses across a frozen lake while a skier held on behind.\n\nThe spectacle, which reflected Alpine winter traditions, drew large crowds, but the sport was seen as more of a novelty exhibition than a standardized international competition and was never added to the official program.\n\nYears: 1932 as a demonstration sport\n\nDog sled racing debuted as a demonstration event at the 1932 Lake Placid Games. The event showcased teams of sled dogs pulling mushers over snowy endurance courses.\n\nIts inclusion highlighted winter culture in the host region, but limited international participation at the time kept it from gaining full Olympic status.\n\nYears: 1952 as a demonstration sport\n\nBandy is a hockey-like team sport played on a large ice field roughly the size of a soccer pitch. Players use curved sticks to move a ball rather than a puck.\n\nOriginating in northern Europe, it predates modern ice hockey and emphasizes passing and field positioning.\n\nThe sport was showcased at the 1952 Oslo Games, although its strong regional concentration, particularly in Scandinavia and parts of the Soviet Union, limited its expansion into a full Olympic event.\n\nYears: 1936 and 1964 as a demonstration sport\n\nIce stock sport, often compared to curling, involves sliding heavy stocks across ice toward a target with the aim of precision placement.\n\nThe sport is popular in Alpine countries such as Austria and Germany, and it was featured twice at the Olympics as a demonstration event.\n\nIts close resemblance to curling and concentrated geographic relevance prevented it from being added permanently to the Olympic lineup.",

The club has not revealed the value of the donation but the BBC understands it is about £80,000.\n\nAs the club's official charity, it uses sport to support young people and runs a number of activities and programmes across Norfolk.\n\nKenny McLean, club captain, said: \"Hopefully, this gesture and donation shows our appreciation for everything that they do, and allows them to continue their amazing work within our community.\"\n\nFamilies praise football hub food poverty scheme\n\nFootball fans asked to bring food tins to kick-off\n\nFootball shop says thefts left them 'unsettled'\n\nIn the build-up to Saturday's match at home to Birmingham City, a number of initiatives and activities have taken place to highlight the work of the CSF and raise additional funds.\n\nAlongside players, head coach Philippe Clement and sporting director Ben Knapper also donated a day's salary.\n\nIan Thornton, chief executive officer of the CSF, said: \"This donation means a great deal to us. When a team comes together like this it sends a powerful message — that they believe in the work we're doing and want to stand with the people we support.\n\n\"Their generosity will help us reach more individuals across Norfolk, offering life-changing opportunities to those who need them most.\"\n\nHe said Saturday's match would be a chance to celebrate the foundation and values of the football club.\n\n\"All the fundraising everyone does for us, whether it's a challenge event or Run Norwich, goes to people needing support,\" he added.\n\n\"It allows us to fund activities. A lot of activities are not funded or not affordable because there's so much need and people enjoy our activities this allows us to sustain a lot of our programmes and ultimately as a football club take a responsibility in helping the community.\"\n\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "description": "Jammu and Kashmir cricket team has reached their maiden Ranji Trophy final, marking a significant achievement for the region. Celebrated by political leaders, the team's success highlights their determination despite a lack of adequate sports facilities. This historic victory is being hailed as a renaissance for J&K cricket.",
    "fullText": "Calling it a renaissance of J&K cricket, chief minister Omar Abdullah, the J&K assembly and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha congratulated the team, which completed a semifinal win over Bengal in Kalyani. Sports minister Satish Sharma said the players deserve “greater applause” as they achieved the feat despite lack of cricket facilities in the state.\n\nGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. \n\nThe LG called it a remarkable victory. “Congratulations to the J&K cricket team on their magnificent victory in the Ranji Trophy semifinal. You have etched a new golden chapter in the sporting history of J&K,” he wrote on X. \n\nIn the Jammu and Kashmir assembly, Congress legislator Nizamuddin Bhat informed the house about the feat and the speaker and the members congratulated the team amid applause.\n\nChief minister Abdullah said that “this landmark achievement” reflects the team’s determination, discipline and rising sporting culture in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nOmar praised team captain Paras Dogra for becoming the second player in the Indian domestic circuit to score 10,000 plus runs in the Ranji Trophy and Auqib Nabi for his nine-wicket haul in the semi-final, taking his season’s tally to 55 from 16 innings.\n\n“With grit, courage, and unbreakable belief,” she said, players have written a golden chapter in J&K’s sporting journey,” said former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti.\n\nThe state sports minister pointed out that the landmark was achieved despite the lack of infrastructure and adequate sports facilities in the Union Territory. “I wish we win the final,” he said, while conceding that basic facilities for cricketers are still lacking in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nHe said the government would work to streamline the system and ensure better support for sportspersons. “Our priority will be to keep politics and politicians away from sports,” Sharma told TOI.\n\nNuzhat Gul, secretary J&K sports council called it “a moment of immense pride.” Ruling National Conference spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar called it “a red-letter day for Jammu and Kashmir cricket and for Jammu and Kashmir as a whole”.",

    "description": "After winning both their games this past week, where does Iowa women's basketball rank in the latest USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll?",
    "fullText": "After Iowa women's basketball's (20-5, 11-3 Big Ten) two victories over Washington (65-56) and Nebraska (80-67) this past week, the Hawkeyes have held onto their previous ranking in the latest USA TODAY Sports Women's College Basketball Coaches Poll.\n\nIn the Hawkeyes' win over the Huskies, sophomore guard Chit-Chat Wright carried the offense behind her 21 points on 6-for-13 shooting, 5-for-8 from 3-point territory, and 4-for-5 from the free-throw line in her 38 minutes of action. Senior forward Hannah Stuelke also notched her seventh double-double of the season and the 18th of her career with 14 points and 16 rebounds.\n\nAgainst the Cornhuskers, sophomore center Avav Heiden dominated en route to a career-high-tying 27 points on 12-for-15 from the floor and 3-for-3 from the charity stripe, along with to go along with her 11 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 blocks, and 1 steal. As a result, this was the 6-foot-4 Sherwood, Ore., native's sixth double-double of the season. Sophomore guard Taylor Stremlow also added a career-high 17 points on top of Heiden's sensational effort.\n\nDespite the wins this past week, Iowa remains at the No. 12 spot in this week's Coaches Poll.\n\nIn addition to Iowa, six other Big Ten squads are within the updated Top 25. NO. 2 UCLA leads the group, followed by No. 5 Michigan, No. 10 Ohio State, No. 15 Maryland, No. 16 Michigan State, and No. 23 Minnesota.\n\nNebraska is the lone conference representative in the receiving votes category, earning just 1 vote.\n\nIowa will have two matchups this week to improve its standing in the next Coaches Poll, as the Hawkeyes travel to Purdue on Feb. 19, before returning home for \"Senior Day\" against No. 5 Michigan on Feb. 22. Tipoff against the Boilermakers is scheduled for 6 p.m. CT on B1G+, while the clash against the Wolverines is set for 11 a.m. CT on FOX.\n\nHere's a look at the full USA TODAY Sports Women's College Basketball Coaches Poll:\n\nNo. 24 Princeton; No. 25 Iowa State;\n\nIowa State 33; Princeton 23; Rhode Island 17; Washington 12; Richmond 2; Rice 2; Oklahoma State 2; Nebraska 1;\n\nContact/Follow us @HawkeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Iowa news, notes, and opinions. Follow Scout on X: @SpringgateNews\n\nThis article originally appeared on Hawkeyes Wire: Where is Iowa women's basketball ranked in the USA TODAY Coaches Poll?",

Gymnast Carlos Yulo won two gold medals at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAnd now Alpine skier Tallulah Proulx has become the first female athlete from the Philippines to compete in the Winter Olympics — and at 17, the youngest ever from the Southeast Asian country.\n\n“This is a new era for the Philippines and sports on the global stage and I really am grateful that I get to be a part of it,” the U.S.-born Proulx said as she finished 50th in the slalom at the Milan Cortina Games on Wednesday after carrying her country’s flag during the opening ceremony.\n\nShe was 52nd in the giant slalom.\n\nProulx grew up skiing at the Sierra Tahoe resort in California, then moved at age 7 to Iowa and raced at tiny Sundown Mountain before moving on Colorado and then settling in Park City, Utah, where she now resides.\n\nProulx’s father is from the Eastern Samar province in the Philippines’ Eastern Visayas region.\n\n“And I have a lot of relatives, family back there and honestly the response has been so heartwarming,” Proulx said. “Filipinos are just such warm and welcoming people. … I think that’s what makes us really strong and I’m so grateful that I get to be the first Filipina because I show that others can follow in my footsteps and hopefully get more involved into winter sports, which I know is quite hard in the Philippines.”\n\nProulx was slated to visit the Philippines for the first time a few years ago before her trip got canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, she has emersed herself in the country’s culture, thanks to her grandmother.\n\n“Me and my brother grew up with her cooking — all of course the delicious Filipino food and sharing her culture,” Proulx said. “Unfortunately, last year she passed away. … I really wanted to push for this and wanted to represent such an important part of my heritage, both for her and for myself.”\n\nIn Cortina, Proulx traded pins with American slalom standout Paula Moltzan and got a picture with slalom gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\n“It’s amazing being around these people that I’ve looked up to my whole life,” she said, “and then realize I’m skiing that course next.”\n\nNext up for Proulx: a trip to the Philippines.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Micah Parsons has unloaded on Skip Bayless in a furious rant about the TV analyst.\n\nThe 74-year-old has enjoyed a legendary career in the sports media industry, but he has annoyed many people along the way.\n\nAmong those is Parsons, whom Bayless often criticized when he played for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nBayless was even pleased when the Cowboys traded the defensive star to the Green Bay Packers last offseason.\n\nParsons has now hit back at the TV personality with some harsh words on the trajectory of his career.\n\nParsons was asked about sports pundits generally, and singled out Bayless as someone he dislikes.\n\nParsons argued that he is better than Bayless at talking about sports, while the former ESPN star could never do his job in the NFL.\n\nAnyone who has followed Bayless’ career will know to expect a passionate response in the next few days.\n\n“F— Skip Bayless,” Parsons said. “F— all of them. I don’t give a f—. They want to ragebait me, but they won’t say it to my face.\n\n“I’ll tell you how it is. You suck. Your show doesn’t work anymore. What are we talking about?\n\n“[They will] tell you how to play the game. Come play my position, Skip, because I can do what you do. I do it better sometimes.”\n\nParsons also spoke about former Super Bowl-winning tight end Shannon Sharpe, who has transitioned into the media industry.\n\nParsons showed much more respect for Sharpe, as he tends to give less controversial takes than Bayless.\n\n“Shay Shay lives on both sides,” he claimed. “He knows how to play the fine line between a player and a show.\n\n“He plays it like, ‘He doesn’t really show up when it matters, but he’s a good player.’\n\n“Sometimes, he can let those ESPN writers get to him a little bit, I can tell.”\n\nJosh Allen gets voted NFL’s most loved player by fans, Aaron Rodgers makes top 10 list\n\nJerry Jones sends strong message to Cowboys fans after watching Seahawks beat Patriots in Super Bowl LX\n\nChad Johnson says he would fix everyone’s problems if he had ‘Jeff Bezos type money’",

The team saw promising initial results from their innovations, but they faced a decision about whether to reveal their new techniques. The U.S. Team’s strategy was easily imitated if competitors witnessed it in a race, but it was a risk not to test it in competition before the Olympics. And, were there possible upsides to imitation if it improved the entire sport? Should they share their techniques, and if so, when?\nHarvard Business School Assistant Professor Rebecca Karp joins Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “A Winning Strategy: Innovation in Olympic Speed Skating.” They explore whether and when to launch a novel idea, product, or service, and what are the consequences—good and bad—to being imitated.\n\n Back / Innovations in Olympic Speed Skating: When to Reveal a Novel Approach\n\n Latest in this series\n\n All episodes",

    "description": "BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team explains how the commentary in best-selling football video game EA FC 26 is put together.",
    "fullText": "Green apples and honey, ginger and lemon tea.\n\nThey may sound like they form the diet of a professional athlete, but they are also the secret weapons of football commentators and co-commentators keeping their voices in perfect condition.\n\nThese days, however, they don't just have to sound their best for real-life games.\n\nGremlin Interactive's groundbreaking Actua Soccer in 1995, which featured BBC Sport duo Barry Davies and Trevor Brooking on the mic, was the first football video game to feature a running match commentary, albeit a basic one.\n\nWhat might have been a gimmick became part of an ongoing quest for realism, evolving over the decades through the long-running Pro-Evo Soccer and Fifa series of games, to EA Sports FC and Konami's eFootball.\n\nCommentary has become part of the experience of millions of gamers on dozens of different titles down the years, providing a reaction for everything from praise of a glorious goal or - more likely - criticism if you miss an easy chance.\n\nBut how is it put together now so it sounds real?\n\n\"That's a terrible shot,\" groans Guy Mowbray. \"What were they thinking!?\" adds Sue Smith, to emphasise exactly how much you messed up.\n\nYou might think it is obvious their comments are nothing personal because when those lines were recorded for the EA Sports FC series - currently the world's most-played football video game - the pair were describing action they have never even seen, to be heard by people in every corner of the planet.\n\nHowever, it seems many do take it to heart.\n\n\"I have had some of my mates' kids message me randomly going, 'you just told me off for shooting from 30 yards' and I am like, 'what?',\" Smith, who is a regular guest summarising real-life action on Sky's Soccer Saturday, tells BBC Sport. \"Then I realise it is the game.\n\n\"It's the same when I meet strangers, or on social media - it shows the impact of the game, how many people play it, and how immersive it is. I think sometimes people genuinely believe you are in their bedrooms or somehow watching them play live.\"\n\nThat's the level of realism that makers Electronic Arts strive for, and is the reason Mowbray and Smith dedicate so much time to making their commentary and co-commentary sound as authentic as possible.\n\nThe first edition of the game the pair worked on came out in 2024. They started work on it more than a year earlier, and have been working on it ever since.\n\nThere is a new version released every 12 months - the latest came out in September 2025 - but as Mowbray and Smith explained, it keeps them busy all year round.\n\nMowbray, who has commentated on the Premier League for Match of the Day since 2004, says working on the game is a \"never-ending job\".\n\n\"It constantly needs updating - with new names for all the new players, plus new terminology and new features in the game,\" he said. \"It's an ever-evolving process and it's exciting to be part of it because it never stands still.\n\n\"The first video game I did the commentary for was the official Champions League game [by Take Two Interactive] for the PlayStation in 2002. I went down to Oxfordshire to record it, and it was very intensive but in three full days I did the entire game.\n\n\"Now things are very different. Either recording or doing prep, it is part of my weekly routine - pretty much every week from November all the way through to the start of July. We might have a couple of months where we are not doing anything on it before the next edition comes out, then it starts again.\n\n\"It takes so long because for every single facet of the game that you could think of, we have to cover every scenario. It is so in-depth because it has got to feel and sound real - the whole point of the game is its authenticity.\"\n\nTogether or separately, Mowbray and Smith have recording sessions every few weeks, along with game producer Paul Russell and a sound engineer.\n\nIt is all done remotely - even when Mowbray and Smith are working at the same time, he is usually in Leeds and she is in Manchester. Russell is in Canada, and the engineer might be in London.\n\n\"It's amazing how it all comes together with us being so far apart,\" Smith said. \"It's great fun when you do them but the sessions can be quite intense, lasting over four or five hours, and our voices have to be perfect.\n\n\"There have been times where we have come in and started recording but been told our voice isn't quite right, and it doesn't sound the same as it did last time.\n\n\"That makes sense, because it has got to sound exactly right within the game. If there is any sort of variation, it would probably sound quite odd, so I have never looked after my voice as much in my entire life!\n\n\"I eat a lot of green apples, which are really good for it, and also drink a lot of honey, ginger and lemon teas - anything like that. I'd never thought of it before, when I started doing co-comms for radio and TV, but when I am doing FC it is so precise that you have to make sure everything is right.\"\n\nMowbray has also become much more aware of the condition of his vocal chords.\n\n\"Doing this game has taught me so much about how the voice works,\" he added. \"Now I notice if my voice is different, and I know about the different parts of your throat and chest when you speak.\n\n\"Another new thing I have started doing in the past few years is the commentary for Gladiators, and again that is a totally different range and set of muscles that I am using. I have to be careful about doing that and the game in the same week.\"\n\nIn order for the game's commentary to sound as live and as natural as possible, producer Russell says the work of Mowbray and Smith is \"not just about recording lines\".\n\n\"We are always thinking about what is happening on the pitch,\" Russell said. \"So, what would a real commentator notice in that moment, and what tone should that moment have?\n\n\"From there, we define lots of different match situations - from the biggest goals to the smallest build-up moments and work with our commentators to create multiple natural ways those moments could be described.\"\n\nThat's where the work begins for Mowbray and Smith - before they get to the studio.\n\n\"Say there is a scenario where a team is crossing the halfway line but we don't know if it will develop into anything,\" Mowbray said.\n\n\"So, I might say, 'oh a promising attack, what could they do from here?' as a line of commentary to explain that - but we need 10 different ways of doing that, so I will have to think of another nine ways of saying it.\n\n\"It can't be scripted for me because it has got to be in my style and how I would say it in real life, so I have to think of those lines myself. It's the same for Sue on co-comms - she will need 10 different ways of adding insight or colour too.\n\n\"We have not got anything to actually watch, so there is no frame of reference when we are doing it. Instead I have to picture it in my mind's eye and think: 'What would I say?'\"\n\nGames like Actua Soccer look primitive now compared to the modern era of face-scans and movie-style graphics, and so was the process of adding the first commentary.\n\nWhen Davies first entered the studio in 1995, any realism was down to him.\n\n\"The company behind Actua Software got in touch with my agent,\" Davies, speaking to BBC Sport in 2020, explained. \"I had really no conception of what they wanted to do, or very little anyway. Then I went to see them and I actually changed the way they wanted to do it.\n\n\"I told them you cannot use the same way of identifying the player every time he touches the ball - it has got to be at different levels depending where he is on the pitch, as I would do when commentating normally.\n\n\"So I gave them about five different versions of every player's name, changing the emphasis each time. That probably gave them more work to do but, as a result, it sounded more realistic in my opinion.\"\n\nSaying each player's name in several different intonations has been one of Mowbray's more repetitive tasks over the past few years too, for use from everything from when they play a two-yard pass on the halfway line to smashing a worldie into the top corner from 25 yards - but his job is much bigger.\n\nActua Soccer had 704 players - 22 for each of the 32 men's national teams that were included - but there are more than 20,000 real male and female footballers in FC, with more being added all the time.\n\nWhile EA do give Mowbray some help here, with part of that process involving AI replicating his voice with his permission for some of the names, it is clear they don't want to lose his human touch.\n\n\"AI has long been part of our development pipeline - from animation to gameplay systems - and continues to support our teams in making better, more responsive football experiences,\" EA said. \"But when it comes to commentary and content, it's always a collaboration with our talent - not a replacement.\"\n\nInstead, it is real life they turn to for inspiration.\n\n\"There have been times when we are, say on a Champions League game, and [Russell] has specifically listened to it to get a feel of how we work together in an actual commentary, because we will try to replicate that rapport in the game. It is the little things like that that really add to the realism,\" Smith said.\n\n\"When you put your headphones on, they even play a crowd noise over the top so you have got to raise your voice over it. It helps me immerse myself even more - I am not just shouting over silence, which would never happen in real life either.\"\n\nLike the other English-language commentary pairing in the game - Derek Rae and Stewart Robson - the contributions of Mowbray and Smith involve back-and-forth chats or interruptions just like you would hear in real life.\n\n\"With the more chatty, in-game stuff, sometimes I am bouncing off what Guy is saying,\" Smith said.\n\n\"He doesn't have to be recording it at the same time as me, but they can play his line to me so I can come in off the back of it, so my levels are the same as his - and vice-versa.\"\n\nIt is evident how much they both enjoy working on the game - but listening to the end product is apparently not always quite as pleasant.\n\n\"I play the game as part of my preparation for my Match of the Day commentaries,\" Mowbray said. \"I've always done that, over many years, and before I began working on it.\n\n\"It is a bit of recreation, firstly, and a lot of fun - but it also gets into my head stuff like who plays where for different teams and in what formations.\n\n\"What I can't do now, though, is have my commentary on. Like everyone else who plays it, when I hear the commentator tell me I have done something wrong I think to myself, 'oh get lost!' but with me commentating I would literally be telling myself where to go!\n\n\"It's an odd sensation and I thought to myself that it must be psychologically damaging in some ways, so I use Derek instead.\n\n\"I know some people who have to listen to me, though. My neighbours have got two young sons - they are not particularly into football but the kids are - and I remember them saying once that every Saturday, particularly at this time of year, it feels like I have moved in.\n\n\"The kids will be playing FC all day, then Gladiators comes on and they watch that, then they go back to playing the game again, and then Match of the Day comes on - and their parents are like 'for goodness sake'.\n\n\"So, I can only apologise to anyone else who is in that situation - it's not my fault, honestly!\"\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy don't England players wear caps while batting?\n\nWhy do Premier League teams spend less in January?\n\nWhy did Alcaraz, Sinner & Sabalenka have to remove fitness trackers?",

That doesn’t that is enough for the empire Roger Goodell has helped expand.\n\nAfter NBC and the NBA agreed to a contract for Sunday Night basketball, it was revealed the NBA will be paid $2.45B per year.

Their viewership and brand is much stronger than that over the NBA.\n\nFor reference, the NFL’s Christmas Day performance saw a 27.5M viewership for one game versus the NBA’s 5.5M. It’s clear the NFL product is much more valuable. Is it worth a fuss over $450M margin?\n\nAfter all, the league is doing plenty well both in the owners’ and player’s pockets.

Instead, he focused on what sports can represent at a broader level.\n\nAfter watching the NBA All-Star Game and Team USA compete at the Winter Olympics, Obama posted a message about the impact of sports.\n\nHe tweeted: “Watching the NBA All-Star game and Team USA at the Winter Olympics, it’s clear that sports — just like music and art — still have the power to bring us together, build community, and remind us of our common humanity.”\n\nObama compared sports to music and art, suggesting they share a unique ability to connect people across different backgrounds.\n\nHis message centered on unity and shared experience rather than competition.\n\nAll-Star weekend, which features players from across the league and around the world, provided a fitting backdrop for that reflection.\n\nMichelle Obama also posted on social media after attending the game with Barack.\n\n“My favorite teammates on and off the court,” she wrote.\n\nHer caption accompanied a photo of the couple courtside at the Intuit Dome, adding a lighthearted note to the evening.\n\nThe post quickly drew attention from fans, many of whom enjoyed seeing the former president and first lady taking in the event together.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron jokes as Victor Wembanyama takes center stage at NBA All-Star Game\n\n‘Who is that?’ – Anthony Edwards’ Cristiano Ronaldo moment at NBA All-Star Game goes viral\n\nMetta Sandiford-Artest claims he can’t travel to Australia due to 2004 Malice at the Palace incident",

    "fullText": "There's a new No. 1 team in the nation.\n\nMichigan basketball (24-1, 14-1 Big Ten) moved up one spot, to No. 1, in the USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll on Monday, Feb. 16; the Wolverines were last atop the poll in its Jan. 5 iteration − five days before the Wolverines lost to Wisconsin in Ann Arbor, their only defeat this season.\n\nMichigan has won 10 consecutive games since, nine by double figures. The Wolverines are coming off another sweep last week, knocking off Northwestern on the road and crushing UCLA at home; with previous No. 1 Arizona losing twice last week, U-M has now taken over the top spot with less than four weeks to play before the reveal of the 2026 March Madness bracket.\n\n[ MUST WATCH: U-M's biggest week of the regular season is here. Make \"Hail Yes!\" your go-to Wolverines podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify). ]\n\nMichigan has been ranked No. 1 for 38 games in its 108-year history.\n\nThis is the latest in a season Michigan has been ranked No. 1 since it was No. 1 in the Associated Press poll on March 7, 1977 in the final poll before the NCAA tournament. Soon after, the Wolverines were upset by Charlotte in the NCAA's second round.\n\nPrior to that, Michigan hadn't been ranked No. 1 in February or later since 1965. That was the year consensus All-American Cazzie Russell led the Wolverines to the national championship game, which U-M lost to UCLA after holding onto the nation's top spot for more than three months.\n\nMichigan State, which has lost three of its past four games, dropped to No. 15 in this week's coaches poll, down from No. 10 last week.\n\nThis season, Michigan has dominated on both sides of the ball. The Wolverines are No. 1 in defensive efficiency (88 points per 100 possessions) and average 2-point distance (7.1 feet), No. 2 in 2-point defense (42.8%) and effective field goal defense (43.2), No. 4 in block rate (18.7%) and No. 7 in 3-point defense (29.1%).\n\nREQUIRED READING: How Michigan basketball built nation's biggest and best frontcourt\n\nOffensively, the Wolverines are No. 2 in 2-point shooting (63%), No. 4 in efficiency (126.6), No. 7 in effective field goal percentage (58.9%), No. 7 in average possession length (15 seconds) and No. 24 in offensive rebounding rate (36.6%).\n\nMichigan can't rest on its statistical excellence, however, with a tough slate this week: The Wolverines hit the road for a matchup with No. 7 Purdue on Tuesday (6:30 p.m., Peacock) before a neutral-court meeting with No. 3 Duke at Capital One Arena in Washington on Saturday (6:30 p.m., ESPN).\n\n\"It feels really good, but as you said, we have tough games now coming up,\" center Aday Mara said last week. \"We got to focus on, on that, on our scout, on practicing, getting better. ...

    "title": "Ratcliffe, Man Utd and the immigration comments fallout",
    "description": "Sports editor Dan Roan analyses the potential fallout of Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comments on immigration.",
    "fullText": "In the coming days, Sir Jim Ratcliffe should discover if the Football Association's legal team has decided the Manchester United co-owner brought the game into disrepute with his comments on immigration last week, which sparked condemnation from the government and beyond.\n\nThe governing body could decide his remarks reached the threshold required for him to be charged with a breach of its rules, it could write to the billionaire to remind him of his responsibilities, or it could choose to take no action at all.\n\nBut whatever the FA does, the impact of his claim that the UK had been \"colonised by immigrants\" - while citing incorrect population data - could be felt for some time to come.\n\nRegardless of the fact Ratcliffe also received support in some quarters for raising the issue of immigration in his interview with Sky News, the fact United felt the need to issue a statement, external that read like a public rebuke towards their own co-owner was a sign of the dismay felt at Old Trafford - along with concern at the potential cost of the backlash his words provoked.\n\nThe pointed assertion of United's \"inclusive and welcoming\" values - while not directly naming Ratcliffe - was a deliberate attempt to distance the club from him, and according to Old Trafford sources was signed off at the highest level.\n\nHours earlier Ratcliffe had said, external he was \"sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth\".\n\nWho is billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe and how did he make his money?\n\nRatcliffe sorry language 'offended some' after immigration comments\n\nRatcliffe has always spoken highly of the Glazer family, describing them as \"the nicest people on the planet\" last year.\n\nBut according to a source familiar with them, the club's majority shareholders will have been \"horrified\" by his initial remarks, and will have seen them as showing \"disregard for their ownership\".\n\nThe Glazers - whose grandparents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to the US - are yet to comment on the episode.\n\nBut the source believes a key reason they have supported inclusive initiatives such as All Red All Equal at the club is because they see it as a brand to be nurtured and heavily commercialised, and they will have taken a dim view of remarks that could make sponsors reconsider partnering with United.\n\n\"Big multi-nationals want to associate with youth, positivity and forward-thinking. United is currently struggling for sponsors… and this exacerbates that,\" the source added, suggesting that some potential partners would \"run a mile\".\n\nThis all came just days after the Glazers were said to have voiced their concerns about United's commercial performance, external at a recent meeting.\n\nIt is easy to see why. United have been without a training kit partner since last season, and their shirt-sleeve sponsor is also set to expire in the summer.\n\nLast year Marriott International - the world's largest hotel company - decided not to extend its sponsorship agreement, external with United after its contract expired.\n\nThe club's deal with Adidas is also worth £10m less this year because United have failed to qualify for the Champions League for two consecutive seasons.\n\nWhile United still managed to post record commercial revenue of £333m last year, their main Premier League rivals have been catching them up in recent years.\n\nSo, even with the club's statement and Ratcliffe's qualified apology, it is easy to see why there may be some nervousness among club executives in the wake of the controversy.\n\nPerhaps even more will now hinge on whether the team can secure Champions League qualification for next season.\n\nWhat this means for the long-term relationship between the six Glazer siblings - who retain 70% of the club - and their British business partner is unclear.\n\nIt is worth noting that under the terms of the agreement that saw Ratcliffe invest £1.25bn in the club in 2024, if the Glazers receive an offer from a third party that they want to accept, they can force him to sell his portion.\n\nAnd then there is the club's hopes for a new 100,000-seat stadium as part of a 370-acre Trafford regeneration project that relies on the support of local and national politicians.\n\nIn January, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Trafford council leader Tom Ross both hailed a new development corporation designed to enable the delivery of the multi-billion pound plan.\n\nThree weeks later however, both men issued statements condemning Ratcliffe's comments. The same applied to both Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves, both of whom had previously expressed support for the redevelopment project.\n\nWhile local officials have vowed that taxpayer money will not be used for the new stadium itself, public funds are being sought for surrounding infrastructure, including the crucial relocation of a neighbouring freight rail terminal to St Helens. Burnham has also said that his office could use compulsory purchase powers via the development corporation to force the sale of land required for the new stadium.\n\nIt is unclear whether Ratcliffe's remarks may make the ongoing negotiations more challenging, but they came at an important moment.\n\n\"Real harm could been done,\" one source close to the regeneration project said.\n\n\"The dust is still settling and none of it is insurmountable. But the optics of the council, the mayor and the government appearing to support his plans just became harder.\"\n\nUnited's hope will be that those involved focus on the 15,000 new homes, 48,000 new local jobs and billions of pounds in value to the economy that the project is said to be worth.\n\nIt appears Ratcliffe's relationship with many of United's fans has been harmed too.\n\n\"Comments from the club's senior leadership should make inclusion easier, not harder\", posted the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST).\n\nGhulam Haydar of the Manchester United Muslim Supporters' Club (MUMSC) told BBC Sport that Ratcliffe's apology was \"a first step\", but said he would like the 73-year-old to agree to a meeting with their members in order to provide some assurances.\n\n\"This is a global club… what's he going to do to actually assure us that the club is a welcoming space for people of colour, people of migrant backgrounds?\" he asked.\n\nMUMSC has said it does not feel that Ratcliffe's apology \"sufficiently addresses the seriousness\" of what was said.\n\n\"Expressing regret for causing offence is not the same as acknowledging the wider impact of words used. Leadership requires accountability as well as openness to debate.\"\n\nKick It Out - which works to fight racism, sexism and homophobia in football and says overall reports about discrimination have risen again this campaign after last season's record high, external - told BBC Sport that it has already received a number of reports about Ratcliffe's comments.\n\nHaving cut jobs and raised ticket prices, Ratcliffe was the subject of a protest by a supporter group just two weeks ago over the way the Ineos hierarchy has run the club since taking over football operations.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what kind of reception Ratcliffe receives when he next visits Old Trafford.\n\nUncertainty also surrounds the impact this could have on manager Michael Carrick - who will face questions about this issue for the first time when he addresses the media this week - along with United's players and staff, described by the club in their statement as a \"diverse group [that] reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home.\"\n\nDespite United's recent upturn in form since the appointment of the former midfielder, these are challenging times for Ratcliffe and his business Ineos, the petrochemicals firm he founded and leads.\n\nLast week, he warned, external that \"current conditions for Europe's chemical industry are unsurvivable without immediate intervention\".\n\nThose concerns were the reason Ratcliffe was at an industry summit in Antwerp. And they were clearly what he intended to talk about in an interview that instead ended up with him engulfed in a fierce political storm.\n\nIt is a controversy that is unlikely to blow over quickly, and the true repercussions are yet to become clear.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Few figure skaters at the Winter Olympics have seen Adeliia Petrosian compete in real life.\n\nShe might leave with the gold medal.\n\nRussia's exclusion from international sports events during its war with Ukraine means that the 18-year-old Petrosian has only skated one senior competition outside of her homeland, the qualifier that earned her place as a neutral athlete in Milan.\n\nAs she readies to skate to Michael Jackson's music in the short program Tuesday, no one besides Petrosian and her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, can be sure of her form, or whether she's injury-free.\n\nBut if Petrosian can get past skaters like the U.S. “Blade Angels” trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito, and Japanese stars Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai, she'll shoot to sudden fame as the fourth consecutive Olympic champion from Russia.\n\nPetrosian is the latest star produced by Tutberidze, who revolutionized women's skating a decade ago by getting young girls barely in their teens to perform bigger and bigger jumps, only to have many of them struggle with repeated injuries.\n\nShe coached 2018 gold medalist Alina Zagitova, and a trio of standouts in 2022, when Anna Shcherbakova won the gold medal.\n\nBut the Beijing Games have been remembered less for Shcherbakova's triumph and more for the positive doping test turned in by another Tutberidze talent, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva. The case ended ultimately in a doping ban for Valieva that only recently ended, and an investigation into Tutberidze, though it found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Russian coach.\n\nTutberidze also was criticized for her harsh words toward her students in Beijing, while World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Bańka said last week that he didn't “feel comfortable with her presence” at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nAs part of the fallout from the Valieva case, the International Skating Union increased the minimum age from 15 to 17 for senior-level athletes. That means Petrosian is one of the oldest women's skaters that Tutberidze has coached at a major championship.\n\nPetrosian has landed quadruple jumps in Russian national events, much like her compatriots were able to do in previous Olympics, and none of the other skaters at the Milan Cortina Games are able to match those high-scoring elements.\n\nThe big question is whether she's fit enough to do it in Milan.\n\n“I can't turn properly,” Petrosian complained in a Russian documentary following Tutberidze released last week. Tutberidze said Petrosian had been making progress in a difficult program around the new year, but suddenly “everything hurt.”\n\nThere's been no indication of how Petrosian's condition may have changed in the last month as she readied for the Olympics.\n\nFitness has been a factor for months. Tutberidze previously told Russian media that Petrosian wanted to give up her place in September's Olympic qualifier for lower-ranked skaters after an injury but ended up competing because the Russian alternate's fitness was worse.\n\n“Let's imagine it's just Chelyabinsk.” That was the advice Russian skater Petr Gumennik got from his coach ahead of skating in the men’s event, to pretend that the Olympics were happening in that provincial Russian city.\n\nFor a few seconds, it felt as if the competition might indeed be happening in Russia.\n\n“When I went out there I got so much applause, there was such noise, you can't compare it to anything,” Gumennik said after skating in the short program, where he was 12th. “That's Olympic support. It was unexpected and it gave me strength and confidence.”\n\nGumennik was greeted by fans waving personalized banners with his face, calling out “well done” in Russian.\n\nThere also was a Russian flag in the stands, even though Olympic organizers have barred it from the Games, where athletes such as Gumennik and Petrosian were vetted for any support of the war before they were allowed to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nAs the Russian with the best chance of a gold medal at these Olympics, there may be even more support when Petrosian skates. ___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "What is the hardest coaching job in world sport?\n\nWe are talking about the ‘poisoned chalice’ roles — mostly big teams where standards are high, fans’ expectations are higher and where coaches also have to contend with the weight of a glorious history.\n\nWe asked our writers across all sports for their nominations for the title, from Manchester United to the USWNT via Ferrari team principal (among others). In each case, reporters were asked to focus on those teams’ wider historical context rather than simply this current season.\n\nAt the end of the article, you can vote for the job you think is the hardest in world sport. This list is far from definitive, so please do make your own suggestions in the comments below if you feel we have missed any roles out.\n\nCoaching the England men’s team is such a peculiar role that it even has a name attached: ‘An Impossible Job’. Former manager Graham Taylor was the subject of a documentary of the same name, which laid bare the team’s unsuccessful bid to qualify for the 1994 World Cup.\n\nPart of this is just the natural effect of assuming this country cares more about its national team than others. Many other nations have a lot of public pressure on this role and a lot of expectation, too. Yes, in the past, the media glare in that job has been ferocious — but that is not the case in quite the same way now. And it is certainly not distinctive to England either.\n\nPerhaps the hardest element is to bridge the gap between resources and record. The England men’s team have won one major tournament: the World Cup hosted by the country in 1966. But they now have the richest, most popular football league in the world in the Premier League on their doorstep. And yet, turning that to the advantage of the England team is a challenge that has yet to be resolved.\n\nCan Thomas Tuchel, the current coach who this week signed a new deal until the European Championship in 2028, be the man to do that at last?\n\nThere are many layers to why coaching the New York Jets feels like an impossible job. Let’s start with the simple statement: they are the New York Jets.\n\nThere is not an NFL team that has been referred to mockingly, or derisively, or served as the butt of a joke in television shows, movies or sketch comedies quite like this team. That reputation is part of what makes it hard to work here: the “Same Old Jets” of it all, a feeling that, eventually, things will go terribly, even when it feels like there is hope.\n\nThat ties to the franchise’s history. This is a team that has not won a Super Bowl since 1969 and has not found any sort of stability at quarterback since then, either. Coaching the Jets means answering to a fanbase that has grown increasingly angry the longer their playoff-less streak (15 years and counting) goes on. Current head coach Aaron Glenn is a beloved former Jets player and he was not granted much of a grace period — after one losing season, fans are already calling for his head.\n\nThe other challenge: ownership. Woody Johnson is known to be meddlesome, impatient and easily influenced by headlines.\n\nBut really, it all falls under the “Same Old Jets” umbrella, which coaches have failed to overcome going on for a few decades now.\n\nManaging Real Madrid is a uniquely difficult challenge. Florentino Perez, long-serving president of the record 15-time European Cup/Champions League winners, has little patience for long-term projects or planning, and no time for excuses or mitigating factors such as injuries or misfortune.\n\nPerez fills the dressing-room with big-name players who do not always fit together well, rarely enjoy detailed tactical instruction and seldom take responsibility when the team is not doing well.\n\nMadrid are actually owned by 80,000 members who demand the highest standards — and are surrounded by a voracious local media who mercilessly criticise anyone who even temporarily falls short.\n\nTo enjoy success in the Spanish capital, Madrid’s coach must be able to motivate and organise star players, while showing humility and intelligence in dealing with Perez, and accepting the only thing that really counts is regularly winning the biggest trophies.\n\nSince 2000, Madrid have had 18 different coaches — and just three have won a Champions League: Vicente del Bosque in 2000 and 2002, Carlo Ancelotti in 2014, 2022 and 2024, and Zinedine Zidane in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nOther coaches with big reputations and personalities who have tried but failed include Jose Mourinho, Fabio Capello, Rafa Benitez, and, most recently, former playing icon Xabi Alonso. It is no surprise that the current incumbent, another former player, Alvaro Arbeloa, is feeling the pressure after just eight games.\n\nAll Formula 1 team principal jobs (the closest to a head coach’s role in other sports) come with pressure. But none compares to that of Ferrari, the sport’s most historic and trophy-laden team, who demand nothing but success. All of Italy is watching.\n\nIt is something Fred Vasseur, Ferrari’s team principal since 2023, felt last year. The team narrowly missed out on the title in 2024, only to then slide backwards and endure a winless season, despite the blockbuster signing of Lewis Hamilton. By mid-season, Vasseur was facing deep scrutiny in the press. Even with a new contract signed last June, that spotlight will only dim once success arrives.\n\nVasseur is Ferrari’s fifth team principal since 2014, with each of the past four changes coming abruptly in response to a lack of success. Simply fighting for wins is not enough to satisfy Ferrari’s board, the Italian press, or its fans watching around the world. Championships are the only currency they want to deal in.\n\nVasseur is acutely aware of that, his goal being to finally be the person to end Ferrari’s title drought (they last won the drivers’ title in 2007 and the constructors’ crown in 2008) and succeed in F1’s toughest job. But he needs to break the trend of his predecessors to make that happen.\n\nManchester United's 20 top-flight league titles, dating back to 1908, have been won by only three men: Ernest Mangnall, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson. That is the same number of league-winning managers that Liverpool have had since 1990, Chelsea have had since 2010 and Manchester City have had since 2012.\n\nIt took United five attempts to land on Busby's true successor. That was long enough, but their next permanent manager will be the seventh since Ferguson's retirement after winning 38 trophies in his 26 years in charge.\n\nThat success made United one of the biggest clubs in the world — almost certainly the biggest in the English-speaking world — but also set an almost impossible standard to meet.\n\nWhoever eventually puts United back on their perch, in Ferguson's parlance, will have to work with an unpopular ownership, an insatiable media and a long list of ex-players who have been there, won it and started a podcast.\n\nBut most of all, they will need to match the expectation that United should be the dominant force in English football, even more than a decade on from the last of those league titles.\n\nTottenham are, in theory, one of the world’s most promising football clubs.\n\nBased in London, an international financial and sporting capital, they can attract talent over competition from most teams in the Premier League and beyond, and their world-class stadium and training ground are, or at least should be, a dream to operate in. They also have wealthy owners.\n\nAll of this leads to high expectations, but Spurs, irrespective of the manager, have consistently fallen short.\n\nNow-USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino is considered the club’s most successful manager in the 21st century, taking Tottenham to a Champions League final and their highest finish in Premier League history (second). It felt like a golden age in waiting, but Spurs lost that final to Liverpool in 2019 and did not become English champions under Pochettino, failing to capitalise on the moment.\n\nSince then, Spurs have been on a steady decline — and no one has got particularly close to rescuing them over a sustained period.\n\nNo matter who has stood in the dugout, whether it has been Premier League winners Jose Mourinho or Antonio Conte, or Ange Postecoglou (who delivered the club's first trophy in 17 years last season at the expense of the club's worst league finish since 1976-77), Nuno Espirito Santo or Thomas Frank — the latter was sacked on Wednesday after only joining in June while Spurs have appointed the Croatian Igor Tudor until the end of the season — the product has never consistently matched the near-league-leading ticket prices. And the coaches are the ones who regularly take the blame.\n\nTottenham currently sit 16th in the Premier League, which led to the board moving on from Frank this week.\n\nThe potential of the young squad and the opportunity for investment should make them an exciting proposition for many top-class head coaches. But almost every type of manager has tried to establish Spurs as league and Champions League contenders post-Pochettino — and all have failed.\n\nThe average tenure of a permanent Chelsea manager this century is 532 days, or 17 and a half months. Across almost two decades of ownership under Roman Abramovich, the club ruthlessly chewed through many of the world’s most famous and successful coaches, banking a steady flow of trophies and pressing the ‘eject’ button at the first sign of failure.\n\nIt says something, then, that the Stamford Bridge dugout has become an even less forgiving environment since Abramovich, a Russian oligarch, sold up in 2022, following UK government sanctions imposed on him after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLiam Rosenior is BlueCo’s fourth permanent head coach appointment in four years, and those numbers do not even account for Thomas Tuchel — the Champions League winner they inherited and quickly sacked, now in charge of England — or Frank Lampard, who returned for a second miserable stint as caretaker boss in 2023.\n\nTo win at the highest level with one of Europe’s youngest squads and satisfy a demanding and increasingly disillusioned fanbase is challenging enough. Then there is Chelsea’s unique executive structure, with co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart heading up an increasingly sprawling brain trust overseeing everything from recruitment to injury prevention and management.\n\nIt is a structure that can only accommodate a head coach, not a manager, and both Mauricio Pochettino (in charge from 2023-2024) and Enzo Maresca grew weary of working within it. Rosenior, promoted with startling speed from BlueCo sister club Strasbourg, has been handed an incredible opportunity so early in his coaching career — but also a frighteningly difficult path to walk.\n\nPicture this: the biggest media market in the country. The franchise with by far the most World Series championships. The most intense fans in the game.\n\nThose are just a few things breathing down the neck of the manager of the New York Yankees.\n\nCalling it a tough job would be a major understatement. It even appears to take a physical toll — just look at the before and after photos of Joe Torre and Joe Girardi, who held the position before Aaron Boone took over in 2018.\n\nPressure like this exists nowhere else in baseball. Other teams tank for higher draft picks or trade their best players to retool, giving up today for a better tomorrow. In the Bronx, there is no such luxury. The Yankees must win every year — the fans demand it.\n\nTo the credit of owner Hal Steinbrenner, he does spend money bringing in some of the sport’s biggest names. But with great talent on the field also comes great expectations in the dugout — all while the manager is forced to explain his decisions to reporters twice a day while maintaining harmony between the clubhouse and the decision-makers in the front office.\n\nIn the biggest city in the U.S., being Yankees manager is a job nobody else can relate to.\n\nYou only need to look at the furore that followed recent defeats by Arsenal and Manchester City — and read The Athletic’s in-depth piece on the crisis happening behind the scenes — to understand the pressure that comes with managing Chelsea women. Sonia Bompastor has only lost three of her 37 Women’s Super League matches in charge of Chelsea since she was appointed in 2024, but there are still fans unhappy with the French manager.\n\nBompastor is a victim of her own success. Last season, she led Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic treble, and the expectations set by her predecessor and now-USWNT coach Emma Hayes, who won 16 trophies in her 12 years at the club. The standard at the club is unforgiving, and entertaining the idea of anything but total dominance is seen as a failure.\n\nThe only women’s club team with comparable expectations are Barcelona, where squad cohesion is helped by the fact that so many of the players are also longtime Spain team-mates. Bompastor has to integrate big-name signings from across the globe. Having such an array of talent is a blessing, but it leaves her with nowhere to hide.\n\nThe rest of the WSL are also narrowing the gap on Chelsea, whereas the only real threat to Barcelona’s dominance in Spain are Real Madrid, and even they have only beaten Barca once in 24 meetings.\n\nThe U.S. women’s national team’s win at the 1999 World Cup set a new bar and served as a catalyst not only for the women’s game domestically but around the world.\n\nThe head that wears the crown has always been heavy: until recently, the expectation of the USWNT was to not only win, but to annihilate opponents (think that 13-0 drubbing of Thailand at the start of their 2019 World Cup campaign). Head coach Emma Hayes will doubtless have found that out for herself since being appointed in 2023.\n\nIf anything, the job has become harder as the talent gap between the U.S. and every other nation has narrowed; they are No 2 in FIFA’s world rankings, trailing World Cup winners Spain.\n\nBalancing sustainable player development while still achieving results — yes, even in international friendlies — is a delicate balance to strike under the spotlight, and there may be no stage more daunting in women’s football than the USWNT.\n\nIt is beyond a joke, really. Just think of the Grampa Simpson meme showing him walking in and out, and that is Watford.\n\nThe second-tier side go through head coaches — it is ironic that they give them such a lofty title in the first place — quicker than you can say, \"another one bites the dust”.\n\nSince the Italian businessman Gino Pozzo bought the club in 2012, he has micro-managed his way through 23 incumbents of football's hottest seat. For context, there had been 34 in the club's 109-year history before then.\n\nOnly five coaches have lasted a whole campaign. Five seasons — including this one — have seen three different men in the dugout. In 2014-15 and 2019-20, there were four.\n\nIt appeared the hire-and-fire culture worked, as Watford spent six of seven seasons in the Premier League from 2015 to 2022. But they are not even a yo-yo club anymore. The string has snapped, the parachute payments from Premier League relegation have stopped, and that revolving door keeps on turning. Next!\n\nIt is a mistake to think of the Bayern Munich job as a coaching role — it is much more than that.\n\nThe starting point for the record 34-time German champions is that anything less than a domestic double of trophies each season is seen as performing below par, with every unconvincing performance — even in victory — subject to inquest.\n\nBut then there is the rapacious Bavarian and national media, for whom negativity about Bayern is big business, and a dressing room always loaded with forthright personalities and egos.\n\nThe club’s elders, Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, present a separate challenge. Hoeness, the honorary president who played for Bayern from 1970 to 1979, rarely has an unspoken thought, especially about the standard of the team or the quality of coaching, meaning that plenty of scrutiny comes from inside the club, from seemingly unimpeachable figures.\n\nA Bayern coach needs tremendous presence, but also the humility to know their place at certain times and when to be deferential. That is a balance few have found in the club’s modern history.\n\nThe hardest coaching job is one where expectations are high, patience is low and, sometimes, the view is irrational. In the NBA, that means the jobs at two high-profile teams on each coast.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers head coach lives under constant strain. Pressure is intensely high for a fanbase (and ownership) used to winning. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles, the second-most in league history. They are not used to losing. Even winning the NBA Cup (a feat with a nebulous value) is not enough. Darvin Ham was fired in 2024, the year after making the conference finals and hanging a Cup banner.\n\nThe Lakers have had 11 coaches in the last 25 years but only one has lasted more than three seasons in the job: Phil Jackson (from 1999-2004 and 2005-2011). Even Frank Vogel was fired in 2022, two years after winning a title.\n\nThe New York Knicks head coach feels the pressure, too. There have been 15 of them since 2000. But that franchise has not won an NBA championship in 53 years. The owner is demanding and impatient, and success is only success on the right terms.\n\nAfter two decades of ineptitude, Tom Thibodeau was fired last spring, despite leading the Knicks to their best finish in a quarter-century. Good luck to the new coach, and the one who replaces him.\n\nThere is an old cliche about the difficulty of coaching national teams in football. Clubs have big fanbases, sure, but they are splintered and spread around. When you manage a country, the number of people who think they can do a better job than you is roughly equal to the entire population.\n\nIn Brazil, that number is about 210million. Nearly all of them are obsessed with football. The older generations remember a time when the national team were the dominant force in the international game. The rest grew up hearing the tales and watching the videos — and many will still have seen one or two of the more recent World Cup wins (Brazil have lifted the game's most prestigious title a record five times). It is understandable that expectation often curdles into entitlement.\n\nWhat complicates things is a knot of competing dynamics. There are the zigzagging inferiority/superiority complexes when it comes to how Brazilian football compares to that played in Europe. There is the deathless debate around the compatibility — or otherwise — of winning and entertaining. There is also the fact that Brazil’s national self-image is so bound up with football.\n\nThe Brazil coach is not just picking 11 players and planning corner routines. He has to plot a course through all of that other stuff, all while loaded down by the weight of history. It is no great wonder most fail.\n\nNo NHL coaching job is quite like it.\n\nA longest-in-league-history championship drought means bringing the Stanley Cup to Toronto would all but guarantee instant legendary status and a statue outside the arena. The problem? That same historic drought — and all the failures along the way — have added to the pressure and noise in hockey’s largest market.\n\nCanada’s most populated city counts a fanbase that has only grown in the face of annual disappointment. The Maple Leafs, the NHL’s most valuable team, last won the Stanley Cup in 1967. There were just six teams in the league at the time. Today, there are 32.\n\nSince Punch Imlach led the Leafs to that last championship, 21 other coaches have tried — and ultimately failed — to satisfy a starved fanbase. Despite the billions of dollars invested over the years into the team’s expensive roster, facilities, resources and staff, the Leafs have never won more than two playoff rounds in a single season in that time.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2012, the Leafs did not even make the playoffs, adding to their sense of perennial heartbreak. Four coaches failed during that time. Two of them won the Stanley Cup elsewhere — giving weight to the notion that the Leafs might be cursed.\n\nWith 25 games remaining this season, the Leafs are in danger of missing the playoffs altogether for the first time in a decade. Craig Berube, a former Stanley Cup-winning coach who has been leading Toronto since 2024, is the latest person in the hot seat.\n\nPutting this season aside, the job of coaching one of Scotland’s big two could be naively regarded as a cakewalk. Historically, and certainly since the turn of the century, their budgets have dwarfed those of every other Scottish team. Your job, therefore, is to finish in front of the club over the road. Simple.\n\nBut in that respect, there is nowhere to hide. If you are Rangers and you wind up behind Celtic, you might as well have finished bottom. The same is true in reverse. To attend an Old Firm fixture, as the rivalry is known, is to understand the frenetic, vitriolic, passionate and sometimes poisonous world of football in Glasgow. It looks like easy street when it goes well. It is an untold nightmare if it goes badly.\n\nAnd, very often, the fate of a coach is wholly dictated by the structure around them and above them. Strain at boardroom level filters down onto the pitch, affecting resources and the quality of performances.\n\nYou have seen that at Rangers for more than a decade. You are seeing it at Celtic now. Yes, Wilfried Nancy was a disaster of an appointment, sacked after 33 days in charge last month — but when were Celtic last set up to fail as they seem to be at present? It made Nancy’s job a hospital pass, regardless of whether the former Columbus Crew coach was ever the right fit.\n\nWith regards to Glasgow, Vince Lombardi was bang on: there is no room for second place. It is sink or swim from a manager’s first morning in post — and rather them than me.\n\nThere is a phrase in Turkish football which roughly translates as “titles are won at the airport” — a reference to the big-name signings who are often greeted with frantic scenes when they get off the plane to finalise their deals.\n\nThe idea that new arrivals will inevitably mean success is an attitude shared by club presidents, too. The message to their coaches is “we’ve given you the stars, now win something”.\n\nWhich is part of the reason that coaching any of Istanbul’s big three clubs — Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas — is almost an impossible job. Plenty of cultures think of football as a form of religion, but there are not many cities that do so with such chaotic intensity as Istanbul.\n\nGood luck to anyone in charge of any of them, but right now the biggest pressure is on Fenerbahce. Historically the most successful club in Turkey (they have won 28 Turkish titles to Galatasaray’s 26), they have not been champions since 2014, their longest-ever drought, and have had to watch Galatasaray demolish them for the last three seasons.\n\nThey are on their 11th different manager since that last success, and things are getting desperate: Jose Mourinho was sacked earlier this season and the man now in the hot seat is former Belgium manager Domenico Tedesco.\n\nKalen DeBoer took on maybe the greatest challenge in college football history two years ago by signing up to be the coach who replaced Nick Saban. Saban produced an unprecedented run of six national titles in 17 seasons at Alabama from 2007 to 2023.\n\nAlabama fans became accustomed to ruling the sport under Saban. But it has historically set the standard at national championship for its football program, long predating Saban. Before him, coach Bear Bryant won six national championships with the football team during the 1960s and 1970s and their excellence stretches back almost a century — with their 30 Southeastern Conference football championships by far the most in the history of the storied league.\n\nIn the early to mid-1900s, a time in the United States when elite Northeast universities and large institutions in the Midwest often ruled the sport, Alabama was a Southern powerhouse and source of pride for much of the state, though in-state rival Auburn also commands similar support. That Iron Bowl rivalry is yet another aspect that makes the Alabama job so difficult. An otherwise successful season can be severely damaged or even ruined by a loss to Auburn in the regular-season finale.\n\nThere is a saying that college football is like a religion in the Deep South, as much a part of a fan's identity as their faith. Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, capacity 100,077, is among college football's largest and most hallowed cathedrals. Successful coaches at Alabama become legends. Coaches who fail to meet the lofty expectations, even respected alumni such as Ray Perkins, Mike DuBose and Mike Shula, are forever remembered for their shortcomings.\n\nIndia are international cricket’s sole powerhouse. Even if Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand can compete in terms of the talent of their first team, India have a much deeper overall pool. The country has a total population of more than 1.4billion.\n\nGiven the perceived player advantage they possess, the coach faces immense scrutiny from all corners in a country that views the sport as a religion and its stars as gods. No sport rivals cricket’s status and no celebrities rival cricketers’ popularity in India.\n\nIndia wield immense financial firepower as a result and a considerable influence over cricket’s global body, the International Cricket Council. Jay Shah, the son of the nation’s home minister, is the council’s chairman.\n\nThose elements also make the coach’s job a fairly thankless one as India are expected to — and arguably should — beat every team they face.\n\nWhat do you think the hardest coaching job in world sport is?

    "description": "Eileen Guo and Alysa Liu have been thrust into a debate that goes far beyond sports.",
    "fullText": "An unusual battle is unfolding over the Winter Olympics in Milan - not on the slopes or in the rinks, but on the internet.\n\nAt its heart are Eileen Gu, a freestyle skier, and Alysa Liu, a figure-skater. They have a lot in common: both are young women of American-Chinese heritage who were born and raised in the US. And they are champions in their field.\n\nAnd yet, one is being hailed a trailblazer, while the other is deemed a traitor. At least that's the case in the eyes of some in the US. On Chinese social media, it's the other way around.\n\nWhy? Liu, the daughter of a political activist who fled China after a deadly crackdown, is competing under the US flag. And Gu, whose mother moved to the US for higher education, often spent her childhood summers visiting Beijing. She is representing China in Milan.\n\nThat seems to rankle with some Americans. \"Eileen Gu competes for China and gets paid millions to do it. Alysa Liu is the daughter of a Chinese immigrant who participated in the Tiananmen Square protests. In a world of Eileen Gus, be an Alysa Liu,\" said one post on X.\n\nMuch of this backlash appears to be driven by political commentators and a vocal minority on X, rather than the broader public or the sporting world. The underlying current is the competition between the US and China - the world's two biggest economies are constantly vying for an edge in everything, from trade to tech.\n\nAnd so, a narrow yet vociferous slice of the internet is pitting two women against each other, questioning their loyalty and identity, while interrogating their immigrant experiences - and adding to the pressure they already face as sporting figures.\n\nKnown in China by her nickname \"Snow Princess\", Eileen Gu was born in California to a Chinese mother and American father.\n\nShe was raised by her mother Yan Gu - reportedly a successful venture capitalist with degrees from Peking University and Stanford.\n\nGu grew up with a foot firmly in both worlds, spending her summers in Beijing and the rest of her term at a private school in San Francisco.\n\nShe began freeskiing at the age of three in the Lake Tahoe region and joined the Northstar California Resort freeskiing team at the age of eight. She won her first national championship just a year later.\n\nShe initially skied for the US before switching to Team China in 2019 in preparation for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which took place in the Chinese capital Beijing.\n\nGu said she wanted to \"inspire millions of young people in Beijing - my mother's birthplace\". The decision earned her the praise of many in China.\n\nShe went on to win two golds and one silver in the 2022 Olympics.\n\nIn the years since, Gu has established herself as a veritable sports icon in China. Millions on Chinese social media follow her every move, leaving heart shaped emojis under her posts.\n\nChinese state media outlet the Global Times called her an \"idol for the whole world\". She is also one of the highest-earning female athletes in the world, reportedly earning around $23m (£16.9m) a year.\n\nHer decision to join Team China initially brought with it a considerable amount of backlash. Beyond the rivalry with the US, people also took issue with China's authoritarian Communist Party rulers, their poor record on human rights and the lack of free speech in the country.\n\nBut the outrage died down for the most part - until now.\n\nIt kicked off last week, when Olympian Hunter Hess was asked what it was like to represent the US given the polarising situation in the country, including the recent, contentious ICE raids in Minnesota that left two people dead.\n\nHe replied that he had \"mixed feelings\" about it, adding: \"Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded to Hess' comment by calling him a \"real loser\" who \"shouldn't have tried out for the team\". Many athletes leapt to Hess' defence, including Gu: \"As someone who's been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes\".\n\nHer comments enraged her critics, who said Gu was able to criticise Trump but had never spoken out publicly against China.\n\nFormer NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom was among them, calling Gu a \"traitor\", who \"was born in America, raised in America, lives in America and chose to compete against her own country for the worst human rights abuser on the planet - China\".\n\n\"You don't get to enjoy the freedoms of US citizenship while acting as a global PR asset for the Chinese Communist Party,\" he said in a lengthy post on X.\n\n\"Does Eileen Gu have any criticism for Xi Jinping for genocide, slavery and arresting dissenters?\" Matt Whitlock, a self-described Republican communicator also posted on X. Western governments, rights groups and the UN have repeatedly accused Beijing of grave human rights violations in Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as in its swift crackdowns on protest and dissent across the country. The Chinese government denies the charges and says these are internal matters.\n\n\"Many American-born athletes compete for other nations with little fanfare - the 'New Cold War' climate between the US and China has changed the stakes,\" says Professor Yinan He of Lehigh University.\n\n\"Personal identity is increasingly centred on national loyalty in the eyes of the public, diminishing the tolerance for 'deviance' or dual-identity\".\n\nEarlier this week Gu said she felt as though she was \"skiing with the weight of two countries on my shoulder\", after losing the gold in women's slopestyle to Switzerland.\n\nWhile some supporters saw this as a moment of vulnerability, it appeared to set her critics off again. Some took offence to her claiming the \"weight\" of the US was on her: \"She was only representing one country and it wasn't ours.\"\n\nSoon, many online began comparing her to Alysa Liu - an athlete who has made a comeback this year, winning a gold medal for the US figure skating team.\n\nThe 20-year-old is the daughter of Arthur Liu, who fled China after taking part in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. The student-led pro-democracy movement ended in a brutal massacre in Beijing. The subject remains taboo in China, and any references to it are swiftly censored.\n\nHer family history might partly explain why there aren't too many posts about Liu on Chinese social media. Those that do praise her usually have comments below such as: \"Why are you praising this person? Her whole family is anti-China\".\n\nRaised by her father, Liu grew up in California and began skiing at a young age. At the age of 13, she became the youngest ever athlete to win the US women's figure skating championship.\n\nIn 2019, Arthur Liu alleged that he was targeted in a spying operation that the Justice Department alleges was ordered by the Chinese government. His daughter says she was told by FBI agents in 2022 that she and her family were believed to be under surveillance by the Chinese government.\n\nHer father's background and the possibility that her family is still targeted because of it has certainly won Liu sympathy and admiration. That, in turn, seems to be fuelling the criticism of Gu.\n\nThe divide between Li and Gu isn't just about \"nationalism, it's also about class and relatability, Prof He says. Gu represents a luxury culture - private schools, Stanford. Her choice to compete for China is often seen through this lens as a 'mercenary business decision'\", he explains.\n\nIndeed a post on X by non-profit group Asians for Liberty read, \"The CCP lures American athletes with promises of wealth and fame but a true American rejects it. Alysa Liu is an American patriot\".\n\n\"All of this frames how the media and the public make sense of Liu and Gu, who have been cast as the good and bad immigrant respectively,\" says Professor Richard King of Columbia College Chicago.\n\nChinese Australian dissident artist Badiucao, known for his content against the Chinese Communist Party, posted drawings of the athletes recently. One showed Liu in front of a Tiananmen tank, a reference to her father's activism, and another showed Gu holding a Chinese flag, with what appear to be bodies hidden underneath, a not-so-subtle reference to the accusations against Beijing.\n\nFar-right news and opinion website The Daily Caller, founded by political commentator Tucker Carlson, went further with an article titled: \"Meet Eileen Gu, the true villain of the Winter Olympics\".\n\nThe episode also exposes \"the incredibly precarious social and political landscape that Asian Americans have to navigate,\" says Professor Stanley Thangaraj at Stonehill College. They \"come to be recognised only in limited ways, and any political act immediately dislocates them from the US\".\n\nWhen prominent Asian Americans attempted to defend Gu, with Marvel actor Simu Liu posting that he was \"freaking proud\" of Gu, calling her \"inspirational, resilient, intelligent and well spoken in two languages\" - he too faced an immediate wave of backlash, with comments demanding he \"go back to China\".\n\nAs the Games continue in Milan, the sport itself seems to have become an afterthought in discussions of both athletes.\n\n\"Despite both athletes sharing similar racial backgrounds and first-generation immigrant experiences,\" Prof He says, \"they have been cast as opposing archetypes in a narrative they didn't write\".",

    "description": "NBC Sports' exclusive stylist Amy Acton explains what it takes to dress more than 200 on-air personalities for Olympic coverage around the world.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Acton, the founder and CEO of Acton Styling Group. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the exclusive stylist for NBC Sports, which means I style NBC talent for the Olympics and other shows like Sunday Night Football, the Kentucky Derby, and more.\n\nI've always been interested in fashion. When I was younger, I went to college for all of two weeks because I ran out of outfits — I thought there was no point. It just wasn't for me. After working at health clubs, I became a personal shopper for an upscale clothing boutique, and then moved into television styling.\n\nI began my styling career on television for \"The Montel Williams Show\" in the 90s. I was styling mostly men then. At a photo shoot, a woman asked me to style NBC anchor Hannah Storm. I did closet edits for her and then her wardrobe for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Then I became a stylist for the Sydney Games. Sports changed my life.\n\nI style over 200 people for NBC during its Olympics coverage. It's not just on-air talent, although we style 20 to 25 on-air talent, like Mike Tirico and Rebecca Lowe. We also create the \"venue talent wardrobe package,\" which is what all the reporters and commentators who call the games on-site wear.\n\nWe start two years before the broadcast. As soon as one Olympics ends, we begin preparing for the next one. We have to make sure we are doing everything — from choosing the right colors to selecting clothing that will protect everyone from the environment — Milan's temperature is very different from the 2018 Winter Olympics site, PyeongChang, for example.\n\nA post shared by Trenni (Kusnierek) Casey (@trenninbcs)\n\nTo prepare, we bring all the talent to New York to do a fitting with the looks I pre-pull. Ralph Lauren, the exclusive brand NBC talent wears, has a team on hand to assist the in-studio team with alterations. The venue talent also comes to the studio; we have to make sure they look good and cohesive, and we don't want everyone wearing the same sweater at the same time. We alter the clothes, and then we ship everything where it needs to go. We shipped the clothes to Milan about a month prior to the games.\n\nMy company, Acton Group, doesn't have anything to do with what Team USA athletes wear.\n\nI'm always working in two different time zones. We have studios in the US plus talent in the host country. In the US, the talent is at the NBC Sports Group headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and sometimes at 30 Rock in New York City. The day never really ends. My phone is always on. For example, I went straight from dressing Super Bowl commentators Jason Garrett, Devin McCourty, and Maria Taylor to Milan for the Olympics.\n\nA post shared by Rebecca Lowe (@rebeccalowetv)\n\nIt's highly hands-on and fast-paced — I'm managing fittings, daily dressing, wardrobe organization, and last-minute changes. For studio talent alone, it's 420 looks over two weeks. There are 10 people in Milan, and 10 people in the US on my team. We are a machine, a 24-hour operation in both countries. Between Stamford and Milan, Acton Style Group manages the movement of more than 7,500 Ralph Lauren pieces across all venues.\n\nAs much as I love fashion, it's about making people feel good about themselves. We want talent — who are in front of the biggest audiences in the world — to feel good about themselves.\n\nYou can't put a price tag on that, and you can't always do it for yourself. You need someone else to pump you up and tell you that it looks good.",

    "fullText": "Recently, Liverpool and the Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk said former players-turned-pundits have a responsibility when discussing the performances of the current generation of footballers.\n\nHe believes they can stray into \"clickbait\" and have a possible impact on players' mental health.\n\nOn Thursday's episode of the More than the Score podcast, former Scotland international Pat Nevin and chief sports editor for Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf Marcel van der Kraan join John Bennett to discuss and analyse the modern world of punditry and the impact it can have on players and managers alike.\n\n\"As a player you do tend to take it to heart, especially when it feels a little personal,\" said Nevin.\n\n\"Generally, it isn't personal and the pundit is just having their opinion and we all kind of know where the lines are. But, the lines have been jumped over more often in recent years and I think Van Dijk is right about that.\n\n\"Because of the clickbait, it is so much easier to get more likes, views and work if you're a little bit more extreme. Ex-players aren't stupid and they know that. If you are too sensible and sit on the fence you won't get the big gigs.\n\n\"You have a dichotomy. Most ex-players would like to be balanced but they know if they are too balanced and sensible they won't be there next week.\n\n\"My criticism would always be constructive criticism which is explained. One-dimensional labeling of players should never happen. Sometimes if a big name says something enough it becomes accepted wisdom.\"\n\nVan der Kraan added: \"There are two different kinds of pundits; those who need to be on every week and those who are genuinely focused on what is right and what players should do.\n\n\"For Van Dijk, after so many years enough is enough.\n\n\"It all started after he came into the Netherlands team and became a big player at Liverpool. The first ex-player to really criticise him was Marco van Basten, saying he was not a leader. Van Dijk was biting his lip after every match because it became a bit of a stigma.\n\n\"Eventually it filtered to England and every time he had a bad game it became an open nerve.\"\n\nListen to the full episode on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Igor Thiago has reflected on his childhood watching Manchester United, which is where his love for football was first established.\n\nThe Brentford talisman chatted with TNT Sports ahead of his side’s clash with league leaders Arsenal last night.\n\nAfter being asked whether he’d always dreamed of being a professional player, he responded: “No, I didn’t even like it that much. But my brother started talking to me and made me watch the Premier League every weekend, especially Manchester United.\n\n“And then I started paying closer attention to United. From there it grew on me with feelings of love and affection. Then, I wanted to become a player too”.\n\n(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nWhile a striker addition isn’t United’s priority heading into the summer window, it’s certainly an admission that’ll have sparked the interest of INEOS chiefs.\n\nThiago is enjoying a tremendous campaign leading the Bees’ frontline – in a season in which they were widely anticipated to struggle in the absence of Thomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.\n\nHowever, they, as much as Keith Andreews might want to play down the prospect, are well in the mix for a European finish, and Thiago has been crucial to that.\n\nThe 24-year-old has netted a remarkable 17 goals in 26 matches, ranking him second-placed behind Erling Haaland in the Golden Boot race.\n\nHe has outscored costly summer signings such as Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike, both of whom are on 10 goals each, as well as Antoine Semenyo (13 goals), who moved from Bournemouth to Manchester City last month.\n\n(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nIn fact, United fans might recall that Thiago was on the scoresheet twice earlier this term when Brentford hosted the Reds at the Gtech Community Stadium back in September.\n\nHaving been injured for his team’s visit in 2024/2025, the Brazilian will experience Old Trafford for the first time in April, when United will be looking to avenge their 3-1 defeat, this time with Michael Carrick in the dugout.\n\nIn-form Premier League talisman says watching Man Utd with ‘love and affection’ made him want to be a player\n\nOwen fires warning to Man Utd that it’s going to be ‘nigh on impossible’ to replace star who could leave in summer\n\nMail: United ‘expected to make offer’ for £180k-a-week star with agreement now looking ‘increasingly likely’",

    "fullText": "CBS Sports sends scary warning to Ohio State, Ryan Day as pressure mounts ahead of 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough the Ohio State Buckeyes failed to repeat as national champions this past season, they are part of a select group of three consecutive Big Ten teams to win it all.\n\nWhether this year will continue the conference's trend, the Buckeyes are going to attempt to remain in that mix for a league and national title under coach Ryan Day.\n\nSome analysts, including CBS Sports' Cody Nagel, aren't fond of the Buckeyes' national title hopes entering this fall as he assessed 25 teams in a way-too-early Top 25 network.\n\nNagel ranked the Buckeyes at No. 1 despite him predicting that they will lose at least three games for the first time in 15 seasons.\n\n\"Ohio State has been a perennial national championship contender for most of the 21st century and expects to be in the title hunt again in 2026,\" Nagel wrote. \"But the Buckeyes face more hurdles than usual with one of the nation's toughest schedules, including five opponents from [Brandon] Marcello's way-too-early top 25. Ohio State hasn't lost more than two games since 2011. If there was ever a year for that streak to end, this is it.\"\n\nMORE: Kirk Herbstreit shares true feelings about Michigan's Bryce Underwood entering 2026 season\n\nFurther along in Nagel's preview, he notes that the Michigan Wolverines will regain momentum in \"The Game\" rivalry this November. Therefore, it would give the Wolverines their first head-to-head win against Ohio State since 2024. To make matters worse for the Buckeyes, their Nov. 7 opponent (Oregon Ducks) are a potential national title pick. Therefore, another loss there seems more likely than not.\n\nShould the Buckeyes miss the postseason, it would further validate the fact that the pressure Day faces from the Buckeyes' fanbase is real, raw and unapologetic.\n\nIf Nagel is proven correct, the next year in Columbus is going to be extremely interesting.\n\nMORE: Patriots coach Mike Vrabel shares harsh reality after losing Super Bowl 60 to Seahawks\n\nIllinois 2026 football schedule\n\nMichigan 2026 football schedule\n\nOhio State 2026 football schedule",

    "title": "THEN AND NOW: What 10 former Olympic stadiums look like today",
    "description": "Some Olympic venues are abandoned after the Games, but the main stadiums often get a second life as general sports arenas or concert venues.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Olympic opening ceremony was a 3 ½-hour extravaganza that mainly took place at Milan's San Siro Stadium.\n\nWith a capacity of over 75,000, it's the largest stadium in Italy and one of the largest stadiums across Europe. It's also the home of soccer teams AC Milan and Inter Milan.\n\nItaly is lucky that San Siro was large enough for the opening ceremony. Many countries have to spend millions constructing a stadium specifically for the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nBut what happens to them after the Games? Some are renovated and turned into sporting arenas. Others are left somewhat abandoned, as the host city often doesn't need the thousands of seats. Or they're destroyed entirely — in Lake Placid, New York, the stadium used for the opening ceremony was demolished soon after the 1980 Games.\n\nHere's what Olympic stadiums looked like at their peak, and how they've changed since the torch was extinguished.\n\nThe Olympiastadion was built for the 1936 Summer Games. A different stadium was used when Berlin hosted the Winter Games earlier that year.\n\nAfter Germany was reunified in 1990, it wasn't clear what Berliners would do with the stadium.\n\nEventually, it was renovated and reopened in 2004. It's now the biggest stadium in Germany, has hosted the 2006 FIFA Men's World Cup and the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, and has been the home stadium for Hertha BSC since 1963.\n\nMost recently, the 2024 UEFA Euro final was held at the Olympiastadion.\n\nHowever, some of the other venues from the Berlin Olympics are abandoned, including the swimming hall and Olympic Village.\n\nThe Beijing National Stadium, or the \"Bird's Nest,\" was built inside Beijing's Olympic Green complex specifically for the 2008 Summer Games.\n\nThe National Stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies again in 2022 after a 14-year hiatus, according to the Olympics.\n\nIn the time since the 2008 Olympics, though, the National Stadium has hosted a handful of sporting events, such as car racing, and concerts, but not many. But the venue costs $10 million a year to maintain, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) reported, so the city charges admission for tours.\n\nThe National Stadium's first big event was the 1958 Asian Games. It remained a popular site for sporting events until it closed in 2014, and it even remained unscathed during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, The Associated Press reported at the time.\n\nIt cost over $1 billion to construct the new stadium, CNN reported. It's now used by the national soccer and rugby teams.\n\nThe stadium has been nicknamed the \"big O\" by locals for its distinct shape ... or the \"big owe\" for how much it cost the city at the time.\n\nMontreal finally paid off its debts three decades after the Games wrapped, CFR reported.\n\nThe fields for equestrian events were already there, but the stands for the 30,000 spectators that day were constructed specifically for the Games and later removed, according to the Olympic Studies Centre.\n\nYou can learn more about visiting here.\n\nThe 1984 Winter Olympics were held in Sarajevo, one of the biggest cities in Yugoslavia, a country that would break up and splinter into multiple countries only a few years later, in 1991.\n\nAfter Yugoslavia broke up, Sarajevo became the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was subsequently bombed and under siege for almost four years, destroying the original Zetra Ice Hall.\n\nThe Juan Antonio Samaranch Olympic Hall was rebuilt in 1999 with the help of a donation from the International Olympic Committee.\n\nOther sites used in the Games have since been left to the elements.\n\nThe Atlanta Games, unfortunately, will always be remembered for the infamous bombing on July 27.\n\nBut after the Olympics, the stadium remained a huge presence in the city. It was shortly turned into Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves from 1997 to 2016.\n\nAfter the Braves departed, Georgia State University acquired the stadium and redesigned it for their football team, the Panthers, who have called Center Parc home since 2017.\n\nThe stadium was originally designed and built in the '80s so Athens could host the 1982 European Championships in Athletics, but it received a major renovation for the 2004 Games, including a new roof, according to the Olympics' website.\n\nWhile some other Olympic venues have seemingly remained untouched since the 2004 Games, the site of the opening and closing ceremonies is quite busy.\n\nHowever, in October 2023, there were concerns that the roof had become unsafe, Reuters reported, and the stadium was closed until May 2024. Just a few weeks later, Coldplay played two shows in the newly restored stadium.\n\nFisht Stadium was specifically built for the 2014 Winter Olympics. It was built as an enclosed facility.\n\nThis renovation was in preparation of Russia hosting the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and then the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The capacity of the venue can now be changed from 45,000 to 25,000 depending on its use, according to its engineering consultants Buro Happold.\n\nAdditionally, Russian soccer team PFC Sochi plays at Fisht.\n\nSoccer and track-and-field events were also held in Maracanã Stadium, which was originally built in 1950 to host the FIFA World Cup, according to Britannica.\n\nThe stadium held the finals for the 2021 Copa América — an international competition between men's soccer teams in South America — in July 2021. The Copa América finals were also played in Maracanã in 2019.",

    "description": "Andrei Arlovski furthered his combat sports legacy by defeating Ben Rothwell to win the BKFC heavyweight title.",
    "fullText": "Andrei Arlovski still has Ben Rothwell's number and has added another championship to his storied resume.\n\nIn the main event of BKFC: KnuckleMania 6, former UFC champ Arlovski met incoming BKFC heavyweight champ for the third time in combat sports – the first time in bareknuckle boxing. Arlovski won the first two fights in MMA and has now won the third in a different sport. The official result was a TKO stoppage due to cuts at 1:14 of Round 3.\n\nRothwell appeared more hesitant than ever before in the BKFC ring, and Arlovski took full advantage. Arlovski brought the fight to Rothwell, shoving him hard into the rigid ropes and clipping him with a few clean punches in Round 1.\n\nArlovski was quicker to the punch in Round 2 as well, opening up a nasty cut. In the closing seconds, Arlovski charged forward with a brutal combination, sending Rothwell reeling into the ropes. He didn't go down, but was clearly hurt from the accurate right hands.\n\nBefore the start of the third round, the referee had the doctor check on Rothwell, but the action continued. Rothwell struggled to deal with Arlovski's speed and accuracy. The fight was paused with less than a minute to go in the round so the doctor could take another look at the gashes on Rothwell's face – and that's where it would end.\n\nAndrei Arlovski makes it 3-0 in combat sports vs. Ben Rothwell, this time to claim the BKFC heavyweight title at age 47. #KM6\n\n🎥 @bareknucklefc pic.twitter.com/R6Q39G9CG4\n\n— MMA Junkie (@MMAJunkie) February 8, 2026\n\nThe pair first met in MMA at Affliction 1 in July 2008. Arlovski won that meeting by TKO in the third round. The rematch took place at UFC on ESPN 4 over a decade later. Once again, Arlovski got his hand raised, that time by unanimous decision.\n\nArlovski, 47, has not lost in competition since exiting the UFC in 2024. Since, he's won four total fights by stoppage; two in BKFC, one in Dirty Boxing Championship, and an exhibition boxing bout under the Misfits Boxing banner.\n\nRothwell, 44, ripped through the competition in BKFC after his UFC exit. He claimed the heavyweight title in his fourth fight by stopping Mick Terrill in just 36 seconds last January. However, his fantastic run came to a halt at the knuckles of a familiar foe.\n\nAndrei Arlovski def.

    "description": "In this Saturday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about why being a sports fan is sometimes better in moderation.",
    "fullText": "Being the ultimate sports fan doesn't come with a warning label, but maybe it should. Cheering on your favorite team can cause severe mood swings, violent outbursts, and even, at times, tightness in your chest. It's why I'm a fair-weather fan.\n\nThere's a backstory: I used to have a team. As a Baltimore native, when the Ravens came to our city in 1996, I was all in. After buying tons of black and purple, winning two Super Bowls, and then white knuckling through the lackluster seasons that followed, I decided to set a boundary for my own sanity.\n\nFor me, and the bold, ambiguous fans like me, being a fair-weather fan isn't about disloyalty; it's a form of self-care. It's choosing which stressors I'm letting get to me — and football was no longer one of them.\n\nGloria Chan Packer, who helps ambitious professionals manage stress and burnout in the workplace, writes in an essay for BI that \"we can't eradicate stress entirely,\" but advises that we should aim \"to establish a healthier and more sustainable relationship with your stress.\"\n\nSo yes, I've decided to protect my peace while still respecting the game and showing up when it matters most. It won't be this Sunday when the Seattle Seahawks face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX, but guess who's not stressed about that? Me.",

    "fullText": "Border Patrol really isn’t welcome anywhere!\n\nU.S. Border Patrol may be all about kicking people out of the country, but Commander Gregory Bovino just got the same treatment at a bar in Las Vegas.\n\nJust days after President Donald Trump pulled Bovino out of Minnesota when he started facing backlash for overseeing the administration’s aggressive mass deportation agenda that led to the fatal shooting of Americans Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the hands of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Bovino found out there was another place he wasn’t welcome: a Sin City bar.\n\nBovino was spotted drinking wine at a sports bar on the Las Vegas Strip Bottled Blonde, but he was quickly removed out of concern for the safety of the other bar patrons.\n\n“Upon becoming aware of the individual’s presence, the patron was asked to leave the premises and was escorted out by staff in accordance with venue policy to maintain a safe and orderly environment for all patrons,” the venue told the Daily Beast.\n\nBottled Blonde didn’t elaborate except to explain that, as a private business that “does not engage in political activity or affiliations,” they reserve “the right to refuse service to any patron at its discretion.”\n\nIt’s unclear why Bovino was seen in the Las Vegas bar three days after he was removed from his role as Border Patrol “commander at large” and transferred back to his old position in California, but he was caught on video and in still photos drinking with a group of younger men.\n\nAfter being kicked out of Bottled Blonde he was seen walking down the Strip with those same men. The photos and videos triggered a backlash online, where people were angry that he was enjoying a night out after leading the violent immigration sweep that caused the extrajudicial shooting of two American citizens.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: Border Patrol boss embarrassingly kicked out of a Las Vegas bar to protect patrons\n\nLGBTQ+ officials denounce ICE killing of Minneapolis woman, demand investigation\n\nBorder Patrol chief Greg Bovino and some of his masked agents will leave Minneapolis\n\nJustice Department employee charged & fired after throwing Subway sandwich at federal law enforcement officer",

    "description": "Nearly every Bruin on the roster got involved in the 40 point win Wednesday night.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - There was a Big Ten mismatch on Wednesday in Pauley Pavilion when No. 2 UCLA (22-1, 12-0) hosted Rutgers (9-14, 1-11) and came out the other end with an 86-46 victory to remain undefeated in conference play.\n\nA matchup between the top and bottom teams in the Big Ten was expected to end in Bruin domination and by the end of the first quarter, where UCLA went on a 17-0 run at one point and finished the quarter ahead 26-6, the game looked pretty much over.\n\nThat comfort meant that UCLA head coach Cori Close had some freedom to experiment with different rotations and utilize players like freshman forward Sienna Betts, freshman guard Lena Bilic and redshirt-sophomore forward Amanda Muse much earlier in the game than they'd appear normally.\n\nMuse played 20 minutes, her second-most minutes this season, while Bilic played 20 minutes herself and Betts played close to 24 minutes while scoring 11 points, the same amount her older sister senior center Lauren Betts scored in the game.\n\n\"I'm sure she'll [Sienna Betts] rub that in quite a bit,\" Close said.\n\nThe benefit of rotations that are uncommon to the team is that it gives them an opportunity to try out combinations with each other they otherwise wouldn't have a chance to. It also means that the starters have a chance to rest their bodies in a game where the stakes are much lower and the end result is all but guaranteed.\n\n\"We mixed up our rotations a little bit. It's a long year. We want to protect our bodies a little bit,\" senior guard Kiki Rice said. \"It's also a great opportunity to play with other people. To work on actions together and how we play with each other and we need to be able to play with different lineups because there's going to be times where that's going to happen throughout the year.\"\n\nJordan Teller - The Sporting Tribune\n\nKiki Rice #1 of the UCLA Bruins drives towards the basket during an NCAA basketball game against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, Wednesday February 4, 2026 in Los Angeles, Calif.\n\nWednesday's game was extra special because it fell on National Girls and Women in Sports Day. To celebrate UCLA involved several young women in the game production, with squeaky voices calling out over the loudspeaker to introduce players or announce a made basket.\n\nFor the players, it's another reminder of the privilege they have to make an impact as the next generation of role models for young women athletes.\n\n\"It's super special that we can do that and have the little girls be out there learning new skills... It's just really cool to see that and what's super cool about our program... there's lots of families here and there's little kids that look up to us. It's super cool because they are familiar faces to us so we do recognize the people that come to our games and we really appreciate it. Just super cool that we can do this game and lift women up,\" senior forward Gabriela Jaquez said.\n\nFor Close, a day like Wednesday's game reminds her of the role models in women's sports that she was looking for growing up but couldn't always find.\n\nIt also reminded her of all the programs and opportunities that exist now, and that UCLA is a part of, to give women more positions in the sports world as athletes, coaches, trainers, hosts and broadcasters.\n\n\"I wish I had women to look up to at that age that I could go and see,\" Close said. \"I am such a hoop head and I would watch as much basketball as my mom would let me, but there were no options to watch women and girls as I was growing up. It was all men's basketball.... What a privilege when you can combine trying to master your craft and compete at the highest levels and inspire somebody else and impact a heart. How lucky are we?\"",

    "fullText": "International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry says it must \"be better\" on climate change after receiving a petition signed by more than 21,000 people who want to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports.\n\nThe petition - delivered on Wednesday and with athletes among the signatories - comes as Italy's Eni, one of the world's seven biggest oil companies, is a 'premium partner' of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIt follows reports that the number of countries which could reliably host a Winter Olympics will hugely reduce in the future because of climate change.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether she is disappointed by the Games having high-carbon sponsors, Coventry said: \"It's really nice athletes have a platform to speak up.\n\n\"The petition, I know they met with our team today and we are having conversations in order to be better, and for our stakeholders to be better. But that takes time.\"\n\nChristophe Dubi, the IOC executive director for the Olympic Games, added: \"We make a point to receive those petitions, and we have to recognise climate is a challenge for all of us.\n\n\"What we have to do as an organisation is to be at the forefront of sustainability, and our principles are very clear.\"\n\nOne area the IOC is aiming to make the Olympics more sustainable is having Games take place over a wider area with more pre-existing facilities, and Coventry said Milan-Cortina is an acid test for whether this is a viable future.\n\nMilan-Cortina takes place in three hubs spread across northern Italy - in Milan, Cortina and Livigno - with only two newly built sporting facilities: the Santagiulia ice hockey arena and Cortina Sliding Centre.\n\nThe next two Winter Olympics - French Alps 2030 and Utah 2034 - will also have sports spread more widely, while the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane is will have venues across Queensland.\n\nThis has caused issues however, with Brisbane organisers saying, external they will go beyond the originally stated budget of $4.9bn (£3.6bn).\n\n\"We are really experiencing a spread out Games here for the first time - we are going to learn a lot,\" Coventry said.\n\n\"We have taken this decision for sustainability reasons, climate and not having to have new venues. We are seeing there is an impact on National Olympic Committees because of the spreadness [sic], also for broadcast and media, making it harder to get around.\n\n\"What is really cool is that you get to see iconic venues in beautiful places - but now we have to weigh this up, the balance between a spread games for sustainability reasons but not shifting complexity and sustainability to different areas.\"\n\nWhile the action got underway on Wednesday with the start of the curling events, the 2026 Winter Olympics will officially start with the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nCoventry said she hoped all nations would be treated with respect by spectators, including the USA team amid criticism from Italian authorities about the presence of ICE agents in Milan.\n\n\"I hope the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as a chance to be respectful,\" she said.\n\n\"For me, when we went to the Olympic village that is the best reminder of how the Games should be. I hope the opening ceremony will do that.\"\n\nFear and Hall named 2026 Team GB flagbearers\n\nRussian athletes linked to pro-war activity\n\nQuiz: Name every sport at the 2026 Winter Olympics",

    "description": "The \"Today\" anchor stepped away from Milano Cortina coverage as her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, remains missing",
    "fullText": "Sports commentator and former tennis player Mary Carillo will replace Savannah Guthrie as co-host of the NBC’s Opening Ceremony for the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games after the “Today” host pulled out, following her mother’s disappearance.\n\nGuthrie had been originally scheduled to host the Opening Ceremony with Terry Gannon, who will remain on. Ahmed Fareed will now host “Olympic Late Night” from Feb. 7 to 9, replacing Craig Melvin.\n\nMelvin will remain stateside rather than traveling to Milan for the Games.\n\n“Our hearts go out to Savannah and the entire Guthrie family. They continue to have our full support,” said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. “We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talented commentators who will step in and fill these roles.”\n\n“Mary is one of the most experienced Olympic commentators ever and a master storyteller,” she added. “She and Terry will lead the American audience through one of the world’s greatest global moments. With his skill and versatility, Ahmed has proven time and again he can step into any hosting role, and we’re thrilled he’s available to handle our late night coverage before heading to Los Angeles for NBA All-Star Weekend.”\n\nThe Milan Games will be Carillo’s 17th Olympics that she has covered — she was already scheduled to be a correspondent in Milan. Of Italian descent herself, the commentator has a personal connection with the host city. This year will be her 14th Olympic assignment with NBC.\n\nAs previously announced, Shaun White will join the Opening Ceremony commentators in the booth during the Parade of Athletes. Following her Opening Ceremony duties, Carillo will cover the Games as a SportsDesk reporter.\n\nGuthrie’s 84-year-old mother Nancy has been missing since late Saturday night. The case has escalated from a missing-person to a suspected abduction with authorities saying they found signs of forced entry in her Arizona home.\n\nLive coverage of the Opening Ceremony begins Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, with primetime coverage scheduled for 8 p.m. ET/PT on both NBC and Peacock.\n\nThe post NBC Sports Taps Mary Carillo to Fill In for Savannah Guthrie at Winter Olympics appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Michigan football went 9-4 in 2025 despite having a lot going on behind the scenes. The hope with new head coach Kyle Whittingham leading the charge is that the Wolverines won't just rebound, they'll thrive.\n\nBut given the schedule, it will be something of an uphill battle for the maize and blue.\n\nMichigan will play Ohio State, Oregon, Indiana, Penn State, Iowa, Oklahoma, and more in 2026, with the first two matchups mentioned being on the road. Even so, CBS Sports' Brad Crawford (who usually isn't effusive in praise for the maize and blue) is optimistic about Whittingham's first year in Ann Arbor.\n\nIn Crawford's too-early CFP 12-team projection, the Wolverines make the cut as the 10-seed, meaning that they would be 12th overall and face Texas Tech, with the winner of the game set to face Indiana.\n\nAn early season win over Oklahoma win come in clutch for first-year Michigan coach Kyle Whittingham, who has more assets with the Wolverines than he ever possessed at Utah. Whittingham often gets the most out of his roster, and with enhanced resources, he should quickly push Michigan back in the playoff conversation. In this scenario as the 10-seed, the Wolverines would become the playoff's second-ever three-loss team, but first to not reach their league title game to get in. The losses? Oregon, Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nHaving three losses in the 2026 season wouldn't be a surprise given the perceived strength of schedule. However, making it into the 12-team invitational without losing that third game in the Big Ten Championship Game would be a bit of a surprise, given that no one has made it in with a 9-3 record before.\n\nCould that equate to a successful season? Making the playoff but with losses to Ohio State, Oregon, and Indiana? Perhaps, but most likely not in Michigan fans' eyes. Even if the schedule is more daunting this year than last.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: CBS Sports projects Michigan football to 2026 College Football Playoff",

    "description": "The Washington Post has laid off one-third of its staff, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage.",
    "fullText": "A sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nThe Washington Post laid off one-third of its staff Wednesday, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a widespread purge that represented a brutal blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.\n\nThe Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, called the move painful but necessary to put the outlet on stronger footing and weather changes in technology and user habits. “We can’t be everything to everyone,” Murray said in a note to staff members.\n\nHe outlined the changes in a companywide online meeting, and staff members then began getting emails with one of two subject lines — telling them their role was or was not eliminated.\n\nRumors of layoffs had circulated for weeks, ever since word leaked that sports reporters who had expected to travel to Italy for the Winter Olympics would not be going. But when official word came down, the size and scale of the cuts were shocking, affecting virtually every department in the newsroom.\n\n“It’s just devastating news for anyone who cares about journalism in America and, in fact, the world,” said Margaret Sullivan, a Columbia University journalism professor and former media columnist at the Post and The New York Times. “The Washington Post has been so important in so many ways, in news coverage, sports and cultural coverage.”\n\nMartin Baron, the Post’s first editor under its current owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, condemned his former boss and called what has happened at the newspaper “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nAs of midday, the Post did not have any news of the changes on its website.\n\nBezos, who has been silent in recent weeks amid pleas from Post journalists to step in and prevent the cutbacks, had no immediate comment Wednesday.\n\nThe newspaper has been bleeding subscribers in part due to decisions made by Bezos, including pulling back from an endorsement of Kamala Harris, a Democrat, during the 2024 presidential election against Donald Trump, a Republican, and directing a more conservative turn on liberal opinion pages.\n\nA private company, the Post does not reveal how many subscribers it has, but it is believed to be roughly 2 million. The Post would also not say how many people it has on staff, making it impossible to estimate how many people were laid off Wednesday. The Post also did not outline its finances.\n\nThe Post’s troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products such as games and its Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade.\n\nEliminating the sports section puts an end to a department that has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, among them John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser. The Times has also largely ended its sports section, but it has replaced the coverage by buying The Athletic and incorporating its work into the Times website.\n\nThe Post’s Book World, a destination for book reviews, literary news and author interviews, has been a dedicated section in its Sunday paper.\n\nA half-century ago, the Post’s coverage of Watergate, led by intrepid reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, entered the history books. The Style section under longtime Executive Editor Ben Bradlee hosted some of the country’s best feature writing.\n\nWord of specific cuts drifted out during the day, as when Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker announced on X that she had been laid off, along with all of the newspaper’s Middle East correspondents and editors. “Hard to understand the logic,” she wrote.\n\nIn the immediate future, Murray said, the Post would concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness and impact, and resonate with readers, including politics, national affairs and security. Even during its recent troubles, the Post has been notably aggressive in coverage of Trump’s changes to the federal workforce.\n\nThe company’s structure is rooted in a different era, when the Post was a dominant print product, Murray said in his note to staff members. In areas such as video, the outlet hasn’t kept up with consumer habits, he said.\n\n“Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”\n\nWhile there are business areas that need to be addressed, Baron pointed a finger of blame at Bezos — for a “gutless” order to kill a presidential endorsement and for remaking an editorial page that stands out only for “moral infirmity” and “sickening” efforts to curry favor with Trump.\n\n“Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,” Baron wrote. “In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.”\n\nBaron said he was grateful for Bezos’ support when he was editor, noting that the Amazon founder came under brutal pressure from Trump during the president’s first term.\n\n“He spoke forcefully and eloquently of a free press and The Post’s mission, demonstrating his commitment in concrete terms,” Baron wrote. “He often declared that The Post’s success would be among the proudest achievements of his life. I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.”\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

    "fullText": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is conducting widespread layoffs.\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray wrote in a Wednesday memo that the \"substantial newsroom reductions\" would impact \"nearly all news departments.\"\n\nThe layoffs impacted hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nMurray told staff on a Wednesday morning call that the cuts were part of a strategic reset, according to an audio recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMurray said the changes included \"closing the sports department in its current form.\"\n\n\"We plan to retain several reporters to join features and cover sports as a cultural and societal phenomenon, as well as several folks to staff the print sports section,\" he added.\n\nMurray said impacted teams included audio and journalists who cover books, the DC metro area, and foreign affairs.\n\n\"A few products will be discontinued — among the most significant, we will be closing the book section and will be suspending the Post Reports podcast,\" Murray said.\n\nThe publication's San Francisco bureau was also heavily hit, one Post insider said.\n\nIn his memo, Murray wrote that for the immediate future, the paper would concentrate on \"areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers.\"\n\n\"These layoffs are not inevitable,\" the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. \"A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach, and its future.\"\n\nFormer executive editor Martin Baron wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"there were acute business problems that had to be addressed\" during \"a period of head-spinning change in media consumption.\" Baron added that the \"Post's challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nDonald Graham, the Post's former publisher, wrote in a Facebook post that he was saddened by the loss of \"so many excellent reporters and editors\" and that he would \"have to learn a new way to read the paper,\" as he had \"started with the sports page since the late 1940's.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nThis new round of layoffs follows a series of recent shake-ups at the 148-year-old newspaper.\n\nEarly last year, the company told its opinions desk that columnists should refocus their coverage to two pillars: \"personal liberties\" and \"free markets.\"\n\nIn March, the Post reorganized its newsroom in a push to shift away from \"commodity news.\" It then offered buy-outs to staffers in May.\n\nLast year's personnel shifts arrived shortly after the Washington Post came under fire from some readers for its decision to skip endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, breaking from a 35-year tradition. Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump.\n\nOver 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were \"deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave.\"\n\nThe Post's staff reductions arrive at a challenging moment for the media industry.\n\nSome brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.\n\nThe New York Times, long seen as the 800-pound gorilla in the newspaper business, saw its shares sink about 14% on Monday as investors fretted about increased costs.",

Its consistency was reflected in the latest edition of the USA TODAY Coaches Poll, released Tuesday.\n\nThe Tigers remained at No. 5 in this week's poll. The top stayed the same with UConn, UCLA, South Carolina and Texas going one through four. Vanderbilt, after suffering its second-consecutive loss this week, dropped two spots to No. 8. Louisville and Michigan each climbed to No. 6 and 7, respectively.\n\nLSU returned to the PMAC on January 26 for three straight home games last week. It defeated Florida, Arkansas and Alabama each by over 20 points. Sunday against Alabama, LSU exploded in the second half for a 40-point win. The Crimson Tide fell to No. 23 in the coaches poll.\n\nThis week, LSU has another chance to climb the rankings and boost its chances at getting a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament bracketology. It travels to Austin to take on the Longhorns on Thursday, then to Auburn for a Sunday afternoon tipoff.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Where LSU women's basketball ranks in latest USA TODAY Coaches Poll",

    "fullText": "It’s pretty safe the say that the general sentiment around college football is that Notre Dame will make its return to the College Football Playoff in 2026.\n\nThe Irish were left out of this year’s 12-team event, as many believed that they deserved to be in. After what we saw unfold, it was pretty safe to say that Notre Dame should have been in, as it very well could have won it all.\n\nAs for this coming season, CBS Sports Brad Crawford released his way-too-early CFP bracket projection, and he’s got the Irish as the No. 2 seed. Miami, one of Notre Dame’s opponents, takes the to spot, so it seems like whoever loses that game finds their footing once again. Texas and Indiana round out his top-4.\n\nIn this scenario, the Irish would take on the winner of the 7 vs. 10 matchup as Crawford has Texas A&M and Oregon battling it out in the first round. Overall, it’s an interesting take, with four Big Ten and SEC teams, Texas Tech making it again and Memphis as the Group of 5 team.\n\nIt will be interesting to come back to this when the regular season is over, but it doesn’t seem like the worst field considering which teams are participating.\n\nWay-Too-Early College Football Playoff projection for the 2026 season, via @BCrawford247 👀\n\nWhat would you change?\n\n🔗 https://t.co/QnshRG871e pic.twitter.com/Dlc3J28sIW\n\n— CBS Sports College Football 🏈 (@CBSSportsCFB) February 3, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: What seed is Notre Dame in CBS Sports early 2026 CFP projection?",

    "fullText": "Winning the Super Bowl and hoisting the Lombardi trophy as confetti rains down has always been considered the stuff of dreams. It’s one of the most coveted championships in all of sports. It’s what children emulate when they organize backyard football games, and Tom Brady is doing his best to remind both Sam Darnold and Drake Maye of that ahead of their respective debuts at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGiven the fact that he’s both won and lost more Super Bowls than most players will ever sniff throughout their careers, it’s safe to say that there’s no better person to humor before venturing into the gridiron’s grandest game than the former New England Patriot. Although it’s just as important to remember that, while confidence and encouragement are key, the hardcold truth is that not everybody can be Brady.\n\n“The reality is that the best team, in a one-game series, doesn’t always win,”he noted to Colin Cowherd during his most recent interview. “In football, you really only have one chance to get it right. That’s the challenge. You could have an off day,” he added.\n\nIn highlighting the Los Angeles Rams’ botched punt against the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, Brady suggested that it doesn’t take much to give your opponent “all of the momentum,” and that those moments happen incredibly fast. “That’s how finicky the game is,” he suggested.\n\nWhile it may be a bit funny to hear the most successful signal caller in NFL history refer to his former profession as being “finicky,” it’s also a testament to just how much the Super Bowl means to players. In other words, those being the ones of Brady’s former Super Bowl rival, the star tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce, “Losing a Super Bowl will never make you want to go back and win one.”\n\nIf anything, knowing that you only get one shot at cementing your name in the analogs of American sporting culture makes things that much harder. “That’s why I always think basketball, baseball, a seven-game series, does identify the best team, because you get seven chances to get it right,” Brady suggests.\n\nEven if this eventually proves to be neither Darnold nor Maye’s last Super Bowl appearance, both men are well aware that they won’t get a second opportunity at winning their championship debut. Throw in the fact that both teams feature a top-five defense from a points allowed perspective, and it’s safe to say that both of these quarterbacks know that their margin for error on Sunday will be painfully slim.\n\nThen again, that’s yet another one of the many things that make the Super Bowl the biggest game of the year, and we simply wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nThe post “You Could Have an Off Day”: Tom Brady Warns Sam Darnold and Drake Maye Ahead of Super Bowl 2015 Rematch appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Disney's next CEO often sports a similar look to that of longtime leader Bob Iger. Experts weigh in on the pros and cons of dressing like your boss.",
    "fullText": "Disney's new CEO is sending a wink with his wardrobe, whether he means to or not.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, who takes the helm of the Mouse House next month, has drawn attention for dressing much like his soon-to-be predecessor, Bob Iger. Both men regularly don sweaters over collared shirts and have a penchant for jackets paired with white dress shirts. At a celebration for Disney's 70th Anniversary last year, the pair sported button-downs and dark slacks.\n\nWhile D'Amaro may just have a natural affinity for the same kind of attire that Iger sports, leadership experts say the similar look projects continuity to Disney's stakeholders. The familiarity may resonate at Disney, where Iger has led the company on and off for nearly two decades — though it raises a question of whether the rest of us should dress like the leaders we hope to one day succeed.\n\n\"You want to avoid looking like a carbon copy of the person,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International in Chicago. \"But there are elements that you want to keep if you can.\"\n\nThose elements should be modest, akin to how Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn't deviate too far from the black turtleneck and jeans his predecessor Steve Jobs regularly wore, suggested Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\nA few years ago, she said a client of hers from a Fortune 200 retailer went overboard by wearing the same distinctive jewelry as his boss. When she met with his peers for feedback on his performance, several described him as a copycat.\n\n\"It really hurt him,\" said Eggers. \"We coached him, and he eventually lost his jewelry.\"\n\nStill, there can be benefits to mimicking a higher-up's sense of fashion when done subtly, added Akubuiro. \"People have a tendency to like people who are more like them,\" he said.\n\nJust keep in mind the fuzzy warm feeling may be temporary.\n\n\"It's effective as a bridge maybe, but not as a destination,\" said Eggers. \"Eventually, leadership credibility has to stand on its own.\"\n\nD'Amaro, who started at Disney in 1998 as a Disneyland business planner, faces a challenging road ahead no matter what he wears. He's tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nA post shared by Robert Iger (@robertiger)\n\nWhile D'Amaro's fashion style is similar to Iger's, Akubuiro said the business-casual look has also made sense for his role as a park executive.\n\n\"This is kind of the uniform of someone walking around the parks, and so it gives him a very accessible feel,\" Akubuiro said. \"When you're making a change, that accessibility is something that actually brings people in and gives them some confidence.\"",

    "fullText": "Florida football finds itself right in the middle of the SEC pack in CBS Sports' power rankings for the 2026 season, a reflection of both uncertainty and quiet optimism surrounding the program entering Jon Sumrall's first year with the Orange and Blue.\n\nCBS Sports' Brandon Marcello slotted the Gators 10th in the SEC, placing Florida firmly in the conference's crowded middle tier following a chaotic transfer portal cycle and a full coaching reset.\n\nSumrall inherited a group that needed significant turnover, and that context matters. Florida lost key contributors to the portal, rebuilt large portions of its depth chart and is still sorting out several position battles heading into spring practice.\n\nCBS Sports pointed specifically to quarterback uncertainty, noting the compeition between Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo and Tramell Jones Jr. as a storyline that could ultimately swing Florida's ceiling one way or another.\n\nIt's simply too early to make definitive judgements. Spring practices, sumeer development and continued roster movement will reshape the conference landscape before fall arrives. For Florida, that means the current ranking by CBS Sports should be viewed more as a snapshot than a verdict.\n\nFor now, the Gators are positioned as a team with something to prove.\n\nHere is everything Marcello wrote about Florida and why he ranked them at No. 10 in the SEC power rankings.\n\n\"Jon Sumrall arrives with a major rebuild on his hands in Gainesville. The former Tulane and Troy coach has never won less than 10 games in a single season, but make sure to temper your expectations for Year 1 in the SEC. He had to overhaul a roster depleted by transfers, and we don't quite know what to expect with Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo battling Tramell Jones Jr. at quarterback.\n\n\"Still, Sumrall has the magic touch and knows how to build rosters. He also hired a top-tier staff. The Gators could be in the top half of the SEC this season, but we need to see more this spring and summer to better gauge the Gators.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.",

    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "fullText": "Florida basketball's brutal home loss to the Auburn Tigers two weeks ago is well in the rearview mirror after a pair of superlative performances — a 47-point beatdown of the South Carolina Gamecocks on the road, followed by an epic victory in the O'Dome against the Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nAs a result of the Gators' plus-70 margin of victory over the last two games, Todd Golden finds his team up five spots in the latest USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll at No. 16. That puts the Orange and Blue between the No. 15 Vanderbilt Commodores and No. 17 Virginia Cavaliers.\n\nThat kick in the pants at home appears to have given Florida a wake-up call, and now the Gators have put the rest of the SEC — and college basketball — on notice with nine games remaining on the regular-season schedule.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference once again has only four member schools in this week's poll, with Vanderbilt hanging onto their league-high No. 15 ranking. Florida is right behind them at No. 16, followed by the Arkansas Razorbacks, who fell five spots to No. 21, and the Texas A&M Aggies, who entered the rankings for the first time this season at No. 25.\n\nAlabama fell out of the top 25, and now follows the de facto No. 27 Tennessee Volunteers (55 votes) with 15 votes. The Kentucky Wildcats continue to cling to their nine votes while the Georgia Bulldogs earned a pair this week.\n\nIowa 52; Tennessee 50; UCF 15; Alabama 15; Villanova 13; Kentucky 9; North Carolina State 4; Utah State 2; Georgia 2; Saint Mary's 1\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida basketball USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll ranking up after win",

    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans are coming off a dismal season that led to a massive overhaul of the organization. Gone is Brian Callahan, and most of his staff, and the Titans have a new head coach in Robert Saleh. But that doesn’t mean that Tennessee didn't have some highlights.\n\nOne of those that marked Callahan’s last victory as Titans’ head coach, and much like the majority of his tenure, it was a fluke. Incredibly, this victory over the Arizona Cardinals was so improbable that it landed on CBS Sports' top 25 stories of the 2025 season.\n\n22. Tennessee Titans at Arizona Cardinals, Week 5: Cardinals, Jonathan Gannon, Kyler Murray, Emari Demercado collapse\n\nThis one requires us to go back quite a bit, but the butterfly effect is startling. The Cardinals, up 21-3 at home against the then-winless Tennessee Titans, suffered one of the wildest and most inexcusable collapses in recent memory en route to a 22-21 defeat.\n\nAlthough the Cardinals basically handed the Titans the victory, Tennessee looked competitive in the fourth quarter and made the plays necessary for the win, with Cam Ward making some big-time throws to give them a chance.\n\nThe Titans would go on to fire Callahan a couple of weeks later, with the win being the highlight of his final weeks in Nashville. But for that week, the football gods looked down on the Titans and gave them a memorable moment in the 2025 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Titans improbable victory over Cardinals one of the top stories in 2025",
