    "description": "Colorado coach Deion Sanders to fine players for tardiness, attendance issues as college sports gets more professional",
    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

    "fullText": "Arsenal icon Patrick Vieira believes one Manchester United player is reaping the rewards of Michael Carrick’s tactics more than Bryan Mbeumo, especially after Sunday’s result.\n\nDuring his punditry duties for Sky Sports, Patrick Vieira watched as his former club Arsenal fell to Manchester United in a 3-2 defeat at the Emirates.\n\nMichael Carrick has now overseen impressive back-to-back Premier League wins over top-two sides Arsenal and Manchester City since taking charge.\n\nBryan Mbeumo was once again trusted to lead the line for Man Utd under Carrick’s system, and the summer signing from Brentford delivered another strong performance.\n\nMbeumo pulled Man Utd level before half-time when he capitalised on a costly mistake from Arsenal’s Martin Zubimendi.\n\nAfter Bryan Mbeumo pulled Manchester United level, Patrick Dorgu put them in front early in the second half. It was a well-taken goal that gave United some momentum coming out of the break.\n\nMikel Merino equalised for Arsenal late on, just when it looked like United might hold on. But even with time running out, there was still more to come.\n\nMatheus Cunha replaced Bryan Mbeumo in the second half and the 26-year-old Brazilian forward scored the winner for Man Utd in Sunday evening’s result.\n\nFollowing Manchester United’s 2-0 victory against Manchester City at Old Trafford last week, Vieira believed that Carrick and his colleagues had finally “answered” the significant questions surrounding them.\n\n“There were still big questions after City,” he told Sky Sports.\n\n“They answered them so well. They are back on track. There’s still a long way to go. Wins against City and Arsenal is so good for confidence.”\n\nPlaying in the No 10 role behind Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes featured there for the second straight Premier League match under interim boss Carrick.\n\nThe Manchester United captain’s performances against both City and Arsenal have drawn high praise from Vieira.\n\n“The system allowed them to express themselves,” the Frenchman stated.\n\n“I think the 4-2-3-1 allowed Fernandes to be a little bit more free on the pitch, create situations, score goals.\n\n“You can see the pictures – the smile is back on the face of the United players.”\n\nUnder Ruben Amorim last season, Fernandes often played deeper before the manager was dismissed earlier this month. The coaching change has clearly had an impact on his play.",

    "description": "The Sky Sports pundit praised Carrick’s influence on the club after wins over Man City and Arsenal but believes they need a ‘bigger’ manager",
    "fullText": "Roy Keane shut down suggestions that Michael Carrick be given the role of Manchester United manager on a permanent basis following the 3-2 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nCarrick took over from the sacked Ruben Amorim on a contract until the end of the current suggestion with the executives at Old Trafford currently searching for a new manager to hire permanently.\n\nIn his first game in charge Carrick orchestrated a 2-0 derby win over Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City before masterminding United’s victory over the league leaders.\n\nKeane was quick to praise the impact Carrick and his staff have had on the players and results but revealed that his preference for the next manager be someone “bigger and better” than Carrick.\n\nAsked for his opinion on the result and the performance from Manchester United, Keane echoed the words of Harry Maguire who was awarded the player of the match trophy.\n\n“Harry makes a good point, they’ve got a lot of their players back now, it’s a full group, they’ve got full weeks together and there’s no other distractions,” Keane replied. “They can focus on the league form and they’re producing.\n\n“But, as we know you win one, two games for Man Utd, fantastic. Particularly to beat City, and come to Arsenal. I felt United would get a result today, I was thinking a draw but I felt United would turn up.\n\n“They’ve got enough quality players and they’ve got momentum into their season and all of a sudden you’re thinking it’s a great chance for top four. If they play with that confidence and belief, you give the manager and the staff credit.”\n\nKeane was then pressed by fellow Sky Sports pundit Micah Richards on whether Manchester United should hire Carrick on a permanent basis already given he has led the team to wins against first and second in the league.\n\n“The job? You’re being silly now,” Keane responded. “No, he’s had two great performances but anybody can win two games. It’s what he does until the end of the season.\n\n“Even if they do get into fourth I still wouldn’t be convinced he’s the man for the job. Absolutely not. I still think they need a bigger and better manager.\n\n“But, he’s got the opportunity, what a chance it is for him and, do you know what, he’s taking it so fair play to him.”",

    "fullText": "Random thoughts while waiting on the release of the new Super Bowl commercials.\n\nThe sight of Cubs star Pete-Crow Armstrong and Bears star Caleb Williams hanging out together at the Blackhawks and Bulls games was a nice way to portray Chicago as the biggest small town in America. Los Angeles has its Hollywood culture and New York is the media center of the world, but nowhere are the local sports stars as big a deal as they are in Chicago.\n\nIt’s nothing new, of course. Chicago’s stars have always supported each other. When the Bears played at Wrigley Field, Bobby Hull was a season ticket holder, and Billy Williams used to get tickets for games from Bears receiver Dick Gordon.\n\nThe budding bromance of Crow-Armstrong and Williams should last a long time, or at least until the Cubs and Bears sign them to massive deals.\n\nOne of the primary requisites of the job of commissioner of a major sports league should be the ability to project strength. But the commissioners of the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball are all weaklings, as evidenced by a report from The Athletic that Roger Goodell, Adam Silver, Gary Bettman and Rob Manfred will meet with President Donald Trump to help promote America 250, a celebration of the country’s 250th birthday.\n\nWhile Trump’s jackboots instill fear in Minneapolis, Chicago and other American cities, and he embarrasses the country on the international stage, these four pretend leaders will be posing for photo-ops in the Oval Office and pretending all is right with the country. None of them has the courage to speak out against what’s happening in America.\n\nLucky for them, they’re only beholden to the billionaire owners of their league’s teams, not the average fans who support their respective sports.\n\nESPN’s Pat McAfee has always appealed to the lowest common denominator, so it’s no surprise the clueless commentator is taking on unidentified media members who point out his lame frat boy act, calling them “fat … lazy nerds” on his TV show.\n\nMcAfee also tweeted that sports journalists “hate what sports are for people (happiness). They hate what sports are for society (unifier) … they’re political journalists by nature who’ve preyed on sports because they saw it as an easier path to ‘make it.’ Their days are numbered … my show being broadcasted on ESPN 10 hours a week with ZERO creative say from any ‘journalism school’ puppets is living proof of that.”\n\nActually, the audience of McAfee’s show is relatively tiny, or else it would be in a better time slot than in the early afternoon, when everyone else is working. He’s already wearing thin on college football fans, and sooner or later the ratings will slide and ESPN will pull the plug and send him off to UFC analysis, where he belongs.\n\nIllinois is having another stellar season, thanks to a deep team led by freshman Keaton Wagler. The 11th-ranked Illini are 17-3 after Saturday’s 88-82 road win over Purdue and in contention for the Big Ten title.\n\nAnd when the Illini are winning, coach Brad Underwood is at his most ornery, as when he recently sparred with an Illinois reporter who praised Tomislav Ivišić for a good game against Northwestern despite what he called an “up-and-down season.”\n\n“You guys say he’s been up and down,” Underwood shot back. “I just say his role changed. You guys create more damn narratives that are full of (bleep). That’s what he does. That’s why he’s been on draft boards. He’s big and can shoot the cover off of it. … No one has ever doubted Tommy.”\n\nLove him or hate him, Underwood is never afraid to speak his mind.\n\nKudos to White Sox general manager Chris Getz for immediately spending the $20 million he saved by dumping Luis Robert Jr.’s contract, signing reliever Seranthony Dominguez to a two-year, $20 million deal. Now maybe he can move Grant Taylor into the rotation where he belongs.\n\nMike Berman was a professional and a hardworking sports reporter willing to work long hours at NBC-5. A Glenbrook North alumnus who grew up rooting for Chicago teams, he did his job for 10 years without calling attention to himself. His work spoke for itself.\n\nBerman, who was let go by the station last week, deserved a better fate. Hopefully he winds up on another local station that will appreciate his work ethic.\n\nTerry Boers, who died Friday at age 75, was remembered by most as a radio host and an original member of The Score. But he was also a great newspaperman. Boers and I competed on the Illini basketball beat for one season back in the early 1990s, when he was still at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was as good a beat writer as there was and handed me my lunch on many occasions.\n\nBoers eventually found his way to radio, where he could put his brash personality into his job. He became a legend at WSCR-AM 670, along with the other originals such as Mike North, Tom Shaer and Dan McNeil. There will never be another quite like Boers, which is why his death has brought so many tributes from colleagues.\n\nCubs manager Craig Counsell is a Green Bay Packers fan, but he assured the media he is not a Bears hater. “Look, I grew up a Packers fan for sure,” he said before the Cubs Convention. “The Bears have struggled for a while, and so when a team hasn’t done well for a whole and starts to do well, you see what it does to a city. You feel it. That part of me knows what it’s doing for the city, and you root for that a little bit.”\n\nAsked who would be booed \n\nIt’s a tough call, but my guess is Counsell is still Public Enemy No. 1 among cheeseheads.",

    "fullText": "This Monday, January 26 at 9 p.m., Girona returns to Montilivi to host Getafe in the match of the 21st round of the EA Sports League. The team has started the second half of the season in the best possible way with an away victory against Espanyol. This result means that Michel's team has achieved three consecutive victories - the best streak of the season - against Espanyol, Osasuna, and Mallorca. This places them in eleventh place with 24 points. At the moment, the standings are very tight with three other teams having the same points: Elche, Real Sociedad, and Athletic Club; two with 22, Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, and three with 21, Sevilla, Mallorca, and Getafe.\n\nGetafe CF, on the other hand, arrives at Montilivi with a trajectory marked by rather negative results in the last league matches. In the most recent games, the Madrid team recorded a 1-0 loss to Valencia and a 2-1 defeat against Real Sociedad, and drew 1-1 with Rayo Vallecano. Additionally, before the Christmas break, Getafe suffered a 4-0 loss to Betis and a 3-1 defeat against Burgos in the Copa del Rey.\n\nAs for the head-to-head history between Girona and Getafe, the record shows a closely contested rivalry in recent history. In the first meeting of this same season, Getafe won 2-1 at the Coliseum, a match in which the Madrid team took the lead with goals from Mario Martín and Borja Mayoral, while Cristhian Stuani reduced the deficit from the penalty spot at the end of the game. Looking at a broader perspective, in a total of 17 historical encounters between both teams, Girona has achieved 6 victories, Getafe 7, and 4 matches have ended in a draw, reflecting the competitive balance that these matches usually display.",

    "description": "Christen Press, who was honored by the U.S. women's soccer team before its win over Paraguay, is determined to be advocate for women's sports in retirement.",
    "fullText": "Christen Press welcomed herself to the U.S. women’s soccer team by scoring twice in her debut in the first game of 2013. The team said goodbye Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park, honoring Press before its first game of 2026, a 6-0 win over Paraguay.\n\nIn between, Press played 154 more times for the U.S., winning two World Cups, an Olympic bronze medal and scoring 62 more goals, retiring as the ninth-leading scorer in team history.\n\nBut those are just numbers because as good as Press was, she wants to be remembered for the legacy she left behind, for the barriers she broke, for the inspiration she continues to provide for players who followed her to the national team.\n\n“Well, it's sort of the point, right?” she said ahead of Saturday’s farewell ceremony before a crowd of 19,397. “I feel really lucky that I had the opportunity to play long enough to overlap with some of these young players and be able to see the growth of the game, how far it's come, and be able to see what the next generation of player feels like.\n\n“It's different, and it's going to take different things for people to have success.”\n\nTalk about following in Press’ footsteps: The first score Saturday came from Reilyn Turner of the Portland Thorns, like Press a Southern California native who scored her first U.S. goal on a left-footed shot in the first half of her international debut. The second goal, less than two minutes into the second half, came from Kansas City’s Ally Sentnor.\n\nAnd that opened the floodgates, with the U.S. getting an own goal from Paraguay’s Fiorella Martínez followed by scores from Trinity Rodman — who was celebrating the three-year contract, reported to be worth a record $6 million, she signed Thursday with the Washington Spirit — a second goal from Sentnor and another from Emma Sears.\n\nPress scored her final international goal in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Ten months later, playing with Angel City FC in the NWSL, she shredded the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee, an injury that required four surgeries and nearly 25 months to repair. She never played another game for the national team and made just three more starts for Angel City before announcing her retirement last October.\n\nThat, Press said, will continue to provide her with a link to the game.\n\n“We're so integrated into the women's sports ecosystem, through podcasts, through merchandise and through the women's soccer community,” she said. “I have spent a lot of time looking at the business of women's sports and how we need to reimagine it.\n\n“In a dream world, I'd be able to continue to influence the ecosystem as a businessperson.”\n\nPress got her start in soccer in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, about a dozen miles from where her career officially ended Saturday in Carson. As a preschooler she played with older kids in co-ed league because one team was short a girl.\n\n“I didn’t touch the ball once,” she remembered years later. “I picked daisies and waved to my mom.”\n\nShe went on to win two CIF Southern Section titles at the Chadwick School and a Hermann Trophy at Stanford before starting a club career that took her to eight teams in three countries. With the national team she went to three Olympics, won World Cups and played a key role in the landmark lawsuit against U.S. Soccer that ended with the women earning equal pay with the men’s team.\n\nIt’s a résumé that already is challenging the next generation of national team players.\n\n“I admired her for a long time,” said Seattle Reign winger Maddie Dahlien, 21, who made her national team debut Saturday. “She made a name for herself a little later. You never know when your opportunity will be. So make the most of it when it comes.”\n\nU.S. coach Emma Hayes never had a chance to work directly with Press, though she wanted to bring her overseas to Chelsea FC when Hayes managed there and Press was looking to move to the Women’s Super League.\n\n“I’ve always admired her and thought what a fantastic football player she is. Very different to what was a more traditional American forward at the time,” Hayes said. “What she’s achieved, as well-traveled as she is, what an honor to be coaching on the day she gets celebrated in her hometown.”\n\nFor Press, it was a celebration that marked the transition from one stage of life to the next. And, she acknowledged, there are a few things she’s going to miss.\n\n“I am so sad that I don't play soccer anymore,” she said. “I miss training. I miss being on a team, being around young people. I miss being outside every day. I miss the grass. I miss the discipline and ritual that football brings to my life.\"\n\n“I like to talk about all the things that I miss, because I think ‘I'm retired. It's easy now.’ No. I had the best job in the world. And it's an irreplaceable job.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Heading into Week 18, Aaron Rodgers was nothing if not pragmatically optimistic.\n\nThe days on his Pittsburgh Steelers contract were dwindling. The future of head coach Mike Tomlin was a subject of public debate. And the franchise he quarterbacked was cornered into a de facto playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens in the regular-season finale. Any direction you looked, there was something finite hanging in the balance. But in what registered in at least a mild surprise, Rodgers spoke to reporters like a man who didn’t see a definitive near-term conclusion to his football career … so long as he didn’t want it to end.\n\n“I’m thinking about this week, but obviously I’m 42 years old and I’m on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,” Rodgers told reporters. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. So that’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play.”\n\nRodgers gave a slight shrug and chuckled.\n\n“Not a lot of options, but — there will be options I would think. Maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.”\n\n[Get more Steelers news: Pittsburgh team feed]\n\nHe then punctuated the thought by opening the door to a return.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed this experience,” Rodgers said. “Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It’s really what I was hoping for, for this experience. It’s been even better than I was hoping.”\n\nA few days later, the Steelers would beat the Ravens and make the postseason, before getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Texans. All in all, it culminated in a season that felt like Rodgers, Tomlin and the Steelers squeezed about as much as they could have expected.\n\nThen Tomlin left, via a resignation that felt like a surprise to ownership. And maybe to Rodgers, too, given that any thought of his return seemed so strongly bound to whether Tomlin would continue to guide Pittsburgh. When that changed, logical speculation — and that’s all we’ve been left with thus far on the Rodgers front — was that a new head coach would mean a new quarterback. Whatever options were on the table for Rodgers, they appeared to have shrunk by one.\n\nThen came Saturday, when the Steelers went against their historical hiring template and locked in 62-year-old Mike McCarthy, a candidate who can fit more than one forward-looking ideology.  On one hand, McCarthy is a seasoned veteran coach who can come in and try to energize an aging roster that is still very much built to win now. On the other, he could be tasked with developing the franchise’s next young quarterback. Without a bridge starter currently on the roster, it will be difficult for McCarthy to achieve both of those responsibilities.\n\nUnless, of course, McCarthy can find a veteran who knows his system and can come in and help with both tasks. Maybe a quarterback who McCarthy previously helped develop into a star? One who already has spent a season in the Pittsburgh quarterback room with 24-year-old Will Howard, who showed promise in limited reps during his rookie preseason and has the support of the front office as a prospect worth some continued development?\n\nThat sounds like a fit for Rodgers. And perhaps the renewal of a 2026 option that appeared to be extinguished when Tomlin resigned.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean McCarthy was hired with any kind of specificity of luring Rodgers back for another season. While some of Pittsburgh’s players gave Rodgers high marks as a teammate in their exit interviews, the work to find the next long-term starting option is clearly near the top of the priorities for ownership and general manager Omar Khan. And that wouldn’t have changed even if Tomlin had remained. One way or another, 2026 was always going to be geared toward either figuring out if the next young quarterback is already on the roster (in the form of Howard) or if the Steelers liked any of their draft, trade or free-agency options.\n\nMcCarthy’s arrival won’t change that mindset. The real factors of change at the quarterback spot will instead be pressed against the options Pittsburgh has available. If McCarthy is a head coach Rodgers will play for, it gives Pittsburgh at least one more year of a bridge starter to either weigh Howard as a prospect, or find someone in the 2026 draft who is worthy of being selected and then groomed. And there’s certainly some deep-value intrigue over the coming draft class of quarterbacks.\n\nThe Steelers won’t have a shot at Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and their first-round draft pick at No. 21 overall might not be high enough to land Alabama’s Ty Simpson, either. But after that tandem, there are some interesting quarterbacks who could be seen as worthwhile projects with upside. Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss (if he can’t force another year of NCAA eligibility) will draw a significant amount of study from NFL teams. As will a quartet of others who were previously considered to be first-round picks — and potentially very high first-round picks — until hitting stumbles in their final seasons: LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier, Miami’s Carson Beck, Penn State’s Drew Allar and Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, among others.\n\nFor now — and we’ve yet to go through the draft sifting process, so take this with a grain of salt — only Mendoza cuts the figure as a Day 1 rookie starter. Simpson could round into that kind of prospect, or one who has a shot to earn a starting job during his rookie season. The rest? Most personnel opinions appear to be placing them on a developmental track to possibly get a shot with a year or more of work from further down the depth chart.\n\nIf any of those players are in the Steelers’ future, McCarthy’s hiring makes a lot of sense given his history with helping quarterbacks grow into starters. And it also makes sense that Rodgers would be a fit, so long as he continues to be in a year-to-year contract mindset and actually wants to play for McCarthy again.\n\nIn that latter vein, both McCarthy and Rodgers have said very nice things about each other in the least few years, each gaining the perspective of working with new people and in new places. Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real, with both having come to terms with their own mistakes and frustrations that ultimately played a part in McCarthy getting fired late in the 2018 season after coaching the Green Bay Packers for nearly 13 years.\n\nBut burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing. Even if Rodgers wants to play again and McCarthy would like to have him in 2026, the veteran quarterback doesn’t know what the rest of the league landscape will look like in even a few weeks. There’s a chance the Los Angeles Rams win a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford decides to pull a John Elway and retire. Should that happen, the Rams will still be very much in the middle of a Super Bowl window and not have an obvious starting quarterback on the roster. And then there is the Minnesota Vikings, a team Rodgers was very interested in playing for last offseason. They are looking for someone to come in and compete with J.J. McCarthy for the starting job next season.\n\nAdd the Steelers to that mix, and you have exactly what Rodgers was talking about when he focused his gaze on 2026. Not a lot of options — but certainly some interesting ones.",

    "fullText": "Most people dream about winning the lottery. But for one 29-year-old man, his $15 million windfall came with a side of guilt, entitlement, and a family-sized headache.\n\nIn a post shared on Reddit, the anonymous winner explained that his financial plans were anything but reckless. He didn't run off to buy yachts or sports cars. Instead, he wanted to take business and finance courses, manage his newfound wealth responsibly, and eventually give back through charitable work. What he didn't plan for? His parents demanding a full quarter of the winnings—roughly $3.75 million—because, in their words, \"we raised you.\"\n\nThe Reddit post made clear this wasn't a close-knit family cashing in on shared joy. The man described his upbringing as \"distant white middle class,\" saying he had moved an hour away from his \"oppressive mother and distant father.\" While he described his sisters as \"nice people,\" he noted they don't have a real relationship.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nDespite this, when he won the lottery, he offered to pay off his parents' mortgages and provide them a cash gift. But when they learned the full scope of his winnings, that wasn't enough. \"Once they found the total amount,\" he wrote, \"they expected a quarter of it.\"\n\nThe conversation escalated. When his mother said, \"we raised you,\" he couldn't help but remember the five-year stretch—from age 15 to 20—when his parents completely cut off contact. Though he didn't directly confront them with that memory, he now questions whether he owes them anything at all.\n\nMany Redditors agreed that his parents were being unreasonable, entitled, and opportunistic. One user summed it up sharply: \"You don't owe them s**t.\"\n\nAnother commenter laid out a detailed legal and financial checklist: hire a lawyer and financial adviser, draw up a will and living trust, create powers of attorney for medical and financial decisions, and install a home security system. They ended their comment with a blunt mantra: \"People get crazy with money.\"\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd they weren't alone in that warning. Multiple users emphasized the need for protection—not just from scammers or strangers, but from family members who might be willing to sue, manipulate, or guilt-trip to access the prize. One even suggested freezing the winnings in a trust for a year just to let emotions cool and see how people behave.\n\nStill, not everyone was entirely unsympathetic to the family's reaction. From a devil's advocate angle, some might say parents who supported their child for nearly two decades—through diapers, meals, and housing—might feel hurt or excluded if they're only offered a slice instead of a share.\n\nBut that perspective hinges on a relationship that doesn't seem to exist in this case. The man's post didn't reveal abuse or violence, but the emotional neglect—especially during his formative years—cast a long shadow. Five years of silence from his parents left a mark. And now, with millions on the table, old wounds are reopening under the glare of entitlement.\n\n\"I feel like I've been as generous as I can be,\" he said, noting he never explicitly said so to his parents, but assumed it would be clear. What stung most was that their reaction didn't reflect pride or joy—it reeked of resentment that they didn't get more.\n\nSee Also: Private-Market Real Estate Without the Crowdfunding Risk—Direct Access to Institutional-Grade Deals Managed by a $12B+ Real Estate Firm\n\nThe original poster has since emailed his parents to reiterate his offer and state firmly that nothing more would be coming. Whether they respond, and how, remains to be seen.\n\nIn a later update, he stressed that this situation wasn't about seeking revenge or proving a point. It was about maintaining boundaries and protecting the life he's worked hard to rebuild. \"I am not looking to be told how to spend my money or how to be vindictive,\" he wrote. \"They do love me, even if it's in their own sad way.\"\n\nAnd maybe that's the hardest part. Winning the lottery can change your bank account—but it doesn't fix broken relationships. The man walked away with $15 million, but in doing so, he discovered that family ties can fray under the weight of expectation. And in his case, no amount of money seems likely to stitch them back together.\n\nRead Next: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times give their thoughts on the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the Rams, the LeBron James-Jeanie Buss rift and college football.",
    "fullText": "The fury over the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker makes me wonder who's shouting the loudest?\n\nCould it be desperate, unfortunate fans whose beloved teams are owned by inheritors, nepo families, or private equity bros who celebrate their glamorous assets?\n\nSo how about a new metric in the sports page to accompany the ranking of teams and players: ownership. Not simply by wealth, but wisdom, brains and commitment. And for fun let's call it the McCourt-Moreno Index.\n\nIt's time we hold the Marge Schotts of pro sports accountable for the franchises they mismanage.\n\nThere are some alarming implications to Bill Plaschke's \"If it blows up baseball, so be it.\" Perhaps he means that MLB should be reduced to a burning garbage heap with three teams atop — Yankees, Cubs and Dodgers — because they were the only ones who went into the TV business and peddled their services for billions in the three largest TV markets.\n\nMaybe he yearns to transform MLB into the NHL of my childhood, with six teams. That was OK if you lived in a shallow arc extending between New York and Chicago — not so good for everyone else.\n\n\"So be it,\" as Plaschke would say, but I can guarantee I won't be the only one who isn't watching anymore.\n\nNaturally Dodger fans are all excited about the signing of the $60-million-a-year All-Star right fielder, Kyle Tucker. But we're not going to be happy when Dodger Stadium becomes the first MLB ballpark with a two-drink minimum.\n\nAs everyone seems to be raving about the Dodgers' acquisition of Kyle Tucker, I note the following: There is another player who was recently signed by the Yankees for less money and less signing bonus than Tucker who had higher numbers last year in average, home runs and WAR. He also plays more positions. Hadn’t the Dodgers heard of Cody Bellinger? Bellinger as a Yankee will never feel right to me.\n\nAsk a Major League Baseball owner like Arte Moreno, who sells out his ballpark whenever the Dodgers come to Anaheim, and sees Angel broadcast ratings surge whenever his team plays the Dodgers, if he thinks the Dodgers are ruining the game.\n\nThe Rams won the battle of which team gets to lose to Seattle.\n\nThe NFL needs to clarify exactly what does and doesn’t constitute pass interference. There is no consistency as to how it's called with each official seeming to have their own definition of what constitutes pass interference. It has gotten to the point where it’s worse than major league umpires and their own definition of the strike zone. NFL, you need to clean this up because these are major calls that are ruining games.\n\nBill Plaschke finally wrote a column about the Lakers with which I agree. LeBron James is the past, Austin Reaves is the future, and $50 million will help the Lakers rebuild. Yes, it's really as simple as that.\n\nWith the Lakers defense costing them multiple games, reminiscent of the coach Mike (no D)'Antoni days, the only real interesting Laker news last week were the alleged Jeanie Buss comments about the King. They sounded like they were lines taken from a scene in \"The Godfather\" .... \"What have I done to make you treat me so disrespectfully.\" My opinion is that it \"was not personal and strictly business.\"\n\nWhen asked after each game how he'd celebrate another victory, Indiana's Curt Cignetti would say, \"With a beer.\" After guiding his team to an undefeated season, and then winning the national championship, I doubt the Hoosiers' coach will ever have to buy another beer again.\n\nLincoln Riley is officially on the clock. In two years Curt Cignetti took a woebegone college team, with nary a five-star player, to an undefeated national championship. Cignetti has proven that, even in the NIL era, coaching matters. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick …\n\nCurt Cignetti and Indiana football playing in and winning the national championship was a modern-day version of the movie \"Hoosiers\" and would have made coach Norman Dale (actor Gene Hackman) proud. Now the question is, can new UCLA football coach Bob Chesney and his 40-plus transfers be the second coming of Indiana? Only time will tell.\n\nKings president Luc Robitaille appears to be happy with the Kings' status quo that appears to be getting one point every game in an overtime or shootout loss. Should we start referring to him as Luc RobitailleandthenloseinOT?\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

    "title": "Brenna Huckaby, Paralympic snowboarder, relies on the power of sports",
    "description": "Brenna Huckaby lost her leg to cancer when she was 14 years old. Then she discovered snowboarding, and it opened her entire world.",
    "fullText": "If we could ski down a mountain, then when we got home, we were able to conquer everyday life things.\n\nAt the time, Brenna Huckaby didn’t fully realize what the idea behind that rehabilitative trip to Utah would mean to her.\n\nShe had been diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, and lost her right leg at 14. To that point, conquering everyday things had meant wearing her prosthetic leg consistently.\n\nBut the trip, sponsored by her hospital, which sent Huckaby and kids who lost mobility from osteosarcoma to the slopes, opened up her world.\n\n\"I fell in love with it immediately,\" she tells USA TODAY Sports. \"It was the first sport that I had found just not only (an) incredible challenge, but also this fear and this knowing that I could do it, and I wanted to do it.\"\n\nHuckaby, now 30, became an American Paralympic snowboarder who will once again be competing at the Olympics, this time at Milano Cortina. She won gold and bronze at Beijing in 2022.\n\nHave you ever taken the time to think about what sports, especially your favorite sport, means to you?\n\nWe caught up with Huckaby, who would also become the first Paralympian to appear in the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated and is now a sports mom, about how sports can give us the confidence to take on life’s biggest challenges.\n\nIf we set a goal, and we push ourselves, we can reap their benefits at no matter what level we achieve.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nHuckaby spoke to USA TODAY Sports on behalf of Hershey’s for the “It’s Your Happy Place” campaign. Athletes partnered with the chocolate and candy company to showcase how happiness is not only found in winning, but sweet, everyday moments.\n\nThose moments, she says, \"don’t have to be big and explosive.\" The small ones can matter the most.\n\n\"I feel like that's been my main focus the last eight years,\" she says. \"How can I enjoy the process, enjoy the journey, not just the destination? And I feel like that's way easier said than done. I've learned that taking time to pause, to slow down, to be in the moment, that's how I have found happiness, presence, gratitude, all the things that make me feel good. It’s been in those tiny moments throughout the day.\"\n\nAs young athletes (and parents), if we take the time to reflect on what we’re doing as we race to our different sports events, we can improve our awareness. Huckaby’s sport, she says, is mostly mental, and that part of her game helps her push through the excruciatingly physical parts.\n\n\"I feel like I don't make progress and grow unless I am mentally present and in a good headspace to learn,\" she says.  \"I would say the sooner that you can take moments to reflect on – whether it's your training in the gym or a practice that you had – what was hard, what was good, what do you want to improve on, and what did it teach you about yourself? When you can start practicing that, it makes the things that you've learned so much easier.\n\n\"Then you're able to see those moments of growth and (be) like, 'Wow, like I'm so glad that I learned that. And I'm so glad I pushed through that because I've got this thing that I'm dealing with at home and I know that I can take the mindsets from sport and apply it here.'\"\n\nReflection has helped Huckaby realize she performs her best when she’s calm. She works with a sports psychologist to help her channel her strength to high stakes situations.\n\nDo you remember the instance where you either discovered your favorite sport or realized it was the one you love most?\n\nHuckaby, who has two older brothers (Jordan and Jeremy), loved to jump around as a little girl. Jeremy, her middle brother, and her parents were really into martial arts, which she tried. Her instructor pulled her parents (Jeff and Kristie) aside and told them, \"You need to put her in gymnastics.\"\n\n\"What I loved the most was learning how to do flips in the gym and that's what my martial arts teachers would just teach me because that was all I could stay focused for,\" she says. \"So my parents listened and also they were tired of me doing cartwheels in the house and stuff, and they thought it was a way to save their TV.\"\n\nHuckaby's cancer, which led to the amputation, ended her gymnastics career. But, Huckaby says, she thought about how she loved moving her body and chasing adrenaline.\n\n\"When snowboarding came to me, 'I was like, this is it,'\" Huckaby says.\n\nShe moved to Utah, about a year after the hospital-led trip with her mom, who worked as a nurse there. The rest of the family stayed at their home in Louisiana, and Kristie moved back home when her daughter graduated high school.\n\n\"It gave me opportunity to just heal from cancer through snowboarding,\" Huckaby says. \"Sports (is) such a great way to understand life in the way that it challenges you and the way that you intimately get to know who you are.\n\n\"You gain so much confidence in your body and what your body's capable of. So during cancer, I never really questioned that I could handle it. I put myself in extreme situations through gymnastics training that I knew that I could handle what was to come.\n\n\"I think now as I've been doing this at a professional level for so long, I've learned, 'How do I put that more into my everyday life so that I'm not just an athlete?'\"\n\nHuckaby says she doesn’t so much balance her life, but embraces what’s important to her through every season.\n\nWhen she’s home, she trains vigorously but finds family time every day with her husband, Tristan Klegg, and young school-aged daughters, Lilah and Sloan. Klegg, a former snowboard cross athlete, realizes he sometimes needs to be at home with the girls at times over being with his wife. But they interact daily.\n\n\"He takes care of our kids while I'm away and when I'm training and (is) such a big support, making sure that we win, right?\" she says. \"It's a team effort for sure.\n\n\"I'm in the gym in the offseason three to five days a week,\" she says, \"and I say three to five because we're human. It's life, you know? So the ideal, the perfect, is five. The reality is usually three, and during that period, you're going really hard. And so those off days are really important. And then between snowboard season and gym season, we have two weeks off. We are encouraged to have fun and move our body in ways that feel good, but it doesn't have to be intense. It's just, 'Take time off.'\n\n“And then I usually give myself a fall break. I know that it's good for my mental health. So usually as Halloween starts rolling around, I'm less intense and then I crank back up (in) November, and then most of December and then (the) holidays, I give myself permission to just chill. Because I know it's about to get serious after Christmas.\n\n\"It's (about) finding a rhythm, but I absolutely rest.\"\n\nLilah and Sloan, Huckaby’s daughters, like skateboarding, wakeboarding, wake surfing and other action sports near their home in Montana.\n\nLilah, her older daughter, has tried gymnastics and does aerial silks, which Huckaby describes as art-based body movements.\n\n\"We're active,\" she says. \"That's where we're trying to shine. I don't ever want them to think anything has just been given to me and easy. Of course, there are moments that it looks easy and it's because of all the decades of work that I've put in on my body and then my mind. And so things look like they come together naturally, but, I love the phrase, 'An overnight success was not built overnight.' It was built, you know, a decade before, just quietly working.\n\n\"Like yesterday, I did not want to go to the gym. It was my third day of two-a-days and I was just like, 'I don't want to go.' And they saw that, and I got up and I went.\"\n\nBut Huckaby also never wants her daughters to think that she’s fearless. She has been scared many times, whether it's during training, free riding or competing.\n\n“But I'm brave, and I do it anyway, and I do it scared, and I trust my training, and I trust myself, and I hope that they learn to do that for themselves,\" she says.\n\nHuckaby was horrified, she says, when Sports Illustrated approached her to pose for its 2018 swimsuit edition. She thought she wasn’t confident enough to put herself out in the world in that way.\n\n\"Then I just thought about my 14-year-old self who had just lost her leg and was bald at the time and just felt unbeautiful and unworthy, and I remembered that she deserved to be represented in a way that she wanted to, and to be seen as someone who could be beautiful and could be lovable. And so I wanted to give that to her, and I'm so proud of myself for doing that.\"\n\nIn a similar way, we sometimes have to put ourselves, or our kids, out there for our first big competition. It’s a risk, for sure, but then that rush of adrenaline can come, the one you only get from sports.\n\n\"Bet on yourself,\" Huckaby says, \"because you're worth investing in. If you want it, go for it. If you feel like you have what it takes and you love what you're doing, go out there and give yourself the time to do it and the opportunity to do it because that's what matters more than when you got into your sport. It’s never too late.\"\n\nWe don’t need to have it all figured out. We might just need more perspective on what we’re doing, and what we’re spending.\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "fullText": "There are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced\n\nDavid Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.\n\nCurrent commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver said then in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”\n\n“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”\n\nFor decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.\n\nYet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won the Premier League just about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.\n\nConcerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double as handy instruments to write off taxes for billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.\n\nLately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.\n\nThey can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.\n\nThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rules now tweaked to merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.\n\nMore tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)\n\nCertainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.\n\nAt least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.\n\nThat’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

His pursuit of the mineral-rich Arctic territory has caused growing tensions with European allies.\n\nDenmark could play in the World Cup - which will see 78 of the 104 matches staged in the US - if its team qualifies via play-offs.\n\nIn a statement, the chief executive of the Danish Football Association, Erik Brogger Rasmussen, told BBC Sport: \"We are, of course, aware of the current sensitive situation.\n\n\"Like many others, we are following it closely on an ongoing basis. Our focus right now is on winning the two matches in March and thereby qualifying for the World Cup.\"",

    "fullText": "Inter Milan vice-president Javier Zanetti delivered his verdict on the San Siro project and shared his hopes for the future.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports UK via FCInterNews, Zanetti shared his thoughts about the club’s intention to build a state-of-the-art stadium.\n\nAC Milan and Inter have embarked on their new stadium project after acquiring the land from the city.\n\nIndeed, a brand-new stadium forms a key pillar of Oaktree’s long-term vision for the Nerazzurri.\n\nTherefore, the clubs have earmarked substantial funds to finance this history-defining development.\n\nBoth teams are aiming to create a modern arena that will serve as a cornerstone for generations to come.\n\nMeanwhile, renowned British architect Norman Foster will be in charge of construction, with the new stadium expected to open in 2031.\n\nAs such, there’s a good probability that San Siro will be among the venues to host the UEFA Euro 2032.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – APRIL 23: General view outside the stadium prior to the coppa Italia Semi Final match between FC Internazionale and AC Milan at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza San Siro on April 23, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\n“The Meazza will always be a stadium that brings back memories. And it has brought many victories,” Javier Zanetti said.\n\n“Everything has changed,” he added. “I believe that a top club like Inter, known worldwide, needs a new, state-of-the-art stadium.\n\n“The important thing is that it’s always at San Siro. I hope we’ll be able to create special memories there as well.”\n\nFinally, Zanetti named his most memorable game in the Nerazzurri shirt.\n\n“My debut game,” he claimed. “I could never have imagined it would be the first of 858 matches.”\n\nZanetti spent his entire professional career in Europe at Inter. Indeed, he joined the club in 1995 and stayed here until 2014.\n\nUpon retirement, the Nerazzurri retired his No.4 jersey, paying tribute to one of the most iconic figures in club history.\n\nHowever, Zanetti couldn’t stay away from his beloved Inter, returning to the club in a different capacity shortly after hanging up his boots.",

    "description": "The 2025 season is hardly over. That's not stopping us from looking eight months ahead.",
    "fullText": "The 2025 season just barely ended, but that's not stopping us from looking eight months ahead.\n\nHere's our way-too-early top 25 for the 2026 college football season. A lot can and will change in the months before the season begins in late August. But here's our quick and undoubtedly wrong look at how the field could stack up.\n\nHow do the Cavaliers follow up the best season in school history? Tony Elliott signed QBs Beau Pribula (Missouri) and Eli Holstein (Pitt) to replace Chandler Morris along with a few key defenders from the transfer portal. Virginia should be near the top of the ACC again.\n\nQB Luke Altmyer is out of eligibility and Bret Bielema brought in former East Carolina QB Katin Houser to replace him. The addition of FIU WR Alex Perry could be significant too. He had 56 grabs for 840 yards in 2025. This is a team that’s won 19 games over the past two seasons and should again be safely bowl eligible.\n\nThe Huskies dodged a huge loss when Demond Williams Jr. decided he was going to stay for the 2026 season. Williams can enter the season as a sleeper Heisman candidate and is the reason why we have Washington ranked. If he had left, coach Jedd Fisch would have had a huge hole to fill at QB.\n\nIs it a make-or-break season for Shane Beamer? Yes, the Gamecocks had a rough schedule in 2025, but the defense took a step back and the offensive line was rough. SC added NC State OL Jacarrius Peak in the transfer portal and QB LaNorris Sellers is back along with edge rusher Dylan Stewart.\n\nDid Houston have the quietest 10-win season in 2025? QB Conner Weigman is back for a second season after he threw for over 2,700 yards and 25 TDs and the Cougars have added a very solid transfer class. The team’s top two signees are offensive linemen and former Tulane RB Makhi Hughes comes over from Oregon where he hopes to recapture the form he had with the Green Wave.\n\nWe’re already bullish on the quick turnaround James Franklin can engineer in Blacksburg. He’s brought over a host of transfers from Penn State, including QB Ethan Grunkemeyer and TE Luke Reynolds along with CB Jaquez White from Troy and edge rusher Javion Hilson from Missouri.\n\nCan Lincoln Kienholz have a breakout season with the Cardinals? After multiple seasons as a backup at Ohio State, Kienholz is now the favorite to start at QB. Coach Jeff Brohm kept RB Isaac Brown from entering the transfer portal and also added Vanderbilt WR Tre Richardson.\n\nAs many former Nittany Lions have gone to Virginia Tech, even more Iowa State players have followed Matt Campbell to State College. That includes QB Rocco Becht, RB Carson Hansen, CB Jeremiah Cooper and a bunch of others. Building a team out of Iowa State players isn’t flashy, but Campbell is the winningest coach in school history for a reason.\n\nThe Mustangs bring back QB Kevin Jennings and added former Cal RB Kendrick Raphael in the transfer portal. He rushed for 943 yards and 13 scores in 2025. The loss of offensive coordinator Casey Woods could hurt — he’s the new head coach at Missouri State — but Rhett Lashlee’s offense should be one of the best in the ACC once again.\n\nIt’s hard to see how Michigan could have done much better than getting Kyle Whittingham after it fired Sherrone Moore. Whittingham brings offensive coordinator Jason Beck with him from Utah and Bryce Underwood could have a breakout season under Beck. DE John Henry Daley and other players have followed Whittingham from Salt Lake City, too.\n\nThe Cougars lost defensive coordinator Jay Hill after Whittingham hired him at Michigan and replaced Hill with longtime assistant Kelly Poppinga. QB Bear Bachmeier should be even better in 2026 and getting leading rusher LJ Martin back for his senior year is a big boost.\n\nThe Trojans have the top-ranked recruiting class in the country heading into the 2026 season. How many of those players can make an immediate impact? Lincoln Riley’s offense will be very good once again. The onus is on the defense … again. The Trojans haven’t allowed fewer than 5.5 yards per play since it gave up 5.4 yards a play in 2018 under Clay Helton.\n\nWe’re betting on a full offseason of health for John Mateer. He’s back for another run at it with the Sooners and was fantastic before he suffered a broken bone in his throwing hand in Week 4 against Auburn. OU’s defense was good enough to win a national title in 2025, but the offense simply wasn’t in the second half of the season.\n\nWith Ty Simpson off to the NFL, it’s up to Austin Mack or Keelon Russell to start at QB for the Crimson Tide. Mack has more familiarity with Kalen DeBoer and Ryan Grubb’s offensive system. Russell is a former five-star recruit. The Tide also bring in No. 1 running back recruit Ezavier Crowell. Can he make Alabama’s run game work again?\n\nLet’s be clear: This ranking is betting on Trinidad Chambliss winning his legal fight to get a sixth year of eligibility from the NCAA. The Rebels are clear contenders to get back to the College Football Playoff if he’s back in Oxford. If he’s not, there are major questions at quarterback after Austin Simmons transferred to Missouri.\n\nJust like with Ole Miss, we’re doing a bit of quarterback projection here and assuming that Darian Mensah ends up a Hurricane. If he doesn’t, then adjust your expectations accordingly. A young secondary should get even better in 2026 and Malachi Toney will be a sleeper Heisman candidate.\n\nQB CJ Carr got better as the season went on in 2025 and could be one of the best quarterbacks in college football in 2026. The Irish made some late moves in the transfer portal, have the No. 2 high school recruiting class in the country and, most importantly, coach Marcus Freeman rebuffed NFL interest to stay in South Bend.\n\nThe Aggies bring back QB Marcel Reed, RB Le’Veon Moss and WR Mario Craver. They also have On3’s No. 3 transfer portal class as they’ve loaded up on defense. Five of the Aggies’ top six rated transfers are all on that side of the ball, including former Tennessee QB Rickey Gibson and former Northwestern edge rusher Anto Saka.\n\nRaiding the transfer portal worked really well for Texas Tech ahead of the 2025 season. Why not do it again and add a QB this time? Brendan Sorsby comes over from Cincinnati and Texas Tech is reloading up front again after the success that its defensive line had in 2025.\n\nLane Kiffin got his quarterback in former Arizona State signal-caller Sam Leavitt. He also added former five-star recruit Husan Longstreet from USC. LSU was one of the biggest underachievers in 2025. This is a roster that can make the College Football Playoff. And, given the way Kiffin left Ole Miss, anything less than making the CFP semifinals can be considered a disappointment.\n\nQB Gunner Stockton is set to come back after he finished in the top 10 of the Heisman voting. The Bulldogs need to replace Zachariah Branch and CJ Allen, but this is a team loaded with top-tier recruits. Even though Georgia has lost in the quarterfinals in each of the past two seasons, we’re not betting against Kirby Smart’s team anytime soon.\n\nQB Julian Sayin and WR Jeremiah Smith are back as the Buckeyes are now the chasers in the Big Ten once again. Losing Sonny Styles, Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs on defense is significant, but Matt Patricia’s unit was so, so good in 2025 that it’s hard to see them taking a huge step back in 2026.\n\nThe Hoosiers have become one of the best teams at navigating the transfer portal and they have the top class in the country in 2026 after winning the national championship this season. Former TCU QB Josh Hoover is in line to replace Fernando Mendoza and WR Nick Marsh is a stellar add from Michigan State. Don’t overlook the edge rushing depth that Curt Cignetti signed as well.\n\nGet ready for another offseason of Texas talk. Don’t say you haven’t been warned. The Longhorns have loaded up on offense for what could be QB Arch Manning’s final season. RBs Raleek Brown and Hollywood Smothers arrived via the transfer portal along with former Auburn WR Cam Coleman. Oh, the defense is coordinated by Will Muschamp again, too. How good can he make that unit?\n\nThe return of Dante Moore for the 2026 season isn’t the only reason the Ducks are in this spot. Yes, Oregon loses TE Kenyon Sadiq, S Dillon Thieneman and LB Bryce Boettcher, but Matayo Uiagalelei is back along the defensive line along with A’Mauri Washington and Bear Alexander. RB Jordon Davison should be better as a sophomore and Oregon added Minnesota S Koi Perich in the transfer portal too.",

    "fullText": "As ESPN readies to air the College Football Playoff National Championship game, the sports network is announcing plans for a documentary series on the coach who has won more national championships than anyone else – Nick Saban.\n\nThe six-part series titled Saban, from ESPN and Word + Pictures, is directed by Russell Dinallo and produced by Words + Pictures’ Connor Schell, Libby Geist, Aaron Cohen, and Alexa Conway along with Tom Rinaldi, with Gabe Honig serving as co-executive producer and showrunner. It will document the man who won seven college football national championships – one at LSU and six at the University of Alabama.\n\nCollege Football Playoff National Championship: How To Watch Indiana Vs.

There’s also a wealth of present-day interviews with Saban and his wife, the legendary Ms. Terry Saban, whose own influence and impact played a massive role in Nick’s success as a coach and leader.”\n\nSaban retired two years ago from Alabama and now serves as an ESPN analyst – as well as a pitchman for Aflac and Vrbo.\n\n“With my coaching days behind me, Ms. Terry and I have been doing a lot of reflection and realized we were ready to tell our story,” Nick Saban said. “The team at Words + Pictures has encouraged me to really look back not just at my time at Alabama, but every stop along the way – and not just reflect on what happened but consider the process which made it happen. I interacted with a lot of players and coaches along the way and I’m happy to see that so many of them have contributed to this docuseries. There’s a lot to tell, and I’m excited to share it all.”\n\nIn addition to his national titles, Saban’s football programs produced four Heisman Trophy winners and innumerable NFL stars. ESPN says the series will include “more than 30 hours of interviews with Saban, and more than 80 interviews with former players, assistant coaches, rivals, family, friends, and observers, the series offers a rare look at how he became the most successful and influential figure that the game of college football has ever known.”\n\n“There will never be another Nick Saban,” observed Connor Schell, CEO of Words + Pictures. “He’s a football genius, a singular leader, and a true icon who has done more than anyone to shape the modern game of college football and the culture around it. When you work with Coach Saban, you’re constantly reminded how every small detail matters and, in his case, that attention to detail and process has added up to an incredible journey and legacy. Working with Coach Saban and Ms. Terry has been a tremendous experience, and we can’t wait to share their story with the world.”\n\nESPN says the premiere date and full rollout plans for the series will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More",

    "fullText": "Manchester City have signed England defender Marc Guehi (25) from Crystal Palace in a deal worth an initial £20m, as reported by Sky Sports.\n\nThe 25-year-old has agreed a five-and-a-half-year contract at the Etihad Stadium, keeping him at City until 2031, with the deal also including a sell-on clause for Palace.\n\nCity moved for Guehi after suffering a number of injuries in defence. The centre-back was out of contract at the end of the season and had been close to joining Liverpool last summer, while Arsenal and Bayern Munich were also interested.\n\n“I am really happy and incredibly proud to be a Manchester City player,” said Guehi. “I am now at the best club in England and part of an unbelievable squad. I can’t wait to get started.”\n\nCity manager Pep Guardiola said the transfer was only possible because of Guehi’s contract situation, with several clubs hoping to sign him on a free transfer in the summer. He praised Guehi’s quality and versatility, saying he can play on either side of central defence.\n\nThe former Chelsea defender becomes City’s second January signing following the arrival of forward Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth. City’s spending over the past 12 months now stands at around £445m.\n\nCrystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner criticised the timing of the move, saying his side were “completely abandoned” by the club’s hierarchy after selling their captain so close to a match.\n\nGuehi leaves Palace having established himself as one of the Premier League’s most reliable defenders and a regular for England. For City, he arrives as an experienced option who can make an immediate impact as they continue to compete on multiple fronts.",

She also had 13 rebounds for her second double-double of the season.\n\nThe Coyotes held Denver under 40% shooting in each quarter and won all four quarters.

She reached 1,000 career points in just 78 games, with 774 of those points coming in 59 games at Truman State. She finished with 15 points on the day, a fifth consecutive game of 15-plus.\n\nThe Coyotes kept control down the stretch, not allowing Denver within 10 of the lead for the entire second half.

The Pens are about to take off on a West Coast road swing through Seattle, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver over the next eight days, starting with a 5 p.m. ET Monday game against the Kraken.\n\nOpponent Track: The Jackets are heading into the weekend on a three-game win streak. Elvis Merzlikins had a succinct answer when asked Thursday what’s changed for the Jackets:\n\n3 wins in a row what’s different for the Blue Jackets?\n\n“New coach.” – Elvis Merzlikins pic.twitter.com/vKvUdIOkK1\n\n— Spittin' Chiclets (@spittinchiclets) January 16, 2026\n\nSeason Series: This marks the last time the Jackets and Pens will meet this season. All three prior games in this season series have gone to overtime, with the Penguins losing in a shootout in October but winning in overtime in November and earlier this month.\n\nHidden Stat: The Penguins are in a playoff spot in no small part thanks to their success against division opponents this season. Including their 2-0-1 record against the Blue Jackets, the Pens have gone 9-1-3 against teams in the Metropolitan Division so far this season. (Last season, Pittsburgh missed the playoffs after going 9-13-4 against division opponents).\n\nCole Sillinger – Adam Fantilli – Kirill Marchenko\n\nBoone Jenner – Sean Monahan – Kent Johnson\n\nDmitri Voronkov – Charlie Coyle – Mathieu Olivier\n\nDanton Heinen – Brendan Gaunce – Mikael Pyyhtia\n\nJake Christiansen / Erik Gudbranson\n\nGoalies: Elvis Merzlikins, Jet Greaves\n\nPotential scratches: Denton Mateychuk (day-to-day), Egor Zamula, Zach Aston-Reese\n\nInjured Reserve: Brendan Smith, Isac Lundestrom, Miles Wood, Mason Marchment\n\nBlue Jackets defenseman Denton Mateychuk is day-to-day after taking a hard hit from Brandon Tanev during the Jackets’ Sunday win over the Utah Mammoth. Columbus general manager Don Waddell said the team doesn’t expect the injury to be long-term.\n\nCoaching change in Columbus: The Blue Jackets fired former coach Dean Evason last week after one and a half seasons and a 19-19-7 start to the 2025-26 campaign. Evason told The Athletic’s Aaron Portzline he was “blindsided” by his dismissal.\n\nThe switch allowed the Jackets to bring in Rick Bowness, 70, who had most recently coached the Winnipeg Jets for two seasons from 2022 to 2024. He hasn’t been with the team for very long— he got the job offer Monday afternoon and joined the team Tuesday morning, per ESPN— but he’s since led the Jackets to wins over the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks.\n\nBones got the boys ready to go 👊\n\nCBJ x @PNCBank pic.twitter.com/tJ0gjt6C8V\n\n— Columbus Blue Jackets (@BlueJacketsNHL) January 14, 2026\n\nKent Johnson played a season-high 20:55 during his first game with Bowness. The Jackets could be hoping to see some more production from the second-line winger if he keeps getting more playing time going forward.\n\nLike the Penguins, the Blue Jackets have at times had a problems with holding on to late leads through the first half of the season. They blew third-period leads 15 times in their first 47 games, per Brian Hedger of the Columbus Dispatch. When asked about that habit after the Jackets held on to a comfortable lead in Thursday’s win over the Vancouver Canucks, Bowness said, per Portzline: “I don’t even worry about it. It was before I got here. I’m just not worried about it… That’s in the past. I know how I want us to play, so that’s the bottom line. And we’re building on that.”\n\nRickard Rakell – Sidney Crosby – Bryan Rust\n\nEgor Chinakhov – Tommy Novak – Evgeni Malkin\n\nAnthony Mantha – Ben Kindel – Justin Brazeau\n\nConnor Dewar – Blake Lizotte – Noel Acciari\n\nParker Wotherspoon / Jack St. Ivany\n\nGoalies: Stuart Skinner and Arturs Silovs\n\nPotential Scratches: Ryan Graves, Kevin Hayes\n\nIR: Erik Karlsson, Filip Hallander, Caleb Jones, Rutger McGroarty\n\nThe Penguins had an off day Friday after Thursday’s 6-3 win over the Flyers.\n\nSidney Crosby has 69 points (24 goals, 45 assists) in 48 career games against the Blue Jackets, which ranked behind only Patrick Kane for the most among any active NHL player. Kris Letang meanwhile leads all NHL defensemen with 14 goals against the Blue Jackets, his highest total against any single team, per Penguins PR.\n\nThe Penguins are 14-1-4 in their last 19 games against the Blue Jackets, and they’re 16-0-2 in their last 18 games against the Jackets at home, per Penguins PR.\n\nThe Pens’ special teams have been thriving lately. They’re heading into Saturday’s matchup having gone 16-for-16 on the PK over their last four games, and they’re currently ranked second in the NHL with a 29.4 percent power-play success rate.",

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section give their thoughts on the Chargers' playoff exit, the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the, Lakers, Clippers and Chloe Kim.",
    "fullText": "If there’s an important playoff game for the Chargers to win, you can bet they’re going to lose. Such was the case again against New England.\n\nWhile having a decent enough defense, the offense was pathetic. And, yes, I know their offensive line was completely depleted. But, the 49ers were banged up as well. They lost George Kittle and still won.\n\nWell, there’s always “next season.” Unfortunately, those two words still haunt the Chargers and their fans.\n\nOnce again the Chargers flop in the playoffs.\n\nThis time much of the blame should be placed at the top with Jim Harbaugh. Perhaps he did not watch or was not aware of how many times in this year's playoffs teams had failed to convert on fourth down with disastrous consequences. The psychological effect on the team from failing to convert and put points on the board early was evident. He had a team without their top running back and a very weak offensive line yet chose to go for it.\n\nHopefully he will learn from this or maybe it is time for Harbaugh to join his brother in seeking new jobs.\n\nNothing wrong with the Chargers that a new OC with a game plan can't fix. Or is there?\n\nThanks for firing your OC Greg Roman. Loyalty is great but loyalty does not get you to the promised land. In two postseason trips, one touchdown to show for it.\n\nIt needed to be done for Justin Herbert & Co.\n\nThe Yankees won 27 World Series championships by being the best team money can buy. The west coast Yankees, aka the Dodgers, are now the best team money can buy. That's capitalism, baby!\n\nAs a Dodgers fan for a Joe DiMaggio-esque 56 consecutive seasons, I am happy to have Kyle Tucker in the Dodgers' outfield in 2026. Certainly, he will be an improvement over Michael Conforto, and allow Teoscar Hernandez to go back to left field.\n\nHowever, I find it perplexing that a player who appeared in only 78 and 136 games in 2024 and 2025, and who has had only one top 10 MVP finish (fifth in 2023) in his career, would be signed for a whopping average of $60-million annually. To earn that enormous salary over the next four seasons, Tucker should be considered the best player in baseball not named Shohei Ohtani.\n\nNewsflash! The Dodgers buy another superstar, cost be damned! I'm not a Dodgers fan. I'm a Baseball fan, witnessing an organization job a system that destroys parity and fairplay. So go ahead — hop aboard the Dodgers bandwagon for another championship. While baseball fans everywhere else throw up their hands in disgust and flock to the NFL.\n\nThe Dodgers' signing of Kyle Tucker for ridiculous money now ensures a (stoppage) after this baseball season. For everyone saying other teams could do the same thing, really? As much as anyone could love the Dodgers, this just takes away from the game.\n\nIf you’re mad at the Dodgers don't stop there — might as well don a cape and be super mad because MLB has no kryptonite against them.\n\nWe should not expect too much from the Lakers. We have the same offense ran by the Dallas Mavericks for Luka Doncic transplanted to L.A. Give the ball to Luka and everyone else stands around and watch. Who is teaching these guys defense?\n\nHow many more games do fans have to endure before the Lakers hire a coach who is a defensive specialist? Where is Frank Vogel when you need him?\n\nThe only way I see the Lakers or Clippers making it to the second round of the playoffs is if they play each other in the first round.\n\nThe womens' snowboarding competition at next month's Winter Olympics in Milan has taken an interesting twist. American Chloe Kim, two-time Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe, will have to wear a shoulder brace after tearing her labrum. This would be analogous to having one arm tied behind your back.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

    "fullText": "The explosive growth of women’s sports has been a well-documented phenomenon over the last four years.\n\nBut when Chicago hosts the 2026 WNBA All-Star Weekend in July, Kara Bachman — the executive director of the Chicago Sports Commission — wants the city’s investors and businesses to do more than just cheer from the sidelines.\n\n“Do a little more,” Bachman said Friday during a launch event in Fulton Market. “Put your money where your mouth is.”\n\nThe league’s All-Star festivities will return to Chicago for the second time from July 23-25, with the game scheduled for Saturday, July 25 at the United Center. Those dates are more than six months away — but planning already has begun for a cornerstone of the WNBA calendar.\n\nThe latest step of that process took place Friday in a launch event headlined by Gov. JB Pritzker, mayor Brandon Johnson and part-owner Dwyane Wade as the Sky and the city made their pitch to local investors and business leaders to take part in the weekend.\n\nAccording to a report by Front Office Sports, Chicago was the only city to bid for hosting the 2026 All-Star weekend. The reticence from other teams? Hosting duties are split between the host team and the league, making the weekend an expensive affair as the standard for logistics such as hotels, parties and activations rise meteorically with the sport as a whole.\n\nSky co-owner and operating chair Nadia Rawlinson spearheaded the pitch for Chicago to land the event. She said the Sky are embracing the responsibility as an opportunity to highlight Chicago as a whole. While some features — a welcoming event, sponsor activations featuring star players, an invite-only party organized in collaboration with the players union — will be familiar from past iterations, Friday’s launch outlined a series of plans and initiatives to expand the event’s footprint.\n\nThis includes a series of VIP roundtable dinners in the months leading up to the event and an innovation summit to highlight and support advancements in women’s sports. During All-Star weekend, Rawlinson said the Sky will host a radio row to highlight prominent sports and business shows. The Sky also plan to partner with the city for a series of community initiatives around the weekend, including a project to add the WNBA 3-point line to basketball courts at every public park in Chicago.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Rawlinson emphasized that the Sky and the WNBA will seek to highlight the diversity of the league’s fanbase.\n\n“The WNBA is (a place) where everyone can find their person,” Rawlinson said. “They can find connection. This is a place where typically people who don’t have a natural community can find community. This is our chance to highlight that.”\n\nChicago hosted the 2022 WNBA All-Star Game at Wintrust Arena — home of the Sky. For the first time in franchise history, the team last season played two regular-season games at the United Center. The home of the NBA’s Bulls and NHL’s Blackhawks has nearly double the capacity of Wintrust’s 10,380.",

In a recent poll they conducted of over 115 sports figures, each of them nominating five of their personal best. The picks consisted of players, coaches and executives, which puts even more weight on these rankings.\n\nFreeman came in No. 20, the first college football head coach named, ahead of megastars like LA Laker LeBron James and New York Yankee Aaron Judge. There were only two other college coaches named with one other receiving multiple votes.\n\nFormer women’s basketball coach Muffet McGraw was one of the voters, as she noted “he puts players first, focusing on developing the whole person rather than just the athlete.”\n\nThis goes to show that Notre Dame has one of the best in the sport, and you could argue in all of sports.

(WETM) – The 18 Sports Blitz returned for a special night in high school hoops.\n\nHornell girls basketball highlighted Friday night’s 18 Sports Blitz, with a pair of historic moments at Alfred University. The top-ranked Red Raiders breezed past Haverling 61-24, while improving to (10-1), and celebrating a two historic moments for the program. Midway through the 1st quarter of the contest, Selena Maldonado kicked off the senior night festivities, scoring an “and one,” off of a layup. At the line, Maldonado converted the free throw to earn the 1,000th point of her high school career.\n\nIn the 2nd, fellow senior Jordyn Dyring added to Hornell’s 21-5 lead and etched her name in history. With a floater in the paint, Dyring surpassed 1,527 career points to become the all-time leading scorer for the girl’s program. The impressive record had stood since 1996, when Megan Buchanan wrapped up her high school career with the Red Raiders. Buchanan would follow up her high school success at Division I U Albany.\n\nBuchanan was enshrined in both, the Hornell High School and Albany Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011, following an outstanding career. With the Great Danes, the Arkport native earned Female Athlete of the Year, as a member of the golf and basketball teams. On the court, Buchanan wrapped up her career 3rd in program history with 1,093 points. After her playing career, Buchanan has been serving as Senior Associate Athletic Director at Skidmore College, since 2005.\n\nElsewhere in high school basketball, the Horseheads girls wrapped up the STAC West Division title.

    "fullText": "Jan 16 (Reuters) - A study by AI risk management platform Alethea into the surge in artificial intelligence-generated fake content, dubbed \"AI slop,\" has warned sports teams, leagues and fans of the risks posed by increasingly sophisticated digital misinformation.\n\nRetired NFL player Jason Kelce never said ​2026 Super Bowl halftime singer Bad Bunny's critics were \"a bad fit for America's future\".\n\nSan Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle never ranted about slain ‌conservative activist Charlie Kirk and politics in football.\n\nHowever, thousands of people believed they did and that is the problem.\n\n\"Teams and players are suddenly being accused of things that are completely fabricated,\" Lisa Kaplan, ‌founder and CEO of Alethea, told Reuters on Friday, adding that the evolution of AI tools has made fake news a more daunting challenge.\n\n\"Content now looks real and is produced at a volume that makes it hard for the average person to determine if it's authentic,\" she said.\n\n\"Before, fake news often relied on human labour to repetitively copy and paste content. Today, AI can impersonate brands and create engaging images that mimic genuine announcements.\"\n\nKaplan noted that this wave of AI-generated misinformation has disrupted the traditional monetisation ⁠model of sports media. \"These networks drive engagement to questionable websites, ‌skew advertising metrics, and can even create scenarios that could manipulate betting markets,\" she added.\n\nC Shawn Eib, Alethea's Head of Investigations, described how these networks use tactics such as making multiple disjointed announcements, like the conflicting claims that former Baltimore Ravens coach ‍John Harbaugh had been hired by multiple teams at the same time.\n\n\"When a single figure appears to be linked with several teams at the same time, it quickly becomes clear that an AI system is behind the creation of these images,\" Eib explained.\n\nAI DECEPTION CAN EXPLOIT 'RAGE BAIT'\n\nThe content follows a formula: fake game updates, nonexistent celebrity feuds, manufactured scandals, and politicised ​quotes falsely attributed to star players.\n\nThe fabricated Kelce and Kittle quotes are prime examples. Both NFL stars publicly denied making comments they never said after the ‌posts went viral.\n\n\"If fans, players and even entire franchises fall prey to these manipulated narratives, it risks damaging reputations, undermining trust and even politicising sport,\" Alethea's VP of Communications Kaila Ryan said.\n\n\"Sports organisations need to proactively manage their brands and digital safety. It is crucial for teams and leagues to start monitoring these risks, work together across communications, legal and security teams, and educate fans to verify announcements from official channels,\" she added.\n\nThe business impact extends beyond reputational harm.\n\nThese networks siphon ad revenue from legitimate sports media and distort audience metrics. Some outbound links have been flagged for phishing and malicious redirects, presenting real fraud risk to fans.\n\nThe problem ⁠is not limited to the NFL. Alethea discovered similar operations targeting the NBA, WNBA, MLB, NHL, ​NASCAR, Formula 1, IndyCar and professional tennis.\n\nKaplan added that beyond monetisation, sport remains a rare cultural ​touchpoint that unites people, making them attractive targets for influence operations, and she pointed to Russia's alleged exploitation of then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's 2018 'Take a Knee' protest as a precedent.\n\nIn a 2019 report, the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed that Russian trolls had focused heavily ‍on the kneeling debate as part of ⁠a broader effort to stoke racial tensions and divide the U.S. following the 2016 election.\n\n\"Kaepernick's protests were exploited for a purpose that had nothing to do with sport. Instead, it's a way of leveraging a cultural touchstone and turning it into something that polarises people,\" said Kaplan.\n\n\"Teams need to ⁠work in unison to defend their identities and protect their fans from falling victim to fraud or manipulation,\" she added, noting that the best advice for fans is to be vigilant.\n\n\"Verify breaking news ‌through official team channels, don't click links in suspicious page comments and remember that outrage is often the product, not the by-product, ‌of what you're seeing\".",

With the Call of Duty franchise having an off year with Black Ops 7, sports titles took the top spots in PlayStation Store's American/Canadian and European PlayStation 5 downloads.\n\nNBA 2K26 was No. 1 in America and Canada, while EA Sports FC 26 claimed the top spot in Europe. It was previously clear that Black Ops 7 would have a hard time repeating Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's chart-topping performance in 2024. But the latest Call of Duty installment fell to No. 7 in America/Canada and Europe. By contrast, Battlefield 6 performed very well in both territories, with a No. 2 finish in North America and a fifth place slot in Europe. Through the end of November 2025, Circana had Battlefield 6 as the best-selling game of the year. But this particular list is only for PlayStation Store downloads and it doesn't count sales on other consoles or PC.\n\nThe lists contained some returning favorites like Minecraft and Helldivers 2, but newcomers like Arc Raiders, Ghost of Yotei, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made the cut in North America as well.\n\nAmong PlayStation 4 games, Red Dead Redemption 2 claimed No. 1 in both territories. Rockstar Games' 2018 open-world western has remained remarkably resilient, as has Grand Theft Auto 5, which placed highly on both the PS5 and PS4 lists.\n\nBeat Saber also claimed the top slots in America/Canada and Europe's PSVR 2 Games charts, and repeated its wins from 2024. Similarly, Fortnite was also a back-to-back winner for free-to-play games in both territories.\n\nThe complete list of 2025's top games on PlayStation Store can be found below.",

    "fullText": "In a recent report, Sky Sports stated that Arsenal are in the running to land Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi. It has been mentioned that the Gunners would have to rival Manchester City, Liverpool and Bayern Munich in the race to sign the English centre-back.\n\nGuehi has enjoyed a decent run of form at the South London club as he has put in a series of impressive displays for them on the defensive end of the field. The English talent has scored three goals and grabbed four assists in 33 appearances for Crystal Palace this season on all fronts.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been a rock at the back for the Eagles and deserves credit for making 30 tackles, 18 blocks, 25 interceptions and 105 clearances in the Premier League. He has even distributed the ball accurately from inside his half, as evidenced by his pass success rate of 84.5% in top-flight football (stats via fbref.com).\n\nHis current contract at Selhurst Park will run out at the end of this campaign. Hence, Arsenal could potentially sign him on a cut-price deal this month or on a free transfer next summer.\n\nSTRASBOURG, FRANCE – NOVEMBER 27: Marc Guehi of Crystal Palace during the UEFA Conference League 2025/26 League Phase MD4 match between Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace and Crystal Palace FC at Stade de la Meinau on November 27, 2025 in Strasbourg, France. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nGuehi loves a tackle and can time his challenges well to earn the ball back for his team inside his half. He usually puts his foot through the ball when required and can play his way out from the back.\n\nThe English sensation has got a wealth of experience at the highest level and won’t take much time to settle into life at Arsenal. He is also a great leader on the pitch.\n\nGuehi would undoubtedly bring more bite and steel to Mikel Arteta’s defence. He has what it takes to compete for a regular first-team spot at the Emirates Stadium in the coming seasons.\n\nAt 25, Guehi has his peak years ahead of him, which makes him a decent option for the Gunners to pursue this January or at the end of this campaign. He might even help Arsenal challenge for some major trophies over the next few years. Therefore, Arteta would be wise to try everything in his power to snap Guehi up soon.",

The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024.\n\nMiss Universe Harnaaz Sandhu Joins Tiger Shroff, Sanjay Dutt in 'Baaghi 4' - Global Bulletin\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, ZEE5, SonyLIV Vie for India's IFFI Streaming Honor - Global Bulletin\n\nFox Orders Lifeguard Drama Series 'Rescue: Hi-Surf' from Producer John Wells (TV News Roundup)\n\nWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\nThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\nRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\nSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\nFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\nMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\nShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\nThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

The hosts (15-3, 7-0) led by as many as 12 points in the third quarter then had to hang on as the Panthers (17-1, 7-1) rallied to close within two in the final seconds.\n\nLast year, Morton went to No. 1 Washington and ended the Panthers season-opening 21-game win streak with a 46-45 win at Torry Gym. The Panthers returned the favor by beating the Potters in the regular season finale and in the sectional championship on the way to finishing third at state.\n\nPenelope Drake scored nine points for the Potters but may have delivered the game’s biggest play when she blocked a three-point shot by Washington’s Avery Tibbs with 0:15 left as Washington was aiming to tie the game. Tibbs finished with a game-high 14 points.\n\nThe two teams will meet again on Feb. 10 in the final game of the regular season in Washington.\n\nOther girls basketball winners included Notre Dame, Richwoods, Normal Community, Normal West, Metamora, Canton.

They limited the Purple to just five points in the third quarter and Nassiff got herself some buckets, scoring eight points in the stretch to build a 42-20 lead heading to the fourth quarter.\n\nNassiff finished as Moses Brown’s top scorer with 23 points. Bousquet was right behind her with 21 points and Adelaide Crosby and Madison Wilson accounted for the remaining seven points.\n\nJaydell Harris was the top scorer for Classical, putting up 12 points. Daniella Jimenez had seven in the loss.\n\nCranston West’s offense was feeling good on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Falcons made seven 3-pointers … in the first quarter against the Rebels. The early shooting led to a 28-point frame as Cranston West toppled South Kingston, 74-36, on the road in a Division I matchup.\n\nCranston West finished with 13 treys in the game with Talya Walker (19 points) making five from distance. Kyla Buco (18 points) was right behind her with four makes from beyond the arc. Walker and Buco each made three triples in the opening frame.\n\nSaniyya Chase scored a dozen points and Madeleine Marques added 11 in the victory. It was the Falcons’ best offensive game of the season by a wide margin as the Falcons hadn’t broken 60 points yet this season. Might Tuesday’s win spark a run for Cranston West?\n\nAn important matchup with Westerly awaits on Saturday at home.\n\nIt was close all night, but Chariho pulled out a nailbiter vs. St. Raphael in Division I play.\n\nThe Chargers carried just a 6-point lead into the break and that was enough to hold off the Saints behind Tessa Aiello’s 16 points. With scoring contributions from six different players, the Chargers used their balanced attack to secure their fourth win of the year.\n\nMenuhki Harris managed a dozen points and had 10 fouls shots in the game as the junior was tough to defend. The Chargers added six points from the line in their decisive 14-point fourth quarter that helped keep them ahead.\n\nAdrianna Noka supplied eight points in the win. Tuesday was a key win at home for the Chargers as they travel to Westerly on Thursday night for a rivalry match. Chariho could play upset against the Bulldogs, who are looking like one of the best teams in the state to start the year.\n\nSRA was paced by 16 points from Carolyn Abreu. The Saints host West Warwick on Thursday.\n\nGenesis Castro scored a team-high 18 points, including 4 buckets from beyond the arc, and teammates Ella Martin and Faith Van Ness added 13 and 11 points, respectively, in the Eagles victory, as Barrington is now 10-1 and ranked second to only Westerly in Division I.\n\nFor the Patriots in the loss, Annie Hurd scored 16 points with 2 threes, Violet Silvia acced 11 points and 3 treys, and Gyselle Mairs finished with 10 points and 2 threes. Portsmouth slips to 5-2 on the season.\n\nThe Skippers wasted little time in dispatching the Rams in his Division I clash, racing out to a 24-3 advantage and playing a solid defensive game to cruise to victory. Brooke Faunce led the way with a game-high 16 points and Mya Macchioni added 8 more as North Kingstown pushed its record to 6-3 with its second win over La Salle (2-8) this season.\n\nFor the Rams, Maya Fernandes led the team with 6 points as La Salle gears up to face Portsmouth later this week.\n\nWesterly continues to prove it’s one of the state’s best programs.\n\nThe Bulldogs handled Pawtucket comfortably in a 65-23 victory on Tuesday night at home. Westerly assisted on 24 of its 27 field goals with Macy Antoch’s 14 points pacing the group. The freshman also supplied four rebounds and four steals in a standout night in the Division I matchup.\n\nDanica Jarrett was right behind her teammate with 13 points, five rebounds and a trio of steals. Cece Saint rounded out Westerly’s scorers in double figures with 10 points. But the standout performers don’t end there. Santanaa Hamelin supplied seven assists and seven steals as the freshman was all over the court.\n\nThe young, and talented, Bulldogs are now 9-1 overall on the year and host Chariho on Thursday.\n\nEast Providence girls basketball rebounded in a big way Tuesday night.\n\nThe Division II Townies managed a season-high 57 points in their 57-43 victory against Division I’s West Warwick. The win comes on the heels of EP losing to Rogers last Friday.\n\nZarae Hall got East Providence started hot with 14 points in the first half and finished off the Wizards with 24 in the game. The junior made 10 shots from the field, including a trio of 3-pointers to push EP to its fifth win of the season.\n\nTrinity Provencher added a dozen points, including eight in the fourth quarter to close out the hosts. Audrey Bernard supplied another dozen points as EP’s offense was firing on all cylinders. East Providence travels to Tiverton on Friday.\n\nWest Warwick was led by Brea Lima’s 18 points and Alexa Foley’s 14.The Wizards meet St. Raphael on Thursday in Pawtucket.\n\nThe Vikings believe in the old adage that you only get one chance to make a first impression. So opening the game with a 17-point first quarter, and then adding 18 in the second was pretty indicative of how this Division II contest would play out.\n\nRogers started hot and stayed that way. They were paced by the dynamic duo of Zaida Aponte – 21 points, including four 3's – and Tameka Robertson – 14 first half points. The result was a 35-17 lead by the break and an easier second half.\n\nFor the Mariners, Taylor Sullivan and Delaney Bonneau each scored 11 points, with Sullivan making a pair of 3-pointers and Bonneau going 6-fo-6 at the foul line.\n\nRogers moves to 4-2 and will have a stiff test coming later this week when it faces first-place Coventry (8-1).\n\nFreshman Eveisha Santana had a night to remember as she poured in 26 points, 6 from beyond the arc, pulled down 8 rebounds and had 5 steals and 4 assists to lead the Knights to a win over the Villa Novans.

Hope, 29\n\nThe Cavaliers made it two in a row on back to back nights, matching last season's win total (three) in the young season. Juanita Sanchez was up 39-21 at the break and was never threatened in the second half\n\nThe Cavs were led by Geston Richardson with 25 points and Corey McClain, who added 17. Amaree Gomes and Allen Ortiz also scored in double figures in the win. The Patriots were led by James Nute (11 points) and Josh Morales (10).\n\nSmithfield 47, North Kingstown 40\n\n200 medley relay: Westerly - Enzo Gynther, Brady Casady, Sam Lorello, Colby Champlin, 1:57.38; 200 free: Westerly - Cooper Palumbo, 2:09.88; 200 IM: NP/S/NS - Mason Smith, 2:28.65; 50 free: Westerly - Champlin, 2:14.91; 100 fly: NP/S/NS - Sean Mania, 57:07; 100 free: Westerly - Lorello, 1:00.50; 500 free: NP/S/NS - Mason Smith, 5:52.82; 200 free relay: Westerly - Juan Aquino, Josue Aquino, Casady, Champlin, 1:56.85; 100 back: Westerly - Gynther, 1:07.82; 100 breast: NP/S/NS - Mania, 1:12:28; 400 free relay: NP/S/NS - Mania, Connor Farrell, Joshua Mesick, Smith, 4:00.43\n\n200 medley relay: NP/S/NS - Patty Oussi, Alexa Cortes, Emily Pace, Lauren Riley, 2:11.33; 200 free: Westerly - Avery Lamb, 2:20:38; 200 IM: NP/S/NS, Alexa Cortes, 2:26.37; 50 free: Westerly, Sonja Beasley, 26:20; 100 fly: NP/S/NS, Oussi, 1:09.45; 100 free: Westerly, Beasley, 58:08; 500 free: Westerly, Olivia ONeil, 6:07:11; 200 free relay:  Alexia McCabe, Peyton Pietraszka, O’Neil and Beasley, 1:52:50; 100 back: NP/S/NS, Oussi, 1:10.93; 100 breast: NP/S/NS, Cortes, 1:15.65; 400 free relay: Westerly - O’Neil, Lamb, McCabe and Beasley, 4:12:03.\n\nHannah Hochman had two wins in two individual events (100 Free, 100 breaststroke) and she also participated in the winning 200 Medley Relay, and teammate Samantha Lin also had two individual victories (200 IM, 100 butterfly) and she also swam a leg on the winning 200 Medley Relay helping the Titans edge the Patriots.\n\nFor Pilgrim, Juliana Kavanaugh also captured two individual events (200 free, 100 backstroke) she swam a leg for the winning 400 freestyle relay.\n\nClassical vs. Hendricken at Al Morro Athletic Complex, 6 p.m.\n\nChariho at Narragansett, 6 p.m.\n\nAchievement First (PVD) vs. Hope at 85 Garfield Ave. Cranston, RI, 6:30 p.m.\n\nJohnston at Burrillville, 6:30 p.m.\n\nMt.

    "fullText": "Jets predicted to trade for $212 million QB in lieu of Dante Moore originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAssuming that Fernando Mendoza is the No. 1 overall NFL Draft pick by the Las Vegas Raiders, the New York Jets will have to cross their fingers.\n\nDante Moore isn't a lock to come out of Oregon and enter the draft. He'd be the only clear QB2 in a class that isn't as strong as once thought.\n\nIf Moore stays in school, the Jets may have to pursue a different route at the quarterback position.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine suggests an outside the box option: Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nTagovailoa has multiple years remaining on what was originally a $212 million contract with the Miami Dolphins. It'd be a fascinating intra-division trade.\n\nBecause it'd be a salary dump, the Jets in this projected trade actually also receive a second-round pick and cash while only giving up a fifth-round pick.\n\n\"For all of Tua Tagovailoa's faults, he is 44-32 as a starter,\" Ballentine writes. \"Tagovailoa said he would be open to a fresh start after a season in which he ended on the bench. The only problem is that he's only one year into his four-year extension. The Jets are uniquely positioned to help the Dolphins out. They have $93.7 million in cap space, which is plenty to take on a significant portion of Tagovailoa's contract before cutting it in 2027 with little additional cost. That would help the Jets win now while adding to their draft pick stockpile and showing some creativity in navigating their rebuild under Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey.\"\n\nMIKE TOMLIN NEWS: What it means for Rodgers | TV future | Tomlin trade potential | Cignetti?\n\nIt would certainly be fascinating to see the Jets' leadership group put their futures in the hands of Tagovailoa.\n\nIt's hard to know if Tua could be good enough without a talented receiving corps, but maybe he needs the change of scenery more than anything else.\n\nThe narratives would be great if this happened, for sure.\n\nPatriots, Drake Maye silence doubters with callback to Brady, Belichick\n\nA.J.

Smith made quite the awkward on-air blunder while discussing the Houston Texans’ 30-6 playoff win Monday over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWhile recapping the matchup on ESPN’s “First Take” on Tuesday, the sports commentator misidentified the Texans’ star wide receiver, Christian Kirk, as the late right-wing political commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nPolitics: Democrat Mary Peltola Launches Senate Bid In Alaska\n\n“We saw Charlie Kirk catch eight receptions for 144 yards,” Smith said before co-host Shae Peppler Cornette interjected to remind him: “Christian Kirk.”\n\nSmith quickly corrected himself. “I’m sorry, I apologize. Oh, my God, Christian Kirk.”\n\nThe verbal slip, which was shared on X by the sports media account Awful Announcing, has already racked up more than 11 million views.\n\nChristian Kirk and his team will play the New England Patriots on Sunday in an NFL divisional round playoff game. It appears that he has not publicly commented on the slip-up.\n\nCharlie Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing nonprofit Turning Point USA, built a massive social media following by holding debates on contentious cultural issues, where he often made incendiary, racist or sexist remarks. He was shot and killed while speaking with students at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, 2025.\n\nAfter the killing, Smith condemned anyone celebrating Kirk’s death on his SiriusXM radio show.\n\nPolitics: Charlie Kirk Brought Hard-Right Politics To A New Generation\n\n“I don’t care what his political beliefs were. I don’t care what he felt. I care about the fact that a man was gunned down in front of two of his children, who are 5 years of age or less,” he said during the Sep. 11 episode.\n\nHe also praised the New York Yankees for honoring Kirk with a moment of silence ahead of a game against the Detroit Tigers.\n\n“Props to the New York Yankees organization last night for having a moment of silence,” Smith said. “We’re not supposed to condone stuff like this. We’re not supposed to say it’s OK. I don’t give a **** who you are, Black, white or anything in between.”\n\nNicki Minaj Uses The Exact Wrong Word Onstage With Erika Kirk\n\nProfessor Fired Over Charlie Kirk Post Just Won A Major Payout — And His Old Job Back\n\nAccused Charlie Kirk Killer Makes 1st In-person Court Appearance",

Duarte (@michaeljduarte) January 12, 2026\n\nCharly Hill, who graduated from Miami in 2024 and has interned and freelanced at Bleacher Report, TNT Sports and NBC, joined as a sports content creator.\n\nI’m not typically active on Twitter, but that’s all about to change with my new role at the California Post as a Sports Content Creator\n\nSo excited to be a part of what’s shaping up to be an incredible year for California sports! pic.twitter.com/EOieGODH0b\n\n— charly d (@charlydyannhill) January 8, 2026\n\nBolch, who has covered UCLA athletics for the Los Angeles Times for more than a decade and spent 26 years at the paper overall, becomes the latest high-profile addition for the California Post, which has aggressively targeted established Southern California journalists to anchor its coverage.\n\nHis move follows the recent exits of former Los Angeles Times sports columnist Dylan Hernandez and Dodgers beat writer Jack Harris, who  announced last month they were joining the California Post.\n\nWith Bolch’s departure, the Los Angeles Times is now left with just nine full-time sports staff writers, a stark contraction for a paper that once boasted one of the deepest sports departments in the country.\n\nOutside of the editors, the Los Angeles Times sports staff is currently led by columnist Bill Plaschke, senior writers Bill Shaikin and Kevin Baxter, Thuc Nhi Nguyen and Broderick Turner on the Lakers, Ryan Kartje on USC, Gary Klein on the Rams, Sam Farmer on the Chargers and Eric Sondheimer on high schools.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times was slated to have the second-largest contingent of sports staffers covering the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo behind NBC, which is the broadcast home of the Olympics, before the pandemic. The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",

    "fullText": "Zurich-based firm taps into latest robot tech to ‘fibre-spray’ high-end sports shoes worn by the likes of Roger Federer\n\nA robot leg whirs around in a complex ballet as an almost invisible spray of “flying fibre” builds a hi-tech £300 sports shoe at its foot.\n\nThis nearly entirely automated process – like a sci-fi future brought to life – is part of the gameplan from On, the Swiss sports brand that is taking on the sector’s mighty champions Nike and Adidas with a mix of technology and chutzpah.\n\nThe brand is expanding rapidly after teaming up with the former tennis pro Roger Federer to create shoes suitable for the Swiss star’s sport and a mix of fashion-led collaborations including with the luxury brand LOEWE, actor Zendaya and singers FKA twigs and Burna Boy. In China, sales have doubled year-on-year. Growth has been strong in the US and mainland Europe and this month On will open its fourth London store, in Kensington.\n\n“We’re an innovation brand at heart,” says its co-founder, David Allemann, “because we are really going for the long run.”\n\nHe’s speaking from On’s Zurich head office, which has the vibe of a tech firm or luxe gym with light-filled spaces and quirky design features from the spiral staircase and workout room to a hanging fossilised tree.\n\nAllemann says the company’s inspirations are disruptors such as Apple and Dyson. These two brands were on the “mood board” when On was set up as they combine “unique design” with “innovation in terms of user-experience or technology”.\n\nAllemann, a former McKinsey consultant, ditched his job in 2010 as marketing boss of the furniture brand Vitra to start On with a former McKinsey colleague, Caspar Coppetti, and the Swiss Ironman world champion and triathlete Olivier Bernhard.\n\nBernhard’s idea was for a shoe that would protect his body from the impact of long-distance running but also promote speed. The original prototype, developed by Bernhard, an inventive individual as well as a committed sportsman, started out with sections of hose-pipe glued to the bottom of an old pair of trainers.\n\nThe three friends, all keen runners, tried out early versions together and put about £600,000 of their life savings into launching the company. They ordered 1,200 pairs of shoes, which they sold at running meets before convincing some specialist retailers to place orders.\n\nIn 2021, the trio floated the brand on the New York Stock Exchange at a value of $8bn (£5.95bn) , raising almost $750m for the business and netting them about $120m in cash while keeping a large stake in the business. This year they expect to sell 30m pairs. The brand is now worth $16bn.\n\nAfter their innovative design took off, On developed the LightSpray flying fibre technology after a team member met a young student, Johannes Voelchert, at a design fair in 2019. The company decided to fund him for a year to develop his vision, which was inspired by a glue gun used to make Halloween spider-web decorations.\n\n“We said: hey, he’s crazy, but we like that because Olivier was crazy as well,” says Allemann.\n\nVoelchert is now part of a team of hundreds of research and technology experts, from more than 90 countries and numerous industry backgrounds, helping to develop new ideas for On in Zurich with a particular eye on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\n“We call that the explorer spirit,” says Allemann.\n\nThe idea is to foster innovation and creativity so that, even as a bigger company employing 4,000 people around the world, the whole business, from designers to manufacturers, can take risks on ideas without necessarily knowing the final outcome. “We’re still able to set sail without exactly knowing where we’re arriving without calling home the next day,” Allemann says.\n\nAllemann adds that On is now seeing the benefit of “many little sprouts that now are growing up”, from its move into different sports – such as outdoor training and tennis – to its development of apparel and the opening of retail stores.\n\nThe small brand may control just 1% of the $450bn global sportswear market, according to GlobalData, but it is expanding rapidly.\n\nOn plays in the premium market with its shoes starting from about £120, excluding seasonal promotions, up to £495. That compares with Nike, which runs from £60 to £290, and Adidas, from £40 to £450.\n\nDespite high-end purchases coming under pressure from cost of living increases, sales for the brand are on track to increase by just over a third to hit nearly 3bn Swiss Francs (£2.8bn) this year. On says it has grabbed as much as a fifth of the running shoe market in the UK and other European countries.\n\nIt faces some heavyweight competition. On is just one-tenth the size of Nike, which holds about 14% of the global sportswear market, according to industry analysts GlobalData, with Adidas on 9%. However, both have faced difficulties in recent years, creating space for new challenges including On, Hoka and revitalised old brands such as New Balance or Onitsuka Tiger, now owned by ASICS.\n\nThe company also faced a class action lawsuit last year in the US, where customers claimed its shoes make a “noisy and embarrassing squeak”. Its “CloudTec” trainers, designed with holes to feel like “running on clouds” – were criticised on social media over the noise. On said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.\n\nOn’s Cloudboom Strike LS laceless shoe, which is made by just nine robots in Zurich and costs £310, has already won the attention of running enthusiasts after the Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri won this year’s New York and last year’s Boston marathon. She also took a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in a pair.\n\nIn Zurich, the robots in their lab-like room are still outnumbered by humans, who monitor their work and complete the final process. Most of the brand’s footwear is made in traditional factories in Asia. But this year On is aiming to open its first robot-led factory to create a more accessible version of the shoe, the upper half of which is made from a single nearly one mile-long filament of thermoplastic polyurethane in just three minutes. Traditionally, a shoe takes several humans hours of work.\n\nThe factory’s location has not yet been decided, but will be close to one of its main retail markets, with the long-term aim of producing on every continent. That would be a dramatic change from today’s industry, which is largely based in Asia, particularly Vietnam and China.\n\nAllemann says local manufacturing is attractive as it has “a huge advantage from a sustainability point of view, because you don’t have to ship shoes around the world, but also from an agility to market point of view – you can produce much faster, according to what people want”.\n\nHe says LightSpray shoes have a 75% lower CO2 footprint than an ordinary sports shoe, which plays to On’s aim to create more sustainable and recyclable kit.\n\nRetail expansion is also a big part of the story. The latest London opening will make the UK capital its biggest retail centre, with plans for as many as seven in future. It is now part of a global portfolio of 60 outlets, with plans for up to 25 more a year despite the rise of online selling.\n\n“We feel there’s still a lot of potential in retail, if done right. City centres are still a very important place for society, and shopping and sports are an important ingredient to that.”\n\nWith those in their late teens, 20s and 30s keen on sport, particularly training and running, Allemann says the shops “are not just stores but also community hubs where running clubs start”.\n\nHe believes On will continue to expand because participating in sport brings people together in a way the online world cannot.\n\n“Running and sports, that’s such an important part of your life that we see consumers are willing to invest in great performance, innovation and better feel, but also in great design and what that tells us about them.”",

    "description": "You can bet on anything from sports to Labubus now, but prediction markets are also a valuable tool for investors, Danny Moses told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "You can bet on pretty much anything these days. From sports to the weather to the price of a Labubu, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi have offered people a new way to gamble.\n\nAccording to Danny Moses, one of the investors from \"The Big Short,\" they've also offered investors a useful tool to help navigate markets.\n\nMoses, who was among the investors betting against the US housing market ahead of the 2008 crash, isn't surprised by the prediction-market boom, and he thinks investors need to be watching these markets closely to stay on top of their game.\n\n\"I think it's great to scan through all the prediction markets out there, certainly economics and business-related, because it actually will get you thinking about things you might have been missing,\" he told Business Insider in an interview before the new year.\n\nMoses isn't too focused on short opportunities these days, despite being famous for his role in Michael Lewis's now-iconic saga of the housing crash. But he thinks that prediction markets can serve to provide valuable info for bullish and bearish investors alike.\n\nHe pointed to the recent example of popular fintech stock SoFi Technologies being listed as having a 38% chance of being added to the benchmark index in 2026, something that could be a likely catalyst for the stock, which is up 93% in the last year.\n\n\"If you're short SoFi and you weren't thinking about the possibility of it being added to the S&P 500, like we just saw happen to Carvana recently, that's something you need to be aware of,\" Moses said.\n\nThat's not the only way prediction markets could help investors make smarter decisions. Moses said he thinks there may be circumstances where they can offer a more appealing risk-reward than investors might get from traditional derivatives. He cited crypto as an example.\n\n\"Will bitcoin trade below $70,000 in the first quarter of 2026?\" he mused. \"Well, if I own bitcoin, and it's a much cheaper way to bet, if it's an eight cent possibility, so call it twelve to one, I might be getting a better market, or I might want to buy that rather than buying a put option on crypto.\"\n\nIn his view, it's early days for prediction markets. Their usefulness will grow as a predictive tool for hedging traditional investments as well as gauging the likelihood of market-moving events. And as they grow, expect more prominent players to participate, he said.\n\n\"I think institutions are going to start using prediction markets more, and as institutions use it, you're going to see a lot more activity,\" he said.",

    "description": "What a night in Chicago: the Bears won their first playoff game in 15 years and the Cubs made their biggest free-agent splash in a decade.",
    "fullText": "Simply, it was the greatest sports evening in Chicago since 2016.\n\nWhile the Chicago Bears were making arguably the greatest comeback in franchise history against the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night in the playoffs, the Chicago Cubs were making their biggest free-agent splash in a decade with a five-year, $175 million agreement with infielder Alex Bregman.\n\n“Big night for Chicago,’’ Scott Boras, Bregman’s agent, said in a text to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nSo, while the Bears were coming back from a 21-3 halftime deficit to win 31-27, Boras and the Cubs were actually in the middle of negotiations?\n\n“Bears game?’’ Boras texted USA TODAY Sports. “I was packing the green in for Breggy with the Cubs.’’\n\nThe Cubs, who tried to sign Bregman a year ago to a four-year, $115 million deal, got their man and stole him away from the Boston Red Sox with the richest salary in Cubs’ history.\n\nAnd after listening to critics all winter, saying that they haven’t made enough moves or spent enough money to make themselves World Series contenders − or at least better than the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central − they shelled out the big cash after acquiring Miami Marlins starter Edward Cabrera just three days ago.\n\nJust like that, the Cubs have got folks in Chicago believing it could be 2016 all over again, the year they won their first World Series since 1908.\n\nCertainly, Bregman, 31, is a huge winner. He opted out of the $80 million owed to him the next two years by the Boston Red Sox, and spun it into a franchise-record $35-million-a-year deal with a full no-trade clause and no opt-outs. The only Cubs’ contracts bigger in total value is Jason Heyward’s eight-year, $184 million contract and shortstop Dansby Swanson’s seven-year, $177 million contract.\n\nBregman, who turns 32 in March, will now earn $215 million over six years.\n\nJust like that, the Cubs could be a giant in the NL. They now have a wealth of depth in their infield in which they could either slide Matt Shaw to second base and trade Nico Hoerner or make Shaw a super utility player and keep Hoerner for one more year before he hits free agency.\n\nNo matter, the Cubs feel as if they’re set, and love Bregman’s leadership skills, as he has been in the playoffs every full year of his 10-year career.\n\nThis is why the Red Sox badly wanted to bring him back and were runner-up in the negotiations. The Arizona Diamondbacks also had interest in Bregman, but once they decided to retain All-Star second baseman Ketel Marte, they dropped out of the Bregman sweepstakes, leaving the Cubs and Red Sox as the two finalists.\n\nBregman, who hit .273 with an .821 OPS with 18 homers and 28 doubles last season, is the biggest free agent to sign this winter. Considering he’s two years older than Cody Bellinger, it perhaps illustrates why Bellinger has not accepted the Yankees’ five-year offer in excess of $150 million.\n\nBregman’s signing now leaves the Red Sox badly needing Bo Bichette, who also is being courted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays. Bichette has a zoom call meeting Monday with the Phillies.\n\nThe Cubs couldn’t care less what happens next. They believe they’re set now. They’re convinced they can win their first NL Central title in a full season since 2017.\n\nAnd, hey, with the Cubs’ convention scheduled this upcoming weekend, they not only plan to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of their World Series, but believe it could be a prelude to an October to remember in 2026.\n\nWhat a night in Chicago, with the Bears winning at Solider Fielder and the Cubs celebrating in their offices at Wrigley Field.\n\nWho would have imagined a brutally cold, blustery evening in Chicago could feel so beautiful?\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Alex Bregman signing with Cubs and Bears win make great Chicago night",

The latest retired Chiefs star to be honored is long-time punter Dustin Colquitt, who was recently named to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame class of 2026.\n\nColquitt, who will be enshrined on February 1st in Springfield, played the most games in franchise history and was a two-time Pro Bowler for Kansas City. He was a member of the Kansas City Super Bowl LIV championship team and recently officially retired with the franchise.\n\nThe former Tennessee Volunteer was selected by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft after his illustrious collegiate career. He spent 14 seasons in Kansas City before joining various teams in the final stretch of his career.\n\nFor 15 seasons, Colquitt experienced the franchise's highs and lows. In 238 regular-season games with the Chiefs, Colquitt tallied 1,167 punts and an impressive 477 inside the 20.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs legend Dustin Colquitt named to Missouri Sports Hall of Fame",

    "description": "Former New York Times writer Harvey Araton's novel reveals a raucous life of a youth athlete, and lessons we can all learn from it.",
    "fullText": "It’s a statement but also a question we can ask ourselves as sports parents.\n\nIt’s driven into our kids very early, often by us.\n\nOr is it to just enjoy the experience?\n\n“Dad, according to Mom, asked the parents in our group not to worry about how good we were, or weren’t,” writes author Harvey Araton, through the eyes of a kid named “Z,” in a new middle-grade novel.\n\nZ’s dad was the coach of the boy’s first soccer team. It’s a neighborhood collection of grade school buddies. Dad didn’t just roll out the ball, though. He orchestrated drills that mimicked game situations that gave everyone a shot at the action.\n\n“You scrimmage too much, and the same kids, the stronger players, will dominate the ball, and then how do the other kids get better?” Z overhears his dad telling his mom early in the book.\n\nEveryone notices, in fiction and reality, when others don’t have this growth mentality.\n\nZ and his teammates hear opposing parents scream for blood, or at least a foul, when his team, once a doormat, incrementally starts to get better and begins to dominate.\n\nThe kids of manic youth sports parents, one of whom Araton admits to once being himself, is whom he wants to reach. The veteran sportswriter, most recently with The New York Times for 25 years, covered the Danny Almonte age scandal at the 2001 Little League World Series, and the ensuing escalation of Little League World Series coverage into American living rooms.\n\nHe has pondered or written about (or both) kids choosing between club and high school soccer and early sports specialization.\n\nHe also played the role of sports dad to two now-grown sons (36 and 32).\n\n“Kids learn playing sports,” Araton tells USA TODAY Sports. “I think there's a joy in that. I just feel, especially at these early years, it's becoming infected with this ambition that there could be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and I think too many parents become obsessed with turning their children into potential cash machines.”\n\nAraton launched the book last week with a signing at his local bookstore in Montclair, New Jersey. He made sure to also include a panel discussion about youth sports. He spoke with us about how his novel imitates the raucous life America lives within it, and the lessons he has gleaned from it.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nAraton is from Staten Island, which he describes as New York City’s last developed borough. It still has large swaths of parks and fields, where his story is set.\n\nHe had grown up on the basketball courts near his public housing development. The free play felt natural as it took him to the local Jewish community center and high school. He eventually played at a health club in Brooklyn as an adult and even worked in Madison Square Garden, where he covered the Knicks, the team he had idolized as a kid.\n\nHis competitive juices carried him into fatherhood when his older son, Alex, was in first grade and had the option of going out for a travel team. It’s a decision many of us have faced.\n\n“I remember asking him if he wanted to try out,” Araton says. “And he was kind of a naturally cautious kid and said, ‘Not really,’ and I remember being disappointed, a little deflated. Maybe I already was thinking, ‘If he doesn't go into this next level, he'll fall behind and never catch up, (and) there will go any chance of playing in high school.’ I mean, I could look at my kids, look at their size even at that age and know that they weren't likely to be D1 college athletes.\n\n“But I remember being disappointed and over the next couple of weeks, I came up with five or six different ways to pose the same question. Well, Nick's trying out, you sure you don't want (to)? And he kept saying no. And then the last time that I asked, he said, ‘No, dad.’ And then he looked at me and said, ‘But if I don't play travel, can I still play in the town league?’\n\n“And I remember feeling this sensation of shame because I realized in that moment that I was projecting my own ambitions and my own sports values onto this 6-year-old kid. And all he wanted to do at that point in his life was just run around and play with a bunch of kids he knew and maybe take one or two things out of any game and feel good about himself and look forward to the snacks.”\n\nThe book’s central character, who tells the story in the first person, is a combination of Araton’s two sons. Charly, Alex’s younger brother, was 4-foot-11 when he entered high school but played on the basketball team for four years.\n\nZ is left-footed with really good field vision like Alex and he’s small and feisty like Charly was. It doesn’t seem to bother Z when his young team is losing because he knows he will celebrate the things they all did well, or at least enjoyed, at Big Mitch’s restaurant afterward.\n\nBig Mitch is the father of his friend and teammate, Lloyd.\n\n“You only let in, like, seven or eight goals on an undefeated travel team,” he tells Lloyd, the team’s goalie, in the book. “Do you think a kid who was out of shape could do that?”\n\nZ becomes less comfortable when sports becomes more and more competitive. His father has a horrific accident and the team eventually gets a coach from England, who adopts a similar skills-first mindset with the kids. Kevin, the coach, who has also had a traumatic experience with his father, takes Z under his wing.\n\nAs the boys and girls on the team continue to rise in competition level, and travel further and further away from Staten Island, Z gets a much more transactional coach.\n\nHe feels himself immersed in a world over which he has less and less control, similar to the experiences Araton observed and felt as a soccer dad.\n\n“The reason why I chose soccer is because I probably was most closely involved with that, whether it was as coaching them in the early grades or just being at the games and kind of like, living for it a little bit,” he says. “I understand why parents are so heavily involved. After a week of work you really look forward to the experience of the games. It's like an adrenaline rush but also I think, it created a whole social network with the parents of their teammates and friends and everything. So I get the temptation, and the seductiveness, of it all, but (it) all got completely out of control, as well.”\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nWhile Araton was growing up on Staten Island, the borough’s Mid-Island Little League won it all in Williamsport. Years later, as a sportswriter, Araton caught up with Danny Yaccarino, who came within one strike of a perfect game during that 1964 Little League World Series against Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nHe wrote a column, (‘After Perfection at the Age of 12, What's Next?’) detailing how Yaccarino became a very good high school pitcher and reached the Baltimore Orioles organization and yet, he was always haunted by the feeling of coming so close to near-perfection as a Little Leaguer and not getting it.\n\n“Not only did he get a lot of bench jockeying and all that stuff throughout his career, but he also put incredible pressure on himself,” Araton says. “He turned out to be a minor league pitcher and he never went very far. But he told me that he finished his career feeling like an abject failure.”\n\nZ feels an emptiness, too, at the climax of the book. It's a feeling that can be induced by us.\n\n\"Parents, being vulnerable, and easily manipulated into spending vast sums of money, (wind) up treating their children like they are speculating on a stock, an investment,\" Araton says. \"They're not stocks that will pay off at 8 or 9 or 10 years; they're developing human beings.\"\n\n“Z, we’re running behind,” his mother yells upstairs, trying to get him moving for his U-13 fall season-opening game. She’s now the team’s driven parent-manager.\n\n“The construction of this story is really about Z coming to an understanding of what role sports should play in his life,” Araton says. “And when I say that, I mean, at that particular time, kids are always subject to change. He's at a point in his life where he's experienced family trauma, and, when he looks around, he doesn't see the friends who he loves, the kids that he grew up playing with. He sees a lot of strange kids. And that's not what he wants. More than playing at an elite level, he wants to play with kids who know him, who know what he's gone through.\n\n“He realizes that he still loves the game, but will only play it under his terms.”\n\nIsn’t that what we all want? What about our kids, too?\n\n“You could offer them the higher-level stuff,” Araton says, “but if it's being forced upon them, and if you're calling up to their bedroom every time there's practice, then it's clear that they don't really want to do it.\n\n“I wouldn't deny an exceptional child that kind of pathway any more than you would, say, if you had a child who (was) a mathematical genius or a classical violinist, you would want them to have the best teachers to best capitalize on their special talent. But the temptation is so great because sports is the most visible thing in the community. …\n\n\"It'll become pretty obvious to a parent if they have someone special. But this whole notion that they can create one by spending significant sums of money, I think it's really overstated.”\n\nAraton points to another interview he did, with Yael Averbuch, the general manager of the New Jersey/New York Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She played for an exclusive club team in high school, won two national championships playing for the University of North Carolina and was drafted professionally.\n\nHer mother said she never had to yell upstairs for practice. Yael was the one yelling to them.\n\nAraton’s sons, like Z, had to figure out where sports fit into their lives. It worked out for them, too.\n\nAlex, who played high school soccer, is a special education teacher and Charly, the high school basketball player (who has grown to about 5-foot-9 today), works in marketing strategies for a fashion brand. He still plays in men’s leagues.\n\nAraton says those middle-grade age groups – 8 to 12, give or take – are the ages where people know the least amount about who their children are as athletes.\n\n“Don’t be disappointed if at the age of 8, they are not willing to do all this stuff and make all that sacrifice,” he says. “They might be ready when they're 11. Kids do things on their own time schedules. So just accept who they are and let them experience sports in the way they want to. They’ll enjoy it more and get more out of it.\n\n“If they're not playing for the idea of feeling good about themselves, about learning to be a coachable kid, and be a good teammate, to play with kids from all different backgrounds and develop their skills at the fundamental level at the age of 7, 8, 9, 10,” Araton says, “then they're playing for the wrong reasons.\n\n“Each shall develop at their own rate. I just think that parents have to chill and let the kids experience it for themselves.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "fullText": "A transfer portal spiraling out of control prompted the new regulatory body for college sports to issue a memo to athletic directors Friday night saying it has “serious concerns” about some of the multimillion-dollar contracts being offered to players.\n\nThe “reminder” from the College Sports Commission came out about an hour before kickoff of the semifinal between Indiana and Oregon in a College Football Playoff that has shared headlines with news of players signing seven-figure deals to move or, in some cases, stay where they are.\n\nThe CSC reminded the ADs that, according to the rules, third-party deals to use players' name, image and likeness “are evaluated at the time of entry in NIL Go, not before, and each deal is evaluated on its own merits.”\n\n\"Without prejudging any particular deal, the CSC has serious concerns about some of the deal terms being contemplated and the consequences of those deals for the parties involved,\" the memo said.\n\nUnder terms of the House settlement that dictated the rules for NIL payments, schools can share revenue with their players directly from a pool of $20.5 million. Third-party deals, often arranged by businesses created to back the schools, are being used as workarounds this so-called salary cap.\n\nThe CSC, through its NIL Go portal, is supposed to evaluate those deals to make sure they are for a valid business purpose and fall within a fair range of compensation for the services being provided.\n\nThe CSC did not list examples of unapproved contracts, but college football has seen its share of seven-figure deals luring players to new schools since the transfer portal opened on Jan. 2.\n\nOne high-profile case involved Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who initially sought to enter the transfer portal and turn his back on a reported deal worth $4 million with the Huskies. Legal threats ensued and Williams changed course and stayed at Washington.\n\n\"Making promises of third-party NIL money now and figuring out how to honor those promises later leaves student-athletes vulnerable to deals not being cleared, promises not being able to be kept, and eligibility being placed at risk,\" the CSC letter said.\n\nThe commission listed two rules about contracts it evaluates, some of which have been termed “agency agreement” or “services agreement” in what look like attempts to bypass the rules.\n\n—\"The label on the contract does not change the analysis; if an entity is agreeing to pay a student-athlete for their NIL, the agreement must be reported to NIL Go within the reporting deadline.\"\n\n—\"An NIL agreement or payment with an associated entity or individual ... must include direct activation of the student-athlete’s NIL rights.\" This is a reference to the practice of “warehousing” NIL rights by paying first, then deciding how to use them later.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Main Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals.  It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.\n\nMain Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals. It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.\n\n“No matter what what happens, whether it’s Main Street, a third party or MLB media, fans are going to have the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday.\n\nMLB took over broadcasts for San Diego in May 2023 after Diamond Sports Group missed a payment to the Padres and added Arizona that July.\n\nColorado joined MLB's distribution in 2024, and Cleveland and Minnesota in 2025. Seattle is being added this season and possibly Washington, which is leaving the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\n\nDiamond was renamed Main Street Sports Group as it emerged out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year and its networks were rebranded as FanDuel.\n\n“Our focus, particularly given the point in the calendar, is to maximize the revenue that’s available to the clubs, whether that’s MLB Media or third party,” Manfred said. “The clubs have control over the timing. They can make a decision to move to MLB Media because of the contractual status now. I think that what's happening right now clubs are evaluating their alternatives. Obviously they’ve made significant payroll commitments already and they’re evaluating the alternatives to find the best revenue source for the year and the best outlet in terms of providing quality broadcasts to their fans.”\n\nManfred said local media provides more than 20% of industry revenue.\n\nMLB and the players' association for 2024 allowed discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue had declined since 2022 or 2023, but they did not reach a similar agreement for 2025.\n\n“We are not providing financial assistance right now,” Manfred said.\n\nHe spoke at a news conference to announce an initiative with Foster Love that envisions 250,000 volunteer hours to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States. At the news conference, MLB staff assembled duffel bags with goods for foster care children.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "fullText": "New details have emerged surrounding Demond Williams and his attempt to enter the transfer portal, shedding light on why Washington officials are refusing to process his request.\n\nAccording to Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports, Williams recently signed a one-year revenue-sharing agreement with the Huskies worth approximately $4 million. The agreement is a Big Ten–approved template used by all conference members and was specifically designed to address scenarios like this.\n\nThe contract evidently prohibits Williams from entering the transfer portal once signed, and restricts his NIL rights from being used by another school. He’s still allowed to pursue outside marketing deals per Dellenger.\n\nAs a result, Washington has declined to enter Williams’ name into the portal, which prevents him from holding conversations with other programs. Dellenger reported that Big Ten Conference commissioner Tony Petitti is heavily involved in the matter, along with other league officials.\n\nAdditionally, the conference is backing Washington’s firm stance. Coincidentally, Petitti is in Seattle this week for a memorial service while discussions continue.\n\nMoreover, Washington officials are expected to communicate later Tuesday with Williams’ representatives regarding next steps. The school also suspects Williams has already spoken with other programs and plans to submit any evidence of tampering to both the conference and the NCAA. LSU is believed to be the program most interested in Williams.\n\nLess than a week before announcing his intention to transfer, Williams signed the new deal at Washington, a development first reported by Pete Nakos of On3. Sources emphasized to Nakos that Williams remains under contract and that Washington expects him to be its starting quarterback in 2026 under head coach Jedd Fisch. The Huskies were also prepared to make Williams one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in college football.\n\nThe situation mirrors a similar case last year involving Wisconsin Badgers defender Xavier Lucas, who withdrew from Wisconsin and enrolled at Miami Hurricanes without entering the portal.\n\nWisconsin claimed Lucas was bound by a two-year NIL agreement and pursued legal action, with attorney Darren Heitner representing Lucas. That lawsuit remains ongoing, and Dellenger noted the language in Williams’ deal closely resembles the template used in the Wisconsin case.\n\nWilliams is coming off a standout sophomore season, throwing for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns while adding 611 rushing yards and six scores. In announcing his intent to transfer Tuesday night, Williams said the decision was made with his future in mind, though Washington appears prepared to enforce the contract he signed just days earlier.\n\n— On3’s Nick Schultz contributed to this article.",

    "description": "\"The jobs this cycle all lack QBs like normal so he's definitely the top QB and offense available for any coach,\" one NFC exec told Yahoo Sports. An AFC assistant added: \"Any scheme fits him.\"",
    "fullText": "When the Cleveland Browns and Las Vegas Raiders interview head coaches in the coming weeks, they know the most important question they must answer: How will we identify and develop a young quarterback?\n\nWhen the New York Giants and Tennessee Titans interview head coaches, they, too, know the crux: First-round quarterbacks Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward need molding and development. The quarterback hopeful for each club is in the house. But how will he grow?\n\nShakeup at the top of the Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals will similarly require answers on a position with major question marks in 2026 and beyond.\n\nThese answers need not all come via offensive head coaches during a hiring cycle riper with defensive candidates than offensive. And in many successful franchises, including the reigning Super Bowl champions, the head coach’s primary responsibility is not to call offensive plays.\n\nBut when teams front young quarterbacks or face questions at quarterback, the pressure to find the offensive panacea sharpens. Coaching searches often skew accordingly.\n\nSo the Baltimore Ravens hold a clear advantage.\n\nBecause as they announced Tuesday night that 18-year head coach John Harbaugh was “relieved of his duties,” the Ravens are the lone team currently looking for a head coach that is not simultaneously searching to clarify their answer at quarterback.\n\nRecruiting coaches while two-time MVP Lamar Jackson is under contract is a luxury.\n\nSure, plenty will argue that just as the Ravens become the most attractive of seven NFL openings and counting, Harbaugh immediately became the most attractive candidate when he hit the market. That doesn’t mean the decision should be baffling. With a Super Bowl-winning coach and an MVP-winning quarterback, it should not be surprising if each believes he has the answers to future success. And if those answers don’t align, a time comes for a change.\n\nBut as the Ravens look for a coach who will end their 13-year Super Bowl drought, they won’t need as strong an emphasis on developing a quarterback.\n\n[Get more Ravens news: Baltimore team feed]\n\nThat could allow them, should they want, to select the best overall candidate first. Their ceiling will immediately be high.\n\n“We have so much talent on this team, and it's just disappointing that we're not able to be the team that's able to execute and win games when we need to win games,” fullback Patrick Ricard said this week. “As long as we have Lamar Jackson, I feel like this team can win a Super Bowl.”\n\nA minority of coaches and executives across the league will argue that a coach in the Shanahan and McVay systems may prefer a more in-structure passer to build their offense around.\n\nBut more often, as the surprise of Harbaugh’s dismissal hit Tuesday, league voices understood the new pecking order of openings.\n\n“The jobs this cycle all lack QBs like normal so he’s definitely the top QB and offense available for any coach,” one NFC executive told Yahoo Sports.\n\nAn AFC assistant added of Jackson: “Any scheme fits him.”\n\nJackson has shown that in eight seasons since the Ravens selected him with the 32nd pick of the 2018 NFL Draft. He’s earned four Pro Bowl berths, three All-Pro honors and two MVP awards while winning 76 of 107 regular-season starts.\n\nIn aggregate, Jackson has completed 64.8% of his passes for 22,608 yards and 187 passing touchdowns to 56 interceptions. His 102.2 career passer rating and 8.25 air yards per attempt currently hold the all-time career records, per Pro Football Reference.\n\nAnd those numbers don’t even include Jackson’s additional 6,522 yards and 35 touchdowns rushing.\n\nHis health has been inconsistent at times, Jackson most recently missing four games and about half of another this season with hamstring and back injuries. But while healthy, he thrived. Consider his Week 18 return from a back injury in Pittsburgh with the AFC North title on the line. While the Ravens lost on a walk-off missed field-goal attempt Sunday night, Jackson completed 11 of 18 passes for 238 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe activated another level in the fourth quarter, with 50- and 64-yard go-ahead touchdown passes to receiver Zay Flowers. The first came despite two defenders seeming to have Jackson wrapped up. Jackson was unfazed.\n\nInsane sack escape and 50-yard TD from Lamar Jackson. \n\nRavens 17, Steelers 13.pic.twitter.com/mgwAU6YIQG\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) January 5, 2026\n\n“Shoot — I cut a nose guard loose, and he somehow slipped out of it and threw the ball [50] yards for a touchdown,” center Tyler Linderbaum said. “That's the kind of ability he has. So, he’s fun to play for. [He’s an] ultra competitor, and any time that ball is snapped to him, and it's in his hands, you know something electrifying can happen.”\n\n“The most electrifying player there is in this game.”\n\nAs reports of tension between Jackson and Harbaugh built this season, Jackson was asked last Thursday if he had a good relationship with Harbaugh.\n\n“Yes, I believe so,” he said. “I don’t know where the noise came from. I don’t know where the noise came from.”\n\nAfter the Ravens’ 26-24 loss Sunday, Jackson was asked about Harbaugh again.\n\nDid he want to see Harbaugh as his head coach next season?\n\n“You’re asking me about next year,” Jackson said. “I’m so caught up in what just happened tonight. I can't focus on that right now, I just told you. Like he asked me, ‘Are you stunned?’\n\n“I’m stunned right now, and I'm still trying to process what's going on. I know we lost, but what the ... you know?”\n\nSure, the emotions of the season’s sudden ending were fresh as Jackson’s Herculean fourth quarter wasn’t enough to advance to a sixth playoff berth in eight years. But Jackson was not the first player to receive a question about his coach’s future at season’s end. He would not have been the first to endorse a leader after a loss, especially one 18 years into his tenure with the organization with a Lombardi Trophy to his name and an AFC championship game berth in partnership with Jackson.\n\nHarbaugh issued his own statement, curiously including a smiley-face emoji as he said goodbye with “disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE & APPRECIATION.”\n\nIs John Harbaugh the first NFL coach to include a smiley face in his statement about being fired? pic.twitter.com/NhHouUIL0C\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) January 6, 2026\n\nThe Ravens' coaching search, as team owner Steve Bisciotti said in a statement, begins. Their ability to move quickly on top defensive candidates including the Los Angeles Chargers’ Jesse Minter, Los Angeles Rams’ Chris Shula and Houston Texans’ Matt Burke could prove to be an asset.\n\n“That’s a dream backfield to have Lamar and Derrick [Henry] and to play with those guys,” Ricard said. “I feel like, as long as they're here, this team has a shot — no matter who else is playing.”",

    "description": "The organization planted seeds of doubt about the Browns’ answer to the most impactful position in sports.\nNeither GM Andrew Berry nor team owner Jimmy Haslam endorsed Sanders as their 2026 answer.",
    "fullText": "On a day when the Cleveland Browns knew fans wanted answers and accountability, team brass didn’t hide the direction the franchise must go.\n\n“The offense, it’s no secret that’s where we’re going to invest most of our resources this offseason,” general manager Andrew Berry said.\n\nTeam owner Jimmy Haslam agreed that “we have a lot of work to do on the roster, particularly on the offensive side of the roster.”\n\nThat neither man crowned any quarterback on their roster as the 2026 leader was telling — not because Shedeur Sanders, Dillon Gabriel and Deshaun Watson have no chance, but because it is clear that none of them has a guarantee.\n\nA new head coach will arrive in Cleveland soon, after the Browns fired Kevin Stefanski after six seasons featured a 45-56 (.446) regular-season record.\n\nThat coach will have meaningful say on who starts at quarterback for the Browns next season and what will be most highly valued at the position.\n\n[Get more Browns news: Cleveland team feed]\n\nThat the Browns will hire an offensive-minded head coach to develop that quarterback is no guarantee: The job will be “to make sure that the offense is run and developed well,” Berry said, “as opposed to necessarily having to be the person that directly does it.”\n\nBut losing, particularly in three- and five-win seasons the last two years, cost Stefanski his job. And the Browns know that finding a lasting quarterback answer is the No. 1 factor that will correlate with turning around their win total.\n\nNo one is saying aloud that Sanders, Gabriel and Watson cannot be the answer. But the organization planted seeds of doubt Monday about the Browns’ answer to the most impactful position in sports.\n\nNeither Berry nor Haslam endorsed Sanders, their starter to end the season, as their 2026 answer. The next head coach will have a say, and Sanders himself acknowledged that “when it comes to those grown-up decisions that’s not me.”\n\nWhat the Browns do know, and were willing to say, is that they need an answer quickly.\n\n“At the end of the day, the National Football League is a quarterback league, right?” seven-time Pro Bowl left guard Joel Bitonio said. “If you have an elite quarterback in this league, it allows you to be a little bit more sustained in your success. And it's not me saying like, ‘Do we know if Shedeur or Dillon or Deshaun or Bailey [Zappe], any of these guys is that guy,’ right?\n\n“We have those guys in our locker room. But until you have a guy that can stay healthy and can be on the field and be that guy for your team, it's hard to have that sustained success. …\n\n“Until you find one that's stable and can lead your team, it's going to be hard to not ride the roller coaster of wins and losses.”\n\nThe Browns do not regret that they evaluated and practiced with four quarterbacks during the offseason and training camp.\n\nConsidering depth was not the problem. Missing on a higher ceiling was.\n\n“We believe in competition in every room on the roster, and quarterback’s no different,” Berry said. “Quarterback is the most important position in sports. We all know that. And part of the equation with quarterback is the evaluation part. Part of it is the development part as well.”\n\nThe Browns traded away the second overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft rather than spend a premium pick on quarterback as some expected. Later in the draft, they selected two quarterbacks — Gabriel in the third round followed by Sanders in the fifth. It was a curious move. And yet, Berry believes philosophically in expending significant resources at quarterback.\n\n“I wouldn't necessarily say draft a quarterback every year, I don't believe it being that,” Berry told Yahoo Sports last June from minicamp. “But if you're in position to make a bet on a quarterback that you think can be a quality starter or some level of high-level proficiency, understand that it's not always going to pan out. That's a bet you should be making because you just never know.”\n\nThe philosophy suggests the Browns will not stay put at quarterback this spring, the question of their acquisition more a question of how rather than if. In their 2025 season, the Browns recognized their transitional stage and built up the roster at some positions. But while their defense posted its second top-five unit in three years, the Browns’ offense ranked bottom-five in offense for the second straight season.\n\nA year after ranking last in scoring, the Browns ranked second-to-last this year. In what Berry and Haslam described as a year of roster “transition,” the franchise evaluated its rookies at length.\n\nThe Browns won three of Sanders’ seven games compared to one of Gabriel's six, wins often considered the “most important” quarterback statistic. In traditional quarterback stats, their performance was mixed.\n\nSanders averaged 193 passing yards per start compared to Gabriel’s 153, while completing 59.5% of his attempts to Gabriel’s 58.9%. But Sanders’ 0.8 touchdown-to-interception ratio (seven touchdowns, nine interceptions in seven games) paled in comparison to Gabriel’s 3.0 (six touchdowns to two interceptions in six games). Sanders’ 72.9 passer rating trailed Gabriel’s 78.9.\n\nSanders earned the right to continue starting and warranting evaluation through season’s end. But with below-league-average metrics, the Browns are not saying right now that he’s earned the right to start next season.\n\n“We saw a lot of progress with Shedeur this year,” Berry said. “I think that’s both mentally, physically, playing the position. He’s still very much a work in progress like many rookie quarterbacks are. But I think we saw some really good things in terms of his playmaking, his accuracy, his ability to extend [plays] with his feet. And I think I’d also give him credit as well as our offensive staff for bringing him along in terms of his pocket management, his situational awareness and things of that nature.\n\n“Now that all being said, we’re going to do our work on the quarterback market. It’s too important of a position and it’s something that has to be solidified. I can’t sit here and tell you today, you know, whether the solution for or the starter in 2026 is internal or external. But it’s something that we’re going to work through over the next several weeks. And quite honestly, the new head coach will also have a lot of input into that as well.”\n\nPerhaps the best thing the Browns can do for their quarterback future is hire the coach they best believe will lead their organization, independent of any single quarterback style.\n\nBerry acknowledged that “schemes, they really do come and go.” An NFC assistant coach whose team helped their quarterback rebound after a coaching change felt no single schematic factor was the answer in their club.\n\n“I think they just need to find the best coach possible,” the assistant told Yahoo Sports. “You just need to hire the best guy for each job of the organization vs. being predetermined to get a QB guru or whatever you think you need stylistically.\n\n“That way you’re able to pivot if it turns out [the quarterback] isn’t the guy, but at least you hired the right coach.”\n\nThis year’s sophomore quarterback class is evidence of that.\n\nSetting a historic pace, teams selected six quarterbacks in the first 12 picks of the 2024 NFL Draft. Second overall pick Jayden Daniels took the Commanders to the NFC Championship game in his first season under center. This year, three more 2024 quarterbacks have led their teams to a playoff berth.\n\nSelected at first, third and 12th respectively, Caleb Williams, Drake Maye and Bo Nix vary in style and NFL early-career experience. While Nix arrived to an organization with coaching stability, receiving play calls from Super Bowl-winning Sean Payton, his counterparts each entered Year 2 with a new head coach. Their two coaching résumés differ vastly, Ben Johnson a first-time head coach who’s calling offensive plays while Mike Vrabel is a second-time head coach calling plays on neither side of the ball.\n\nAnd yet, talent evaluators around the league look at each of their stories and see the success stemming from coach at least as much as quarterback. The “right” coach was hired. Neither his quality or quantity of experience determined whether he was the right coach.\n\nFinding Mr. Right will be Berry’s job in the coming weeks, after which the group will decide how and with whom they want to augment the quarterback room. Doing nothing, while currently on track for a host of 2026 draft picks, including the sixth overall as well as a late first-round selection, would be shocking.\n\nWhile free agency is always an option, 12 of the 14 starting quarterbacks in this year’s postseason were selected in the first round. Three are no longer with the team that initially drafted them, a reminder of success teams have had in recent years finding quarterbacks via trade or free agency.\n\nThat history may be a tell for the Browns brass’s next move. And it may be a tell of Sanders’ chance at keeping his starting job through 2026. Fifth-round quarterbacks face uphill battles. So do quarterbacks selected before a coach had input in that decision.\n\n“I think overall, like as a quarterback, I showed different pieces in different games to all add up to one complete quarterback,” Sanders said. “And that’s what I had to get to in those situations — red-zone situations, field-goal situations, third-down situations, ‘where you at on the field’ situations. So, it was a lot of situations that was good. I feel like this was a good learning year for me, and I’m excited for it. Because like I say, like moving forward I’ll be prepared.\n\n“I did what I was able to do, and I definitely grew from a lot of things. And I got experience now. So, I’m always the same: confidence-wise, I’m there. But like, that’s not in my hands. Like, that’s not my decision.\n\n“I can’t speak on what other people feel.”",

    "fullText": "We have elevated DT Ricky Barber and WR River Cracraft from the practice squad pic.twitter.com/LnFS6NHTYI\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) January 3, 2026\n\nKingsbury will be a hot name this offseason despite having a down year for the Commanders, but will he actually leave? He’s already been linked to the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders job as a fit, but what about going to a division rival? ESPN’s Jordan Raanan said the Giants will cast a wide net in their head coaching search, but Kingsbury might be on the outside looking in.\n\n“Commanders’ offensive coordinator Kingsbury, who also has experience as an NFL head coach with the Cardinals, is considered a bright offensive mind. The question is if he’s the right fit for the New York market.” – Jordan Raanan, ESPN\n\nThe Giants interview list includes Mike McCarthy, Chris Shula, Antonio Pierce and more as they cast a wide net. https://t.co/o2weOafxQt\n\n— Jordan Raanan (@JordanRaanan) January 2, 2026\n\nIt would be a surprise if Kingsbury doesn’t even get an interview with the Giants, given his track record with young quarterbacks, and what he could do with Jaxson Dart. It sounds like they could be interested in Kingsbury, but he’s likely more of a tier two or tier three candidate for the Giants.\n\nThe former TCU standout is getting a look down the stretch with Tunsil out. Coleman looks more accomplished and urgent in everything he does. He is not the finished article by any stretch of the imagination, but his upturn in consistency indicates that all hope is not lost just yet.\n\nThis hasn’t gone unnoticed by Quinn. The coach thinks Coleman has learned a great deal in his second campaign. The athletic upside has always been there, but the lineman has developed a new sense of resilience that is standing him in exceptional stead.\n\n“I think…he has learned a lot here in year two. This is a resilient guy that can do a lot of things based on his athleticism, him learning and going through the hard moments.”Dan Quinn via Commanders.com\n\nColeman will start at left tackle again in Week 18 against the Philadelphia Eagles if he gets the all-clear to participate. He’s listed as questionable with a knee problem, but he practiced in full on Friday. That’s a positive sign, which gives him a fighting chance of finishing his campaign on a high note.\n\nThe Commanders elevated Cracraft from the practice squad to the active roster Saturday ahead of Sunday’s game against the Eagles. Cracraft has been elevated for consecutive weeks, finishing Christmas Day’s loss against the Cowboys with just one snap on the special-teams unit. With Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel, Treylon Burks and Chris Moore all healthy and active, Cracraft is likely in line to see the same minimal special-teams snap share in Sunday’s game.\n\n1) What were your big takeaways from the Week 16 matchup between the Commanders and Eagles?\n\nI do think it’s silly how the Commanders took such offense to the Eagles going for two late in the game. Why wait until then to show that kind of fight? Also, laughable to hear Dan Quinn talk tough about how Washington was going to see the Eagles again in two weeks. When it seemed like the Eagles will be resting their starters, which we now know is exactly the case. For Quinn to be afraid of going for it on fourth down (punted on 4th-and-4 from the minus 40-yard line down 11 with 9 minutes to go … and punted on 4th-and-6 from the minus 44-yard line down 11 with just 6:44 to go) and then act all tough in the postgame presser? That’s unserious behavior to me.\n\n2) How far do you think the Eagles will get in the post-season and what do you think will be their biggest secret to success or stumbling block?\n\nI think the Eagles can win the Super Bowl. Vic Fangio’s defense is awesome. Jalen Hurts has played well in the biggest games of his career. There is no juggernaut the Eagles simply can’t beat.\n\nDo you expect the Commanders will try especially hard this week or are they going to pack it in and rest key players with an eye to the 2026 season? How do fans want the team to approach this game?\n\nI don’t know that the Commanders will try especially hard to win, but they will certainly try as hard to win as they did in the last matchup (where the playoffs were already out of reach). Reports are that Dan Quinn still has the locker room, the players are still bought in, and the coaches and players still want to win games. So I’m sure they’ll try their hardest to win, just like last time, but the deck will be stacked against them due to all their injuries.\n\nThe decision to rest or play starters is not just about protecting players or gaining draft position, it’s also about putting together some good tape so the front office can actually evaluate the talent on the team. So many players have been injured or are returning from injury, so many players have been moved to different positions or roles (particularly on defense) due to injuries and due to Dan Quinn taking over the defense a few weeks ago, that it’s probably more important for the front office to get additional tape on these players playing their best in order to evaluate them than it is to get a slightly higher draft spot. What good does a better draft pick do if you can’t even evaluate your biggest team needs effectively? For this reason, as well as for pride and division rivalry, I think most fans will be rooting for the starters to play and the team to play well. In my opinion, the only reason to tank is if you need a top 2 pick for a QB, quality players at other positions can be found later in the draft.\n\nTampa Bay’s 16-14 win over the Panthers keeps it alive, but now the Bucs need the Saints to beat the Falcons to make the postseason.\n\nthe showdown game for first place in the NFC South did not yield a division winner, at least not yet.\n\nSo it went on the opening day of the final weekend of the NFL’s regular season. The Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara, California, to secure the NFC West title and the conference’s No. 1 playoff seed. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Carolina Panthers but will have to wait until Sunday to see whether that will be enough for them to win the NFC South.\n\nThe playoff field is taking shape and will be fully formed when Sunday’s play is done.\n\nThe Buccaneers helped their postseason cause. But they didn’t punch their playoff ticket, at least not yet.\n\nThe opening game of the final weekend of the NFL’s regular season did not determine as much as it could have. The Buccaneers beat the Panthers, 16-14, in the rain Saturday at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. But they will have to wait until Sunday to find out whether they will secure their fifth straight NFC South title and the NFC’s No. 4 playoff seed.\n\nThey need the Atlanta Falcons to lose Sunday to the New Orleans Saints. If the Falcons beat the Saints, that would create a three-way tie for the division lead with matching 8-9 records. The Panthers would win the division in that case, based on tiebreakers.\n\n“We did everything we could today,” Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield told ESPN afterward. “Sit back and see what happens tomorrow.”\n\nThe final show@BankofAmerica | #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/UoGpgmFVLs\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) January 4, 2026\n\nCommanders edge rusher Von Miller needs one sack Sunday vs. the Eagles to finish the season with nine sacks and collect another $500,000 in incentives. pic.twitter.com/eDSPxZ9Lls\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 4, 2026\n\nCommanders WR Deebo Samuel has $650,000 on the line Sunday vs. the Eagles.

Over-promoted and out of his depth.\n\nA first half at Celtic Park that offered such promise made way for another second half of dismal collapse. They had Rangers on the ropes at the break but you always sensed that they needed a second goal to put them on the floor and maybe a third just to put them out for the count. These are Celtic's frailties these days. One goal is never enough.\n\nThose goals never came despite the chances they had. Once Rangers started to fight back, they hit Celtic with three blows in 21 minutes. Ruthless. The Celtic lights went out in an instant. From light to dark in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe colossal weaknesses in Nancy's formation, the giant amounts of space conceded by his players were the problem again. That and their inability to stay in the fight. Was their feeble demise a window to their collective soul, a reflection of their spirit under the new, and surely doomed, manager? It looked like that. A lost dressing room? Perhaps. Just because it's a cliche doesn't mean it isn't true.",

    "description": "Readers of the L.A. Times Sports section share their thoughts on USC losing in the Alamo Bowl, Lincoln Riley's coaching job, college bowl games, the Lakers and Bill Plaschke.",
    "fullText": "It's very obvious to this USC diehard fan, Lincoln Riley is not delivering on his commitment to restore Trojans football to national prominence as head coach.\n\nStop promising better results, hiring new assistant coaches, and commenting on the difficulty of the schedule.\n\nAfter USC lost to unranked Texas Christian in the Alamo Bowl to finish a 9-4 season, coach Lincoln Riley said, \"The arrow is pointing straight up.\" He apparently didn't receive a compass for Christmas.\n\nIf USC plays again in the Alamo Bowl, the Trojans should bring their own officials. ’Nuf said.\n\nAfter losing to TCU in overtime, the Trojans will always \"Remember the Alamo (Bowl).\" With that, the Men of Troy seem to break my heart every football season. Not playing Notre Dame anymore is sacrilegious. Last but not least, Lincoln Riley is an overrated head football coach. Fight On!\n\nThe Ohio State University loses the big playoff game and Ole Miss advances without former coach Lane Kiffin. I imagine millions, like me, hope Ole Miss will win the whole thing without Kiffin.\n\nTimes sports columnist Bill Plaschke appropriately describes how unique and beautiful the Rose Bowl is as a football venue. However, he’s completely off base to advocate for the CFP national championship game to be hosted there. Unmentioned in his column is the fact that Rose Bowl's primary tenant, UCLA, is currently trying to hightail it for the sleek confines of SoFi Stadium. Does Bill really believe that the CFP management committee won’t notice?\n\nOne can add \"lack of class\" to Oregon's ridiculous collection of ugly uniforms based on their performance in the Orange Bowl. Leading 16-0 with less than two minutes in the game while at the Texas Tech two-yard line, the Ducks pushed across an unnecessary touchdown instead of going into the victory formation. Let's hope they get washed out in the semifinals next week.\n\nSorry to see Jerry Neuheisel leave UCLA to join traitor and coaching has-been Chip Kelly at Northwestern. Perhaps young Jerry will skip out after a year — just like his boss does so often.\n\nHaving recently played Detroit, the Rams must have caught a case of \"Dan Campbell-ism\" that is now infecting both the NFL and college games. Definition: Going for it on fourth down while eschewing a 95% likelihood of a made field goal early in the game, all while demonstrating no confidence in your defense. Think those three points would have come in handy at the end of the Rams' loss vs. Atlanta?\n\nThe Rams' consecutive losses recently turned the McVay Rams to the Oy Vay Rams.\n\nThe only positive words for the Lakers that I read in \"Pistons dominate the paint\" by Thuc Nhi Nguyen were, \"The Lakers have eight of their next nine games against teams with losing records.\" That's sad!\n\nThe Lakers coughed the ball up 21 times against the Pistons the other night. I haven't seen that many turnovers since I was at a pastry shop in Solvang.\n\nLuka Doncic is an incredible offensive player. Maybe best in the NBA. But when you’re giving up 20-plus points in layups on the other end, your value drops significantly. “The Trade” was not nearly as lopsided as everyone is saying.\n\nBill Plaschke's New Year's Day column on Los Angeles sports as a saving grace in very difficult times was a home run, touchdown and three-point shot all at one time. Bill had an incredibly difficult 2025, but it was inspirational to read how he was able to get through it with a love of sports getting a huge assist.

    "description": "Now that the Kansas City Chiefs have committed to building a new stadium and team headquarters in Kansas, what’s next for the Truman Sports Complex?",
    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Now that the Kansas City Chiefs have committed to building a new stadium and team headquarters in Kansas, what’s next for the Truman Sports Complex?\n\nWhile the Royals could still renew their lease with Jackson County, county legislator Manny Abarca says it’s time to start thinking about the future of the land.\n\n“At the end of 2031, December 1, something will change and we want to be ready for that with a plan, with a strategy, if we’ve got to tear down one or two stadiums, we should be prepared for that, not waiting for after the fact,” Abarca said.\n\nAbarca wrote a letter to Jackson County Executive Phil LeVota on Wednesday, with a plan to use the existing Repair, Maintenance, Management, and Operations (RMMO) fund to set aside money for the potential demolition of one or both stadiums and the redevelopment of the land.\n\n“We’ve got to have a strategic plan going forward,” Abarca said.\n\n“That opportunity of us, scrapping some of that maintenance and repair money towards the strategic plan is still within our RMMO accounts. So, there’s some opportunity. We just have to be willing to do it.”\n\nCurrently, a 3/8 cent sales tax sends roughly $55 million annually to the complex’s upkeep and renovations. Saving half of that money over the course of the next 5 years could amount to north of $137 million.\n\nAs for what’s next for the land, Abarca says it could be of huge benefit for the county.\n\n“I think we can look at that as a county park, as a county asset. There were houses there before and so I think there’s an opportunity to look at that as a public housing option if there aren’t stadiums there. It’s adjacent to our Rock Island corridor, which is currently a bike route, but could be a mass transit route. There’s a lot of opportunity, right? Its geographic location is really center of our county.”\n\nWhether the Royals decide to stay at Truman or leave, Abarca says it’s time to be prepared for the next phase of that land.\n\n“Before taxpayers were asked to fund stadiums, this was a green space. These were neighborhoods. These were communities. There’s vibrancy that was there before. Now, instead of walking away with an abandoned stadium, that can be 30 to 50 to $70 million to tear down and maybe two of those, it can at least be a green space.”",

(WMBD/WYZZ) — Richwoods is back in the winner’s circle in Pekin.\n\nAmarion Smith-Holley scored 24 points and Tony Bradford added 14 to lead Richwoods to a 61-54 win over Chicago Mount Carmel in the title game of the 60th Pekin Insurance Holiday Tournament on Wednesday. It marks the first Pekin title for Richwoods in 16 years.\n\n“We hadn’t won the tournament since 2009,” said Bradford, who transferred to the Knights from Manual. “This is my first year here and we are already seeing improvement. We’re winning and it feels good to come back and win.”\n\nThe Knights trailed Mount Carmel, 43-42, heading into the fourth quarter. Bradford hit a jumper from the baseline with 47 remaining to give the Knights a three-point lead and then Richwoods stole in the inbounds pass.\n\nThe win comes after 12 days after the Knights lost a 19-point lead in a 73-68 loss at Manual. Richwoods (10-2) lost a 10-point game at United Township right before the Manual game.\n\n“It means a lot to turn all those L’s into lessons,” said Smith-Holley. “To come in here and play hard. Every loss we had, we put behind us. We were picking everybody’s hands up. We were down in the fourth quarter but we came back.”\n\nAlso in Pekin, Springfield beat Washington, 64-57, in the tournament’s third-place game. James Johnson led the Panthers with 18 points.\n\nMorton finished fifth at the Pekin Holiday Tournament following a 61-52 win over Chicago Leo. Alex McKie scored 19 points to lead the Potters.\n\nManual finished the Pontiac Holiday Tournament with a 64-49 loss to Lockport.

    "description": "UCLA head coach Cori Close was frustrated with the lack of media coverage after UCLA beat Ohio State on Sunday, but postgame after UCLA's win over Penn State on Wednesday was a different story.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - No. 4 UCLA head coach Cori Close made waves Sunday after the Bruins' thrilling victory over no. 19 Ohio State with her displeasure at the lack of media coverage for the matchup of two Big Ten powerhouses.\n\nThe Bruins outlasted the Buckeyes in an 82-75 victory on the road in a return to conference play with double-digit scoring performances by five different Bruins to secure the win. But after the game, Close was met with an empty conference room and just one reporter, Benjamin Royer of the Orange County Register, over the phone to discuss the game.\n\nClose was frustrated, to say the least.\n\n\"If I'm being really blunt with you, the energy in the building was great, but having no media here at all from either team or either -- no AP, nothing, doesn't say a lot. We're the only double-ranked game out today; the only one in the country, and we had no media day today. No media here... Like for the only game that had two ranked opponents to not have more coverage over this particular game -- disappointing honestly, \" Close said after UCLA's win (via Benjamin Royer of the Orange County Register).\n\nUCLA women's bball coach Cori Close said that I (from Los Angeles, not in Columbus), was the only media member to to talk with her after UCLA's win vs OSU. Close said she didn't mind if I printed her response, so here it is in full.\n\nClose's full remarks are in the photo below: pic.twitter.com/lQ3kiMcBXf\n\n— Benjamin Royer (@thebenroyer) December 28, 2025\n\nClose's words quickly took over over online discourse and revealed two key things: coverage of women's sports still suffers in the face of other sports, namely college football, despite the meteoric rise in popularity for women's basketball, and the overall media landscape is suffering from a lack of resources for road coverage.\n\nWhen the Bruins stepped onto the court next for a dominant 97-61 over Penn State, Close and senior center Lauren Betts were met with a different sight after the game: a Zoom conference full of reporters from outlets like the Orange County Register, Los Angeles Times, and of course, The Sporting Tribune.\n\nClose made it clear in her opening statement that her frustrations earlier in the week stemmed from her desire to continue to promote women's sports and the game that she loves and the passion she has for her team.\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA guard, Kiki Rice (1) dribbling during a NCAA basketball game against Cal Poly on December 16, 2025 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n\"The reality of what my comments were after the Ohio State game were, I have two really passionate agendas in regards to this: I want to be a pioneer of growing the game period. I want to really be a part of the surge that's happening and and I want to be a part of telling these amazing stories that these players have, and they're incredible young women as well as amazing basketball players,\" Close said.\n\nShe continued, \"This is nothing to take away from any men's program at all. I love men's sports just as much as I love women's sports. But, if there was a top five team all year long, and they were playing another ranked team, I don't care what time of year it would be, I think there would be more coverage there. So I just want to fight for our players getting that same proportionate coverage and exposure that I believe they've earned.\"\n\nWomen's basketball has experienced more growth than ever in recent years with stars like Caitlin Clark and Paige Bueckers, now both WNBA superstars with the Indiana Fever and Dallas Wings respectively, shining a massive spotlight on the sport at both the college and professional levels.\n\nUCLA has been a part of that growth as well. An elite squad with several of their starters projected to be first-round picks in the upcoming WNBA Draft, the Bruins under Cori Close have brought a stellar brand of basketball to Westwood. Last season's Final Four-reaching squad brought in over 88,000 fans to Pauley Pavilion to watch a team that ranked no. 1 in the country for most of the season and were led by a superstar in Betts.\n\nJordan Teller - The Sporting Tribune\n\nCenter Lauren Betts #51 high fives guard Kiki Rice #1 of the UCLA Bruins during an NCAA basketball game against the Oregon Ducks, Sunday December 7, 2025 in Los Angeles, Calif.\n\nBetts also spoke after the Penn State win on the issue of media coverage that the Bruins have contended.\n\n\"You have two really amazing teams, and I don't think that's something that should hopefully ever happen again [lack of coverage],\" Betts said. \"So, just continuing to grow the game in any way that we can, and to make sure that we speak out on situations like that. But, obviously I have a lot of respect for Coach Cori and what she had to say about it.\"\n\nClose has been a vocal advocate for the media and for coverage of her team and women's basketball as a whole, and the gratitude she has for reporters at her team's games is something she makes a point of stating in many postgame conferences.\n\nRobert Talamantes- The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA G Gabriela Jaquez (11) scores a fast break layup during an NCAA basketball game against the Michigan Wolverans, Wednesday January 1st, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThere are systemic issues facing the modern sports media landscape, issues acquiring access and resources among them, but just as there are issues there has also been a proliferation of outlets that serve a wide variety of niches in the athletic world. Close wants to serve both traditional and non-traditional outlets in terms of access and availability so that she can continue shining a light on the accomplishments her team has achieved and continue to elevate women's sports as a whole.\n\n\"I always want to be solution minded. I don't want to be just a complainer,\" Close said. \"I really want us to be a team that makes ourselves available, that gives good stories to tell... I think there needs to be access for non-traditional media outlets, as long as you're going for the right reasons, and you're really a part of wanting to tell the stories of these women. I think the days of limiting it to just traditional media outlets are over if we want to continue because.. there are so many squeezes on those traditional media outlets, I think we can't limit ourselves to what's worked in the past or how we've done things in the past.\"\n\nJohn Panganiban-The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA Bruins Coach Cori Close breaking down the game for Avary Cain (2) during an NCAA basketball game against Colgate, Sunday November 10th, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe impact of covering women's programs like UCLA goes well beyond entertainment factor. This new wave of women's sports popularity and the stories that athletes tell serves a humanitarian purpose as well. The inspiration that athletes can bring elevates the lives of the next generation that watches them.\n\nFollowing Betts' portion of Wednesday's conference. Close shared a story that illustrates that impact potential. Betts spoke with ESPN in an article published March 2025 about her mental health journey and after Wednesday's game, Close said that Betts met with one young girl waiting for an autograph that said Betts' article saved her own life. Betts came back to the locker room with happy tears in her eyes.\n\n\"That's just a real time example about why storytelling of these amazing women are so important.\"",

    "title": "A 2025 Year-in-Review of UNC sports in the AP Top 25",
    "description": "There’s been some ups and downs among UNC’s three big teams in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Usually in the early part of the week, one post that gets published here at Tar Heel Blog is our weekly rundown of the AP Top 25 rankings. With football now into bowl season — and UNC not particularly relevant in 2025 — and basketball season in full swing, we usually take a look at the newest AP Poll and highlight where the UNC men’s and women’s basketball teams landed.\n\nHowever, with there not being a particularly large amount of games last week over Christmas, the AP is not releasing new polls this week. Therefore, instead of just reposting the same rankings as last week, I thought we could use these final couple days of 2025 to look back at how the various Tar Heel teams performed in this year’s AP Top 25 rankings, which for the purposes of basketball at least, includes the end of last season.\n\nWeeks Ranked: 8 (out of a possible 20)\n\nHighest Ranking: #12 (first on 12/15, still currently)\n\nUNC’s 2025 in men’s basketball has been a tale of two halves. The Tar Heels quite famously struggled on the court for much of the stretch run of last year’s basketball season, as they barely squeaked into the NCAA Tournament, having to take part in the First Four. They won a game in Dayton, but then lost to Ole Miss in the first round, ending the season on a whimper.\n\nHowever, coach Hubert Davis remade the roster over the offseason, and so far it’s paid off. Caleb Wilson looks like a star, Henri Veesaar has been the perfect fit in the frontcourt, and the team has answers all over the court in general. Carolina is 12-1 on the season so far, and have a couple of potential big wins for the résumé come tournament time. They still have to prove it now in ACC play, but the Tar Heels are in a good place going into 2026.\n\nHighest Ranking: #8 (2/24 last season)\n\nOn the other side of things, the UNC women have appeared in every AP Poll in 2025. They were a good team last year, getting an NCAA Tournament #3 seed and advancing to the Sweet 16. (The less said about what happened there, the better.) They started out this year ranked, and while they’ve slid a little bit from where they started the year, they’re still on track to earn another high seed come tournament time.\n\nCoach Courtney Banghart’s team’s issue both this season and last is that they’ve been a good team, they just haven’t been able to take the step to great. They’ve played games against the UConns and South Carolinas of the world, they just haven’t been able to pull off a win. The potential is certainly there for the program to get to that tier, but they’re not there yet.\n\nEnd of 2024 season ranking: none",

    "description": "Will Smith, Miguel Rojas, Andy Pages, Luka Doncic and so many others delivered marquee moments that helped me endure a terrible 2025.",
    "fullText": "It was the last story I wrote before everything changed.\n\nIt was Jan. 5, 2025, and I was marveling at the Rams gumption in their short-handed loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\n“It was weird,” I wrote. “It was wild.”\n\nI was so witty. I was so wrong.\n\nTwo days later, I was fleeing for my life, steering my car down narrow Altadena streets with a fireball at my back and a nightmarish future sprawled across the smoke-filled streets ahead.\n\nThe year 2025 was more tumultuous than any silly football game and its accompanying overwrought metaphors. It was a year that knocked me flat, tearing me apart from so many things that once anchored me, setting me afloat in a sea of guilt and despair and ultimate uncertainty.\n\nToday, I have a home but no home. My days are filled with the beeps and growls of bulldozers. My nights are draped in the silence of emptiness. What was once one of the coolest secrets in Los Angeles has become a veritable ghost town, the vast empty spaces populated by howling coyotes and scrounging bears.\n\nA lot has changed in the 12 months since the Eaton Fire spared my house but destroyed my Altadena neighborhood. I say a daily prayer of thanks that I did not endure the horror of the 19 people who lost their lives and thousands more who lost their homes. I am beyond fortunate to live in what was left behind.\n\nBut virtually nothing was left behind. Venerable manicured homes have been replaced by weed-choked vacant lots. Familiar local businesses are now empty parking lots. There is the occasional sighting of new construction, but far more prevalent is “For Sale” signs that have seemingly been there for months.\n\nAfter living in the limbo of hotels and Airbnbs for two months while my home was remediated, I was blessed to return to four walls and running water, but beset with the guilt of having a front-row seat to the pain of so many who lost everything. I was spared, but nobody in Los Angeles was spared, and it wasn’t until halfway through the year that I noticed a consistent light from the strangest source.\n\nEvery night, I would watch the Dodgers. At least once every couple of weeks, I would attend a Sparks game with my daughter, MC. Soon, there would be Saturdays with one of our college football teams, then Sundays with the NFL then, the baseball playoffs, leading to the insane Game 7 and morphing into the annual Lakers winter drama.\n\nThe highs, the lows, the dramatics, the desperation, it was all there when nothing was there, it was the feeling that even with everything gone, you still belonged to something.\n\nFrom Dodgers exhilaration to Laker despair, from USC football frustration to UCLA women’s basketball greatness, sports has been the bright wallpaper on a year of Southland darkness.\n\nIt is sports that kept me grounded, kept me steady and somehow kept me believing.\n\nIn the worst year of my life, it was sports that saved me.\n\nThe path back to normalcy began two weeks after the Eaton fire, when I left my temporary hotel room to attend a press conference for the Dodgers’ latest Japanese import, Roki Sasaki.\n\n“Invincible,” I wrote about the team’s rebuilt roster, a word that was so comforting during such a time when everything in life felt tenuous.\n\nI came back to the hotel after the press conference, wrote my story then, like thousands of others in my situation, packed up and moved to another hotel.\n\nSoon thereafter I was awakened late one night with the news of the Lakers stunning acquisition of Luka Doncic. I wrote this column from a rental house while preparing to move to yet another new place. My clothes were in a plastic grocery bag. My house was still in shambles. In Doncic, as least, there was hope.\n\nSeveral days later I attended the Doncic press conference, asked a question, and Doncic asked me to repeat it. Turns out, it wasn’t a language barrier, it was a sound barrier. I was speaking too softly. It was then I noticed that the trauma from the fire had exacerbated my Parkinson’s Disease, which affected my voice, one of the many symptoms which later led me to acknowledging my condition in a difficult mid-summer column.\n\nGood news returned in early March when it was announced that the Dodgers had made Dave Roberts the richest manager in baseball, giving him a new four-year, $32.4 million contract. In a bit of dumb luck that hasn’t stopped me from bragging about it since, 10 years ago I was the first one to publicly push for Roberts’ hiring. In such unstable times in our city, Roberts had become the new Tommy Lasorda, and his presence became a needed jolt of smile.\n\nIn early April, I wrote a column I never thought I’d write — that Bronny James had been transformed from circus to contributor. I also wrote a column that I maybe wish I hadn’t written so soon, that JJ Redick was a Laker success.\n\nIn late May I sadly said goodbye to my second family when I wrote about the end of my 22-year run on ESPN’s popular “Around the Horn” game show. It wasn’t the first time in 2025 that a column brought me to tears, witness the video immediately after the fire. Agreed, I spent the year showing so much emotion for someone who had gotten so lucky. But I’m guessing I wasn’t alone.\n\nTwo weeks later I wrote about my new family, the group of boxers I have joined in my fight against Parkinson’s. That was the toughest column I have ever written, as I was acknowledging something I refused to admit for five years. But the fire had seemingly set the disease ablaze, and I could hide it no longer.\n\nThe year continued with columns about the soon-to-be-retiring Clayton Kershaw, the greatest Dodger pitcher with the greatest entrance song. Hearing “We Are Young” when he took the mound consistently gave me hope that, through the treacheries of a summer that marked the escalation of those insane ICE raids, we can continue to strive for rebirth.\n\nThat’s what sports consistently provided in 2025, the hope that from beneath the rubble, we could all fly again.\n\nI voiced this hope in a Rams preview column that predicted they would go to the Super Bowl. I later wrote a Rams column predicting they would actually win the Super Bowl. I stand by my stories.\n\nAll of which led to a series of Dodger playoff columns that hopefully reflected the building energy of a town enthralled. After their Game 7 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays, I was so spent that I hyperventilated for what felt like an hour.\n\n“In the end, they not only ran it back, they sprinted it back, they slugged it back, and then, finally, they literally Will-ed it back,” I wrote.\n\nIn hindsight those words could have been written not only about a team, but a city, fighting back, staying strong, the results of its struggle mirroring the Dodgers’ consecutive championships, punching through desperation, from struggle to strength.\n\nIn 2025, sports showed me that life can get better, life will be better, that if we hang in there long enough we can all hit that Miggy Ro homer, make that Andy Pages catch, stay forever young.\n\nAnd thus I offer a heartiest and hopeful welcome to 2026.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "The Indiana high school boys basketball upcoming 2025-26 season like others across the country, is in full swing as the winter sports seasons have commenced.\n\nContinuing to top Indiana high school boys basketball are the Fishers Tigers, which is off to a sizzling 8-0 start after going 30-1 last season. The Tigers are back with plenty of talent dotted along their roster, but who else should we watch for out of Indiana when it comes to the state’s top teams?\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory.\n\nHere’s a look at the top 25 high school boys basketball teams in the state of Indiana according to the Massey Ratings, which ranks teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule and margin of victory, as of Dec. 30.\n\nFishers Tigers last year were just a bucket away from repeating as IHSA Class 4A state champions, falling in a heartbreaking, 67-66 decision to Jeffersonville. The team returns plenty of talent from a year ago as they continue to hold the No. 1 spot in our second set of Indiana high school boys basketball rankings. The Tigers brings back a pair of junior guards in Jason Gardner Jr. and Cooper Zachary, whom combined for around 26 points per game a season ago. Coming off a 30-1 season, the Tigers remain the team to beat as they’re off to a strong start through eight games. Gardner Jr. leads the team currently in scoring at 21.3 points per contest.\n\nSpeaking of another Indiana high school boys basketball team that last year ended up falling to Jeffersonville along the way in the Class 4A state tournament was Lawrence North, as they fell to the eventual champions in a 56-49 decision. The Wildcats bring back one of the state’s top power forwards in senior Brennan Miller, who averaged 13.4 points and 8.6 rebounds last season. Also watch out for forwards Kai McGrew and Kenneth Lampley, respectively. Lawrence North has yet to drop a contest as of yet through six games.\n\nCarmel started off the season with a football-like score of a game against No. 12 Zionsville, winning 35-28 to tip things off. Since then, the Greyhounds have been off and running through the Indiana high school boys basketball season so far. The month of January is certainly going to test the mettle of Carmel as they have matchups slated against No. 4 Cathedral (Jan. 3), No. 5 Plainfield (Jan. 16) and No. 20 Westfield (Jan. 10), respectively.\n\nThe Cathedral Fighting Irish dropped down a spot in our first set of regular season rankings in Indiana as they started the preseason at No. 3. Detroit Mercy commitment Keaton Aldridge, who averaged 11.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists last season, is back in the lineup. Another key player that’s back for the Fighting Irish this season is guard Julien Smith, who was second on the team in scoring in 2024-25 at 13.5 points per game. Both players have come on strong this season for the Fighting Irish as Aldridge leads the team with 18.5 points, 9.5 rebounds a game and Smith is averaging 18.3, respectively.\n\nRounding out the Top 5 of the Indiana high school boys basketball rankings is the Plainfield Quakers, which went 16-8 in the 2024-25 season. The Quakers have a solid roster coming back that includes senior power forward Noah Smith, who is committed to DePaul. The three-star forward has provided the punch in the front court for Plainfield as Smith is averaging 20.6 points and 8.6 rebounds per contest this winter.\n\n6. Crown Point Bulldogs (6-0)\n7. Mt Vernon Marauders (10-2)\n8. Pike Red Devils (7-1)\n9. La Lumiere School Lakers (3-1)\n10. Ben Davis Giants (4-2)\n\n11. Noblesville Millers (5-4)\n12. Zionsville Eagles (5-4)\n13. Silver Creek Dragons (8-1)\n14. Crispus Attucks Tigers (5-2)\n15. Roncalli Royals (6-0)\n\n16. Riley Wildcats (5-0)\n17. Penn Kingsmen (5-2)\n18. Brownsburg Bulldogs (6-3)\n19. North Huskies (6-0)\n20. Westfield Shamrocks (3-3)\n\n21. Saint Joseph Huskies (7-3)\n22. North Central Panthers (4-3)\n23. Homestead Spartans (7-2)\n24. Northridge Raiders (7-1)\n25. Portage Indians (10-0)\n\nFor Indiana high school boys basketball fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "description": "After skiing and snowboarding for decades and teaching my kids the winter sports, I have great tips for first-time beginners hitting the slopes.",
    "fullText": "I've been skiing and snowboarding my whole life, and I've even taught my children how to tackle the slopes.\n\nEvery so often, while riding the chairlift, I look down upon some out-of-control skier in soaked-through jeans, a snow-flecked sweatshirt, and cotton gloves. A few moments later, they crash into some obstacle and tangle themselves among their skis and poles.\n\nIt reminds me that although these sports can be fun winter activities, if you're not properly dressed or prepared, you're putting yourself and others at risk.\n\nWhether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, here are a few tips for staying safe on the mountain.\n\nSlope safety begins at home. Before you leave, consider your outfit.\n\nYou'll definitely want waterproof snow pants and a jacket that will keep the wind and rain off of you, but your layers don't have to be anything fancy.\n\nTo start, you may be able to cobble together something warm from what you already own. Try wool sweaters, synthetic running shirts, and that random fleece vest that you own but never wear.\n\nI think it's pointless for a new skier to drop hundreds of dollars on gear, but there are a few body parts worth investing in (hands, feet, head). If you're going to spend money on anything, invest in good gloves.\n\nBeyond that, ski socks are priceless in keeping toes warm. A good neck gaiter and a basic pair of goggles can prevent your nose and eyes from dripping icicles, too.\n\nWhen picking out your gear, keep in mind that anything made of cotton has no place on the mountain.\n\nWhen cotton gets wet — an inevitability for first-time skiers and snowboarders who spend a lot of time on the ground or anyone who's prone to sweating — the material absorbs the moisture, remains wet, and makes you cold.\n\nChoose synthetic materials or natural fibers like wool that help to wick away water from the body and keep you warm.\n\nWhether you're renting or investing in your first pair of ski or snowboard boots, know that they should be snug.\n\nThe boots are meant to react to your feet's movements, so they have to be a little tight. However, they shouldn't be cutting off your circulation.\n\nIf they're uncomfortable in the rental shop, they're going to feel terrible on the mountain.\n\nDo yourself a favor and make sure they feel as close to perfect as possible before you hit the chairlift. The employees in ski shops should be able to help.\n\nOnce you arrive at the mountain, don't look to tackle anything above your level.\n\nIf you're a beginner, head straight for the bunny slopes. There's no shame in learning to turn, stop, and not kill yourself or someone else on the mountain's gentlest run.\n\nThe fastest way to get off the bunny hill is to take a one-hour lesson to help you acquire the basic skills to become a more competent rider.\n\nAfter you gain the fundamentals, progress in order. Conquering the bunny hill doesn't mean you're ready for black diamonds.\n\nHead to green-circle beginner trails to practice your turns and technique. After getting comfortable with those skills on that terrain, try the blue-square intermediate trails.\n\nPro tip: Keep in mind that trail markings are not universal from mountain to mountain. A black diamond in the Poconos usually isn't as difficult as a black diamond in Colorado.\n\nWe're heading into 2026 and not the aughts — a time when people didn't seem to truly understand that speed, hard surfaces, and bare skulls made for dangerous combinations on the slopes.\n\nWhether you're a beginner or a pro, you'll want a helmet. You can usually rent these if needed.\n\nTaking an in-person lesson is the best way to really get the hang of skiing, but here are a few tips and stances to get you started.\n\nFirst-time skiers need to remember two foods: pizza and french fries.\n\nKeep a gentle bend in your knees and shape your skis like a slice of pizza to achieve a more controlled stance, then proceed down the mountain at a reduced speed. Thinner pizza slices make you go faster, and wider ones slow you down.\n\nWhen you're ready to go faster, shaping your skis more parallel, like french fries, will send you straight down.\n\nSnowboarders have fewer food terms to remember, but you'll want to loosely bend your knees and carve back and forth across the mountain to limit your speed.\n\nThe trickiest part of snowboarding is shifting from your heel to your toe to change directions.\n\nMy best advice is to start slow, commit to every turn, and look where you want to go (not backward).\n\nThis story was originally published on December 3, 2024, and most recently updated on December 30, 2025.",

    "fullText": "In this time of unrelenting, often unprecedented cruelty and lawlessness, I’m grateful for Nation readers like you.\n\nSo many of you have taken to the streets, organized in your neighborhood and with your union, and showed up at the ballot box to vote for progressive candidates. You’re proving that it is possible—to paraphrase the legendary Patti Smith—to redeem the work of the fools running our government.\n\nAnd as we head into 2026, I promise that The Nation will fight like never before for justice, humanity, and dignity in these United States.\n\nAt a time when most news organizations are either cutting budgets or cozying up to Trump by bringing in right-wing propagandists, The Nation’s writers, editors, copy editors, fact-checkers, and illustrators confront head-on the administration’s deadly abuses of power, blatant corruption, and deconstruction of both government and civil society.\n\nWe couldn’t do this crucial work without you.\n\nThrough the end of the year, a generous donor is matching all donations to The Nation’s independent journalism up to $75,000. But the end of the year is now only days away.\n\nTime is running out to have your gift doubled. Don’t wait—donate now to ensure that our newsroom has the full $150,000 to start the new year.\n\nAnother world really is possible. Together, we can and will win it!",

The post Five Bears whose stock went up or down in NFL Week 17 loss to 49ers appeared first on Marquee Sports Network - Home of the Cubs, Bears, Red Stars and Sky.",
    "fullText": "The final Sunday in 2025 provided football fans with a memorable game that featured plenty of offensive firepower.\n\nWith how the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers moved the ball and scored, it felt like a game that would end with whatever team had the ball last.\n\nCaleb Williams and the Bears had their shot with 2:15 left in the game, down by four points.\n\nThe Bears quarterback led his team on a 15-play drive that ended on the 49ers’ 2-yard line after Williams attempted to extend the play to find an open receiver. With the 49ers’ defense closing in, Williams threw a pass into the end zone, but it fell short.\n\nWild ending to an incredible game. pic.twitter.com/Xe6pJkBfEa\n\nThe Bears lost 42-38, which eliminates them from contention for the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Still, as NFC North champions, they will host at least one playoff game at Soldier Field.\n\nHere are the five players who raised and lowered their stock in the Week 17 shootout at Levi’s Stadium.\n\nWilliams had one of his best passing performances of the season, completing 25 of 42 throws for 330 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nHis first TD pass of the day — to rookie Luther Burden III — was a perfectly thrown 35-yard strike in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWilliams’ second TD pass — to Colston Loveland in the second quarter– displayed some of his elite quarterback traits. Williams drew the 49ers’ defense offside with his cadence, kept his eyes downfield after the snap, then threw a dart to his rookie tight end for a 36-yard score.\n\nCaleb Williams gets the 49ers on the hard count.\n\nTouchdown, Colston Loveland\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWith how well the 49ers’ offense played, Williams needed to match Brock Purdy on the other side. For a majority of the game, that’s exactly what he did. However, he missed some throws.\n\nOn the final drive, Williams was heavily pressured on a first-and-10 play. He ran away from the pressure to his right but couldn’t complete a pass to wide-open Devin Duvernay on what might have been a game-winning TD.\n\nthis was 7 pic.twitter.com/WzuR5ONtEM\n\n— Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) December 29, 2025\n\nIt only took one play for the former All-Pro cornerback to change the game.\n\nJohnson jumped Jauan Jennings’ slant route and deflected Purdy’s first pass on the first play of the game into the air. T.J. Edwards intercepted the ball and returned it 34 yards for a pick six.\n\nT.J. EDWARDS, PICK-SIX ON THE FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nJohnson finished the game with zero receptions allowed on one target. He wasn’t targeted for the remainder of the game after helping cause the pick six, but he also played limited snaps in the second half.\n\nJohnson has given up just seven receptions on 12 targets for 142 yards in six games this season, and he has one interception. It shows just how important keeping Johnson healthy is to the Bears’ defense.\n\nThe Bears’ rookie wide receiver returned to action after missing last week’s win over the Green Bay Packers and quickly made an impact.\n\nEntering their third drive, the Bears had failed to record a first down. Then Williams found Burden for a 10-yard gain on second down. Three plays later, Williams connected with Burden on an explosive 35-yard TD pass, giving Chicago’s offense its first points of the game late in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nBurden finished as the game’s leading receiver with eight receptions on nine targets for 138 yards and the TD. He was injured on the final play of the game, and head coach Ben Johnson didn’t have an immediate update on the rookie’s condition.\n\nThe Bears’ veteran linebacker had the daunting task of trying to contain Christian McCaffrey. The entire defense, especially Edmunds, failed to keep the 49ers’ versatile playmaker in check.\n\nMcCaffrey finished the first half with 18 carries for 121 yards and one TD. He added two receptions for 20 yards as a pass catcher before halftime.\n\n: NBC\nNFL+// https://t.co/Zkva0Y3QRRpic.twitter.com/Lw0glXcnaP\n\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) December 29, 2025\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Edmunds allowed seven receptions on seven targets for 55 yards and two TDs.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense, which features plenty of motions and shifts, forced Edmunds and the rest of the Bears’ defensive front to react slowly, and San Francisco benefited throughout the game, finishing with 496 total yards (200 rushing, 296 passing).\n\nThe Bears cornerback dealt with a hamstring injury and an illness throughout the week, but he was able to start against the 49ers.\n\nHe’s had a remarkable season, but this wasn’t a good showing. Per Pro Football Focus, Wright gave up four receptions on five targets for 73 yards in just the first half.\n\nWright looked a step slow and couldn’t stay in front of opposing receivers.\n\nThe post Five Bears whose stock went up or down in NFL Week 17 loss to 49ers appeared first on Marquee Sports Network - Home of the Cubs, Bears, Red Stars and Sky.",
