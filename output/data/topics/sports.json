    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "fullText": "Florida basketball's brutal home loss to the Auburn Tigers two weeks ago is well in the rearview mirror after a pair of superlative performances — a 47-point beatdown of the South Carolina Gamecocks on the road, followed by an epic victory in the O'Dome against the Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nAs a result of the Gators' plus-70 margin of victory over the last two games, Todd Golden finds his team up five spots in the latest USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll at No. 16. That puts the Orange and Blue between the No. 15 Vanderbilt Commodores and No. 17 Virginia Cavaliers.\n\nThat kick in the pants at home appears to have given Florida a wake-up call, and now the Gators have put the rest of the SEC — and college basketball — on notice with nine games remaining on the regular-season schedule.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference once again has only four member schools in this week's poll, with Vanderbilt hanging onto their league-high No. 15 ranking. Florida is right behind them at No. 16, followed by the Arkansas Razorbacks, who fell five spots to No. 21, and the Texas A&M Aggies, who entered the rankings for the first time this season at No. 25.\n\nAlabama fell out of the top 25, and now follows the de facto No. 27 Tennessee Volunteers (55 votes) with 15 votes. The Kentucky Wildcats continue to cling to their nine votes while the Georgia Bulldogs earned a pair this week.\n\nIowa 52; Tennessee 50; UCF 15; Alabama 15; Villanova 13; Kentucky 9; North Carolina State 4; Utah State 2; Georgia 2; Saint Mary's 1\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida basketball USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll ranking up after win",

    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans are coming off a dismal season that led to a massive overhaul of the organization. Gone is Brian Callahan, and most of his staff, and the Titans have a new head coach in Robert Saleh. But that doesn’t mean that Tennessee didn't have some highlights.\n\nOne of those that marked Callahan’s last victory as Titans’ head coach, and much like the majority of his tenure, it was a fluke. Incredibly, this victory over the Arizona Cardinals was so improbable that it landed on CBS Sports' top 25 stories of the 2025 season.\n\n22. Tennessee Titans at Arizona Cardinals, Week 5: Cardinals, Jonathan Gannon, Kyler Murray, Emari Demercado collapse\n\nThis one requires us to go back quite a bit, but the butterfly effect is startling. The Cardinals, up 21-3 at home against the then-winless Tennessee Titans, suffered one of the wildest and most inexcusable collapses in recent memory en route to a 22-21 defeat.\n\nAlthough the Cardinals basically handed the Titans the victory, Tennessee looked competitive in the fourth quarter and made the plays necessary for the win, with Cam Ward making some big-time throws to give them a chance.\n\nThe Titans would go on to fire Callahan a couple of weeks later, with the win being the highlight of his final weeks in Nashville. But for that week, the football gods looked down on the Titans and gave them a memorable moment in the 2025 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Titans improbable victory over Cardinals one of the top stories in 2025",

    "fullText": "Rangers are interested in completing a deal for Southampton striker Cameron Archer before next Monday’s transfer deadline, according to Sky Sports journalist Mark McAdam. Rangers manager Danny Rohl wants attacking reinforcements at the Ibrox club and the Bears have been linked with Hansa Rostock striker Ryan Naderi. They have offered a new bid of around €3.6 million and a sell-on clause for him, but, the German club do not want to lose him. Rangers are now looking at other options to bring to the Ibrox club before the deadline.\n\nRangers also have Leeds United striker Joel Piroe on their radar, and Archer has emerged as the latest player to be linked with the Bears. The 24-year-old has four goals in 23 games for the Saints this term after notching five goals in 40 appearances last term. Archer has proven himself in the Championship, with 20 league goals to his name across three seasons in the division. The Aston Villa star had earlier loan spells at Preston North End and Middlesbrough and will bring enough experience to the Rangers attack having also featured for the likes of Sheffield United and Solihull Moors.\n\nSouthampton are hoping to secure a return to the Premier League at the end of the season and it remains to be seen whether they will be open to losing one of their key players. Rangers are desperate to get a deal for a new striker over the line before the deadline to boost their chances of pipping Hearts and Celtic to the Scottish Premiership title. They are just four points behind league leaders Hearts after 23 matches and having a stronger squad would come in handy in the coming games as the top-three battle for the top prize.",

    "fullText": "Sunday, February 8, will be a legendary day for sports fans because of Super Bowl LX, and the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games will be happening on the same day. But also for NBC and their streaming platform, Peacock, as they will be presenting both events live all day in 4K HDR. Via a press release, this will mark the first time a Super Bowl and Olympic Games will be presented in 4K HDR on the NBC broadcast network and the Peacock.\n\nIn a statement, Rick Cordella, President of NBC Sports, believes that because February will be a huge month for sports for the network, they feel obligated to deliver the best viewing experience possible.\n\n“When you’re about to present the biggest month in U.S. sports media history, you want to make sure you’re giving fans the best experience possible – so that’s exactly what we have planned on NBC and Peacock for Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, and NBA All-Star Weekend,” said Cordella. “Building on NBC Sports’ long-standing commitment to innovation across all platforms, we’ll be celebrating the action on the field, slopes, and court with our signature storytelling, state-of-the-art production, and dynamic streaming features that together bring these incredible sporting events to life for audiences at home.”\n\nThe platform will be presenting other innovations with their Olympic coverage by expanding their Multiview feature to mobile, which activates a four-box vertical display that showcases the top four events at any given time. Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming, states Peacock leads the industry in preesnting high profile events due to their infrastructure.\n\n“Peacock is the first streamer to deliver major live sports at this scale, seamlessly presenting many simultaneous events, with millions of people coming to the platform at once, over several days,” said Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming. “This impressive performance is possible because of Peacock’s industry-leading infrastructure that supports unmatched reliability, especially under peak demand.”\n\nPeacock’s February doesn’t stop with the Olympics and the Super Bowl, as for the first time in over 20 years, NBC will produce NBA All-Star Weekend onsite in Los Angeles.",

    "fullText": "Eddie Hall has found himself in the ring with two influencers again, this time in another unusual 2 vs 1 boxing match.\n\nHall, who made his name as a Strongman competitor, has spent the last few years exploring different combat sports, including arm wrestling and boxing.\n\nThis past year, he finally stepped into an MMA cage, picking up a controversial win over Mariusz Pudzianowski after dedicating years to training for the sport.\n\nSeveral months on from that fight, Hall’s latest move sees him back in another strange setup.\n\nFollowing his quick success in MMA, it seemed inevitable that the 38-year-old would continue in the sport, and would potentially take on former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, who continues to look for a fight.\n\nHowever, since then, there hasn’t been much news about Hall’s next move in combat sports. But he’s still finding ways to stay active and grab attention with some unusual ventures.\n\nJust recently, a video made the rounds on social media showing Hall stepping into another two vs one boxing match against a pair of influencers.\n\nThis wasn’t new territory for Hall. Back in 2024, he knocked out two featherweights at once during what many called a ‘freak fight’.\n\nBut this latest fight didn’t go as smoothly as that one did. One of his opponents was Dean Alex (Dean.dodd online), who regularly takes on odd challenges set by his 750,000 followers.\n\nThe other was Kristen Hanby, whose prank videos have built him an audience of 8.2 million people online.\n\nDuring the fight, Dodd took several knockdowns from Hall but also managed to land a few clean shots himself. Fortunately for both Dodd and Hanby, it was all light-hearted sparring rather than anything meant to cause real harm.\n\nIt’s looking more and more likely that Hall will be back in the MMA cage before the end of the year.\n\nHowever, with influencer boxing on the rise, there’s also a chance his next appearance could come back inside the ring rather than under MMA rules.",

    "fullText": "Grassroots sports groups across the West Midlands have welcomed government funding to help improve their facilities.\n\nLast year, 991 projects across the UK received money through the Multi-Sport Grassroots Facilities Programme to improve things like floodlights, goalposts and all-weather pitches.\n\nA new round of funding has now opened and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has invited community organisations to apply for a share of an £85m grant.\n\nFor football groups in Herefordshire and Warwickshire, the funds they were previously awarded had a massive impact on the children they support.\n\nIn total, clubs in Coventry and Warwickshire received more than £310,000 to upgrade their facilities.\n\nThe funding ranged from just under £250,000 for new changing rooms at Racing Club Warwick, to just over £1,000 for Upper Lighthorne Football Club for new goalposts.\n\nNuneaton-based Camp Hill Educational Sports and Social, better known as Chess FC, was awarded £6,017 to buy portable floodlights for their training pitches at Hill Top Playing Fields in Arley.\n\nClub chairperson Ian Andrew said it meant their eight junior teams, including an under-15 girls side, could train anywhere on the surface at night and in all weathers.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"They love coming along in the evening. It's pitch black and they've got the chance to run around and feel like professional footballers playing under lights.\"\n\nRacing Club Warwick received just under £250,000 to build new changing rooms at their Townsend Meadow ground.\n\nClub chairman Gary Vella said: \"When you've got a 3G pitch and you've got game after game, particularly for juniors, you need changing facilities. The women's game, disability football, all need their own changing areas, so this will help push us on.\"\n\nNearly £60,000 was given to 16 clubs across Herefordshire and Worcestershire and the DCMS said the money was aimed at giving families affordable ways to stay healthy.\n\nDavid Pembridge, from Wessington Juniors FC in Hereford, said: \"Throughout Herefordshire there's a massive shortage of indoor facilities.\n\n\"It's very costly so any time that you're hiring indoor facilities, which could be anything from £50 an hour, when you've got 11 teams, that quickly racks up to thousands and thousands which makes it less affordable for parents.\"\n\nThe group was awarded a grant to provide portable floodlights\n\nHe added: \"Every winter since we have been able to continue training outside in almost all weathers, when the clocks change it doesn't mean football stops it means that we can carry on and the children still get their weekly fix of football.\"\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"This is sport delivering for the nation. Every pound we invest in grassroots facilities is a pound that takes pressure off our NHS, supports mental and physical health, and opens doors for new community members to benefit from sport - like women and girls who've been shut out for too long.\"\n\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.\n\nEngland inspire women footballers of the future\n\nFoundation to increase free football for adults\n\nGrassroots football teams get government funding\n\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport",

    "fullText": "Wonder what Caitlin Clark thinks about the confusion surrounding Austin Reaves' imminent return to the Lakers lineup? Or whether Jeanie Buss has turned on LeBron James? Or if she has nothing but praise for Luka Doncic?\n\nTune in to the Lakers' matchup against the New York Knicks on the NBC Sports debut of “Basketball Night in America” on Sunday night to find out. Clark, the uber-popular WNBA star, will serve an analyst on the pregame show, beginning at 3 p.m. PT, one hour before tipoff.\n\nShould Reaves return Friday or Sunday after missing a month with a left calf strain, it would mark only the seventh time the guard has played together with James and Doncic. That might be the first topic addressed by Clark, who will join the studio team of Maria Taylor and three former NBA stars: Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady.\n\nExpectations that Reaves would take the floor Wednesday in a nationally televised game against the Cleveland Cavaliers were heightened Tuesday when ESPN insider Shams Charania posted on X that the Lakers guard would be “available to return to the lineup on Wednesday.”\n\nA few moments later, however, the post was deleted with no explanation and the Lakers' injury report lists Reaves as out.\n\nClark might stick to lauding Doncic, considering that the superstar NBA guard complimented her game in 2024, saying \"that’s the women’s Steph Curry. She can shoot it better than me.”\n\nClark, who attended Iowa, is the all-time leading scorer in NCAA history. In two seasons with the Indiana Fever, she was named WNBA Rookie of the Year and is a two-time All-Star despite missing much of the 2025 season with a severe groin injury.\n\n“Caitlin is one of the most captivating players and dynamic scorers in basketball,” NBC Sports Executive Producer Sam Flood said in a statement. “We’re excited to have Caitlin join Hall of Famers Melo, Vince, Tracy and Reggie in New York for the launch of Sunday Night Basketball.”\n\nThe Lakers-Knicks game will begin a doubleheader that also includes the Oklahoma City Thunder facing the Denver Nuggets.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The fun of watching sports is not knowing who will win—so why should watching highlights be any different?",
    "fullText": "Part of the fun of watching sports is that you don't know what's going to happen. TV shows and movies follow story beats, meaning you can usually get a sense for where things are heading, but sports do not work that way. The totally unexpected can, and does, frequently occur—and that's the reason people keep tuning in, whether their team is dominating or an underdog.\n\nSometimes, though, you can't catch the game live, but still want a bit of that feeling. That's why leagues offer extended highlights, featuring all the key moments, complete with the commentary from the broadcast. These can feel almost like watching the full game, and I love catching up with them the next day alongside my morning coffee. The problem: you'll typically find those videos on sites full of spoilers about who won, whether that's via a scoreboard at the top of the site or headlines blaring the results. If you're hoping for even a fraction of the fun of watching sports live, that's a problem.\n\nDon't Tell Me The Score is your solution. This simple website offers highlights for NFL, NHL, MLB, and NBA games, with no scores or spoilers of any kind. The site interface shows only a bunch of icons representing all upcoming and recent games. Color logos means there are highlights are already available, and you can click or tap to start watching.\n\nThis is my favorite way to catch up on games I missed. The videos, which are sourced from the league's official YouTube channels, tend to be a little over 10 minutes, meaning you'll see the highs and lows, but it won't take up hours of your day, and you won't know who won going in (provided you've also taken care to avoid spoilers via the TV, newspapers, social media, push notifications, or ill-timed texts from friends).\n\nThis tends to work really well, with one big hiccup: NFL videos can't be watched on the site itself, as the NFL prevents their highlights from being embedded on other sites. This means you'll need to click a link to watch the highlights on YouTube's website. This is a little annoying, but the YouTube pages usually don't include spoilers either, as long as you steer clear of the comments.\n\nI wish more leagues were supported—soccer highlights aren't offered at all, for example, and neither are the increasingly popular women's leagues. But if you're a fan of one of the \"big four\" North American sports, like watching highlights, and don't want to get spoiled first, Don't Tell Me The Score is worth adding to your daily rotation.",

    "fullText": "The United Center in Chicago will become the first major U.S. sports venue to offer THC-infused drinks during events, reflecting a growing demand for non-alcoholic alternatives.\n\nThe arena — home to the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks — announced the move on Tuesday in a joint statement with RYTHM, a local beverage company.\n\nThe company inked a multi-year deal with the stadium to sell its drink, called Señorita, which contains hemp-derived THC, to guests 21 and older at live events, including concerts. The beverages, however, will not be available at sporting events due to league regulations.\n\n\"We are excited to introduce Señorita and RYTHM to the live entertainment space,” Joe Myhra, the chief operating officer at United Center, said in the release. “As we continue to evolve offerings for our guests, RYTHM’s Chicago roots made its beverage line a natural fit for the United Center experience.”\n\nSeñorita, which includes five milligrams of THC per drink, will become available for purchase at the stadium beginning in February.\n\n“Bringing Señorita and RYTHM to the United Center reflects a simple truth: consumers want non-alcoholic options, and leading venues are responding,” Ben Kovler, the CEO of RYTHM, said in the release.\n\n“The United Center is one of the world’s premier venues and continues to set the standard for live entertainment with the introduction of these modern, responsible options,” he added.\n\nThe announcement comes as demand for alcoholic beverages has fallen to a record low in the U.S., according to an August Gallup poll. In the survey, 54 percent of Americans reported consuming alcohol, marking the lowest share since 1939. The trend is largely driven by younger adults.\n\nAt the same time, young Americans are increasingly unwinding with weed drinks.\n\nIn an August poll by Drug Rehab USA, 66 percent of Gen Z and Millennial respondents said they had tried alternatives to alcohol in the past six months, with 24 percent saying they had “at least partially” substituted alcohol with non-alcoholic or cannabis-infused drinks.",

    "fullText": "Now nearly a full month into 2026, college basketball teams are into the thick of their conference schedules. UNC, which secured a huge road upset of rival Virginia on Saturday, is in the top half of what's shaping up to be a deep ACC.\n\nNorth Carolina (16-4, 4-3 ACC) rolled through non-conference play with a 12-1 record, securing wins against fellow blue bloods Kansas and Kentucky. The Tar Heels hit an impasse to begin ACC play, losing their first three conference road games, but squeaked by Wake Forest at home and dominated Notre Dame.\n\nUNC has plenty more season ahead, with a third-straight NCAA Tournament appearance increasingly likely. In USA TODAY Sports' January 26 bracketology, released earlier Tuesday, North Carolina is a 5-seed in the East Region.\n\nUSAT projects the Tar Heels facing 12-seeded Belmont in Tampa, Fla. Joining UNC and the Bruins are 4-seed, reigning national champion Florida and 2023 Final Four squad Florida Atlantic.\n\nNorth Carolina and Belmont, the latter a member of the Missouri Valley Conference, previously played in November 2013. If you attended that game at the Dean Dome, you likely still have memories of a painful upset etched in your mind.\n\nAfter dropping consecutive games at Stanford and Cal on their West Coast swing, the Tar Heels are now winners of two straight. Derek Dixon is a key in the starting lineup, Caleb Wilson remains a superstar and head coach Hubert Davis is now playing his best rotations.\n\nUNC has all the pieces to make a National Championship run. Can North Carolina continue to play at its current pace, rise through the ACC and be college basketball's last team standing in April?\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC basketball projected the East's 5 seed in USAT Sports bracketology",

    "fullText": "Independiente Santa Fe continues to add young talent to its sports project for the 2026 season. In recent hours, it was confirmed that Kilian Toscano, a 21-year-old midfielder, will join the \"Cardenal\" squad after reaching a loan agreement with Atlético Nacional. The young player, who is looking to establish himself in the capital, arrives with the mission of bringing balance and dynamism to the midfield of the team led by Pablo Peirano.\n\nDespite his young age, Toscano is no rookie in professional football. The midfielder already boasts 39 official matches, the vast majority of them wearing the verdolaga jersey, where he demonstrated his abilities in ball recovery and initiating play. Additionally, his talent led him to participate in several processes with the Colombia U-20 National Team during the Argentina 2023 World Cup cycle, although he ultimately was not included in the final squad for the global event.\n\nThis move represents the first change of scenery for Toscano, who completed his entire youth development in Medellín. For Santa Fe, the addition of the young player responds to the need to refresh the squad with promising players who are already familiar with the demands of big clubs. The footballer is expected to join training at the Tenjo facility immediately to compete for a spot in the starting eleven before the league begins.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "A sports nutritionist for NBA champs explains why athletes stop drinking water after 4 p.m. to optimize hydration and perform their best.",
    "fullText": "NBA champions don't have time for morning brain fog or an afternoon slump.\n\nTheir secret to staying sharp all day long: perfectly-timed water breaks, according to a top sports nutritionist.\n\nMatt Jones, who worked with the Boston Celtics during their 2024 NBA Championship-winning season and advises the supplement brand Cadence, said the pros have mastered the art of optimal hydration.\n\n\"Fueling intentionally is probably one of the biggest things we can take from the world of professional sport,\" he told Business Insider. \"Professional athletes are very good at repeating basic behaviors like hydrating, and it's those routines that allow them to perform to the best of their ability.\"\n\nIf you want to level up your hydration game, start paying attention to how much you drink and when, Jones recommends.\n\nAfter years of experience coaching elite athletes and military professionals, he has five key tips for getting enough water and electrolytes for better performance throughout the day.\n\nStaying hydrated makes a big difference to your brain and body in the office or on the basketball court, Jones said.\n\n\"It can impact your mood, your decision-making; it can impact the way you just go about your normal life,\" he said.\n\nResearch suggests that mild or moderate dehydration can impair reaction time and memory. Physically, being dehydrated can reduce strength and endurance, and make it more difficult to recover after exercise.\n\nJones uses a gold-standard test to see if his athletes need to drink more water. It can tell you if you're dehydrated based on three symptoms:\n\nEveryone's water needs are different, based on how much energy you use.\n\nJones said the gold standard recommendation is 1 milliliter to 1.5 milliliters per calorie of energy expenditure (in normal conditions). Two liters — or that eight cups of water a day you've probably heard about — makes sense for someone who burns 2,000 calories a day, but you may need more or less depending on your body size and activity level.\n\nSleeping is a superpower for athletes, and a simple tip helps them stay well-hydrated without too many overnight bathroom trips.\n\nJones said the solution for his athletes, including the Celtics, is to drink 80% of their fluids for the day before 4 p.m. so that their bodies have time to process all that liquid before bedtime.\n\nPlain water should be your first priority for hydration, but other drinks and even foods can count toward your daily total.\n\nFor instance, your morning brew can help keep you hydrated, since caffeinated drinks in moderation lead to a net gain in fluid. Just steer clear of artificially sweetened or sugary beverages, too much of which can cause health issues like chronic inflammation over time.\n\nHydrating foods such as fruits and veggies also provide electrolytes to regulate the fluids in your body.\n\nSodium, or salt, is a key electrolyte, but you probably get enough in your diet already. Instead, Jones said to focus on potassium to offset the side effects of too much sodium, such as high blood pressure.\n\nGood sources of potassium include bananas, avocados, coconut water, pomegranate, and watermelon.\n\nDehydration can sneak up on you before you realize it, especially if you're sweating a lot.\n\n\"During intense exercise, particularly in warm environments, thirst is not a good indicator of hydration status,\" Jones said. \"People are often chasing their tails a little bit.\"\n\nYou can calculate your sweat rate to estimate just how much water you need to replace during exercise, like Jones does with the pros.\n\nPrevent a dip in performance by drinking water at regular intervals.\n\n\"The first priority as soon as your big toe hits planet earth in the morning is to rehydrate,\" Jones said.",

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

    "fullText": "Arsenal icon Patrick Vieira believes one Manchester United player is reaping the rewards of Michael Carrick’s tactics more than Bryan Mbeumo, especially after Sunday’s result.\n\nDuring his punditry duties for Sky Sports, Patrick Vieira watched as his former club Arsenal fell to Manchester United in a 3-2 defeat at the Emirates.\n\nMichael Carrick has now overseen impressive back-to-back Premier League wins over top-two sides Arsenal and Manchester City since taking charge.\n\nBryan Mbeumo was once again trusted to lead the line for Man Utd under Carrick’s system, and the summer signing from Brentford delivered another strong performance.\n\nMbeumo pulled Man Utd level before half-time when he capitalised on a costly mistake from Arsenal’s Martin Zubimendi.\n\nAfter Bryan Mbeumo pulled Manchester United level, Patrick Dorgu put them in front early in the second half. It was a well-taken goal that gave United some momentum coming out of the break.\n\nMikel Merino equalised for Arsenal late on, just when it looked like United might hold on. But even with time running out, there was still more to come.\n\nMatheus Cunha replaced Bryan Mbeumo in the second half and the 26-year-old Brazilian forward scored the winner for Man Utd in Sunday evening’s result.\n\nFollowing Manchester United’s 2-0 victory against Manchester City at Old Trafford last week, Vieira believed that Carrick and his colleagues had finally “answered” the significant questions surrounding them.\n\n“There were still big questions after City,” he told Sky Sports.\n\n“They answered them so well. They are back on track. There’s still a long way to go. Wins against City and Arsenal is so good for confidence.”\n\nPlaying in the No 10 role behind Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes featured there for the second straight Premier League match under interim boss Carrick.\n\nThe Manchester United captain’s performances against both City and Arsenal have drawn high praise from Vieira.\n\n“The system allowed them to express themselves,” the Frenchman stated.\n\n“I think the 4-2-3-1 allowed Fernandes to be a little bit more free on the pitch, create situations, score goals.\n\n“You can see the pictures – the smile is back on the face of the United players.”\n\nUnder Ruben Amorim last season, Fernandes often played deeper before the manager was dismissed earlier this month. The coaching change has clearly had an impact on his play.",

    "description": "The Sky Sports pundit praised Carrick’s influence on the club after wins over Man City and Arsenal but believes they need a ‘bigger’ manager",
    "fullText": "Roy Keane shut down suggestions that Michael Carrick be given the role of Manchester United manager on a permanent basis following the 3-2 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nCarrick took over from the sacked Ruben Amorim on a contract until the end of the current suggestion with the executives at Old Trafford currently searching for a new manager to hire permanently.\n\nIn his first game in charge Carrick orchestrated a 2-0 derby win over Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City before masterminding United’s victory over the league leaders.\n\nKeane was quick to praise the impact Carrick and his staff have had on the players and results but revealed that his preference for the next manager be someone “bigger and better” than Carrick.\n\nAsked for his opinion on the result and the performance from Manchester United, Keane echoed the words of Harry Maguire who was awarded the player of the match trophy.\n\n“Harry makes a good point, they’ve got a lot of their players back now, it’s a full group, they’ve got full weeks together and there’s no other distractions,” Keane replied. “They can focus on the league form and they’re producing.\n\n“But, as we know you win one, two games for Man Utd, fantastic. Particularly to beat City, and come to Arsenal. I felt United would get a result today, I was thinking a draw but I felt United would turn up.\n\n“They’ve got enough quality players and they’ve got momentum into their season and all of a sudden you’re thinking it’s a great chance for top four. If they play with that confidence and belief, you give the manager and the staff credit.”\n\nKeane was then pressed by fellow Sky Sports pundit Micah Richards on whether Manchester United should hire Carrick on a permanent basis already given he has led the team to wins against first and second in the league.\n\n“The job? You’re being silly now,” Keane responded. “No, he’s had two great performances but anybody can win two games. It’s what he does until the end of the season.\n\n“Even if they do get into fourth I still wouldn’t be convinced he’s the man for the job. Absolutely not. I still think they need a bigger and better manager.\n\n“But, he’s got the opportunity, what a chance it is for him and, do you know what, he’s taking it so fair play to him.”",

    "fullText": "Random thoughts while waiting on the release of the new Super Bowl commercials.\n\nThe sight of Cubs star Pete-Crow Armstrong and Bears star Caleb Williams hanging out together at the Blackhawks and Bulls games was a nice way to portray Chicago as the biggest small town in America. Los Angeles has its Hollywood culture and New York is the media center of the world, but nowhere are the local sports stars as big a deal as they are in Chicago.\n\nIt’s nothing new, of course. Chicago’s stars have always supported each other. When the Bears played at Wrigley Field, Bobby Hull was a season ticket holder, and Billy Williams used to get tickets for games from Bears receiver Dick Gordon.\n\nThe budding bromance of Crow-Armstrong and Williams should last a long time, or at least until the Cubs and Bears sign them to massive deals.\n\nOne of the primary requisites of the job of commissioner of a major sports league should be the ability to project strength. But the commissioners of the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball are all weaklings, as evidenced by a report from The Athletic that Roger Goodell, Adam Silver, Gary Bettman and Rob Manfred will meet with President Donald Trump to help promote America 250, a celebration of the country’s 250th birthday.\n\nWhile Trump’s jackboots instill fear in Minneapolis, Chicago and other American cities, and he embarrasses the country on the international stage, these four pretend leaders will be posing for photo-ops in the Oval Office and pretending all is right with the country. None of them has the courage to speak out against what’s happening in America.\n\nLucky for them, they’re only beholden to the billionaire owners of their league’s teams, not the average fans who support their respective sports.\n\nESPN’s Pat McAfee has always appealed to the lowest common denominator, so it’s no surprise the clueless commentator is taking on unidentified media members who point out his lame frat boy act, calling them “fat … lazy nerds” on his TV show.\n\nMcAfee also tweeted that sports journalists “hate what sports are for people (happiness). They hate what sports are for society (unifier) … they’re political journalists by nature who’ve preyed on sports because they saw it as an easier path to ‘make it.’ Their days are numbered … my show being broadcasted on ESPN 10 hours a week with ZERO creative say from any ‘journalism school’ puppets is living proof of that.”\n\nActually, the audience of McAfee’s show is relatively tiny, or else it would be in a better time slot than in the early afternoon, when everyone else is working. He’s already wearing thin on college football fans, and sooner or later the ratings will slide and ESPN will pull the plug and send him off to UFC analysis, where he belongs.\n\nIllinois is having another stellar season, thanks to a deep team led by freshman Keaton Wagler. The 11th-ranked Illini are 17-3 after Saturday’s 88-82 road win over Purdue and in contention for the Big Ten title.\n\nAnd when the Illini are winning, coach Brad Underwood is at his most ornery, as when he recently sparred with an Illinois reporter who praised Tomislav Ivišić for a good game against Northwestern despite what he called an “up-and-down season.”\n\n“You guys say he’s been up and down,” Underwood shot back. “I just say his role changed. You guys create more damn narratives that are full of (bleep). That’s what he does. That’s why he’s been on draft boards. He’s big and can shoot the cover off of it. … No one has ever doubted Tommy.”\n\nLove him or hate him, Underwood is never afraid to speak his mind.\n\nKudos to White Sox general manager Chris Getz for immediately spending the $20 million he saved by dumping Luis Robert Jr.’s contract, signing reliever Seranthony Dominguez to a two-year, $20 million deal. Now maybe he can move Grant Taylor into the rotation where he belongs.\n\nMike Berman was a professional and a hardworking sports reporter willing to work long hours at NBC-5. A Glenbrook North alumnus who grew up rooting for Chicago teams, he did his job for 10 years without calling attention to himself. His work spoke for itself.\n\nBerman, who was let go by the station last week, deserved a better fate. Hopefully he winds up on another local station that will appreciate his work ethic.\n\nTerry Boers, who died Friday at age 75, was remembered by most as a radio host and an original member of The Score. But he was also a great newspaperman. Boers and I competed on the Illini basketball beat for one season back in the early 1990s, when he was still at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was as good a beat writer as there was and handed me my lunch on many occasions.\n\nBoers eventually found his way to radio, where he could put his brash personality into his job. He became a legend at WSCR-AM 670, along with the other originals such as Mike North, Tom Shaer and Dan McNeil. There will never be another quite like Boers, which is why his death has brought so many tributes from colleagues.\n\nCubs manager Craig Counsell is a Green Bay Packers fan, but he assured the media he is not a Bears hater. “Look, I grew up a Packers fan for sure,” he said before the Cubs Convention. “The Bears have struggled for a while, and so when a team hasn’t done well for a whole and starts to do well, you see what it does to a city. You feel it. That part of me knows what it’s doing for the city, and you root for that a little bit.”\n\nAsked who would be booed \n\nIt’s a tough call, but my guess is Counsell is still Public Enemy No. 1 among cheeseheads.",

At the moment, the standings are very tight with three other teams having the same points: Elche, Real Sociedad, and Athletic Club; two with 22, Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, and three with 21, Sevilla, Mallorca, and Getafe.\n\nGetafe CF, on the other hand, arrives at Montilivi with a trajectory marked by rather negative results in the last league matches. In the most recent games, the Madrid team recorded a 1-0 loss to Valencia and a 2-1 defeat against Real Sociedad, and drew 1-1 with Rayo Vallecano. Additionally, before the Christmas break, Getafe suffered a 4-0 loss to Betis and a 3-1 defeat against Burgos in the Copa del Rey.\n\nAs for the head-to-head history between Girona and Getafe, the record shows a closely contested rivalry in recent history. In the first meeting of this same season, Getafe won 2-1 at the Coliseum, a match in which the Madrid team took the lead with goals from Mario Martín and Borja Mayoral, while Cristhian Stuani reduced the deficit from the penalty spot at the end of the game. Looking at a broader perspective, in a total of 17 historical encounters between both teams, Girona has achieved 6 victories, Getafe 7, and 4 matches have ended in a draw, reflecting the competitive balance that these matches usually display.",

    "description": "Christen Press, who was honored by the U.S. women's soccer team before its win over Paraguay, is determined to be advocate for women's sports in retirement.",
    "fullText": "Christen Press welcomed herself to the U.S. women’s soccer team by scoring twice in her debut in the first game of 2013. The team said goodbye Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park, honoring Press before its first game of 2026, a 6-0 win over Paraguay.\n\nIn between, Press played 154 more times for the U.S., winning two World Cups, an Olympic bronze medal and scoring 62 more goals, retiring as the ninth-leading scorer in team history.\n\nBut those are just numbers because as good as Press was, she wants to be remembered for the legacy she left behind, for the barriers she broke, for the inspiration she continues to provide for players who followed her to the national team.\n\n“Well, it's sort of the point, right?” she said ahead of Saturday’s farewell ceremony before a crowd of 19,397. “I feel really lucky that I had the opportunity to play long enough to overlap with some of these young players and be able to see the growth of the game, how far it's come, and be able to see what the next generation of player feels like.\n\n“It's different, and it's going to take different things for people to have success.”\n\nTalk about following in Press’ footsteps: The first score Saturday came from Reilyn Turner of the Portland Thorns, like Press a Southern California native who scored her first U.S. goal on a left-footed shot in the first half of her international debut. The second goal, less than two minutes into the second half, came from Kansas City’s Ally Sentnor.\n\nAnd that opened the floodgates, with the U.S. getting an own goal from Paraguay’s Fiorella Martínez followed by scores from Trinity Rodman — who was celebrating the three-year contract, reported to be worth a record $6 million, she signed Thursday with the Washington Spirit — a second goal from Sentnor and another from Emma Sears.\n\nPress scored her final international goal in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Ten months later, playing with Angel City FC in the NWSL, she shredded the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee, an injury that required four surgeries and nearly 25 months to repair. She never played another game for the national team and made just three more starts for Angel City before announcing her retirement last October.\n\nThat, Press said, will continue to provide her with a link to the game.\n\n“We're so integrated into the women's sports ecosystem, through podcasts, through merchandise and through the women's soccer community,” she said. “I have spent a lot of time looking at the business of women's sports and how we need to reimagine it.\n\n“In a dream world, I'd be able to continue to influence the ecosystem as a businessperson.”\n\nPress got her start in soccer in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, about a dozen miles from where her career officially ended Saturday in Carson. As a preschooler she played with older kids in co-ed league because one team was short a girl.\n\n“I didn’t touch the ball once,” she remembered years later. “I picked daisies and waved to my mom.”\n\nShe went on to win two CIF Southern Section titles at the Chadwick School and a Hermann Trophy at Stanford before starting a club career that took her to eight teams in three countries. With the national team she went to three Olympics, won World Cups and played a key role in the landmark lawsuit against U.S. Soccer that ended with the women earning equal pay with the men’s team.\n\nIt’s a résumé that already is challenging the next generation of national team players.\n\n“I admired her for a long time,” said Seattle Reign winger Maddie Dahlien, 21, who made her national team debut Saturday. “She made a name for herself a little later. You never know when your opportunity will be. So make the most of it when it comes.”\n\nU.S. coach Emma Hayes never had a chance to work directly with Press, though she wanted to bring her overseas to Chelsea FC when Hayes managed there and Press was looking to move to the Women’s Super League.\n\n“I’ve always admired her and thought what a fantastic football player she is. Very different to what was a more traditional American forward at the time,” Hayes said. “What she’s achieved, as well-traveled as she is, what an honor to be coaching on the day she gets celebrated in her hometown.”\n\nFor Press, it was a celebration that marked the transition from one stage of life to the next. And, she acknowledged, there are a few things she’s going to miss.\n\n“I am so sad that I don't play soccer anymore,” she said. “I miss training. I miss being on a team, being around young people. I miss being outside every day. I miss the grass. I miss the discipline and ritual that football brings to my life.\"\n\n“I like to talk about all the things that I miss, because I think ‘I'm retired. It's easy now.’ No. I had the best job in the world. And it's an irreplaceable job.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real. But burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Week 18, Aaron Rodgers was nothing if not pragmatically optimistic.\n\nThe days on his Pittsburgh Steelers contract were dwindling. The future of head coach Mike Tomlin was a subject of public debate. And the franchise he quarterbacked was cornered into a de facto playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens in the regular-season finale. Any direction you looked, there was something finite hanging in the balance. But in what registered in at least a mild surprise, Rodgers spoke to reporters like a man who didn’t see a definitive near-term conclusion to his football career … so long as he didn’t want it to end.\n\n“I’m thinking about this week, but obviously I’m 42 years old and I’m on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,” Rodgers told reporters. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. So that’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play.”\n\nRodgers gave a slight shrug and chuckled.\n\n“Not a lot of options, but — there will be options I would think. Maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.”\n\n[Get more Steelers news: Pittsburgh team feed]\n\nHe then punctuated the thought by opening the door to a return.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed this experience,” Rodgers said. “Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It’s really what I was hoping for, for this experience. It’s been even better than I was hoping.”\n\nA few days later, the Steelers would beat the Ravens and make the postseason, before getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Texans. All in all, it culminated in a season that felt like Rodgers, Tomlin and the Steelers squeezed about as much as they could have expected.\n\nThen Tomlin left, via a resignation that felt like a surprise to ownership. And maybe to Rodgers, too, given that any thought of his return seemed so strongly bound to whether Tomlin would continue to guide Pittsburgh. When that changed, logical speculation — and that’s all we’ve been left with thus far on the Rodgers front — was that a new head coach would mean a new quarterback. Whatever options were on the table for Rodgers, they appeared to have shrunk by one.\n\nThen came Saturday, when the Steelers went against their historical hiring template and locked in 62-year-old Mike McCarthy, a candidate who can fit more than one forward-looking ideology.  On one hand, McCarthy is a seasoned veteran coach who can come in and try to energize an aging roster that is still very much built to win now. On the other, he could be tasked with developing the franchise’s next young quarterback. Without a bridge starter currently on the roster, it will be difficult for McCarthy to achieve both of those responsibilities.\n\nUnless, of course, McCarthy can find a veteran who knows his system and can come in and help with both tasks. Maybe a quarterback who McCarthy previously helped develop into a star? One who already has spent a season in the Pittsburgh quarterback room with 24-year-old Will Howard, who showed promise in limited reps during his rookie preseason and has the support of the front office as a prospect worth some continued development?\n\nThat sounds like a fit for Rodgers. And perhaps the renewal of a 2026 option that appeared to be extinguished when Tomlin resigned.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean McCarthy was hired with any kind of specificity of luring Rodgers back for another season. While some of Pittsburgh’s players gave Rodgers high marks as a teammate in their exit interviews, the work to find the next long-term starting option is clearly near the top of the priorities for ownership and general manager Omar Khan. And that wouldn’t have changed even if Tomlin had remained. One way or another, 2026 was always going to be geared toward either figuring out if the next young quarterback is already on the roster (in the form of Howard) or if the Steelers liked any of their draft, trade or free-agency options.\n\nMcCarthy’s arrival won’t change that mindset. The real factors of change at the quarterback spot will instead be pressed against the options Pittsburgh has available. If McCarthy is a head coach Rodgers will play for, it gives Pittsburgh at least one more year of a bridge starter to either weigh Howard as a prospect, or find someone in the 2026 draft who is worthy of being selected and then groomed. And there’s certainly some deep-value intrigue over the coming draft class of quarterbacks.\n\nThe Steelers won’t have a shot at Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and their first-round draft pick at No. 21 overall might not be high enough to land Alabama’s Ty Simpson, either. But after that tandem, there are some interesting quarterbacks who could be seen as worthwhile projects with upside. Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss (if he can’t force another year of NCAA eligibility) will draw a significant amount of study from NFL teams. As will a quartet of others who were previously considered to be first-round picks — and potentially very high first-round picks — until hitting stumbles in their final seasons: LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier, Miami’s Carson Beck, Penn State’s Drew Allar and Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, among others.\n\nFor now — and we’ve yet to go through the draft sifting process, so take this with a grain of salt — only Mendoza cuts the figure as a Day 1 rookie starter. Simpson could round into that kind of prospect, or one who has a shot to earn a starting job during his rookie season. The rest? Most personnel opinions appear to be placing them on a developmental track to possibly get a shot with a year or more of work from further down the depth chart.\n\nIf any of those players are in the Steelers’ future, McCarthy’s hiring makes a lot of sense given his history with helping quarterbacks grow into starters. And it also makes sense that Rodgers would be a fit, so long as he continues to be in a year-to-year contract mindset and actually wants to play for McCarthy again.\n\nIn that latter vein, both McCarthy and Rodgers have said very nice things about each other in the least few years, each gaining the perspective of working with new people and in new places. Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real, with both having come to terms with their own mistakes and frustrations that ultimately played a part in McCarthy getting fired late in the 2018 season after coaching the Green Bay Packers for nearly 13 years.\n\nBut burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing. Even if Rodgers wants to play again and McCarthy would like to have him in 2026, the veteran quarterback doesn’t know what the rest of the league landscape will look like in even a few weeks. There’s a chance the Los Angeles Rams win a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford decides to pull a John Elway and retire. Should that happen, the Rams will still be very much in the middle of a Super Bowl window and not have an obvious starting quarterback on the roster. And then there is the Minnesota Vikings, a team Rodgers was very interested in playing for last offseason. They are looking for someone to come in and compete with J.J. McCarthy for the starting job next season.\n\nAdd the Steelers to that mix, and you have exactly what Rodgers was talking about when he focused his gaze on 2026. Not a lot of options — but certainly some interesting ones.",

    "fullText": "Most people dream about winning the lottery. But for one 29-year-old man, his $15 million windfall came with a side of guilt, entitlement, and a family-sized headache.\n\nIn a post shared on Reddit, the anonymous winner explained that his financial plans were anything but reckless. He didn't run off to buy yachts or sports cars. Instead, he wanted to take business and finance courses, manage his newfound wealth responsibly, and eventually give back through charitable work. What he didn't plan for? His parents demanding a full quarter of the winnings—roughly $3.75 million—because, in their words, \"we raised you.\"\n\nThe Reddit post made clear this wasn't a close-knit family cashing in on shared joy. The man described his upbringing as \"distant white middle class,\" saying he had moved an hour away from his \"oppressive mother and distant father.\" While he described his sisters as \"nice people,\" he noted they don't have a real relationship.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nDespite this, when he won the lottery, he offered to pay off his parents' mortgages and provide them a cash gift. But when they learned the full scope of his winnings, that wasn't enough. \"Once they found the total amount,\" he wrote, \"they expected a quarter of it.\"\n\nThe conversation escalated. When his mother said, \"we raised you,\" he couldn't help but remember the five-year stretch—from age 15 to 20—when his parents completely cut off contact. Though he didn't directly confront them with that memory, he now questions whether he owes them anything at all.\n\nMany Redditors agreed that his parents were being unreasonable, entitled, and opportunistic. One user summed it up sharply: \"You don't owe them s**t.\"\n\nAnother commenter laid out a detailed legal and financial checklist: hire a lawyer and financial adviser, draw up a will and living trust, create powers of attorney for medical and financial decisions, and install a home security system. They ended their comment with a blunt mantra: \"People get crazy with money.\"\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd they weren't alone in that warning. Multiple users emphasized the need for protection—not just from scammers or strangers, but from family members who might be willing to sue, manipulate, or guilt-trip to access the prize. One even suggested freezing the winnings in a trust for a year just to let emotions cool and see how people behave.\n\nStill, not everyone was entirely unsympathetic to the family's reaction. From a devil's advocate angle, some might say parents who supported their child for nearly two decades—through diapers, meals, and housing—might feel hurt or excluded if they're only offered a slice instead of a share.\n\nBut that perspective hinges on a relationship that doesn't seem to exist in this case. The man's post didn't reveal abuse or violence, but the emotional neglect—especially during his formative years—cast a long shadow. Five years of silence from his parents left a mark. And now, with millions on the table, old wounds are reopening under the glare of entitlement.\n\n\"I feel like I've been as generous as I can be,\" he said, noting he never explicitly said so to his parents, but assumed it would be clear. What stung most was that their reaction didn't reflect pride or joy—it reeked of resentment that they didn't get more.\n\nSee Also: Private-Market Real Estate Without the Crowdfunding Risk—Direct Access to Institutional-Grade Deals Managed by a $12B+ Real Estate Firm\n\nThe original poster has since emailed his parents to reiterate his offer and state firmly that nothing more would be coming. Whether they respond, and how, remains to be seen.\n\nIn a later update, he stressed that this situation wasn't about seeking revenge or proving a point. It was about maintaining boundaries and protecting the life he's worked hard to rebuild. \"I am not looking to be told how to spend my money or how to be vindictive,\" he wrote. \"They do love me, even if it's in their own sad way.\"\n\nAnd maybe that's the hardest part. Winning the lottery can change your bank account—but it doesn't fix broken relationships. The man walked away with $15 million, but in doing so, he discovered that family ties can fray under the weight of expectation. And in his case, no amount of money seems likely to stitch them back together.\n\nRead Next: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times give their thoughts on the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the Rams, the LeBron James-Jeanie Buss rift and college football.",
    "fullText": "The fury over the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker makes me wonder who's shouting the loudest?\n\nCould it be desperate, unfortunate fans whose beloved teams are owned by inheritors, nepo families, or private equity bros who celebrate their glamorous assets?\n\nSo how about a new metric in the sports page to accompany the ranking of teams and players: ownership. Not simply by wealth, but wisdom, brains and commitment. And for fun let's call it the McCourt-Moreno Index.\n\nIt's time we hold the Marge Schotts of pro sports accountable for the franchises they mismanage.\n\nThere are some alarming implications to Bill Plaschke's \"If it blows up baseball, so be it.\" Perhaps he means that MLB should be reduced to a burning garbage heap with three teams atop — Yankees, Cubs and Dodgers — because they were the only ones who went into the TV business and peddled their services for billions in the three largest TV markets.\n\nMaybe he yearns to transform MLB into the NHL of my childhood, with six teams. That was OK if you lived in a shallow arc extending between New York and Chicago — not so good for everyone else.\n\n\"So be it,\" as Plaschke would say, but I can guarantee I won't be the only one who isn't watching anymore.\n\nNaturally Dodger fans are all excited about the signing of the $60-million-a-year All-Star right fielder, Kyle Tucker. But we're not going to be happy when Dodger Stadium becomes the first MLB ballpark with a two-drink minimum.\n\nAs everyone seems to be raving about the Dodgers' acquisition of Kyle Tucker, I note the following: There is another player who was recently signed by the Yankees for less money and less signing bonus than Tucker who had higher numbers last year in average, home runs and WAR. He also plays more positions. Hadn’t the Dodgers heard of Cody Bellinger? Bellinger as a Yankee will never feel right to me.\n\nAsk a Major League Baseball owner like Arte Moreno, who sells out his ballpark whenever the Dodgers come to Anaheim, and sees Angel broadcast ratings surge whenever his team plays the Dodgers, if he thinks the Dodgers are ruining the game.\n\nThe Rams won the battle of which team gets to lose to Seattle.\n\nThe NFL needs to clarify exactly what does and doesn’t constitute pass interference. There is no consistency as to how it's called with each official seeming to have their own definition of what constitutes pass interference. It has gotten to the point where it’s worse than major league umpires and their own definition of the strike zone. NFL, you need to clean this up because these are major calls that are ruining games.\n\nBill Plaschke finally wrote a column about the Lakers with which I agree. LeBron James is the past, Austin Reaves is the future, and $50 million will help the Lakers rebuild. Yes, it's really as simple as that.\n\nWith the Lakers defense costing them multiple games, reminiscent of the coach Mike (no D)'Antoni days, the only real interesting Laker news last week were the alleged Jeanie Buss comments about the King. They sounded like they were lines taken from a scene in \"The Godfather\" .... \"What have I done to make you treat me so disrespectfully.\" My opinion is that it \"was not personal and strictly business.\"\n\nWhen asked after each game how he'd celebrate another victory, Indiana's Curt Cignetti would say, \"With a beer.\" After guiding his team to an undefeated season, and then winning the national championship, I doubt the Hoosiers' coach will ever have to buy another beer again.\n\nLincoln Riley is officially on the clock. In two years Curt Cignetti took a woebegone college team, with nary a five-star player, to an undefeated national championship. Cignetti has proven that, even in the NIL era, coaching matters. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick …\n\nCurt Cignetti and Indiana football playing in and winning the national championship was a modern-day version of the movie \"Hoosiers\" and would have made coach Norman Dale (actor Gene Hackman) proud. Now the question is, can new UCLA football coach Bob Chesney and his 40-plus transfers be the second coming of Indiana? Only time will tell.\n\nKings president Luc Robitaille appears to be happy with the Kings' status quo that appears to be getting one point every game in an overtime or shootout loss. Should we start referring to him as Luc RobitailleandthenloseinOT?\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

To that point, conquering everyday things had meant wearing her prosthetic leg consistently.\n\nBut the trip, sponsored by her hospital, which sent Huckaby and kids who lost mobility from osteosarcoma to the slopes, opened up her world.\n\n\"I fell in love with it immediately,\" she tells USA TODAY Sports. \"It was the first sport that I had found just not only (an) incredible challenge, but also this fear and this knowing that I could do it, and I wanted to do it.\"\n\nHuckaby, now 30, became an American Paralympic snowboarder who will once again be competing at the Olympics, this time at Milano Cortina. She won gold and bronze at Beijing in 2022.\n\nHave you ever taken the time to think about what sports, especially your favorite sport, means to you?\n\nWe caught up with Huckaby, who would also become the first Paralympian to appear in the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated and is now a sports mom, about how sports can give us the confidence to take on life’s biggest challenges.\n\nIf we set a goal, and we push ourselves, we can reap their benefits at no matter what level we achieve.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nHuckaby spoke to USA TODAY Sports on behalf of Hershey’s for the “It’s Your Happy Place” campaign. Athletes partnered with the chocolate and candy company to showcase how happiness is not only found in winning, but sweet, everyday moments.\n\nThose moments, she says, \"don’t have to be big and explosive.\" The small ones can matter the most.\n\n\"I feel like that's been my main focus the last eight years,\" she says. \"How can I enjoy the process, enjoy the journey, not just the destination? And I feel like that's way easier said than done. I've learned that taking time to pause, to slow down, to be in the moment, that's how I have found happiness, presence, gratitude, all the things that make me feel good. It’s been in those tiny moments throughout the day.\"\n\nAs young athletes (and parents), if we take the time to reflect on what we’re doing as we race to our different sports events, we can improve our awareness. Huckaby’s sport, she says, is mostly mental, and that part of her game helps her push through the excruciatingly physical parts.\n\n\"I feel like I don't make progress and grow unless I am mentally present and in a good headspace to learn,\" she says.  \"I would say the sooner that you can take moments to reflect on – whether it's your training in the gym or a practice that you had – what was hard, what was good, what do you want to improve on, and what did it teach you about yourself? When you can start practicing that, it makes the things that you've learned so much easier.\n\n\"Then you're able to see those moments of growth and (be) like, 'Wow, like I'm so glad that I learned that. And I'm so glad I pushed through that because I've got this thing that I'm dealing with at home and I know that I can take the mindsets from sport and apply it here.'\"\n\nReflection has helped Huckaby realize she performs her best when she’s calm. She works with a sports psychologist to help her channel her strength to high stakes situations.\n\nDo you remember the instance where you either discovered your favorite sport or realized it was the one you love most?\n\nHuckaby, who has two older brothers (Jordan and Jeremy), loved to jump around as a little girl. Jeremy, her middle brother, and her parents were really into martial arts, which she tried. Her instructor pulled her parents (Jeff and Kristie) aside and told them, \"You need to put her in gymnastics.\"\n\n\"What I loved the most was learning how to do flips in the gym and that's what my martial arts teachers would just teach me because that was all I could stay focused for,\" she says. \"So my parents listened and also they were tired of me doing cartwheels in the house and stuff, and they thought it was a way to save their TV.\"\n\nHuckaby's cancer, which led to the amputation, ended her gymnastics career. But, Huckaby says, she thought about how she loved moving her body and chasing adrenaline.\n\n\"When snowboarding came to me, 'I was like, this is it,'\" Huckaby says.\n\nShe moved to Utah, about a year after the hospital-led trip with her mom, who worked as a nurse there. The rest of the family stayed at their home in Louisiana, and Kristie moved back home when her daughter graduated high school.\n\n\"It gave me opportunity to just heal from cancer through snowboarding,\" Huckaby says. \"Sports (is) such a great way to understand life in the way that it challenges you and the way that you intimately get to know who you are.\n\n\"You gain so much confidence in your body and what your body's capable of. So during cancer, I never really questioned that I could handle it. I put myself in extreme situations through gymnastics training that I knew that I could handle what was to come.\n\n\"I think now as I've been doing this at a professional level for so long, I've learned, 'How do I put that more into my everyday life so that I'm not just an athlete?'\"\n\nHuckaby says she doesn’t so much balance her life, but embraces what’s important to her through every season.\n\nWhen she’s home, she trains vigorously but finds family time every day with her husband, Tristan Klegg, and young school-aged daughters, Lilah and Sloan. Klegg, a former snowboard cross athlete, realizes he sometimes needs to be at home with the girls at times over being with his wife. But they interact daily.\n\n\"He takes care of our kids while I'm away and when I'm training and (is) such a big support, making sure that we win, right?\" she says. \"It's a team effort for sure.\n\n\"I'm in the gym in the offseason three to five days a week,\" she says, \"and I say three to five because we're human. It's life, you know? So the ideal, the perfect, is five. The reality is usually three, and during that period, you're going really hard. And so those off days are really important. And then between snowboard season and gym season, we have two weeks off. We are encouraged to have fun and move our body in ways that feel good, but it doesn't have to be intense. It's just, 'Take time off.'\n\n“And then I usually give myself a fall break. I know that it's good for my mental health. So usually as Halloween starts rolling around, I'm less intense and then I crank back up (in) November, and then most of December and then (the) holidays, I give myself permission to just chill. Because I know it's about to get serious after Christmas.\n\n\"It's (about) finding a rhythm, but I absolutely rest.\"\n\nLilah and Sloan, Huckaby’s daughters, like skateboarding, wakeboarding, wake surfing and other action sports near their home in Montana.\n\nLilah, her older daughter, has tried gymnastics and does aerial silks, which Huckaby describes as art-based body movements.\n\n\"We're active,\" she says. \"That's where we're trying to shine. I don't ever want them to think anything has just been given to me and easy. Of course, there are moments that it looks easy and it's because of all the decades of work that I've put in on my body and then my mind. And so things look like they come together naturally, but, I love the phrase, 'An overnight success was not built overnight.' It was built, you know, a decade before, just quietly working.\n\n\"Like yesterday, I did not want to go to the gym. It was my third day of two-a-days and I was just like, 'I don't want to go.' And they saw that, and I got up and I went.\"\n\nBut Huckaby also never wants her daughters to think that she’s fearless. She has been scared many times, whether it's during training, free riding or competing.\n\n“But I'm brave, and I do it anyway, and I do it scared, and I trust my training, and I trust myself, and I hope that they learn to do that for themselves,\" she says.\n\nHuckaby was horrified, she says, when Sports Illustrated approached her to pose for its 2018 swimsuit edition. She thought she wasn’t confident enough to put herself out in the world in that way.\n\n\"Then I just thought about my 14-year-old self who had just lost her leg and was bald at the time and just felt unbeautiful and unworthy, and I remembered that she deserved to be represented in a way that she wanted to, and to be seen as someone who could be beautiful and could be lovable. And so I wanted to give that to her, and I'm so proud of myself for doing that.\"\n\nIn a similar way, we sometimes have to put ourselves, or our kids, out there for our first big competition. It’s a risk, for sure, but then that rush of adrenaline can come, the one you only get from sports.\n\n\"Bet on yourself,\" Huckaby says, \"because you're worth investing in. If you want it, go for it. If you feel like you have what it takes and you love what you're doing, go out there and give yourself the time to do it and the opportunity to do it because that's what matters more than when you got into your sport. It’s never too late.\"\n\nWe don’t need to have it all figured out. We might just need more perspective on what we’re doing, and what we’re spending.\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "title": "US sports say parity is essential for success. Premier League proves that untrue",
    "description": "There are no salary caps, no aprons, and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced",
    "fullText": "There are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced\n\nDavid Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.\n\nCurrent commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver said then in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”\n\n“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”\n\nFor decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.\n\nYet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won the Premier League just about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.\n\nConcerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double as handy instruments to write off taxes for billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.\n\nLately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.\n\nThey can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.\n\nThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rules now tweaked to merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.\n\nMore tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)\n\nCertainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.\n\nAt least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.\n\nThat’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

The Athletic surveyed over 100 industry insiders to find the figures who command the most respect in 2025. From tacticians to culture-setters, these are the names that define the modern standard. Here are the top 15 most admired leaders.\n\nRole: Quarterback, Kansas City Chiefs​\nMahomes makes the list because his leadership is as effortless as his playmaking. He balances supreme confidence with a calming presence that stabilizes the entire franchise when chaos hits. He isn’t just the face of the Chiefs; he is the league’s competitive north star.​\n\nRole: President of Basketball Operations, Boston Celtics​\nTransitioning from the sideline to the front office, Stevens proved that elite basketball IQ translates anywhere. He is admired for his cold, decisive roster management, prioritizing winning combinations over sentimentality. His vision turned a good team into a perennial juggernaut.​\n\nRole: Head Coach (Former)​\nCarroll’s legacy is built on a high-energy, positive culture that allowed players to be themselves. His “always compete” mantra wasn’t just a slogan; it was a daily way of life that resonated across generations of athletes. He remains the blueprint for the modern players’ coach.​\n\nRole: Quarterback, Philadelphia Eagles​\nHurts commands respect through a stoic demeanor that never fluctuates, regardless of the scoreboard. His leadership is quiet but heavy, grounded in a relentless work ethic that sets the temperature for the entire building. In a volatile market, he is the unshakeable constant.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, Michigan State​\nThe ultimate throwback, Izzo leads with a mix of brutal accountability and genuine, familial love. His teams mirror his identity: tough, physical, and built to survive the grind of March. Peers admire him for the fierce loyalty he inspires in everyone who wears the jersey.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, Pittsburgh Steelers​\nTomlin is the master of messaging, known for cutting through the noise with honesty that players crave. His greatest skill is his consistency; he prevents the floor from dropping out, no matter the roster turnover. He remains the standard for stability in the NFL.​\n\nRole: Forward, Las Vegas Aces​\nWilson has become the WNBA’s undisputed face, carrying the league’s growth with grace and dominance. She leads with accessibility and humor, anchoring a dynasty while shouldering the expectations of a superstar. She makes greatness look relatable.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, Detroit Lions​\nCampbell turned a punchline into a powerhouse by doubling down on authenticity and grit. He proved that vulnerability can be a strength, building a locker room that fights harder because they truly believe in the man leading them. His team is a direct reflection of his heart.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, USWNT​\nHayes brings a psychological edge to management, treating athletes as whole people to unlock their best performance. Her rapid success with Chelsea and the USWNT on the international stage showcased her ability to diagnose and fix culture instantly. She is a tactician who understands the human element first.​\n\nRole: General Manager, OKC Thunder​\nPresti is the long-game visionary who wasn’t afraid to look foolish in the short term to build something lasting. His disciplined approach to asset accumulation set a new template for success in small markets. He wins by sticking to the plan when others panic.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, Kansas City Chiefs​\nReid is the rare genius who lacks an ego, creating a collaborative environment where players’ personalities thrive. His offensive creativity is legendary, but his steady, fatherly hand is what keeps the dynasty humming. He makes the grind of football feel like a joyride.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, UConn​\nAuriemma demands a level of perfectionism that most programs can’t comprehend. His abrasive style works because it is rooted in a deep, relentless drive to extract every ounce of potential from his players. To play for him is to ​\n\nRole: Point Guard, Golden State Warriors​\nCurry’s leadership is defined by “joyful energy,” a selfless vibe that allowed a dynasty to breathe without ego battles. He is the rare alpha who invites others to share the spotlight rather than hoarding it. His presence dissolves tension and elevates everyone.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, South Carolina​\nStaley is a “truth-teller” who advocates fiercely for her players and the sport itself. She built a powerhouse by being a mentor first and a coach second, earning unshakeable trust from her roster. Her voice resonates far beyond the court.​\n\nRole: Head Coach, Golden State Warriors​\nKerr tops the list for his mastery of the soft skills, managing massive egos and keeping a dynasty hungry over a decade. His leadership is defined by emotional intelligence and perspective, keeping the game in balance for his team. He is the ultimate people manager.​\n\nThese fifteen leaders share one trait: the ability to make those around them better. Whether through tactical brilliance or emotional connection, they set the bar that the rest of the sports world chases.​\n\nThe post The Athletic’s top 15 leaders in sports appeared first on The Big Lead.",

The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport.\"\n\nShe was speaking before Trump said on Wednesday that he is seeking \"immediate negotiations\" to acquire Greenland for national security reasons, but that he \"won't use force\". His pursuit of the mineral-rich Arctic territory has caused growing tensions with European allies.\n\nDenmark could play in the World Cup - which will see 78 of the 104 matches staged in the US - if its team qualifies via play-offs.\n\nIn a statement, the chief executive of the Danish Football Association, Erik Brogger Rasmussen, told BBC Sport: \"We are, of course, aware of the current sensitive situation.\n\n\"Like many others, we are following it closely on an ongoing basis. Our focus right now is on winning the two matches in March and thereby qualifying for the World Cup.\"",

And it has brought many victories,” Javier Zanetti said.\n\n“Everything has changed,” he added. “I believe that a top club like Inter, known worldwide, needs a new, state-of-the-art stadium.\n\n“The important thing is that it’s always at San Siro. I hope we’ll be able to create special memories there as well.”\n\nFinally, Zanetti named his most memorable game in the Nerazzurri shirt.\n\n“My debut game,” he claimed. “I could never have imagined it would be the first of 858 matches.”\n\nZanetti spent his entire professional career in Europe at Inter. Indeed, he joined the club in 1995 and stayed here until 2014.\n\nUpon retirement, the Nerazzurri retired his No.4 jersey, paying tribute to one of the most iconic figures in club history.\n\nHowever, Zanetti couldn’t stay away from his beloved Inter, returning to the club in a different capacity shortly after hanging up his boots.",

    "description": "The 2025 season is hardly over. That's not stopping us from looking eight months ahead.",
    "fullText": "The 2025 season just barely ended, but that's not stopping us from looking eight months ahead.\n\nHere's our way-too-early top 25 for the 2026 college football season. A lot can and will change in the months before the season begins in late August. But here's our quick and undoubtedly wrong look at how the field could stack up.\n\nHow do the Cavaliers follow up the best season in school history? Tony Elliott signed QBs Beau Pribula (Missouri) and Eli Holstein (Pitt) to replace Chandler Morris along with a few key defenders from the transfer portal. Virginia should be near the top of the ACC again.\n\nQB Luke Altmyer is out of eligibility and Bret Bielema brought in former East Carolina QB Katin Houser to replace him. The addition of FIU WR Alex Perry could be significant too. He had 56 grabs for 840 yards in 2025. This is a team that’s won 19 games over the past two seasons and should again be safely bowl eligible.\n\nThe Huskies dodged a huge loss when Demond Williams Jr. decided he was going to stay for the 2026 season. Williams can enter the season as a sleeper Heisman candidate and is the reason why we have Washington ranked. If he had left, coach Jedd Fisch would have had a huge hole to fill at QB.\n\nIs it a make-or-break season for Shane Beamer? Yes, the Gamecocks had a rough schedule in 2025, but the defense took a step back and the offensive line was rough. SC added NC State OL Jacarrius Peak in the transfer portal and QB LaNorris Sellers is back along with edge rusher Dylan Stewart.\n\nDid Houston have the quietest 10-win season in 2025? QB Conner Weigman is back for a second season after he threw for over 2,700 yards and 25 TDs and the Cougars have added a very solid transfer class. The team’s top two signees are offensive linemen and former Tulane RB Makhi Hughes comes over from Oregon where he hopes to recapture the form he had with the Green Wave.\n\nWe’re already bullish on the quick turnaround James Franklin can engineer in Blacksburg. He’s brought over a host of transfers from Penn State, including QB Ethan Grunkemeyer and TE Luke Reynolds along with CB Jaquez White from Troy and edge rusher Javion Hilson from Missouri.\n\nCan Lincoln Kienholz have a breakout season with the Cardinals? After multiple seasons as a backup at Ohio State, Kienholz is now the favorite to start at QB. Coach Jeff Brohm kept RB Isaac Brown from entering the transfer portal and also added Vanderbilt WR Tre Richardson.\n\nAs many former Nittany Lions have gone to Virginia Tech, even more Iowa State players have followed Matt Campbell to State College. That includes QB Rocco Becht, RB Carson Hansen, CB Jeremiah Cooper and a bunch of others. Building a team out of Iowa State players isn’t flashy, but Campbell is the winningest coach in school history for a reason.\n\nThe Mustangs bring back QB Kevin Jennings and added former Cal RB Kendrick Raphael in the transfer portal. He rushed for 943 yards and 13 scores in 2025. The loss of offensive coordinator Casey Woods could hurt — he’s the new head coach at Missouri State — but Rhett Lashlee’s offense should be one of the best in the ACC once again.\n\nIt’s hard to see how Michigan could have done much better than getting Kyle Whittingham after it fired Sherrone Moore. Whittingham brings offensive coordinator Jason Beck with him from Utah and Bryce Underwood could have a breakout season under Beck. DE John Henry Daley and other players have followed Whittingham from Salt Lake City, too.\n\nThe Cougars lost defensive coordinator Jay Hill after Whittingham hired him at Michigan and replaced Hill with longtime assistant Kelly Poppinga. QB Bear Bachmeier should be even better in 2026 and getting leading rusher LJ Martin back for his senior year is a big boost.\n\nThe Trojans have the top-ranked recruiting class in the country heading into the 2026 season. How many of those players can make an immediate impact? Lincoln Riley’s offense will be very good once again. The onus is on the defense … again. The Trojans haven’t allowed fewer than 5.5 yards per play since it gave up 5.4 yards a play in 2018 under Clay Helton.\n\nWe’re betting on a full offseason of health for John Mateer. He’s back for another run at it with the Sooners and was fantastic before he suffered a broken bone in his throwing hand in Week 4 against Auburn. OU’s defense was good enough to win a national title in 2025, but the offense simply wasn’t in the second half of the season.\n\nWith Ty Simpson off to the NFL, it’s up to Austin Mack or Keelon Russell to start at QB for the Crimson Tide. Mack has more familiarity with Kalen DeBoer and Ryan Grubb’s offensive system. Russell is a former five-star recruit. The Tide also bring in No. 1 running back recruit Ezavier Crowell. Can he make Alabama’s run game work again?\n\nLet’s be clear: This ranking is betting on Trinidad Chambliss winning his legal fight to get a sixth year of eligibility from the NCAA. The Rebels are clear contenders to get back to the College Football Playoff if he’s back in Oxford. If he’s not, there are major questions at quarterback after Austin Simmons transferred to Missouri.\n\nJust like with Ole Miss, we’re doing a bit of quarterback projection here and assuming that Darian Mensah ends up a Hurricane. If he doesn’t, then adjust your expectations accordingly. A young secondary should get even better in 2026 and Malachi Toney will be a sleeper Heisman candidate.\n\nQB CJ Carr got better as the season went on in 2025 and could be one of the best quarterbacks in college football in 2026. The Irish made some late moves in the transfer portal, have the No. 2 high school recruiting class in the country and, most importantly, coach Marcus Freeman rebuffed NFL interest to stay in South Bend.\n\nThe Aggies bring back QB Marcel Reed, RB Le’Veon Moss and WR Mario Craver. They also have On3’s No. 3 transfer portal class as they’ve loaded up on defense. Five of the Aggies’ top six rated transfers are all on that side of the ball, including former Tennessee QB Rickey Gibson and former Northwestern edge rusher Anto Saka.\n\nRaiding the transfer portal worked really well for Texas Tech ahead of the 2025 season. Why not do it again and add a QB this time? Brendan Sorsby comes over from Cincinnati and Texas Tech is reloading up front again after the success that its defensive line had in 2025.\n\nLane Kiffin got his quarterback in former Arizona State signal-caller Sam Leavitt. He also added former five-star recruit Husan Longstreet from USC. LSU was one of the biggest underachievers in 2025. This is a roster that can make the College Football Playoff. And, given the way Kiffin left Ole Miss, anything less than making the CFP semifinals can be considered a disappointment.\n\nQB Gunner Stockton is set to come back after he finished in the top 10 of the Heisman voting. The Bulldogs need to replace Zachariah Branch and CJ Allen, but this is a team loaded with top-tier recruits. Even though Georgia has lost in the quarterfinals in each of the past two seasons, we’re not betting against Kirby Smart’s team anytime soon.\n\nQB Julian Sayin and WR Jeremiah Smith are back as the Buckeyes are now the chasers in the Big Ten once again. Losing Sonny Styles, Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs on defense is significant, but Matt Patricia’s unit was so, so good in 2025 that it’s hard to see them taking a huge step back in 2026.\n\nThe Hoosiers have become one of the best teams at navigating the transfer portal and they have the top class in the country in 2026 after winning the national championship this season. Former TCU QB Josh Hoover is in line to replace Fernando Mendoza and WR Nick Marsh is a stellar add from Michigan State. Don’t overlook the edge rushing depth that Curt Cignetti signed as well.\n\nGet ready for another offseason of Texas talk. Don’t say you haven’t been warned. The Longhorns have loaded up on offense for what could be QB Arch Manning’s final season. RBs Raleek Brown and Hollywood Smothers arrived via the transfer portal along with former Auburn WR Cam Coleman. Oh, the defense is coordinated by Will Muschamp again, too. How good can he make that unit?\n\nThe return of Dante Moore for the 2026 season isn’t the only reason the Ducks are in this spot. Yes, Oregon loses TE Kenyon Sadiq, S Dillon Thieneman and LB Bryce Boettcher, but Matayo Uiagalelei is back along the defensive line along with A’Mauri Washington and Bear Alexander. RB Jordon Davison should be better as a sophomore and Oregon added Minnesota S Koi Perich in the transfer portal too.",

    "fullText": "As ESPN readies to air the College Football Playoff National Championship game, the sports network is announcing plans for a documentary series on the coach who has won more national championships than anyone else – Nick Saban.\n\nThe six-part series titled Saban, from ESPN and Word + Pictures, is directed by Russell Dinallo and produced by Words + Pictures’ Connor Schell, Libby Geist, Aaron Cohen, and Alexa Conway along with Tom Rinaldi, with Gabe Honig serving as co-executive producer and showrunner. It will document the man who won seven college football national championships – one at LSU and six at the University of Alabama.\n\nCollege Football Playoff National Championship: How To Watch Indiana Vs. Miami On TV & Online\n\nNFL Playoffs Schedule: How To Watch All Divisional Round Games Live Online & On TV\n\nDish Countersues Disney In Fight Over Sling TV Passes\n\nWatch a teaser for the Saban series below.\n\n“The series will peel back the curtain on the long closely guarded world of Saban,” notes a release, “with hundreds of hours of never-before-seen footage from the locker room and practice fields, as well as many other behind-the-scenes moments in his career at Alabama, and prior to that LSU, the Miami Dolphins, and Michigan State among other stops. There’s also a wealth of present-day interviews with Saban and his wife, the legendary Ms. Terry Saban, whose own influence and impact played a massive role in Nick’s success as a coach and leader.”\n\nSaban retired two years ago from Alabama and now serves as an ESPN analyst – as well as a pitchman for Aflac and Vrbo.\n\n“With my coaching days behind me, Ms. Terry and I have been doing a lot of reflection and realized we were ready to tell our story,” Nick Saban said. “The team at Words + Pictures has encouraged me to really look back not just at my time at Alabama, but every stop along the way – and not just reflect on what happened but consider the process which made it happen. I interacted with a lot of players and coaches along the way and I’m happy to see that so many of them have contributed to this docuseries. There’s a lot to tell, and I’m excited to share it all.”\n\nIn addition to his national titles, Saban’s football programs produced four Heisman Trophy winners and innumerable NFL stars. ESPN says the series will include “more than 30 hours of interviews with Saban, and more than 80 interviews with former players, assistant coaches, rivals, family, friends, and observers, the series offers a rare look at how he became the most successful and influential figure that the game of college football has ever known.”\n\n“There will never be another Nick Saban,” observed Connor Schell, CEO of Words + Pictures. “He’s a football genius, a singular leader, and a true icon who has done more than anyone to shape the modern game of college football and the culture around it. When you work with Coach Saban, you’re constantly reminded how every small detail matters and, in his case, that attention to detail and process has added up to an incredible journey and legacy. Working with Coach Saban and Ms. Terry has been a tremendous experience, and we can’t wait to share their story with the world.”\n\nESPN says the premiere date and full rollout plans for the series will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More",

    "fullText": "Manchester City have signed England defender Marc Guehi (25) from Crystal Palace in a deal worth an initial £20m, as reported by Sky Sports.\n\nThe 25-year-old has agreed a five-and-a-half-year contract at the Etihad Stadium, keeping him at City until 2031, with the deal also including a sell-on clause for Palace.\n\nCity moved for Guehi after suffering a number of injuries in defence. The centre-back was out of contract at the end of the season and had been close to joining Liverpool last summer, while Arsenal and Bayern Munich were also interested.\n\n“I am really happy and incredibly proud to be a Manchester City player,” said Guehi. “I am now at the best club in England and part of an unbelievable squad. I can’t wait to get started.”\n\nCity manager Pep Guardiola said the transfer was only possible because of Guehi’s contract situation, with several clubs hoping to sign him on a free transfer in the summer. He praised Guehi’s quality and versatility, saying he can play on either side of central defence.\n\nThe former Chelsea defender becomes City’s second January signing following the arrival of forward Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth. City’s spending over the past 12 months now stands at around £445m.\n\nCrystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner criticised the timing of the move, saying his side were “completely abandoned” by the club’s hierarchy after selling their captain so close to a match.\n\nGuehi leaves Palace having established himself as one of the Premier League’s most reliable defenders and a regular for England. For City, he arrives as an experienced option who can make an immediate impact as they continue to compete on multiple fronts.",

She reached 1,000 career points in just 78 games, with 774 of those points coming in 59 games at Truman State. She finished with 15 points on the day, a fifth consecutive game of 15-plus.\n\nThe Coyotes kept control down the stretch, not allowing Denver within 10 of the lead for the entire second half. The Pioneers shot 31.6% from the field and 22.2% from three, but under their season averages.\n\nOutside of Williams’ double-double, Joyce was second on the Coyotes in scoring Saturday with 15. Elise Turrubiates tallied 13 points and Tori Schlagel 10.

All three prior games in this season series have gone to overtime, with the Penguins losing in a shootout in October but winning in overtime in November and earlier this month.\n\nHidden Stat: The Penguins are in a playoff spot in no small part thanks to their success against division opponents this season. Including their 2-0-1 record against the Blue Jackets, the Pens have gone 9-1-3 against teams in the Metropolitan Division so far this season.

Columbus general manager Don Waddell said the team doesn’t expect the injury to be long-term.\n\nCoaching change in Columbus: The Blue Jackets fired former coach Dean Evason last week after one and a half seasons and a 19-19-7 start to the 2025-26 campaign. Evason told The Athletic’s Aaron Portzline he was “blindsided” by his dismissal.\n\nThe switch allowed the Jackets to bring in Rick Bowness, 70, who had most recently coached the Winnipeg Jets for two seasons from 2022 to 2024. He hasn’t been with the team for very long— he got the job offer Monday afternoon and joined the team Tuesday morning, per ESPN— but he’s since led the Jackets to wins over the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks.\n\nBones got the boys ready to go 👊\n\nCBJ x @PNCBank pic.twitter.com/tJ0gjt6C8V\n\n— Columbus Blue Jackets (@BlueJacketsNHL) January 14, 2026\n\nKent Johnson played a season-high 20:55 during his first game with Bowness. The Jackets could be hoping to see some more production from the second-line winger if he keeps getting more playing time going forward.\n\nLike the Penguins, the Blue Jackets have at times had a problems with holding on to late leads through the first half of the season. They blew third-period leads 15 times in their first 47 games, per Brian Hedger of the Columbus Dispatch. When asked about that habit after the Jackets held on to a comfortable lead in Thursday’s win over the Vancouver Canucks, Bowness said, per Portzline: “I don’t even worry about it. It was before I got here. I’m just not worried about it… That’s in the past. I know how I want us to play, so that’s the bottom line. And we’re building on that.”\n\nRickard Rakell – Sidney Crosby – Bryan Rust\n\nEgor Chinakhov – Tommy Novak – Evgeni Malkin\n\nAnthony Mantha – Ben Kindel – Justin Brazeau\n\nConnor Dewar – Blake Lizotte – Noel Acciari\n\nParker Wotherspoon / Jack St. Ivany\n\nGoalies: Stuart Skinner and Arturs Silovs\n\nPotential Scratches: Ryan Graves, Kevin Hayes\n\nIR: Erik Karlsson, Filip Hallander, Caleb Jones, Rutger McGroarty\n\nThe Penguins had an off day Friday after Thursday’s 6-3 win over the Flyers.\n\nSidney Crosby has 69 points (24 goals, 45 assists) in 48 career games against the Blue Jackets, which ranked behind only Patrick Kane for the most among any active NHL player. Kris Letang meanwhile leads all NHL defensemen with 14 goals against the Blue Jackets, his highest total against any single team, per Penguins PR.\n\nThe Penguins are 14-1-4 in their last 19 games against the Blue Jackets, and they’re 16-0-2 in their last 18 games against the Jackets at home, per Penguins PR.\n\nThe Pens’ special teams have been thriving lately.

    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section give their thoughts on the Chargers' playoff exit, the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the, Lakers, Clippers and Chloe Kim.",
    "fullText": "If there’s an important playoff game for the Chargers to win, you can bet they’re going to lose. Such was the case again against New England.\n\nWhile having a decent enough defense, the offense was pathetic. And, yes, I know their offensive line was completely depleted. But, the 49ers were banged up as well. They lost George Kittle and still won.\n\nWell, there’s always “next season.” Unfortunately, those two words still haunt the Chargers and their fans.\n\nOnce again the Chargers flop in the playoffs.\n\nThis time much of the blame should be placed at the top with Jim Harbaugh. Perhaps he did not watch or was not aware of how many times in this year's playoffs teams had failed to convert on fourth down with disastrous consequences. The psychological effect on the team from failing to convert and put points on the board early was evident. He had a team without their top running back and a very weak offensive line yet chose to go for it.\n\nHopefully he will learn from this or maybe it is time for Harbaugh to join his brother in seeking new jobs.\n\nNothing wrong with the Chargers that a new OC with a game plan can't fix. Or is there?\n\nThanks for firing your OC Greg Roman. Loyalty is great but loyalty does not get you to the promised land. In two postseason trips, one touchdown to show for it.\n\nIt needed to be done for Justin Herbert & Co.\n\nThe Yankees won 27 World Series championships by being the best team money can buy. The west coast Yankees, aka the Dodgers, are now the best team money can buy. That's capitalism, baby!\n\nAs a Dodgers fan for a Joe DiMaggio-esque 56 consecutive seasons, I am happy to have Kyle Tucker in the Dodgers' outfield in 2026. Certainly, he will be an improvement over Michael Conforto, and allow Teoscar Hernandez to go back to left field.\n\nHowever, I find it perplexing that a player who appeared in only 78 and 136 games in 2024 and 2025, and who has had only one top 10 MVP finish (fifth in 2023) in his career, would be signed for a whopping average of $60-million annually. To earn that enormous salary over the next four seasons, Tucker should be considered the best player in baseball not named Shohei Ohtani.\n\nNewsflash! The Dodgers buy another superstar, cost be damned! I'm not a Dodgers fan. I'm a Baseball fan, witnessing an organization job a system that destroys parity and fairplay. So go ahead — hop aboard the Dodgers bandwagon for another championship. While baseball fans everywhere else throw up their hands in disgust and flock to the NFL.\n\nThe Dodgers' signing of Kyle Tucker for ridiculous money now ensures a (stoppage) after this baseball season. For everyone saying other teams could do the same thing, really? As much as anyone could love the Dodgers, this just takes away from the game.\n\nIf you’re mad at the Dodgers don't stop there — might as well don a cape and be super mad because MLB has no kryptonite against them.\n\nWe should not expect too much from the Lakers. We have the same offense ran by the Dallas Mavericks for Luka Doncic transplanted to L.A. Give the ball to Luka and everyone else stands around and watch. Who is teaching these guys defense?\n\nHow many more games do fans have to endure before the Lakers hire a coach who is a defensive specialist?

    "description": "The explosive growth of women’s sports has been a well-documented phenomenon over the last four years. But when Chicago hosts the 2026 WNBA All-Star Weekend in July, Kara Bachman — the executive director of the Chicago Sports Commission — wants the city’s investors and businesses to do more than just cheer from the sidelines. “Do a little more,” Bachman said Friday during a launch event in ...",
    "fullText": "The explosive growth of women’s sports has been a well-documented phenomenon over the last four years.\n\nBut when Chicago hosts the 2026 WNBA All-Star Weekend in July, Kara Bachman — the executive director of the Chicago Sports Commission — wants the city’s investors and businesses to do more than just cheer from the sidelines.\n\n“Do a little more,” Bachman said Friday during a launch event in Fulton Market. “Put your money where your mouth is.”\n\nThe league’s All-Star festivities will return to Chicago for the second time from July 23-25, with the game scheduled for Saturday, July 25 at the United Center. Those dates are more than six months away — but planning already has begun for a cornerstone of the WNBA calendar.\n\nThe latest step of that process took place Friday in a launch event headlined by Gov. JB Pritzker, mayor Brandon Johnson and part-owner Dwyane Wade as the Sky and the city made their pitch to local investors and business leaders to take part in the weekend.\n\nAccording to a report by Front Office Sports, Chicago was the only city to bid for hosting the 2026 All-Star weekend. The reticence from other teams? Hosting duties are split between the host team and the league, making the weekend an expensive affair as the standard for logistics such as hotels, parties and activations rise meteorically with the sport as a whole.\n\nSky co-owner and operating chair Nadia Rawlinson spearheaded the pitch for Chicago to land the event. She said the Sky are embracing the responsibility as an opportunity to highlight Chicago as a whole. While some features — a welcoming event, sponsor activations featuring star players, an invite-only party organized in collaboration with the players union — will be familiar from past iterations, Friday’s launch outlined a series of plans and initiatives to expand the event’s footprint.\n\nThis includes a series of VIP roundtable dinners in the months leading up to the event and an innovation summit to highlight and support advancements in women’s sports. During All-Star weekend, Rawlinson said the Sky will host a radio row to highlight prominent sports and business shows. The Sky also plan to partner with the city for a series of community initiatives around the weekend, including a project to add the WNBA 3-point line to basketball courts at every public park in Chicago.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Rawlinson emphasized that the Sky and the WNBA will seek to highlight the diversity of the league’s fanbase.\n\n“The WNBA is (a place) where everyone can find their person,” Rawlinson said. “They can find connection. This is a place where typically people who don’t have a natural community can find community. This is our chance to highlight that.”\n\nChicago hosted the 2022 WNBA All-Star Game at Wintrust Arena — home of the Sky. For the first time in franchise history, the team last season played two regular-season games at the United Center. The home of the NBA’s Bulls and NHL’s Blackhawks has nearly double the capacity of Wintrust’s 10,380.",

In a recent poll they conducted of over 115 sports figures, each of them nominating five of their personal best. The picks consisted of players, coaches and executives, which puts even more weight on these rankings.\n\nFreeman came in No. 20, the first college football head coach named, ahead of megastars like LA Laker LeBron James and New York Yankee Aaron Judge. There were only two other college coaches named with one other receiving multiple votes.\n\nFormer women’s basketball coach Muffet McGraw was one of the voters, as she noted “he puts players first, focusing on developing the whole person rather than just the athlete.”\n\nThis goes to show that Notre Dame has one of the best in the sport, and you could argue in all of sports. Freeman represents the university like he’s alum, and it’s clear the Irish have a great on leading their program.\n\nInspiring others by the way he leads ☘️\n\nCoach @Marcus_Freeman1 was named as one of the 40 most admired leaders in sports from 2025 in a survey of over 100 people in sports led by @TheAthletic.#GoIrish☘️ pic.twitter.com/FjszEviI8v\n\n— Notre Dame Football (@NDFootball) January 16, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Marcus Freeman is named as a the top leaders in all of sports",

(WETM) – The 18 Sports Blitz returned for a special night in high school hoops.\n\nHornell girls basketball highlighted Friday night’s 18 Sports Blitz, with a pair of historic moments at Alfred University. The top-ranked Red Raiders breezed past Haverling 61-24, while improving to (10-1), and celebrating a two historic moments for the program. Midway through the 1st quarter of the contest, Selena Maldonado kicked off the senior night festivities, scoring an “and one,” off of a layup. At the line, Maldonado converted the free throw to earn the 1,000th point of her high school career.\n\nIn the 2nd, fellow senior Jordyn Dyring added to Hornell’s 21-5 lead and etched her name in history. With a floater in the paint, Dyring surpassed 1,527 career points to become the all-time leading scorer for the girl’s program. The impressive record had stood since 1996, when Megan Buchanan wrapped up her high school career with the Red Raiders. Buchanan would follow up her high school success at Division I U Albany.\n\nBuchanan was enshrined in both, the Hornell High School and Albany Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011, following an outstanding career. With the Great Danes, the Arkport native earned Female Athlete of the Year, as a member of the golf and basketball teams.

After her playing career, Buchanan has been serving as Senior Associate Athletic Director at Skidmore College, since 2005.\n\nElsewhere in high school basketball, the Horseheads girls wrapped up the STAC West Division title.

    "fullText": "Jan 16 (Reuters) - A study by AI risk management platform Alethea into the surge in artificial intelligence-generated fake content, dubbed \"AI slop,\" has warned sports teams, leagues and fans of the risks posed by increasingly sophisticated digital misinformation.\n\nRetired NFL player Jason Kelce never said ​2026 Super Bowl halftime singer Bad Bunny's critics were \"a bad fit for America's future\".\n\nSan Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle never ranted about slain ‌conservative activist Charlie Kirk and politics in football.\n\nHowever, thousands of people believed they did and that is the problem.\n\n\"Teams and players are suddenly being accused of things that are completely fabricated,\" Lisa Kaplan, ‌founder and CEO of Alethea, told Reuters on Friday, adding that the evolution of AI tools has made fake news a more daunting challenge.\n\n\"Content now looks real and is produced at a volume that makes it hard for the average person to determine if it's authentic,\" she said.\n\n\"Before, fake news often relied on human labour to repetitively copy and paste content. Today, AI can impersonate brands and create engaging images that mimic genuine announcements.\"\n\nKaplan noted that this wave of AI-generated misinformation has disrupted the traditional monetisation ⁠model of sports media. \"These networks drive engagement to questionable websites, ‌skew advertising metrics, and can even create scenarios that could manipulate betting markets,\" she added.\n\nC Shawn Eib, Alethea's Head of Investigations, described how these networks use tactics such as making multiple disjointed announcements, like the conflicting claims that former Baltimore Ravens coach ‍John Harbaugh had been hired by multiple teams at the same time.\n\n\"When a single figure appears to be linked with several teams at the same time, it quickly becomes clear that an AI system is behind the creation of these images,\" Eib explained.\n\nAI DECEPTION CAN EXPLOIT 'RAGE BAIT'\n\nThe content follows a formula: fake game updates, nonexistent celebrity feuds, manufactured scandals, and politicised ​quotes falsely attributed to star players.\n\nThe fabricated Kelce and Kittle quotes are prime examples. Both NFL stars publicly denied making comments they never said after the ‌posts went viral.\n\n\"If fans, players and even entire franchises fall prey to these manipulated narratives, it risks damaging reputations, undermining trust and even politicising sport,\" Alethea's VP of Communications Kaila Ryan said.\n\n\"Sports organisations need to proactively manage their brands and digital safety. It is crucial for teams and leagues to start monitoring these risks, work together across communications, legal and security teams, and educate fans to verify announcements from official channels,\" she added.\n\nThe business impact extends beyond reputational harm.\n\nThese networks siphon ad revenue from legitimate sports media and distort audience metrics. Some outbound links have been flagged for phishing and malicious redirects, presenting real fraud risk to fans.\n\nThe problem ⁠is not limited to the NFL. Alethea discovered similar operations targeting the NBA, WNBA, MLB, NHL, ​NASCAR, Formula 1, IndyCar and professional tennis.\n\nKaplan added that beyond monetisation, sport remains a rare cultural ​touchpoint that unites people, making them attractive targets for influence operations, and she pointed to Russia's alleged exploitation of then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's 2018 'Take a Knee' protest as a precedent.\n\nIn a 2019 report, the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed that Russian trolls had focused heavily ‍on the kneeling debate as part of ⁠a broader effort to stoke racial tensions and divide the U.S. following the 2016 election.\n\n\"Kaepernick's protests were exploited for a purpose that had nothing to do with sport. Instead, it's a way of leveraging a cultural touchstone and turning it into something that polarises people,\" said Kaplan.\n\n\"Teams need to ⁠work in unison to defend their identities and protect their fans from falling victim to fraud or manipulation,\" she added, noting that the best advice for fans is to be vigilant.\n\n\"Verify breaking news ‌through official team channels, don't click links in suspicious page comments and remember that outrage is often the product, not the by-product, ‌of what you're seeing\".",

With the Call of Duty franchise having an off year with Black Ops 7, sports titles took the top spots in PlayStation Store's American/Canadian and European PlayStation 5 downloads.\n\nNBA 2K26 was No. 1 in America and Canada, while EA Sports FC 26 claimed the top spot in Europe. It was previously clear that Black Ops 7 would have a hard time repeating Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's chart-topping performance in 2024. But the latest Call of Duty installment fell to No. 7 in America/Canada and Europe. By contrast, Battlefield 6 performed very well in both territories, with a No. 2 finish in North America and a fifth place slot in Europe. Through the end of November 2025, Circana had Battlefield 6 as the best-selling game of the year. But this particular list is only for PlayStation Store downloads and it doesn't count sales on other consoles or PC.\n\nThe lists contained some returning favorites like Minecraft and Helldivers 2, but newcomers like Arc Raiders, Ghost of Yotei, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made the cut in North America as well.\n\nAmong PlayStation 4 games, Red Dead Redemption 2 claimed No. 1 in both territories. Rockstar Games' 2018 open-world western has remained remarkably resilient, as has Grand Theft Auto 5, which placed highly on both the PS5 and PS4 lists.\n\nBeat Saber also claimed the top slots in America/Canada and Europe's PSVR 2 Games charts, and repeated its wins from 2024. Similarly, Fortnite was also a back-to-back winner for free-to-play games in both territories.\n\nThe complete list of 2025's top games on PlayStation Store can be found below.",

    "fullText": "In a recent report, Sky Sports stated that Arsenal are in the running to land Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi. It has been mentioned that the Gunners would have to rival Manchester City, Liverpool and Bayern Munich in the race to sign the English centre-back.\n\nGuehi has enjoyed a decent run of form at the South London club as he has put in a series of impressive displays for them on the defensive end of the field. The English talent has scored three goals and grabbed four assists in 33 appearances for Crystal Palace this season on all fronts.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been a rock at the back for the Eagles and deserves credit for making 30 tackles, 18 blocks, 25 interceptions and 105 clearances in the Premier League. He has even distributed the ball accurately from inside his half, as evidenced by his pass success rate of 84.5% in top-flight football (stats via fbref.com).\n\nHis current contract at Selhurst Park will run out at the end of this campaign. Hence, Arsenal could potentially sign him on a cut-price deal this month or on a free transfer next summer.\n\nSTRASBOURG, FRANCE – NOVEMBER 27: Marc Guehi of Crystal Palace during the UEFA Conference League 2025/26 League Phase MD4 match between Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace and Crystal Palace FC at Stade de la Meinau on November 27, 2025 in Strasbourg, France. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nGuehi loves a tackle and can time his challenges well to earn the ball back for his team inside his half. He usually puts his foot through the ball when required and can play his way out from the back.\n\nThe English sensation has got a wealth of experience at the highest level and won’t take much time to settle into life at Arsenal. He is also a great leader on the pitch.\n\nGuehi would undoubtedly bring more bite and steel to Mikel Arteta’s defence. He has what it takes to compete for a regular first-team spot at the Emirates Stadium in the coming seasons.\n\nAt 25, Guehi has his peak years ahead of him, which makes him a decent option for the Gunners to pursue this January or at the end of this campaign. He might even help Arsenal challenge for some major trophies over the next few years. Therefore, Arteta would be wise to try everything in his power to snap Guehi up soon.",

    "fullText": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\nThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024.\n\nMiss Universe Harnaaz Sandhu Joins Tiger Shroff, Sanjay Dutt in 'Baaghi 4' - Global Bulletin\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, ZEE5, SonyLIV Vie for India's IFFI Streaming Honor - Global Bulletin\n\nFox Orders Lifeguard Drama Series 'Rescue: Hi-Surf' from Producer John Wells (TV News Roundup)\n\nWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\nThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\nRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\nSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\nFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\nMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\nShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\nThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

(WMBD/WYZZ) — Morton did it to Washington again.\n\nPaige Selke and Abby VanMeenen scored 12 points each as third-ranked Morton handed top-ranked Washington its first loss of the season, 41-37, in a match-up of teams at the top of the Mid-Illini Conference standings Tuesday at Morton High School. The hosts (15-3, 7-0) led by as many as 12 points in the third quarter then had to hang on as the Panthers (17-1, 7-1) rallied to close within two in the final seconds.\n\nLast year, Morton went to No. 1 Washington and ended the Panthers season-opening 21-game win streak with a 46-45 win at Torry Gym. The Panthers returned the favor by beating the Potters in the regular season finale and in the sectional championship on the way to finishing third at state.\n\nPenelope Drake scored nine points for the Potters but may have delivered the game’s biggest play when she blocked a three-point shot by Washington’s Avery Tibbs with 0:15 left as Washington was aiming to tie the game. Tibbs finished with a game-high 14 points.\n\nThe two teams will meet again on Feb. 10 in the final game of the regular season in Washington.\n\nOther girls basketball winners included Notre Dame, Richwoods, Normal Community, Normal West, Metamora, Canton. Pekin, and Illini Bluffs. Boys basketball winners Tuesday included Normal Community, Normal West, Richwoods, Manual, Washington, Leroy, Fieldcrest, El Paso-Gridley, Elmwood and Peoria Heights.",

    "fullText": "Editor's note: Coaches are reminded to send in game results each weeknight, from 6-10 p.m., by emailing them to pjsports@providencejournal.com\n\nMarielle Nassiff provided some offensive pop in the third quarter that gave the Quakers the separation they needed to close out the Purple in their 51-37 win.\n\nThe first quarter was tough defensive basketball, as Moses Brown led 9-4, then took a 24-15 lead into halftime thanks to nine points from Nassiff and six from Lauren Bousquet in the second quarter.\n\nWith Classical still hanging around, the Quakers revved up the defensive measures. They limited the Purple to just five points in the third quarter and Nassiff got herself some buckets, scoring eight points in the stretch to build a 42-20 lead heading to the fourth quarter.\n\nNassiff finished as Moses Brown’s top scorer with 23 points. Bousquet was right behind her with 21 points and Adelaide Crosby and Madison Wilson accounted for the remaining seven points.\n\nJaydell Harris was the top scorer for Classical, putting up 12 points. Daniella Jimenez had seven in the loss.\n\nCranston West’s offense was feeling good on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Falcons made seven 3-pointers … in the first quarter against the Rebels. The early shooting led to a 28-point frame as Cranston West toppled South Kingston, 74-36, on the road in a Division I matchup.\n\nCranston West finished with 13 treys in the game with Talya Walker (19 points) making five from distance. Kyla Buco (18 points) was right behind her with four makes from beyond the arc. Walker and Buco each made three triples in the opening frame.\n\nSaniyya Chase scored a dozen points and Madeleine Marques added 11 in the victory. It was the Falcons’ best offensive game of the season by a wide margin as the Falcons hadn’t broken 60 points yet this season. Might Tuesday’s win spark a run for Cranston West?\n\nAn important matchup with Westerly awaits on Saturday at home.\n\nIt was close all night, but Chariho pulled out a nailbiter vs. St. Raphael in Division I play.\n\nThe Chargers carried just a 6-point lead into the break and that was enough to hold off the Saints behind Tessa Aiello’s 16 points. With scoring contributions from six different players, the Chargers used their balanced attack to secure their fourth win of the year.\n\nMenuhki Harris managed a dozen points and had 10 fouls shots in the game as the junior was tough to defend. The Chargers added six points from the line in their decisive 14-point fourth quarter that helped keep them ahead.\n\nAdrianna Noka supplied eight points in the win. Tuesday was a key win at home for the Chargers as they travel to Westerly on Thursday night for a rivalry match. Chariho could play upset against the Bulldogs, who are looking like one of the best teams in the state to start the year.\n\nSRA was paced by 16 points from Carolyn Abreu. The Saints host West Warwick on Thursday.\n\nGenesis Castro scored a team-high 18 points, including 4 buckets from beyond the arc, and teammates Ella Martin and Faith Van Ness added 13 and 11 points, respectively, in the Eagles victory, as Barrington is now 10-1 and ranked second to only Westerly in Division I.\n\nFor the Patriots in the loss, Annie Hurd scored 16 points with 2 threes, Violet Silvia acced 11 points and 3 treys, and Gyselle Mairs finished with 10 points and 2 threes. Portsmouth slips to 5-2 on the season.\n\nThe Skippers wasted little time in dispatching the Rams in his Division I clash, racing out to a 24-3 advantage and playing a solid defensive game to cruise to victory. Brooke Faunce led the way with a game-high 16 points and Mya Macchioni added 8 more as North Kingstown pushed its record to 6-3 with its second win over La Salle (2-8) this season.\n\nFor the Rams, Maya Fernandes led the team with 6 points as La Salle gears up to face Portsmouth later this week.\n\nWesterly continues to prove it’s one of the state’s best programs.\n\nThe Bulldogs handled Pawtucket comfortably in a 65-23 victory on Tuesday night at home. Westerly assisted on 24 of its 27 field goals with Macy Antoch’s 14 points pacing the group. The freshman also supplied four rebounds and four steals in a standout night in the Division I matchup.\n\nDanica Jarrett was right behind her teammate with 13 points, five rebounds and a trio of steals. Cece Saint rounded out Westerly’s scorers in double figures with 10 points. But the standout performers don’t end there. Santanaa Hamelin supplied seven assists and seven steals as the freshman was all over the court.\n\nThe young, and talented, Bulldogs are now 9-1 overall on the year and host Chariho on Thursday.\n\nEast Providence girls basketball rebounded in a big way Tuesday night.\n\nThe Division II Townies managed a season-high 57 points in their 57-43 victory against Division I’s West Warwick. The win comes on the heels of EP losing to Rogers last Friday.\n\nZarae Hall got East Providence started hot with 14 points in the first half and finished off the Wizards with 24 in the game. The junior made 10 shots from the field, including a trio of 3-pointers to push EP to its fifth win of the season.\n\nTrinity Provencher added a dozen points, including eight in the fourth quarter to close out the hosts. Audrey Bernard supplied another dozen points as EP’s offense was firing on all cylinders. East Providence travels to Tiverton on Friday.\n\nWest Warwick was led by Brea Lima’s 18 points and Alexa Foley’s 14.The Wizards meet St. Raphael on Thursday in Pawtucket.\n\nThe Vikings believe in the old adage that you only get one chance to make a first impression. So opening the game with a 17-point first quarter, and then adding 18 in the second was pretty indicative of how this Division II contest would play out.\n\nRogers started hot and stayed that way. They were paced by the dynamic duo of Zaida Aponte – 21 points, including four 3's – and Tameka Robertson – 14 first half points. The result was a 35-17 lead by the break and an easier second half.\n\nFor the Mariners, Taylor Sullivan and Delaney Bonneau each scored 11 points, with Sullivan making a pair of 3-pointers and Bonneau going 6-fo-6 at the foul line.\n\nRogers moves to 4-2 and will have a stiff test coming later this week when it faces first-place Coventry (8-1).\n\nFreshman Eveisha Santana had a night to remember as she poured in 26 points, 6 from beyond the arc, pulled down 8 rebounds and had 5 steals and 4 assists to lead the Knights to a win over the Villa Novans. Also factoring in the win was Keeana Palmer who had 8 points, 5 boards, 3 steals and 4 assists. Central improved to 7-1 on the season.\n\nSkyla Caro topped Woonsocket in scoring with 11 points and teammate Akira Moise added 8 points in the loss.\n\nLincoln School 53, Mt. Hope, 29\n\nThe Cavaliers made it two in a row on back to back nights, matching last season's win total (three) in the young season. Juanita Sanchez was up 39-21 at the break and was never threatened in the second half\n\nThe Cavs were led by Geston Richardson with 25 points and Corey McClain, who added 17. Amaree Gomes and Allen Ortiz also scored in double figures in the win. The Patriots were led by James Nute (11 points) and Josh Morales (10).\n\nSmithfield 47, North Kingstown 40\n\n200 medley relay: Westerly - Enzo Gynther, Brady Casady, Sam Lorello, Colby Champlin, 1:57.38; 200 free: Westerly - Cooper Palumbo, 2:09.88; 200 IM: NP/S/NS - Mason Smith, 2:28.65; 50 free: Westerly - Champlin, 2:14.91; 100 fly: NP/S/NS - Sean Mania, 57:07; 100 free: Westerly - Lorello, 1:00.50; 500 free: NP/S/NS - Mason Smith, 5:52.82; 200 free relay: Westerly - Juan Aquino, Josue Aquino, Casady, Champlin, 1:56.85; 100 back: Westerly - Gynther, 1:07.82; 100 breast: NP/S/NS - Mania, 1:12:28; 400 free relay: NP/S/NS - Mania, Connor Farrell, Joshua Mesick, Smith, 4:00.43\n\n200 medley relay: NP/S/NS - Patty Oussi, Alexa Cortes, Emily Pace, Lauren Riley, 2:11.33; 200 free: Westerly - Avery Lamb, 2:20:38; 200 IM: NP/S/NS, Alexa Cortes, 2:26.37; 50 free: Westerly, Sonja Beasley, 26:20; 100 fly: NP/S/NS, Oussi, 1:09.45; 100 free: Westerly, Beasley, 58:08; 500 free: Westerly, Olivia ONeil, 6:07:11; 200 free relay:  Alexia McCabe, Peyton Pietraszka, O’Neil and Beasley, 1:52:50; 100 back: NP/S/NS, Oussi, 1:10.93; 100 breast: NP/S/NS, Cortes, 1:15.65; 400 free relay: Westerly - O’Neil, Lamb, McCabe and Beasley, 4:12:03.\n\nHannah Hochman had two wins in two individual events (100 Free, 100 breaststroke) and she also participated in the winning 200 Medley Relay, and teammate Samantha Lin also had two individual victories (200 IM, 100 butterfly) and she also swam a leg on the winning 200 Medley Relay helping the Titans edge the Patriots.\n\nFor Pilgrim, Juliana Kavanaugh also captured two individual events (200 free, 100 backstroke) she swam a leg for the winning 400 freestyle relay.\n\nClassical vs. Hendricken at Al Morro Athletic Complex, 6 p.m.\n\nChariho at Narragansett, 6 p.m.\n\nAchievement First (PVD) vs. Hope at 85 Garfield Ave. Cranston, RI, 6:30 p.m.\n\nJohnston at Burrillville, 6:30 p.m.\n\nMt.

    "fullText": "Jets predicted to trade for $212 million QB in lieu of Dante Moore originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAssuming that Fernando Mendoza is the No. 1 overall NFL Draft pick by the Las Vegas Raiders, the New York Jets will have to cross their fingers.\n\nDante Moore isn't a lock to come out of Oregon and enter the draft. He'd be the only clear QB2 in a class that isn't as strong as once thought.\n\nIf Moore stays in school, the Jets may have to pursue a different route at the quarterback position.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine suggests an outside the box option: Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nTagovailoa has multiple years remaining on what was originally a $212 million contract with the Miami Dolphins. It'd be a fascinating intra-division trade.\n\nBecause it'd be a salary dump, the Jets in this projected trade actually also receive a second-round pick and cash while only giving up a fifth-round pick.\n\n\"For all of Tua Tagovailoa's faults, he is 44-32 as a starter,\" Ballentine writes. \"Tagovailoa said he would be open to a fresh start after a season in which he ended on the bench. The only problem is that he's only one year into his four-year extension. The Jets are uniquely positioned to help the Dolphins out. They have $93.7 million in cap space, which is plenty to take on a significant portion of Tagovailoa's contract before cutting it in 2027 with little additional cost. That would help the Jets win now while adding to their draft pick stockpile and showing some creativity in navigating their rebuild under Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey.\"\n\nMIKE TOMLIN NEWS: What it means for Rodgers | TV future | Tomlin trade potential | Cignetti?\n\nIt would certainly be fascinating to see the Jets' leadership group put their futures in the hands of Tagovailoa.\n\nIt's hard to know if Tua could be good enough without a talented receiving corps, but maybe he needs the change of scenery more than anything else.\n\nThe narratives would be great if this happened, for sure.\n\nPatriots, Drake Maye silence doubters with callback to Brady, Belichick\n\nA.J.

    "fullText": "Stephen A. Smith made quite the awkward on-air blunder while discussing the Houston Texans’ 30-6 playoff win Monday over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWhile recapping the matchup on ESPN’s “First Take” on Tuesday, the sports commentator misidentified the Texans’ star wide receiver, Christian Kirk, as the late right-wing political commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nPolitics: Democrat Mary Peltola Launches Senate Bid In Alaska\n\n“We saw Charlie Kirk catch eight receptions for 144 yards,” Smith said before co-host Shae Peppler Cornette interjected to remind him: “Christian Kirk.”\n\nSmith quickly corrected himself. “I’m sorry, I apologize. Oh, my God, Christian Kirk.”\n\nThe verbal slip, which was shared on X by the sports media account Awful Announcing, has already racked up more than 11 million views.\n\nChristian Kirk and his team will play the New England Patriots on Sunday in an NFL divisional round playoff game. It appears that he has not publicly commented on the slip-up.\n\nCharlie Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing nonprofit Turning Point USA, built a massive social media following by holding debates on contentious cultural issues, where he often made incendiary, racist or sexist remarks. He was shot and killed while speaking with students at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, 2025.\n\nAfter the killing, Smith condemned anyone celebrating Kirk’s death on his SiriusXM radio show.\n\nPolitics: Charlie Kirk Brought Hard-Right Politics To A New Generation\n\n“I don’t care what his political beliefs were. I don’t care what he felt. I care about the fact that a man was gunned down in front of two of his children, who are 5 years of age or less,” he said during the Sep. 11 episode.\n\nHe also praised the New York Yankees for honoring Kirk with a moment of silence ahead of a game against the Detroit Tigers.\n\n“Props to the New York Yankees organization last night for having a moment of silence,” Smith said. “We’re not supposed to condone stuff like this. We’re not supposed to say it’s OK.

Duarte (@michaeljduarte) January 12, 2026\n\nCharly Hill, who graduated from Miami in 2024 and has interned and freelanced at Bleacher Report, TNT Sports and NBC, joined as a sports content creator.\n\nI’m not typically active on Twitter, but that’s all about to change with my new role at the California Post as a Sports Content Creator\n\nSo excited to be a part of what’s shaping up to be an incredible year for California sports! pic.twitter.com/EOieGODH0b\n\n— charly d (@charlydyannhill) January 8, 2026\n\nBolch, who has covered UCLA athletics for the Los Angeles Times for more than a decade and spent 26 years at the paper overall, becomes the latest high-profile addition for the California Post, which has aggressively targeted established Southern California journalists to anchor its coverage.\n\nHis move follows the recent exits of former Los Angeles Times sports columnist Dylan Hernandez and Dodgers beat writer Jack Harris, who  announced last month they were joining the California Post.\n\nWith Bolch’s departure, the Los Angeles Times is now left with just nine full-time sports staff writers, a stark contraction for a paper that once boasted one of the deepest sports departments in the country.\n\nOutside of the editors, the Los Angeles Times sports staff is currently led by columnist Bill Plaschke, senior writers Bill Shaikin and Kevin Baxter, Thuc Nhi Nguyen and Broderick Turner on the Lakers, Ryan Kartje on USC, Gary Klein on the Rams, Sam Farmer on the Chargers and Eric Sondheimer on high schools.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times was slated to have the second-largest contingent of sports staffers covering the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo behind NBC, which is the broadcast home of the Olympics, before the pandemic. The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",

    "fullText": "Zurich-based firm taps into latest robot tech to ‘fibre-spray’ high-end sports shoes worn by the likes of Roger Federer\n\nA robot leg whirs around in a complex ballet as an almost invisible spray of “flying fibre” builds a hi-tech £300 sports shoe at its foot.\n\nThis nearly entirely automated process – like a sci-fi future brought to life – is part of the gameplan from On, the Swiss sports brand that is taking on the sector’s mighty champions Nike and Adidas with a mix of technology and chutzpah.\n\nThe brand is expanding rapidly after teaming up with the former tennis pro Roger Federer to create shoes suitable for the Swiss star’s sport and a mix of fashion-led collaborations including with the luxury brand LOEWE, actor Zendaya and singers FKA twigs and Burna Boy. In China, sales have doubled year-on-year. Growth has been strong in the US and mainland Europe and this month On will open its fourth London store, in Kensington.\n\n“We’re an innovation brand at heart,” says its co-founder, David Allemann, “because we are really going for the long run.”\n\nHe’s speaking from On’s Zurich head office, which has the vibe of a tech firm or luxe gym with light-filled spaces and quirky design features from the spiral staircase and workout room to a hanging fossilised tree.\n\nAllemann says the company’s inspirations are disruptors such as Apple and Dyson. These two brands were on the “mood board” when On was set up as they combine “unique design” with “innovation in terms of user-experience or technology”.\n\nAllemann, a former McKinsey consultant, ditched his job in 2010 as marketing boss of the furniture brand Vitra to start On with a former McKinsey colleague, Caspar Coppetti, and the Swiss Ironman world champion and triathlete Olivier Bernhard.\n\nBernhard’s idea was for a shoe that would protect his body from the impact of long-distance running but also promote speed. The original prototype, developed by Bernhard, an inventive individual as well as a committed sportsman, started out with sections of hose-pipe glued to the bottom of an old pair of trainers.\n\nThe three friends, all keen runners, tried out early versions together and put about £600,000 of their life savings into launching the company. They ordered 1,200 pairs of shoes, which they sold at running meets before convincing some specialist retailers to place orders.\n\nIn 2021, the trio floated the brand on the New York Stock Exchange at a value of $8bn (£5.95bn) , raising almost $750m for the business and netting them about $120m in cash while keeping a large stake in the business. This year they expect to sell 30m pairs. The brand is now worth $16bn.\n\nAfter their innovative design took off, On developed the LightSpray flying fibre technology after a team member met a young student, Johannes Voelchert, at a design fair in 2019. The company decided to fund him for a year to develop his vision, which was inspired by a glue gun used to make Halloween spider-web decorations.\n\n“We said: hey, he’s crazy, but we like that because Olivier was crazy as well,” says Allemann.\n\nVoelchert is now part of a team of hundreds of research and technology experts, from more than 90 countries and numerous industry backgrounds, helping to develop new ideas for On in Zurich with a particular eye on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\n“We call that the explorer spirit,” says Allemann.\n\nThe idea is to foster innovation and creativity so that, even as a bigger company employing 4,000 people around the world, the whole business, from designers to manufacturers, can take risks on ideas without necessarily knowing the final outcome. “We’re still able to set sail without exactly knowing where we’re arriving without calling home the next day,” Allemann says.\n\nAllemann adds that On is now seeing the benefit of “many little sprouts that now are growing up”, from its move into different sports – such as outdoor training and tennis – to its development of apparel and the opening of retail stores.\n\nThe small brand may control just 1% of the $450bn global sportswear market, according to GlobalData, but it is expanding rapidly.\n\nOn plays in the premium market with its shoes starting from about £120, excluding seasonal promotions, up to £495. That compares with Nike, which runs from £60 to £290, and Adidas, from £40 to £450.\n\nDespite high-end purchases coming under pressure from cost of living increases, sales for the brand are on track to increase by just over a third to hit nearly 3bn Swiss Francs (£2.8bn) this year. On says it has grabbed as much as a fifth of the running shoe market in the UK and other European countries.\n\nIt faces some heavyweight competition. On is just one-tenth the size of Nike, which holds about 14% of the global sportswear market, according to industry analysts GlobalData, with Adidas on 9%. However, both have faced difficulties in recent years, creating space for new challenges including On, Hoka and revitalised old brands such as New Balance or Onitsuka Tiger, now owned by ASICS.\n\nThe company also faced a class action lawsuit last year in the US, where customers claimed its shoes make a “noisy and embarrassing squeak”. Its “CloudTec” trainers, designed with holes to feel like “running on clouds” – were criticised on social media over the noise. On said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.\n\nOn’s Cloudboom Strike LS laceless shoe, which is made by just nine robots in Zurich and costs £310, has already won the attention of running enthusiasts after the Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri won this year’s New York and last year’s Boston marathon. She also took a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in a pair.\n\nIn Zurich, the robots in their lab-like room are still outnumbered by humans, who monitor their work and complete the final process. Most of the brand’s footwear is made in traditional factories in Asia. But this year On is aiming to open its first robot-led factory to create a more accessible version of the shoe, the upper half of which is made from a single nearly one mile-long filament of thermoplastic polyurethane in just three minutes. Traditionally, a shoe takes several humans hours of work.\n\nThe factory’s location has not yet been decided, but will be close to one of its main retail markets, with the long-term aim of producing on every continent. That would be a dramatic change from today’s industry, which is largely based in Asia, particularly Vietnam and China.\n\nAllemann says local manufacturing is attractive as it has “a huge advantage from a sustainability point of view, because you don’t have to ship shoes around the world, but also from an agility to market point of view – you can produce much faster, according to what people want”.\n\nHe says LightSpray shoes have a 75% lower CO2 footprint than an ordinary sports shoe, which plays to On’s aim to create more sustainable and recyclable kit.\n\nRetail expansion is also a big part of the story. The latest London opening will make the UK capital its biggest retail centre, with plans for as many as seven in future. It is now part of a global portfolio of 60 outlets, with plans for up to 25 more a year despite the rise of online selling.\n\n“We feel there’s still a lot of potential in retail, if done right. City centres are still a very important place for society, and shopping and sports are an important ingredient to that.”\n\nWith those in their late teens, 20s and 30s keen on sport, particularly training and running, Allemann says the shops “are not just stores but also community hubs where running clubs start”.\n\nHe believes On will continue to expand because participating in sport brings people together in a way the online world cannot.\n\n“Running and sports, that’s such an important part of your life that we see consumers are willing to invest in great performance, innovation and better feel, but also in great design and what that tells us about them.”",

    "description": "You can bet on anything from sports to Labubus now, but prediction markets are also a valuable tool for investors, Danny Moses told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "You can bet on pretty much anything these days. From sports to the weather to the price of a Labubu, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi have offered people a new way to gamble.\n\nAccording to Danny Moses, one of the investors from \"The Big Short,\" they've also offered investors a useful tool to help navigate markets.\n\nMoses, who was among the investors betting against the US housing market ahead of the 2008 crash, isn't surprised by the prediction-market boom, and he thinks investors need to be watching these markets closely to stay on top of their game.\n\n\"I think it's great to scan through all the prediction markets out there, certainly economics and business-related, because it actually will get you thinking about things you might have been missing,\" he told Business Insider in an interview before the new year.\n\nMoses isn't too focused on short opportunities these days, despite being famous for his role in Michael Lewis's now-iconic saga of the housing crash. But he thinks that prediction markets can serve to provide valuable info for bullish and bearish investors alike.\n\nHe pointed to the recent example of popular fintech stock SoFi Technologies being listed as having a 38% chance of being added to the benchmark index in 2026, something that could be a likely catalyst for the stock, which is up 93% in the last year.\n\n\"If you're short SoFi and you weren't thinking about the possibility of it being added to the S&P 500, like we just saw happen to Carvana recently, that's something you need to be aware of,\" Moses said.\n\nThat's not the only way prediction markets could help investors make smarter decisions. Moses said he thinks there may be circumstances where they can offer a more appealing risk-reward than investors might get from traditional derivatives. He cited crypto as an example.\n\n\"Will bitcoin trade below $70,000 in the first quarter of 2026?\" he mused. \"Well, if I own bitcoin, and it's a much cheaper way to bet, if it's an eight cent possibility, so call it twelve to one, I might be getting a better market, or I might want to buy that rather than buying a put option on crypto.\"\n\nIn his view, it's early days for prediction markets. Their usefulness will grow as a predictive tool for hedging traditional investments as well as gauging the likelihood of market-moving events. And as they grow, expect more prominent players to participate, he said.\n\n\"I think institutions are going to start using prediction markets more, and as institutions use it, you're going to see a lot more activity,\" he said.",

    "description": "What a night in Chicago: the Bears won their first playoff game in 15 years and the Cubs made their biggest free-agent splash in a decade.",
    "fullText": "Simply, it was the greatest sports evening in Chicago since 2016.\n\nWhile the Chicago Bears were making arguably the greatest comeback in franchise history against the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night in the playoffs, the Chicago Cubs were making their biggest free-agent splash in a decade with a five-year, $175 million agreement with infielder Alex Bregman.\n\n“Big night for Chicago,’’ Scott Boras, Bregman’s agent, said in a text to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nSo, while the Bears were coming back from a 21-3 halftime deficit to win 31-27, Boras and the Cubs were actually in the middle of negotiations?\n\n“Bears game?’’ Boras texted USA TODAY Sports. “I was packing the green in for Breggy with the Cubs.’’\n\nThe Cubs, who tried to sign Bregman a year ago to a four-year, $115 million deal, got their man and stole him away from the Boston Red Sox with the richest salary in Cubs’ history.\n\nAnd after listening to critics all winter, saying that they haven’t made enough moves or spent enough money to make themselves World Series contenders − or at least better than the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central − they shelled out the big cash after acquiring Miami Marlins starter Edward Cabrera just three days ago.\n\nJust like that, the Cubs have got folks in Chicago believing it could be 2016 all over again, the year they won their first World Series since 1908.\n\nCertainly, Bregman, 31, is a huge winner. He opted out of the $80 million owed to him the next two years by the Boston Red Sox, and spun it into a franchise-record $35-million-a-year deal with a full no-trade clause and no opt-outs. The only Cubs’ contracts bigger in total value is Jason Heyward’s eight-year, $184 million contract and shortstop Dansby Swanson’s seven-year, $177 million contract.\n\nBregman, who turns 32 in March, will now earn $215 million over six years.\n\nJust like that, the Cubs could be a giant in the NL. They now have a wealth of depth in their infield in which they could either slide Matt Shaw to second base and trade Nico Hoerner or make Shaw a super utility player and keep Hoerner for one more year before he hits free agency.\n\nNo matter, the Cubs feel as if they’re set, and love Bregman’s leadership skills, as he has been in the playoffs every full year of his 10-year career.\n\nThis is why the Red Sox badly wanted to bring him back and were runner-up in the negotiations. The Arizona Diamondbacks also had interest in Bregman, but once they decided to retain All-Star second baseman Ketel Marte, they dropped out of the Bregman sweepstakes, leaving the Cubs and Red Sox as the two finalists.\n\nBregman, who hit .273 with an .821 OPS with 18 homers and 28 doubles last season, is the biggest free agent to sign this winter. Considering he’s two years older than Cody Bellinger, it perhaps illustrates why Bellinger has not accepted the Yankees’ five-year offer in excess of $150 million.\n\nBregman’s signing now leaves the Red Sox badly needing Bo Bichette, who also is being courted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays. Bichette has a zoom call meeting Monday with the Phillies.\n\nThe Cubs couldn’t care less what happens next. They believe they’re set now. They’re convinced they can win their first NL Central title in a full season since 2017.\n\nAnd, hey, with the Cubs’ convention scheduled this upcoming weekend, they not only plan to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of their World Series, but believe it could be a prelude to an October to remember in 2026.\n\nWhat a night in Chicago, with the Bears winning at Solider Fielder and the Cubs celebrating in their offices at Wrigley Field.\n\nWho would have imagined a brutally cold, blustery evening in Chicago could feel so beautiful?\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Alex Bregman signing with Cubs and Bears win make great Chicago night",

    "description": "Former New York Times writer Harvey Araton's novel reveals a raucous life of a youth athlete, and lessons we can all learn from it.",
    "fullText": "It’s a statement but also a question we can ask ourselves as sports parents.\n\nIt’s driven into our kids very early, often by us.\n\nOr is it to just enjoy the experience?\n\n“Dad, according to Mom, asked the parents in our group not to worry about how good we were, or weren’t,” writes author Harvey Araton, through the eyes of a kid named “Z,” in a new middle-grade novel.\n\nZ’s dad was the coach of the boy’s first soccer team. It’s a neighborhood collection of grade school buddies. Dad didn’t just roll out the ball, though. He orchestrated drills that mimicked game situations that gave everyone a shot at the action.\n\n“You scrimmage too much, and the same kids, the stronger players, will dominate the ball, and then how do the other kids get better?” Z overhears his dad telling his mom early in the book.\n\nEveryone notices, in fiction and reality, when others don’t have this growth mentality.\n\nZ and his teammates hear opposing parents scream for blood, or at least a foul, when his team, once a doormat, incrementally starts to get better and begins to dominate.\n\nThe kids of manic youth sports parents, one of whom Araton admits to once being himself, is whom he wants to reach. The veteran sportswriter, most recently with The New York Times for 25 years, covered the Danny Almonte age scandal at the 2001 Little League World Series, and the ensuing escalation of Little League World Series coverage into American living rooms.\n\nHe has pondered or written about (or both) kids choosing between club and high school soccer and early sports specialization.\n\nHe also played the role of sports dad to two now-grown sons (36 and 32).\n\n“Kids learn playing sports,” Araton tells USA TODAY Sports. “I think there's a joy in that. I just feel, especially at these early years, it's becoming infected with this ambition that there could be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and I think too many parents become obsessed with turning their children into potential cash machines.”\n\nAraton launched the book last week with a signing at his local bookstore in Montclair, New Jersey. He made sure to also include a panel discussion about youth sports. He spoke with us about how his novel imitates the raucous life America lives within it, and the lessons he has gleaned from it.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nAraton is from Staten Island, which he describes as New York City’s last developed borough. It still has large swaths of parks and fields, where his story is set.\n\nHe had grown up on the basketball courts near his public housing development. The free play felt natural as it took him to the local Jewish community center and high school. He eventually played at a health club in Brooklyn as an adult and even worked in Madison Square Garden, where he covered the Knicks, the team he had idolized as a kid.\n\nHis competitive juices carried him into fatherhood when his older son, Alex, was in first grade and had the option of going out for a travel team. It’s a decision many of us have faced.\n\n“I remember asking him if he wanted to try out,” Araton says. “And he was kind of a naturally cautious kid and said, ‘Not really,’ and I remember being disappointed, a little deflated. Maybe I already was thinking, ‘If he doesn't go into this next level, he'll fall behind and never catch up, (and) there will go any chance of playing in high school.’ I mean, I could look at my kids, look at their size even at that age and know that they weren't likely to be D1 college athletes.\n\n“But I remember being disappointed and over the next couple of weeks, I came up with five or six different ways to pose the same question. Well, Nick's trying out, you sure you don't want (to)? And he kept saying no. And then the last time that I asked, he said, ‘No, dad.’ And then he looked at me and said, ‘But if I don't play travel, can I still play in the town league?’\n\n“And I remember feeling this sensation of shame because I realized in that moment that I was projecting my own ambitions and my own sports values onto this 6-year-old kid. And all he wanted to do at that point in his life was just run around and play with a bunch of kids he knew and maybe take one or two things out of any game and feel good about himself and look forward to the snacks.”\n\nThe book’s central character, who tells the story in the first person, is a combination of Araton’s two sons. Charly, Alex’s younger brother, was 4-foot-11 when he entered high school but played on the basketball team for four years.\n\nZ is left-footed with really good field vision like Alex and he’s small and feisty like Charly was. It doesn’t seem to bother Z when his young team is losing because he knows he will celebrate the things they all did well, or at least enjoyed, at Big Mitch’s restaurant afterward.\n\nBig Mitch is the father of his friend and teammate, Lloyd.\n\n“You only let in, like, seven or eight goals on an undefeated travel team,” he tells Lloyd, the team’s goalie, in the book. “Do you think a kid who was out of shape could do that?”\n\nZ becomes less comfortable when sports becomes more and more competitive. His father has a horrific accident and the team eventually gets a coach from England, who adopts a similar skills-first mindset with the kids. Kevin, the coach, who has also had a traumatic experience with his father, takes Z under his wing.\n\nAs the boys and girls on the team continue to rise in competition level, and travel further and further away from Staten Island, Z gets a much more transactional coach.\n\nHe feels himself immersed in a world over which he has less and less control, similar to the experiences Araton observed and felt as a soccer dad.\n\n“The reason why I chose soccer is because I probably was most closely involved with that, whether it was as coaching them in the early grades or just being at the games and kind of like, living for it a little bit,” he says. “I understand why parents are so heavily involved. After a week of work you really look forward to the experience of the games. It's like an adrenaline rush but also I think, it created a whole social network with the parents of their teammates and friends and everything. So I get the temptation, and the seductiveness, of it all, but (it) all got completely out of control, as well.”\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nWhile Araton was growing up on Staten Island, the borough’s Mid-Island Little League won it all in Williamsport. Years later, as a sportswriter, Araton caught up with Danny Yaccarino, who came within one strike of a perfect game during that 1964 Little League World Series against Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nHe wrote a column, (‘After Perfection at the Age of 12, What's Next?’) detailing how Yaccarino became a very good high school pitcher and reached the Baltimore Orioles organization and yet, he was always haunted by the feeling of coming so close to near-perfection as a Little Leaguer and not getting it.\n\n“Not only did he get a lot of bench jockeying and all that stuff throughout his career, but he also put incredible pressure on himself,” Araton says. “He turned out to be a minor league pitcher and he never went very far. But he told me that he finished his career feeling like an abject failure.”\n\nZ feels an emptiness, too, at the climax of the book. It's a feeling that can be induced by us.\n\n\"Parents, being vulnerable, and easily manipulated into spending vast sums of money, (wind) up treating their children like they are speculating on a stock, an investment,\" Araton says. \"They're not stocks that will pay off at 8 or 9 or 10 years; they're developing human beings.\"\n\n“Z, we’re running behind,” his mother yells upstairs, trying to get him moving for his U-13 fall season-opening game. She’s now the team’s driven parent-manager.\n\n“The construction of this story is really about Z coming to an understanding of what role sports should play in his life,” Araton says. “And when I say that, I mean, at that particular time, kids are always subject to change. He's at a point in his life where he's experienced family trauma, and, when he looks around, he doesn't see the friends who he loves, the kids that he grew up playing with. He sees a lot of strange kids. And that's not what he wants. More than playing at an elite level, he wants to play with kids who know him, who know what he's gone through.\n\n“He realizes that he still loves the game, but will only play it under his terms.”\n\nIsn’t that what we all want? What about our kids, too?\n\n“You could offer them the higher-level stuff,” Araton says, “but if it's being forced upon them, and if you're calling up to their bedroom every time there's practice, then it's clear that they don't really want to do it.\n\n“I wouldn't deny an exceptional child that kind of pathway any more than you would, say, if you had a child who (was) a mathematical genius or a classical violinist, you would want them to have the best teachers to best capitalize on their special talent. But the temptation is so great because sports is the most visible thing in the community. …\n\n\"It'll become pretty obvious to a parent if they have someone special. But this whole notion that they can create one by spending significant sums of money, I think it's really overstated.”\n\nAraton points to another interview he did, with Yael Averbuch, the general manager of the New Jersey/New York Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She played for an exclusive club team in high school, won two national championships playing for the University of North Carolina and was drafted professionally.\n\nHer mother said she never had to yell upstairs for practice. Yael was the one yelling to them.\n\nAraton’s sons, like Z, had to figure out where sports fit into their lives. It worked out for them, too.\n\nAlex, who played high school soccer, is a special education teacher and Charly, the high school basketball player (who has grown to about 5-foot-9 today), works in marketing strategies for a fashion brand. He still plays in men’s leagues.\n\nAraton says those middle-grade age groups – 8 to 12, give or take – are the ages where people know the least amount about who their children are as athletes.\n\n“Don’t be disappointed if at the age of 8, they are not willing to do all this stuff and make all that sacrifice,” he says. “They might be ready when they're 11. Kids do things on their own time schedules. So just accept who they are and let them experience sports in the way they want to. They’ll enjoy it more and get more out of it.\n\n“If they're not playing for the idea of feeling good about themselves, about learning to be a coachable kid, and be a good teammate, to play with kids from all different backgrounds and develop their skills at the fundamental level at the age of 7, 8, 9, 10,” Araton says, “then they're playing for the wrong reasons.\n\n“Each shall develop at their own rate. I just think that parents have to chill and let the kids experience it for themselves.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "fullText": "A transfer portal spiraling out of control prompted the new regulatory body for college sports to issue a memo to athletic directors Friday night saying it has “serious concerns” about some of the multimillion-dollar contracts being offered to players.\n\nThe “reminder” from the College Sports Commission came out about an hour before kickoff of the semifinal between Indiana and Oregon in a College Football Playoff that has shared headlines with news of players signing seven-figure deals to move or, in some cases, stay where they are.\n\nThe CSC reminded the ADs that, according to the rules, third-party deals to use players' name, image and likeness “are evaluated at the time of entry in NIL Go, not before, and each deal is evaluated on its own merits.”\n\n\"Without prejudging any particular deal, the CSC has serious concerns about some of the deal terms being contemplated and the consequences of those deals for the parties involved,\" the memo said.\n\nUnder terms of the House settlement that dictated the rules for NIL payments, schools can share revenue with their players directly from a pool of $20.5 million. Third-party deals, often arranged by businesses created to back the schools, are being used as workarounds this so-called salary cap.\n\nThe CSC, through its NIL Go portal, is supposed to evaluate those deals to make sure they are for a valid business purpose and fall within a fair range of compensation for the services being provided.\n\nThe CSC did not list examples of unapproved contracts, but college football has seen its share of seven-figure deals luring players to new schools since the transfer portal opened on Jan. 2.\n\nOne high-profile case involved Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who initially sought to enter the transfer portal and turn his back on a reported deal worth $4 million with the Huskies. Legal threats ensued and Williams changed course and stayed at Washington.\n\n\"Making promises of third-party NIL money now and figuring out how to honor those promises later leaves student-athletes vulnerable to deals not being cleared, promises not being able to be kept, and eligibility being placed at risk,\" the CSC letter said.\n\nThe commission listed two rules about contracts it evaluates, some of which have been termed “agency agreement” or “services agreement” in what look like attempts to bypass the rules.\n\n—\"The label on the contract does not change the analysis; if an entity is agreeing to pay a student-athlete for their NIL, the agreement must be reported to NIL Go within the reporting deadline.\"\n\n—\"An NIL agreement or payment with an associated entity or individual ... must include direct activation of the student-athlete’s NIL rights.\" This is a reference to the practice of “warehousing” NIL rights by paying first, then deciding how to use them later.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

He heavily considered BYU before his mission but ultimately committed to the Trojans. Listed at 6-foot-4 and 245 pounds, Walker was USC’s fifth leading receiver. He finished the season with 20 receptions, 223 receiving yards, and 2 TDs. He had 4 catches for 39 yards at Illinois and 2 catches for 42 yards versus Michigan.\n\nBYU must replace starting tight end Carsen Ryan and Lyons will likely fill that role. He is a big body who has good receiving skills and should see his production see a big uptick now that he has a clear path to be tight end #1. Aaron Roderick has proven that he will use skilled tight ends. Carsen Ryan was BYU’s third leading receiver this season, finishing with 45 receptions, 620 yards, and 3 TDs. Lyons has the same ability to make a similar impact.\n\nLyons will be a junior this upcoming season and should make a big impact both of his seasons in Provo.\n\nYou can watch some highlights below.\n\nI see you Walker Lyons!\n\nInitial contact at the 15-yard line.

Main Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.\n\nMain Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals. It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.\n\n“No matter what what happens, whether it’s Main Street, a third party or MLB media, fans are going to have the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday.\n\nMLB took over broadcasts for San Diego in May 2023 after Diamond Sports Group missed a payment to the Padres and added Arizona that July.\n\nColorado joined MLB's distribution in 2024, and Cleveland and Minnesota in 2025. Seattle is being added this season and possibly Washington, which is leaving the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\n\nDiamond was renamed Main Street Sports Group as it emerged out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year and its networks were rebranded as FanDuel.\n\n“Our focus, particularly given the point in the calendar, is to maximize the revenue that’s available to the clubs, whether that’s MLB Media or third party,” Manfred said. “The clubs have control over the timing. They can make a decision to move to MLB Media because of the contractual status now. I think that what's happening right now clubs are evaluating their alternatives. Obviously they’ve made significant payroll commitments already and they’re evaluating the alternatives to find the best revenue source for the year and the best outlet in terms of providing quality broadcasts to their fans.”\n\nManfred said local media provides more than 20% of industry revenue.\n\nMLB and the players' association for 2024 allowed discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue had declined since 2022 or 2023, but they did not reach a similar agreement for 2025.\n\n“We are not providing financial assistance right now,” Manfred said.\n\nHe spoke at a news conference to announce an initiative with Foster Love that envisions 250,000 volunteer hours to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States. At the news conference, MLB staff assembled duffel bags with goods for foster care children.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO — Sports Illustrated will bring back one of Super Bowl weekend’s signature parties in 2026, announcing Wednesday that SI The Party Presented by DraftKings will take over San Francisco’s historic Cow Palace on Saturday, Feb. 7.\n\nProduced by Authentic Live and Medium Rare, the event has become a premier off-field destination where league owners, franchise executives, athletes, celebrities and fans converge for a high-energy, all-inclusive nightlife experience outside the game itself.\n\nThe 2026 edition will feature headline performances from The Chainsmokers, Ludacris, DJ Irie and rising DJ-producer Xandra, blending electronic, hip-hop and open-format DJ sets into a genre-spanning celebration.

    "fullText": "New details have emerged surrounding Demond Williams and his attempt to enter the transfer portal, shedding light on why Washington officials are refusing to process his request.\n\nAccording to Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports, Williams recently signed a one-year revenue-sharing agreement with the Huskies worth approximately $4 million. The agreement is a Big Ten–approved template used by all conference members and was specifically designed to address scenarios like this.\n\nThe contract evidently prohibits Williams from entering the transfer portal once signed, and restricts his NIL rights from being used by another school. He’s still allowed to pursue outside marketing deals per Dellenger.\n\nAs a result, Washington has declined to enter Williams’ name into the portal, which prevents him from holding conversations with other programs. Dellenger reported that Big Ten Conference commissioner Tony Petitti is heavily involved in the matter, along with other league officials.\n\nAdditionally, the conference is backing Washington’s firm stance. Coincidentally, Petitti is in Seattle this week for a memorial service while discussions continue.\n\nMoreover, Washington officials are expected to communicate later Tuesday with Williams’ representatives regarding next steps. The school also suspects Williams has already spoken with other programs and plans to submit any evidence of tampering to both the conference and the NCAA. LSU is believed to be the program most interested in Williams.\n\nLess than a week before announcing his intention to transfer, Williams signed the new deal at Washington, a development first reported by Pete Nakos of On3. Sources emphasized to Nakos that Williams remains under contract and that Washington expects him to be its starting quarterback in 2026 under head coach Jedd Fisch. The Huskies were also prepared to make Williams one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in college football.\n\nThe situation mirrors a similar case last year involving Wisconsin Badgers defender Xavier Lucas, who withdrew from Wisconsin and enrolled at Miami Hurricanes without entering the portal.\n\nWisconsin claimed Lucas was bound by a two-year NIL agreement and pursued legal action, with attorney Darren Heitner representing Lucas. That lawsuit remains ongoing, and Dellenger noted the language in Williams’ deal closely resembles the template used in the Wisconsin case.\n\nWilliams is coming off a standout sophomore season, throwing for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns while adding 611 rushing yards and six scores. In announcing his intent to transfer Tuesday night, Williams said the decision was made with his future in mind, though Washington appears prepared to enforce the contract he signed just days earlier.\n\n— On3’s Nick Schultz contributed to this article.",

Meanwhile, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, which launched at the beginning of December, is at No. 18, while Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora rides the wave from a new DLC expansion tying into the new Avatar film to land in the No. 14 position.\n\nOn the PlayStation 4 side, Red Dead Redemption 2 continues to dominate in both North America and the European Union, while Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 (which is currently available at a steep discount on the PSN store) surprises by shooting up in the No. 3 spot. In the States, four different Five Nights at Freddy's titles take up spots on the PS4 list.\n\nBeat Saber was the most-played PS VR2 game last month, though the game is discontinuing support and online multiplayer this month.

Store owner Jake Miller says the group stole rare sports trading cards and valuable Pokémon TCG cards after sawing through the front door.

    "description": "\"The jobs this cycle all lack QBs like normal so he's definitely the top QB and offense available for any coach,\" one NFC exec told Yahoo Sports. An AFC assistant added: \"Any scheme fits him.\"",
    "fullText": "When the Cleveland Browns and Las Vegas Raiders interview head coaches in the coming weeks, they know the most important question they must answer: How will we identify and develop a young quarterback?\n\nWhen the New York Giants and Tennessee Titans interview head coaches, they, too, know the crux: First-round quarterbacks Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward need molding and development. The quarterback hopeful for each club is in the house. But how will he grow?\n\nShakeup at the top of the Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals will similarly require answers on a position with major question marks in 2026 and beyond.\n\nThese answers need not all come via offensive head coaches during a hiring cycle riper with defensive candidates than offensive. And in many successful franchises, including the reigning Super Bowl champions, the head coach’s primary responsibility is not to call offensive plays.\n\nBut when teams front young quarterbacks or face questions at quarterback, the pressure to find the offensive panacea sharpens. Coaching searches often skew accordingly.\n\nSo the Baltimore Ravens hold a clear advantage.\n\nBecause as they announced Tuesday night that 18-year head coach John Harbaugh was “relieved of his duties,” the Ravens are the lone team currently looking for a head coach that is not simultaneously searching to clarify their answer at quarterback.\n\nRecruiting coaches while two-time MVP Lamar Jackson is under contract is a luxury.\n\nSure, plenty will argue that just as the Ravens become the most attractive of seven NFL openings and counting, Harbaugh immediately became the most attractive candidate when he hit the market. That doesn’t mean the decision should be baffling. With a Super Bowl-winning coach and an MVP-winning quarterback, it should not be surprising if each believes he has the answers to future success. And if those answers don’t align, a time comes for a change.\n\nBut as the Ravens look for a coach who will end their 13-year Super Bowl drought, they won’t need as strong an emphasis on developing a quarterback.\n\n[Get more Ravens news: Baltimore team feed]\n\nThat could allow them, should they want, to select the best overall candidate first. Their ceiling will immediately be high.\n\n“We have so much talent on this team, and it's just disappointing that we're not able to be the team that's able to execute and win games when we need to win games,” fullback Patrick Ricard said this week. “As long as we have Lamar Jackson, I feel like this team can win a Super Bowl.”\n\nA minority of coaches and executives across the league will argue that a coach in the Shanahan and McVay systems may prefer a more in-structure passer to build their offense around.\n\nBut more often, as the surprise of Harbaugh’s dismissal hit Tuesday, league voices understood the new pecking order of openings.\n\n“The jobs this cycle all lack QBs like normal so he’s definitely the top QB and offense available for any coach,” one NFC executive told Yahoo Sports.\n\nAn AFC assistant added of Jackson: “Any scheme fits him.”\n\nJackson has shown that in eight seasons since the Ravens selected him with the 32nd pick of the 2018 NFL Draft. He’s earned four Pro Bowl berths, three All-Pro honors and two MVP awards while winning 76 of 107 regular-season starts.\n\nIn aggregate, Jackson has completed 64.8% of his passes for 22,608 yards and 187 passing touchdowns to 56 interceptions. His 102.2 career passer rating and 8.25 air yards per attempt currently hold the all-time career records, per Pro Football Reference.\n\nAnd those numbers don’t even include Jackson’s additional 6,522 yards and 35 touchdowns rushing.\n\nHis health has been inconsistent at times, Jackson most recently missing four games and about half of another this season with hamstring and back injuries. But while healthy, he thrived. Consider his Week 18 return from a back injury in Pittsburgh with the AFC North title on the line. While the Ravens lost on a walk-off missed field-goal attempt Sunday night, Jackson completed 11 of 18 passes for 238 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe activated another level in the fourth quarter, with 50- and 64-yard go-ahead touchdown passes to receiver Zay Flowers. The first came despite two defenders seeming to have Jackson wrapped up. Jackson was unfazed.\n\nInsane sack escape and 50-yard TD from Lamar Jackson. \n\nRavens 17, Steelers 13.pic.twitter.com/mgwAU6YIQG\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) January 5, 2026\n\n“Shoot — I cut a nose guard loose, and he somehow slipped out of it and threw the ball [50] yards for a touchdown,” center Tyler Linderbaum said. “That's the kind of ability he has. So, he’s fun to play for. [He’s an] ultra competitor, and any time that ball is snapped to him, and it's in his hands, you know something electrifying can happen.”\n\n“The most electrifying player there is in this game.”\n\nAs reports of tension between Jackson and Harbaugh built this season, Jackson was asked last Thursday if he had a good relationship with Harbaugh.\n\n“Yes, I believe so,” he said. “I don’t know where the noise came from. I don’t know where the noise came from.”\n\nAfter the Ravens’ 26-24 loss Sunday, Jackson was asked about Harbaugh again.\n\nDid he want to see Harbaugh as his head coach next season?\n\n“You’re asking me about next year,” Jackson said. “I’m so caught up in what just happened tonight. I can't focus on that right now, I just told you. Like he asked me, ‘Are you stunned?’\n\n“I’m stunned right now, and I'm still trying to process what's going on. I know we lost, but what the ... you know?”\n\nSure, the emotions of the season’s sudden ending were fresh as Jackson’s Herculean fourth quarter wasn’t enough to advance to a sixth playoff berth in eight years. But Jackson was not the first player to receive a question about his coach’s future at season’s end. He would not have been the first to endorse a leader after a loss, especially one 18 years into his tenure with the organization with a Lombardi Trophy to his name and an AFC championship game berth in partnership with Jackson.\n\nHarbaugh issued his own statement, curiously including a smiley-face emoji as he said goodbye with “disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE & APPRECIATION.”\n\nIs John Harbaugh the first NFL coach to include a smiley face in his statement about being fired? pic.twitter.com/NhHouUIL0C\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) January 6, 2026\n\nThe Ravens' coaching search, as team owner Steve Bisciotti said in a statement, begins. Their ability to move quickly on top defensive candidates including the Los Angeles Chargers’ Jesse Minter, Los Angeles Rams’ Chris Shula and Houston Texans’ Matt Burke could prove to be an asset.\n\n“That’s a dream backfield to have Lamar and Derrick [Henry] and to play with those guys,” Ricard said. “I feel like, as long as they're here, this team has a shot — no matter who else is playing.”",
