    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn's Winter Olympic dream ended in screams of pain on Sunday after she crashed out of the women's downhill, failing in her audacious bid to medal in her favoured discipline at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nThe American star had been trying to claim the fourth Olympic medal of her career despite suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee just over a week ago, but her race ended after just 13 seconds in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nShe cried in anguish and pain after her awful fall high up the course, medical staff surrounding the distraught 41-year-old on the Olimpia delle Tofane piste where has enjoyed much success in the past.\n\nThe 2010 Olympic downhill champion hit the firm snow face first soon after pushing off from the gate.\n\nShe then rolled down the slope with her skis still attached, which could likely cause further serious damage to her knee.\n\nVonn's Olympic dream now lies in tatters after her brave effort to achieve the seemingly impossible, an attempt which ended with her being taken away in a helicopter as fans in the stands saluted her with loud applause.\n\nHer US teammate Breezy Johnson, sitting in the leader's chair, held her face in shock. At the time Vonn crashed, Johnson, the world downhill champion, was in front of Germany's Emma Aicher by just 0.04sec following her powerful run.\n\nJohan Eliasch, the president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) who was watching the race in Cortina, said Vonn's crash was \"tragic, but it's ski racing I'm afraid\".\n\n\"And I can only say thank you for what she has done for our sport because this race has been the talk of the Games and it's put our sport in the best possible light.\"\n\nEliasch added: \"I hope she will have a speedy recovery and back on skis very, very soon.\n\n\"A lot of people are going to say she shouldn't have been racing today (with) that type of injury. It's obviously her decision.\"\n\nOne of world sport's most recognisable faces and an alpine skiing icon, Vonn has insisted that she could not only compete but win against the world's best women skiers, some of whom like Aicher are nearly half her age.\n\nVonn said ahead of the Games that she was planning on also competing in the team combined event on Tuesday and the super-G two days later.\n\nBut that now looks unlikely, a potential long lay-off perhaps heralding the end of her comeback to skiing in her early 40s.\n\nVonn retired in 2019 but returned to compeition in November 2024 following surgery to partially replace her right knee to end persistent pain.\n\nHad she not crashed in the last World Cup downhill ahead of the Olympics, in Crans Montana at the end of January, Vonn would have been a serious contender for gold in Cortina.\n\nVonn had finished on the podium in every previous World Cup downhill race this season, including two victories in St. Moritz and Zauchensee, and claimed two more top-three finishes in the super-G.\n\nBut retirement looms for Vonn following a disastrous end to one of the biggest stories of the Winter Olympics.",

    "description": "World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses England's seven-try thrashing of Wales and the lessons coach Steve Borthwick can learn from France.",
    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses England's seven-try thrashing of Wales, Tommy Freeman's performance at centre and the lessons coach Steve Borthwick could learn from his France counterpart.\n\nThere was a time, maybe a couple of years ago, when the England shirt used to weigh heavy on the players.\n\nThe pressure seemed to inhibit them. They were not expressing themselves. Everything was safety-first and a bit meek.\n\nNow, that England shirt seems to make the players double in size. They have embraced this team and this stage and are relishing showing the Allianz Stadium crowd what they are capable of.\n\nThey are enjoying their rugby. And we are enjoying watching them.\n\nPerversely, it is because the mood is so good around the team that coach Steve Borthwick and the players can be so focused on the bits and pieces which went wrong in the 48-7 win over Wales to open their Six Nations campaign.\n\nThere were no cartwheels or laps of honour after the final whistle. The players looked like they were happy with the win but focused on the next task - and aware that they will have to be better when they take on a wounded Scotland in Edinburgh on Saturday.\n\nTommy Freeman is rapidly approaching world-class status.\n\nThe package that he brings to Test rugby - the pace, size, aerial ability and appetite for the ball - is pretty special.\n\nHe was a starter for the British and Irish Lions in all three Tests against Australia in the summer and he is inked into this England team as one of those who will always have a place when fit.\n\nHowever, there is a question over which number Borthwick will write next to Freeman's name.\n\nThis was Freeman's 23rd England appearance but only his third as a centre.\n\nConsidering that relatively paltry midfield experience, he was pretty damn good against Wales.\n\nHe hit superb lines, either hitting the ball up bravely into the heart of Wales defence or acting as a decoy, and worked instinctively with Northampton team-mate Fraser Dingwall inside him at 12.\n\nThey are turning into a dangerous and cohesive pairing - and England have been crying out for a midfield combination with those qualities for ages.\n\nWhere once the supply of centres was quite low, there are now a bunch of alternatives.\n\nOllie Lawrence, who is working his way back from a minor knee injury, may be available for Scotland. Max Ojomoh was very impressive against Argentina in the autumn. Seb Atkinson has credit in the bank from his performances on the summer tour of Argentina.\n\nIt means England can mix and match according to the opposition.\n\nDo they want a punch in midfield or the ability to distribute quickly into wide channels? Gas around the outside or the ability to probe behind with kicks?\n\nThe ability to change tactics with different midfield selection is very, very exciting.\n\nSouth Africa - the gold standard for everyone in world rugby at the moment - have the same.\n\nThe mix of Damian de Allende, Jesse Kriel, Canan Moodie, Damian Willemse and even Andre Esterhuizen gives them different ways of playing.\n\nThat adaptability is a fantastic attribute for any team.\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales\n\nSame old story for sorry Wales in Six Nations\n\nInevitably, Henry Arundell's first-half hat-trick for England caught the eye against Wales, but it will have been the smaller details that most impressed Borthwick.\n\nDefensively, Arundell has been questioned in the past, but he was strong in that area against Wales.\n\nWhen you see him up close, he is strong and solid, as well as fast. He packs 15st 2lb into a 6ft frame and is physical and intimidating in defence. But he is also canny.\n\nHis positioning was good against Wales. He did not step out of shape and get isolated, as he has done previously.\n\nHis six months or so at Bath, under Johann van Graan and defence coach JP Ferreira, have really brought Arundell's game on in that respect.\n\nLate in the game, with England well over the horizon and the win secure, he also came in off his wing, looking for work and holes to exploit with his pace.\n\nThat is another side of his game that is developing. He is no longer only hanging out on the edge, waiting for the ball to come to him.\n\nAfter France and England's dominant first-round performances, the expectation around their final-round meeting in Paris on 14 March has risen another notch.\n\nBut you would be foolish to draw a straight line from this opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider on the final one.\n\nThere are going to be tougher moments for each side before that. The test will be how they react to being under the pump, away from home in tricky conditions. Scotland showed how hard that can be during their defeat by Italy on Saturday.\n\nBorthwick will not be looking too far ahead, but one lesson he can already take from France is the ability to create competitive internal environments.\n\nOpposite number Fabien Galthie shook up his squad selection for the tournament, leaving out established players Damian Penaud, Gael Fickou and Gregory Alldritt. Perhaps they will come back in for later fixtures. Perhaps not.\n\nBut the new faces - and the sense of playing for your place - pushed France to a great performance against Ireland.\n\nBorthwick now has the depth to be as bold in his team selection. That is a wonderful place to be.",

    "description": "The world's fourth-richest man promised to save the Washington Post. Time for him to step up and do it.",
    "fullText": "Will Lewis, the former CEO and publisher of the Washington Post, had a terrible tenure at the paper. The two years he spent there, which ended Saturday with a two-paragraph memo, are chiefly notable for a series of cuts and layoffs, culminating in a 30% bloodletting days ago.\n\nBut let's be clear: This one is on Jeff Bezos.\n\nMost obviously, that's because Bezos owns the Post, and Bezos was the one who hired Lewis to run the business for him.\n\nBezos was also the one signing off on Lewis's actions at the paper, which mostly amounted to making the paper smaller while telling the staff that \"people are not reading your stuff.\"\n\nAnd slightly less obviously, it was Bezos who dramatically worsened the Post's business outlook. He decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in 2024, weeks before the election — a move that outraged many Post readers, who saw the non-endorsement as an attempt to cater to Donald Trump.\n\nThat led to more than 250,000 subscriber cancellations, a huge problem for a paper whose circulation peaked at 3 million in 2021.\n\nThe best case argument you could make for Lewis era at the Post, if you are inclined, would go something like this: Bezos, who bought the Post in 2013 and then invested heavily in staff, realized a few years ago that he now employed many more people than his business would support. So he brought Lewis in to do the grim work of shrinking the publication. Now that work is done, so Lewis can do something else and Bezos can find someone to help the Post grow again.\n\nBut the timing of Lewis' departure — late afternoon on a Saturday, following days of howling from Post employees and many others about Lewis and Bezos' stewardship of the paper — suggests this was not a long-in-the-making move.\n\nAnd again, whether Lewis jumped or was pushed doesn't matter in the end. The Washington Post is Jeff Bezos. He gets praise if things are going well — which, for several years after his purchase, seemed to be the case — and blame when it doesn't.\n\nHere I'll also point out that Bezos, who has no problem being seen jet-setting around the world in a style befitting the world's fourth-richest man, has been totally MIA during his paper's recent turmoil.\n\nOn Saturday, when the paper announced it had promoted Post CFO Jeff D'Onofrio to acting publisher and CEO, Bezos finally attached his name to a public statement, promising that the new Post would thrive by giving readers things they wanted to read.\n\n\"The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus,\" he said in a Post press release.\n\nThat might qualify for an insight 30 years ago, when newspapers were struggling to respond to the internet. Now that's table stakes, and you would hope the guy who created Amazon has more up his sleeve.\n\n\"I have a bunch of ideas,\" for the Post, Bezos said in the fall of 2024. \"I'm working on that right now.\"",

    "description": "By scoring a first-half hat-trick against Wolves on Saturday, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent, putting himself firmly in the England conversation.",
    "fullText": "With the World Cup four months away, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent on Saturday.\n\nThe Chelsea forward scored a first-half hat-trick as the Blues beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves 3-1 to remain firmly in the hunt for a top-four finish.\n\nTwo of those goals were penalties, with Palmer displaying his typically ice-cool demeanour to send the goalkeeper the wrong way both times.\n\nPalmer has been dogged by a groin injury this season, and the three goals almost doubled his tally for the campaign - going from four Premier League goals to seven.\n\nThe performance also puts him firmly in the England squad conversation.\n\n\"If he's impacting games, like we know he can, from now to the end of the season, he's a sure thing to be in the squad,\" former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"He can play wide, he can play as a 10. He's just so good on the ball and classy and simply doesn't fear anybody.\n\n\"Even if you bring him off the bench, you know he can do unbelievable things. He can win you a game in a heartbeat.\"\n\nPalmer celebrated his opening goal against Wolves by covering his ears - a response, perhaps, to recent reports suggesting he is unsettled in London.\n\nThe former Manchester City player has had a difficult campaign in which injury has seen him in and out of the side, while under new head coach Liam Rosenior he has had his playing minutes carefully managed.\n\nSince Rosenior became Chelsea boss at the start of this year he has often faced questions about Palmer's form, fitness and state of mind.\n\nThis performance provided something of a direct response to those questions, but key for Palmer will be keeping it up.\n\n\"We know what a world-class player he is. He's played a lot of football over the last year with not much rest,\" said Rosenior.\n\n\"When he's at his best, he's unstoppable. I'm delighted to be working with him.\"\n\nThis is, after all, a player who scored twice in the Club World Cup final less than six months ago, and across the two seasons prior to this one totted up 37 Premier League goals.\n\nIf Palmer can now build momentum, he will be hitting form at just the right time.\n\nHe was a key player for England at Euro 2024 but has made just one appearance under current boss Thomas Tuchel - in a 1-0 win against Andorra last June.\n\nInjuries have been a factor, but there is also competition for places - with the likes of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham rivalling him for the number 10 role.\n\n\"At the moment it looks like Morgan Rogers and Jude Bellingham will be the two who are ahead of him,\" said former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha on BBC Final Score.\n\n\"I'd be looking to find a way to get him in the side.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would select Palmer for England, former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton was a little more blunt: \"Not at the minute, no. I'd play Rogers.\"\n\nEngland have two more friendlies lined up before the World Cup - against Uruguay on 27 March and Japan four days later - so that international camp will offer a big chance for players such as Palmer to impress Tuchel.\n\n\"I don't think Cole [Palmer] is at his best yet,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"Like a lot of players, when you have had a bad injury and you've had quite a lot of time out, it does take game time to get your rhythm and your sharpness back.\n\n\"He really needs to start playing regularly to force his way into the England squad and team, because at the moment with Morgan Rogers doing what he's doing, and other players playing well, he's got a battle on his hands.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Nick Ball is beaten for the first time in his professional career in front of hometown fans in Liverpool, relinquishing his world title.",
    "fullText": "Nick Ball's reign as WBA featherweight world champion ended in dramatic fashion as the British boxer was stopped in the 12th round by Brandon Figueroa in front of stunned home fans in Liverpool.\n\nAfter 11 closely contested rounds, in which Ball was at times typically bullish on the inside and Figueroa responded with relentless volume, the fight turned in an instant.\n\nSeconds into the final round at M&S Bank Arena, Figueroa landed a flush straight left that sent Ball crashing to the canvas. The 28-year-old beat the count but looked unsteady, and a sharp follow-up combination forced the referee to wave it off.\n\nUgly scenes followed as beer and objects were thrown towards the ring after a brief altercation, with members of Ball's team unhappy about the manner of Figueroa's celebrations while the deposed champion was recovering.\n\n\"I'm sorry [for the celebration], we didn't mean anything, we were just excited. Sorry about that,\" Figueroa said.\n\n\"Big shout out to Nick Ball, he is a great Liverpool champion and one of the best England have ever had. I have nothing but respect for him.\"\n\nIn his fourth defence of the world title, Ball - who left the arena without giving a post-fight interview - suffered the first defeat of his professional career, having previously gone 24 fights unbeaten with one draw.\n\nThe result scuppers his hopes of unification bouts and brings to an end a positive run of results for British boxing on the global stage following Dalton Smith and Josh Kelly's world title triumphs in January.\n\nAmerican Figueroa, meanwhile, becomes a three-weight world champion in his 30th pro bout.\n\nFigueroa stops Ball to claim WBA title from Briton - reaction\n\nFigueroa, 29, lived up to his moniker, 'Heartbreaker', on a deflating and sorrowful night for 'Wrecking' Ball and the Liverpool crowd.\n\nThe challenger was met by a chorus of jeers on his ring walk, the 7,500-capacity arena close to full and firmly partisan. Figueroa blew kisses to his loved ones and stood calmly in his corner as the noise swelled for Ball.\n\nThe Kirkby-born fighter was given a proper hometown reception. From John Conteh to Natasha Jonas, Liverpool has never been shy of producing world champions, and Ball is the latest to have carried on that proud tradition.\n\nThe contest began at a frantic pace. Ball threw 145 punches across the opening three rounds - including sharp uppercuts in the first and second – with Figueroa throwing 204 times.\n\nAt just 5ft 2in, Ball conceded seven inches in height but dismissed the idea that was a disadvantage beforehand, insisting he preferred \"punching up\" at taller opponents.\n\nAs blood trickled from the champion's nose and reddened his mouth, Figueroa continued to press and appeared the fresher man at the halfway mark.\n\nBall responded with a blistering flurry in the eighth. Figueroa winced, smiled and fired back to the body. With some tight rounds, the fight felt finely poised and destined to go to the scorecards.\n\n\"Championship rounds. This is your territory now,\" Ball's corner told him.\n\nThere was nervousness in the arena, but nobody predicted such an abrupt ending.\n\nWith Ball scrambling on the floor after the initial left, he admirably rose on the count of nine.\n\nBut Figueroa sensed the finish and unloaded - a left-right-left combination completing the job for the Texan.\n\nDuring the melee that followed the stoppage, Andrew Cain, a member of Ball's team who won his own fight on the undercard, appeared to aim a kick at one of Figueroa's cornerman.\n\nTensions were calmed quickly, and scorecards revealed the knockout was the icing on the cake for Figueroa, who was ahead of two of the three scorecards at the time of the stoppage.\n\nBall has come a long way since making his professional debut in a Liverpool nightclub and had won four fights in a row since his controversial split draw with Rey Vargas in March 2024.\n\nOf all reigning male world champions from Britain, he was the only one to have defended his title.\n\nBut that run has come to an end in the most disappointing fashion.\n\nBall's fan-friendly style had made him one of the country's most watchable fighters, with unification bouts and big-name opponents on the horizon.\n\nA potential super-fight with Japan's pound-for-pound star Naoya Inoue, the undisputed super-bantamweight champion, had also been on Ball's wishlist.\n\nInstead, Ball ran into an inspired Figueroa and must now process both the first defeat of his career and the loss of his world title.\n\nHow he responds - physically and mentally - will shape the next chapter, and overcoming this setback may prove a defining test of his character.\n\nBruce Carrington (WBC), Angelo Leo (IBF) and Rafael Espinoza (WBO) hold the other world titles in the division, but would any of them be eager to step in with Ball when he has no world title to offer?\n\nBall could seek a rematch with Figueroa, although the American might be reluctant to take that option after his knockout win.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Singapore (AP) — This week’s Singapore Air Show brought together trade delegations from around the world to show off the latest in civilian and military aviation technology.\n\nThe event this year marked the 10th edition of the air show, which showcased cutting-edge planes from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force. This included the F-35 Lightning II, the latest U.S.-made fifth-generation fighter jet that has integrated stealth technology and is considered one of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.\n\nMajor commercial plane makers also touted the latest advancements in their fleets, including Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Boeing and China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC.\n\n“We have a very good representation of the latest and the greatest,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, which organizes the event. “The Singapore Air Show, the unique part of it is we cover both the aviation and also the defense industries.”\n\nDuring the Singapore Air Show's aerial displays, COMAC promoted its C919 passenger jet, which China is pushing as an alternative to the European Airbus A320neo and the American Boeing 737 MAX. The daily aerial displays at the event also showcased six military teams and Airbus’ A350-1000.\n\nWithin the exhibition hall, the air show featured experimental air taxis, advanced flight simulators, a wide variety of drones and both manned and unmanned helicopters. The static aircraft display under Singapore’s sizzling sun included roughly 35 planes from more than 10 countries.\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 companies from around 50 countries participated in the air show, hosted on the grounds of Changi International Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest airport. The event, which opened on Feb. 3, is considered Asia’s largest aerospace and defense exhibition and runs through Feb. 8.\n\n“All the exhibitors can use Singapore as a springboard to then tap into the opportunities that are rising in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key driver that is driving the growth of the global aviation industry,\" Lam said.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "fullText": "India captain Suryakumar Yadav led ‌by example as the tournament co-hosts began their Twenty20 World Cup title defence with a 29-run victory against the United States in a group A contest on Saturday.\n\nIndia recovered from a dire 77-6 to post a decent 161-9 with Suryakumar hitting a scintillating 84 not out off 49 balls.\n\nThe US managed 132-8 in reply, putting up a decent fight but never really coming ⁠close to chasing down the target.\n\nEarlier, the predominantly Indian fans at the Wankhede Stadium probably expected sixes and fours to rain down after US captain Monank Patel elected to field.\n\nInstead, it was a long procession of India’s top-order batters returning to the pavilion after a spectacular meltdown of the world’s top-ranked T20 team.\n\nOpener Abhishek Sharma, currently the world’s number one T20 batter, fell for a first-ball duck in perhaps an inkling of what was in ⁠store for the home side.\n\nThe real nightmare unfolded in the final Powerplay over when Shadley van Schalkwyk claimed three wickets in five deliveries to leave India reeling on 46-4.\n\nIshan Kishan (20) and Tilak Varma (25) could not convert their starts, while Shivam Dube departed with a golden duck against his name in that eventful over from van Schalkwyk.\n\nIt could easily have been worse, but bowler Shubham Ranjane could not hold onto a return catch from Suryakumar when the batter was on 15.\n\nWickets kept tumbling at the other end though.\n\nRinku Singh, Hardik Pandya and ‌Axar Patel perished trying to swing their way out of trouble.\n\nSuryakumar responded to the crisis with a captain’s knock as he raced to a 36-ball fifty before plundering 21 runs from the final over from Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nIndia’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah missed ‌the match due to illness, and they were also forced into replacing Harshit Rana, who was ruled out of the tournament barely 24 hours before ‌their opening match with a thigh injury.\n\nMohammed Siraj (3-29) vindicated his last-minute ⁠inclusion as Rana’s replacement with a two-wicket burst, while Arshdeep Singh also tasted success as they reduced the US to 31-3 in the six Powerplay overs.\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi (37) and Milind Kumar (34) defied India for a while with a 58-run stand, but once the partnership ‌ended, India were firmly in charge.\n\nIn Colombo, the Netherlands nearly pulled off a major upset before Faheem Ashraf’s breezy cameo secured Pakistan’s nervy three-wicket win with three balls to spare in another group A contest.\n\nIn a group C match in Kolkata, West Indies fast bowler Romario Shepherd claimed four wickets in five balls, including a hat-trick, as the twice champions thumped Scotland by 35 runs.",

    "description": "A global boycott may be the only nonviolent way to curb US aggression and repression.",
    "fullText": "Professorial Lecturer at American University in Washington, DC.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump’s leadership, the United States has, over the past year, consistently violated international norms and laws. The rollercoaster of tariff barriers, the sham negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, and the declaration of a false “ceasefire” with Israel, all while openly musing about turning Gaza into “oceanfront property”, would have been bad enough on their own.\n\nBut in just the past couple of months, the US has bombed Nigeria to “defend” Christians, invaded Venezuela and arrested its president, Nicolás Maduro, after months of blowing up Venezuelan boats in international waters, and openly threatened Iran, Greenland, and Mexico with military intervention.\n\nWithin the US, Trump’s ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has continued to carry out extralegal harm in the process of fulfilling his promise of mass deportations. Since the start of 2026, federal immigration officers have shot and killed at least three US citizens: 43-year-old Keith Porter Jr. in California, and 37-year-olds Renée Nicole Good and Alex Pretti in Minnesota. Both Good and Pretti were killed on camera, in incidents recorded from multiple angles, intensifying public outrage over the expanding use of lethal force by federal immigration agencies.\n\nIf this were almost any other country, like Iran, with its repressive and indiscriminate killing of thousands of protesters over the past month, the Western-led international community would already be calling for sanctions and embargoes against the US. But in light of US threats and actions at home and abroad, the world now needs to take a page from the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s leadership in the early years of the Civil Rights Movement. The world needs to boycott and divest from US corporations, US-made products, and US-led events.\n\nShort of civil strife, civil war, or military action, there is no other way for the world to disrupt US aggression except through massive economic pressure. While on a considerably smaller scale, King and so many other Black people in the 1950s understood that hitting the wallets of those who had long benefited from Black labour and pain could be effective in the US. It was one of the few tools available in their struggle against the daily onslaught of violent racist segregation.\n\nThe 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama was a response to decades of segregated public transport, not simply to Rosa Parks refusing to give up a “whites-only” seat at the front of a bus on December 1, 1955. During the year-long protest, some 40,000 Black Montgomery residents either carpooled or walked to school, work, church, and elsewhere. Defending the boycott, King said, “We came to see that, in the long run, it is more honourable to walk in dignity than ride in humiliation.”\n\nWhite Montgomery residents responded with mass arrests, threats, and other acts of intimidation, including the bombing of King’s home on January 30, 1956. A month after the US Supreme Court affirmed Browder v. Gayle, the decision outlawing segregation on public transportation, with the now-deceased activist Claudette Colvin among the plaintiffs, Montgomery formally ended its bus segregation policies on December 17, 1956, though white residents continued to harass, attack, and even lynch Black bus riders and civil rights activists for years afterwards. “Our aim has never been to put the bus company out of business, but rather to put justice in business,” King said.\n\nPutting “justice in business” in the case of the US will require a global effort. The world should build on the Palestinian-led BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement against Israel and apply those lessons to the US. BDS was launched in July 2005 with the support of 170 Palestinian organisations as a nonviolent effort to apply economic and cultural pressure on Israel to end its apartheid rule over Gaza and the West Bank. BDS founders Omar Barghouti and the late Ingrid Jaradat Gassner drew inspiration from the global anti-apartheid boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBDS has three objectives in its two-decade-long push against Israeli oppression and systematic genocide: “ending [Israel’s] occupation and colonisation of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall; recognising the fundamental rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and respecting, protecting, and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties, as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.”\n\nIt is true that powerful lobbies and other Western supporters of Zionism have labelled BDS “anti-Semitic”. But it is also true that those opposed to social justice will go to great lengths to discredit and destroy movements that challenge their power. Over the years, BDS has helped raise global awareness of the everyday, systemic destruction of Palestine and the lives of Palestinians living under Israel’s apartheid and occupation. The movement is also likely a key reason why the ongoing genocide in Gaza never garnered broad international support or sustained backing among ordinary Americans.\n\nAs for a global boycott movement against US oppression and aggression, some have already begun calling for a boycott of the 2026 FIFA Men’s World Cup this summer, with most scheduled matches set to take place in stadiums across the US. Social media posts urging people to cancel World Cup tickets and travel plans to the US, and to sanction its athletes and businesses, have gone viral in the aftermath of ICE agent Jonathan Ross’s gunning down of Renée Nicole Good on January 7. Given the increase in xenophobic, queerphobic, and racist civil strife and persecution at home and abroad, a backlash against US tourism now looms as the world approaches the June dates for the tournament’s matches.\n\nBut the stakes for the US and the world at this moment are high, and boycotting the globe’s largest sporting event, though significant, is hardly enough to pressure an increasingly belligerent and autocratic regime. Boycotting and divesting from US businesses that support the oppression of marginalised people, especially companies such as Google, Amazon, and Palantir, with their surveillance investments in Israel, would be one place to start. Disinvesting from US-based media monopolies, whether News Corp, The Washington Post, or Paramount Global, would go a long way towards loosening the stranglehold US monopolies exert over Western media. Boycotting the America250 celebrations scheduled for July, the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and annual US-based international cultural events such as Coachella and the Met Gala would also exert pressure.\n\nBoycotting high-profile US supporters of oppression and militarism, whether Trump, Bari Weiss, or Elon Musk, would draw further attention. If the world wants the US to do better by its own people and to act as a better nation-state on the global stage, it must act collectively to boycott and divest from US influence.\n\nIt was not all that long ago that the old Soviet Union regularly labelled Americans as “capitalist pigs” or “imperialist pigs”. Such Cold War propaganda was accompanied by films portraying the once self-proclaimed “leader of the free world” as a society riven by racist civil strife and violent repression against those who challenged injustice.\n\nYears after King gave his first public address galvanising the Montgomery Bus Boycott, where he described the “weapon of protest” as “the glory of America, with all of its faults”, he came to understand that much of what had been dismissed as Soviet propaganda was, in fact, bedrock reality. “The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and racism. The problems of racial injustice and economic injustice cannot be solved without a radical redistribution of political and economic power,” King said in 1967. This is something the world needs to remind the US of in 2026.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

    "description": "Ireland have a string of disappointing T20 World Cups behind them and will need to repeat their giant-killings of the past to buck the trend in Sri Lanka and India.",
    "fullText": "Whether it be the unforgettable St. Patrick's Day against Pakistan in 2007, or Kevin O'Brien thumping a rapid century to beat England four years later, Ireland's history at World Cups is one built upon giant killings.\n\nBut if those historic days, and a few more besides against the likes of West Indies, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, all helped to create a reputation for over-performance at global showpieces, it has been a contrasting story at T20 World Cups.\n\nIndeed, as Ireland prepare to start their 2026 campaign against co-hosts Sri Lanka on Sunday, the presence of Oman in their group is a reminder that in the shorter format, the shoe has more often been on the other foot.\n\nIt was 10 years ago in India that defeat by the tournament debutants first up sent Ireland on their way to one of their six early exits from eight attempts, while it was the same old story in the USA last time around when a 12-run loss to Canada, with an assist from the weather, did the damage.\n\nWith Australia to follow Sri Lanka this time around, before facing Oman and then Zimbabwe in Pool B, if Heinrich Malan's side are to reverse the trend in the coming 10 days, they must ensure they are again the ones administering the shocks rather than finding themselves on the receiving end.\n\nSaturday, 8 February 2026, 13:30 GMT\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text with in-play clips.\n\nWhile Ireland lost three of their six scheduled T20s to the weather during a wholly frustrating home summer in 2025, in the months since they have at least had the benefit of regular cricket.\n\nHarry Tector and Matthew Humphreys led the way for an encouraging T20 win over Bangladesh in November before consecutive losses to surrender the series gave the impression of a side who had run out of steam at the end of the multi-format tour.\n\nA 2-1 series win over Italy followed by a two-game whitewash of the UAE have formed the bulk of preparations for the World Cup, but a final tune-up against Pakistan on Wednesday fell victim to the rain, robbing the side of the chance to step up against the sort of superior opposition they will face in their first two games in Sri Lanka.\n\nAcross the five warm-up games in Dubai, there is the sense that the side have chanced upon their optimum line-up for the conditions in Sri Lanka, although perhaps the solution involved the loss of form one of their leading lights.\n\nTector and Humphreys continue to lead the way with bat and ball respectively, with the former averaging 43 across his past eight T20 internationals to form a strong middle-order with wicket-keeper Lorcan Tucker.\n\nRoss Adair, who still has Ireland's most recent T20 century to his name thanks to his knock against South Africa in 2024, appears to have held off the challenge of the younger Tector brother, Tim, to open alongside captain Paul Stirling.\n\nDespite the skipper averaging 20 across the 16 T20s Ireland have played since the last World Cup, the 35-year-old remains the side's best player against the spin bowling they are sure to face in Sri Lankan conditions.\n\nThe bowling resurgence of veteran all-rounder George Dockrell - who took four wickets for 53 runs from 13 overs in the warm-ups - allows for the lengthening of the batting line-up where 23-year-old Ben Calitz will be relied upon to provide some left-handed thump.\n\nIt is all, however, expected to be at the expense of a genuine quick. An out-of-sorts Josh Little did not feature in either match against the UAE after not managing a wicket in two games against both Bangladesh and Italy with an economy rate ranging between 9.50 and 13.50.\n\nThe player who took a memorable T20 World Cup hat-trick against New Zealand in 2022, and indeed had figures of 4-23 against Sunday's opposition a year prior, looks likely to start the tournament outside the starting XI.\n\nWith Mark Adair, Ireland's leading T20 wicket-taker there to shoulder the load in terms of seam, it means Malan's selection can all, in one way or another, take some confidence from their preparations.\n\nWhether that transfers to facing the likes of Sri Lanka and Australia, however, will be the determining factor in Ireland's efforts.\n\nAustralia's Hazlewood ruled out of T20 World Cup\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group C, Kolkata\n\nWest Indies 182-5 (20 overs): Hetmyer 64 (36); Currie 2-23\n\nScotland 147 (18.5 overs): Berrington 42 (24), Shepherd 5-20\n\nScotland began their T20 World Cup campaign with a 35-run defeat by two-time champions West Indies at Eden Gardens, undone by Shimron Hetmyer's blistering half‑century and Romario Shepherd's five-wicket haul.\n\nHaving been drafted into the tournament late following Bangladesh's boycott, the Scots had their moments but ultimately failed to match the quality of their opponents, who were winners in 2012 and 2016.\n\nA fourth-place finish at last summer's Europe Qualifier had looked to have cost Scotland a place at the 2026 edition, but handed a second chance, they proved they were not out of place on the big stage.\n\nChasing 183, the Scots were 37-3 in the sixth over when captain Richie Berrington and Tom Bruce came together in the middle and briefly ignited hopes of an upset.\n\nThe pair added 78 for the fourth wicket, with Berrington leading from the front with 42 from 24 balls but his departure with the score at 115-4 stalled their momentum.\n\nWest Indies then all but sealed the victory as Shepherd took four wickets in the 17th over, including a sensational hat-trick, to finish with 5-20.\n\nOpting to bowl first, Scotland restricted West Indies to 182‑5 - a total they would have gladly accepted going into the final overs after coming under pressure from the brutal hitting of Windies duo Hetmyer and Rovman Powell.\n\nMaking their sixth appearance in the tournament, Scotland held their nerve through the powerplay as West Indies crawled to 33-0 before they struck twice in quick succession through Michael Leask and debutant Oliver Davidson.\n\nOff-spinner Leask made the breakthrough in the ninth over to dismiss Windies skipper Shai Hope before Davidson, the 21-year-old left-armer, accounted for Brandon King, who had settled in well with a 30-ball 35, in the following over.\n\nWest Indies found themselves 66-2 at the halfway stage of their innings but some explosive batting from Hetmyer swung the momentum back in their favour with Powell also joining in with 24 from 14 balls.\n\nHetmyer, meanwhile, raced to his half-century in 22 balls and it needed a fantastic catch from Brandon McMullen at wide long-on to send back the batter in the penultimate over after a quickfire 64 from 36 balls.\n\nBut by then, the Windies were well and truly in command, and despite some tidy death bowling from Brad Currie, who finished with figures of 2‑23, they posted a total that proved out of Scotland's reach.\n\nT20 World Cup: Shepherd takes hat-trick as Windies blow away Scotland - as it happened\n\nScotland may have been late additions to the T20 World Cup but Hetmyer was an even later arrival to India, only reaching Kolkata on the eve of West Indies' opener because of issues with his visa.\n\nBut you would not have known it from his daring innings at Eden Gardens as the 29‑year‑old Guyanese left‑hander showed no hints of jet lag as he went about dismantling Scotland's plans.\n\nHetmyer's 22-ball half-century was the fastest ever by a West Indies player at the T20 World Cup, breaking Chris Gayle's previous record from 23 balls against Australia in 2009.\n\nHe hit 40 of his first 52 runs in boundaries, and with support from Powell and Sherfane Rutherford who powered to a 13-ball 26, guided his team through a blistering middle phase as they went from 66-2 in 10 overs to 138-2 with five overs to go.\n\nHetmyer himself produced a brilliant one-handed catch to dismiss Scotland opener George Munsey early on but it was Shepherd who grabbed the limelight with the ball for the Windies.\n\nWith Scotland on 132-5 and needing 51 off 24, the all-rounder took four wickets in five balls to leave them reeling at 133-9.\n\nShepherd dismissed Matthew Cross, Leask and Davidson for his hat-trick before also picking up Safyaan Sharif's wicket for the first five-for of his T20I career and giving West Indies a platform to build on as they eye a record third title.\n\nThey will next be action against England in Mumbai on Wednesday, 11 February while Scotland meet Italy on Monday, 9 February.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - fixtures\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Bowler Shubham Ranjane, one of five India-born players in USA's XI, was the guilty party low in his follow-through.\n\nThe India captain punished the miss with a brilliant 84 not out from 49 balls, countering the situation perfectly by starting slowly before unfurling thrilling scoops and flicks to drag the hosts to 161-9.\n\nThat denied the underdogs any momentum and India seamers Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj took three wickets in the first four overs of the chase to reduce the US to 13-3.\n\nAs the required run-rate climbed, the expectant locals grew more comfortable and the US scrapped to 132-8 in their 20 overs without ever threatening to complete the chase.\n\nIt means, after an entertaining opening day in which the Netherlands were a dropped catch away from stunning Pakistan and Scotland threatened West Indies, India set the early pace at the top of Group A as expected in this World Cup.\n\nEngland enter the tournament on Sunday with a fixture against Nepal at 09:30 GMT. Ireland play Sri Lanka in Colombo at 13:30.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nIndia's margin of victory was, in the end, comfortable.\n\nMake no mistake, however. The upset, which would have topped USA's super over win over Pakistan at the last T20 World Cup, was on at one stage.\n\nThe home crowd was quiet and in the 13th over Suryakumar and Axar Patel were at the crease with only three tailenders remaining.\n\nThe US, who have not played a T20 since April amid governance issues and are ranked 18th in the world, bowled superbly.\n\nIndia opener Abhishek Sharma, many people's tip for player of the tournament, slashed his first ball to deep cover and when South Africa-born seamer Shadley van Schalkwyk mixed his pace to take three wickets in the sixth over, including Tilak Verma and Shivam Dube in consecutive deliveries, the hosts were 46-4.\n\nSuryakumar - known by his nickname SKY - defended Van Schalkwyk's hat-trick ball and took only five runs from his first 10 deliveries and 20 from his first 21.\n\nHis team-mates all struggled to time the ball but he took time to feel comfortable, putting on 41 with Axar.\n\nMaking the most of the reprieve by Ranjane, Suryakumar was playing trademark sweeps off seamers for six and tumbling scoops by the end with the US hurt by the loss of Ali Khan to injury with two of his overs unbowled.\n\nIndia's captain took 20 runs from the last over, meaning he ended the innings with 10 runs more than the 74 his team-mates managed combined.\n\nIt was a spectacular and much-needed knock.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Captain Scott Edwards top-scored with a battling 37.\n\nThe Netherlands made a positive start to their innings at the Sinhalese Sports Club after they were asked to bat first as opener Michael Levitt thumped 24 off 15 balls.\n\nBas de Leede continued the momentum with a composed 25-ball 30 and, at 105-3 with De Leede and Edwards at the crease, the Netherlands looked set to post a competitive total.\n\nBut the Associate nation lost their last six wickets for 20 runs as Mohammad Nawaz, Abrar Ahmed and Saim Ayub picked up two wickets apiece.\n\nSahibzada Farhan's classy 47 off 31 balls guided Pakistan to 98-2 before he slapped Aryan Dutt to cover to start a Pakistan collapse as Roelof van der Merwe and Paul van Meekeren bowled tightly.\n\nAshraf spared their blushes, though, when he hammered three sixes and a four off the penultimate over from Logan van Beek, the Netherlands missing a chance to dismiss him on seven when Max O'Dowd shelled a catch at long-off.\n\nWith five needed from the final over Ashraf got himself on strike then thrashed De Leede through cover for four to prevent a shock.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "title": "Backlift like Brian Lara, world champion at 14: The rise and rise of unconventional Vaibhav Sooryavanshi",
    "description": "Still two-years younger than what Sachin Tendulkar's age was at the time of his India debut, he has a bat-swing that reminds of Brian Charles Lara, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Yuvraj Singh, and like footballer Lamine Yamal, who has emerged as a teenage sensation at the highest level, Sooryavanshi’s age has rarely matched the stage he performs on.",
    "fullText": "Conventional wisdom suggests that a 13-year-old would struggle to even face deliveries bowled at speeds above 90 mph. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi has challenged that assumption by striking bowlers such as Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Jofra Archer to all parts of the ground.\n\nIn traditional cricket coaching, batters are taught to keep their hands close to the body during the backlift to maintain control over the bat swing. Sooryavanshi differs here as well. His backlift moves away from the body, going against what is often described as textbook technique.\n\nStill two-years younger than what Sachin Tendulkar's age was at the time of his India debut, he has a bat-swing that reminds of Brian Charles Lara, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Yuvraj Singh; and like footballer Lamine Yamal, who has emerged as a teenage sensation at the highest level, Sooryavanshi’s age has rarely matched the stage and level he performs on.\n\nTalent could never be the question with Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. It never was. With the 80-ball 175 knock against England in the Under-19 World Cup final on Friday, he also put to rest any talks of temperament too, with delivering on the biggest of stages.\n\nSooryavanshi produced what can be counted among the most dominant innings in Under-19 World Cup history. His 175, which included 15 sixes, helped India post 411 for 9 against England in the final at Harare.\n\nEngland, under pressure after Sooryavanshi’s innings, were bowled out for 311 in 40.2 overs while chasing a target of 412 against India’s bowling attack.\n\nThe 14-year-old reached his century in 55 balls, becoming the second-fastest centurion in the history of the Under-19 World Cup.\n\nHis innings is the highest individual score in an Under-19 World Cup final and came in the match that also produced the highest team total in a final of the tournament.\n\nSooryavanshi reached his first fifty in 32 balls and continued at the same pace against the England bowlers. His second fifty came off 23 balls.\n\nOut of his 175 runs, 150 came through boundaries, with 15 sixes and an equal number of fours. During this phase, India’s scoring rate stayed close to 10 runs an over, and the projected total crossed 500 midway through the innings.\n\nHe now holds the record for most sixes in a Youth ODI innings, surpassing his own mark of 14 sixes against UAE at ICCA Dubai in December.\n\nSooryavanshi also owns the record for the fastest 150 in Under-19 cricket, reaching the mark in 71 balls. The previous record was held by England’s Ben Mayes, who took 98 balls against Scotland at the same venue earlier in the tournament.\n\nVedant Trivedi, batting at the other end, faced only four deliveries between Sooryavanshi’s 100 and 150, underlining the speed at which the runs were scored.\n\nSooryavanshi first came into wider attention in November 2024 when he became the youngest player to receive an IPL contract after Rajasthan Royals signed him for Rs 1.10 crore. He was 13 years and 243 days old at the time. By then, he had already represented India Under-19 and scored a century as an opener against Australia Under-19 in a four-day match in Chennai.\n\nOne of the early highlights of his career was the 58-ball century against Australia Under-19, where he scored 104. At 13 years and 187 days, he became the youngest player to score a century in youth cricket, breaking the previous record held by Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto.\n\nIn the following months, Sooryavanshi continued to add records. On April 19, 2025, he made his IPL debut for Rajasthan Royals against Lucknow Super Giants, hitting Shardul Thakur for a six over extra cover off his first ball. He scored 34 off 20 balls in that match.\n\nIn his third IPL appearance, he scored a 35-ball century against Gujarat Titans, whose bowling attack included Mohammed Siraj, Ishant Sharma and Rashid Khan. The hundred was the second-fastest in IPL history, behind only Chris Gayle’s 30-ball century in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, Sooryavanshi recorded the fastest Youth ODI century at the time, reaching the milestone in 52 balls. That record was later broken by Pakistan’s Sameer Minhas, who scored a century off 42 balls against Zimbabwe Under-19.\n\nHe was named Bihar’s vice-captain for the first two rounds of the 2025–26 Ranji Trophy season in October. The decision followed his performances on India Under-19's tour of Australia, where he provided quick starts and scored a 78-ball century in the first four-day match in Brisbane. He finished as the second-highest run-scorer of the series, with 133 runs in three innings as India won 2-0.\n\nIn November 2025, Sooryavanshi scored 144 off 42 balls for India A against UAE in the Asia Cup Rising Stars. His century came off 32 balls and was then the joint-third fastest by an Indian in men’s T20 cricket.\n\nA few weeks later, he scored 171 off 95 balls against UAE Under-19 in the opening match of the Under-19 Asia Cup.\n\nAt 14 years and 272 days, Sooryavanshi became the youngest player to score a century in men’s List A cricket. He achieved the feat while playing for Bihar against Arunachal Pradesh in the 2025–26 Vijay Hazare Trophy. He reached his century in 36 balls, later scoring the fastest 150 in men’s List A cricket off 59 balls. He was dismissed for 190 off 84 balls, which included 16 fours and 15 sixes.\n\nSooryavanshi scored 439 runs and took 1 wicket in the Under-19 World Cup and was named Player of the Tournament after India won their sixth Under-19 World Cup title on Friday.\n\n\"I had faith in my skills that I can contribute in big games and today it happened,\" Sooryavanshi said at the post-match presentation.\n\nAt 14, Sooryavanshi is already a world champion. He has delivered on most opportunities given to him so far. But he's still a kid. It's important to give him space and not put too many expectations on him. Leave him freely and watch him take the cricketing world by storm.",

    "fullText": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Pakistan, at the center of a boycott controversy that has overshadowed the lead up to the T20 World Cup, has won the toss and elected to field against the Netherlands in the tournament's opening game on Saturday.\n\nThe Pakistan government has instructed its national team to boycott its Feb. 15 Group A game against co-host India, a decision that shook the cricket world only six days ago.\n\nThe ICC has since requested the Pakistan Cricket Board to reconsider the decision otherwise it will forfeit the marquee game of the tournament.\n\nIf Pakistan goes ahead with its boycott against India, it can ill afford to lose points in its three other Group A games — a group that also features the U.S. and Namibia.\n\nA grassy wicket at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, hosting its first T20 in 16 years, surprised Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha.\n\n“First time I’ve seen this much grass in Sri Lanka,” Agha said at the toss. “We’re playing three pacers and allrounders.

    "description": "Italy welcomed the world with a snow-capped spectacle during the opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Olympics, pushing past pre-Games tension.",
    "fullText": "Spread across more than 265 miles in four different cities from the snowy Dolomites to the sunny — for now — streets of Milan, the Milan-Cortina Olympics delivered one message.\n\nThe most widespread Olympic Games in history showcased Italy’s idyllic snow-capped mountains, cutting-edge city life and celebrated winter legacy in the opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Games on Friday. The unique setup that required four ceremonies in Milan, Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina d'Ampezzo used movie magic on video screens, a golden ring and Italian icon Andrea Bocelli to bridge the distance between host cities Milan and Cortina and unite the Olympics behind the athletes who will compete across seven sports zones in the next 16 days.\n\n“Let these Games be a celebration of what unites us, of everything that makes us human,” International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry said in her speech, her first at an Olympic Games under her leadership. “This is the magic of the Olympic Games: inspiring us all to be the best that we can be — together.”\n\nThe theme for Milan-Cortina’s opening ceremony was armonia, or harmony. The Games needed it.\n\nThese Olympics appear to be the most disconnected ever. The sprawling footprint covers seven different competition zones. The 2026 Games are the first to be officially hosted by two cities.\n\nBut the geographical distance is small compared to the geopolitical canyon the Games hope to bridge.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine is keeping most Russian athletes out of the competition. Only 32 athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports were allowed and will have to compete as individual neutral athletes. They will not hear their national anthems or wear their national flags. Ukrainian athletes marched into San Siro Stadium — where athletes competing in ice sports participated in the opening ceremony — to loud cheers.\n\nWhen talk of protest or political conflict arose this week, Coventry tried to downplay it to keep the focus on the Games. She called controversy about LA28 chairman Casey Wasserman and ICE agents in Milan \"sad\" distractions. The United States was at the center of much of the contention after reports concerning the presence of U.S. immigration agents in Milan prompted anti-ICE protests. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee tried to cool tensions by clarifying that the organization does work with the federal government to help secure the Games, but the USOPC works with the Diplomatic Security Service, which falls under the jurisdiction of the State Department and not Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.\n\nPresident Trump’s recent comments about the United States taking control of Greenland from Denmark also angered European allies.\n\nOn Friday, an American fan walked around the concourse at San Siro Stadium in a sweatshirt that read in multiple languages: “Sorry for our president.”\n\nWhen Vice President JD Vance, sitting in the presidential suite, was shown on the video screen at San Siro, the cheers that showered U.S. athletes when they entered the stadium turned into jeers. Vance attended multiple events this week, including the U.S. women’s hockey’s group stage opener Thursday and the team figure skating competition Friday.\n\nThe 323-athlete U.S. delegation led by flag bearers speedskater Erin Jackson in Milan and bobsled athlete Frank Del Duca in Cortina was the largest in the nation's Winter Olympics history and the largest of any country at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nAthletes marched into Milan’s San Siro Stadium, the home of AC Milan and Inter Milan, across a spiral-shaped stage. The four ramps converging into a circle represented the connection between Milan, Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina.\n\nEven if athletes of a country were not competing in Milan and were unable to attend the opening ceremony, a sign-holding volunteer dressed in a silver floor-length puffer dress strutted across the stage while screens showed athletes marching in during ceremonies at other Olympic locations around Italy.\n\nIn Cortina, a Brazilian athlete did a backflip after talking through a golden ring portal, a shared symbol at each ceremony. While Olympians in Milan walked into a packed stadium with flashing lights and thumping techno music played by a DJ at a turntable that looked like ice, the mountain ceremonies took place through the streets. Fans assembled on either side of the walkway for the parade of athletes.\n\nThe ceremony hit on the quintessential northern Italian experience. A plate of risotto was among the first images shown on the video board in the countdown video as the ceremony approached, followed by the picturesque snowy peaks of the Dolomites. As a fashion capital of the world, Milan used runway models dressed in green, white and red outfits designed by Giorgia Armani to represent the Italian flag. There was even a two-minute video on Italian hand gestures.\n\nItaly, as the host nation, marched in last to deafening applause and cheers from the crowd in Milan. In about two years, the United States will have the honor of closing the parade of athletes when L.A. hosts the 2028 Summer Games. The opening ceremony is also planned to take place in multiple locations, with the Coliseum and SoFi Stadium co-hosting the event.\n\nTo unite the Italian host cities, the Olympic flame was passed out of the stadium as Bocelli belted and the torch simultaneously reached two cauldrons. In Milan, the pulsating cauldron inspired by the sun will burn at Arco della Pace. In Cortina, it will light up Piazza Angelo Dibona.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "For a long time, everyone was sure Barron Trump would grow up to be a mini version of his dad, US President Donald Trump. Many believed he would attend his dad’s alma mater, but he ended up attending New York University, seemingly for business. But what else business-like has Barron done? Well, we know he helped with his dad’s campaign, and now he’s fully stepping into the business role his dad has held.\n\nIn case you missed it, Barron just became a partner in a new beverage company called Sollos Yerba Mate Inc. The company boasts $1 million in capital, and it seems Barron, along with a couple of high school pals, is listed as a director, according to Silicon Valley.\n\nMelania Trump Confirms Barron’s Role In The Bro Vote\n\nDescribed as a “lifestyle beverage brand built around clean + functional ingredients,” the company is all about yerba, a caffeinated herbal tea popular in South America.\n\nSo it seems he’s turning more and more into Donald every day, especially in the business world.\n\nIf you need a rundown on Donald’s kids and their partners, we got you. Donald has five children in total. He and his first wife, the late Ivana Trump, welcomed three children named Donald Jr, born Dec 1977, Ivanka, born Oct 1981, and Eric, Jan 1984. Donald and his second wife, Marla Maples, welcomed a daughter named Tiffany in October 1993.\n\nHe then welcomed his fifth child, Barron, in March 2006, with his current wife, Melania.\n\nBefore you go, \n\nEverything to Know About Leonardo DiCaprio’s GF Vittoria Ceretti\n\nEvery Super Bowl Halftime Performer From 1993-2026\n\nChappell Roan's Topless Moment & More Of The Most Shocking Grammys Looks Of All Time",

    "title": "US accuses China of breaking rules on nuclear weapons by hiding explosions and preparing for more testing",
    "description": "The US accused China of secret nuclear tests, banned under international agreement, that were building toward tests of larger nuclear warheads.",
    "fullText": "The US accused China of secret nuclear explosive testing and attempting to cover it up, an official said Friday.\n\nBanned for decades under an international agreement to which China and the US are signatories, nuclear explosive testing involves the detonation of warheads. The US accusation comes on the heels of the expiration of the nuclear arms control New START agreement between the US and Russia, which limited their numbers of deployed warheads and launchers.\n\n\"I can reveal that the US government is aware that China has conducted nuclear explosive tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons,\" US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Thomas DiNanno said in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nDiNanno added that Beijing had used \"decoupling — a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring — to hide its activities from the world,\" and said one such test had occurred on June 22, 2020. Decoupling refers to muffling the seismic signal of an underground nuclear test.\n\nA spokesperson for China's embassy in the US told Business Insider that Beijing is \"committed to peaceful development, follows a policy of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons, and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense and adheres to its nuclear testing moratorium.\" The spokesperson added China is ready to work with other countries to uphold the agreement.\n\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted in 1996, banned the live tests that have occurred for decades and contributed to nuclear scares and radioactive exposure. The last such test conducted by the US was in 1992, and China's most recent occurred in 1996. The only publicly known explosive testing this century has been by North Korea. The US, Russia, and China have signed the treaty but haven't ratified it, unlike nearly 180 other countries.\n\nCurrent testing practices rely on modeling, simulation, and subcritical testing, which officials have said are vigorous and dependable. Last year, US President Donald Trump raised concerns with vague comments on resuming nuclear testing in response to other countries.\n\n\"They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don't do testing, and we've halted it years, many years ago. But with others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" the president said.\n\nThere's been some suspicion that US rivals have been preparing for testing, including work spotted at the Lop Nur and Novaya Zemlya nuclear sites in China and Russia, respectively.\n\nBut in response to DiNanno's comments, Robert Floyd, executive secretary of the CTBTO, said the organization's monitoring system \"did not detect any event consistent with the characteristics of a nuclear weapon test explosion at that time. Subsequent, more detailed analyses has not altered that determination.\"\n\nJust a day before DiNanno's comments, the New START agreement binding the US and Russia to a number of operational nuclear weapons and launchers, as well as a verification process and open communication, expired. Whether Washington and Beijing will continue to observe the treaty or attempt a new agreement remains unclear.\n\nThe Trump administration has said a new nuclear arms deal would need to account for the growth of China's nuclear weapons stockpile, which the Pentagon has assessed will top 1,000 by 2030. \"And as we sit here today, China's entire nuclear arsenal has no limits, no transparency, no declarations, and no controls,\" DiNanno said, adding that a post-New START treaty will address both Russia's vast arsenal and China's nuclear rise.",

    "description": "The NFL will take two of its most iconic teams to two of the world's most iconic stadiums next season, so what is the league's plan and what do its players think?",
    "fullText": "The NFL's bid to capture the attention of the world's sports fans appears to know no bounds.\n\nAmerica's biggest sports league had already confirmed it will make its debut at two of the world's most iconic stadiums next season - Rio de Janeiro's Maracana and the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\n\nThen on Thursday, it used its biggest week of the year to announce that two of its most iconic franchises will be playing there.\n\nWith most activities for Super Bowl week being held in San Francisco, Thursday's news that the 49ers will be heading to Australia created a buzz in 'The City'.\n\nThen a few hours later it was revealed that the Dallas Cowboys - known as 'America's Team' - will head to Brazil for the NFL's first game in Rio.\n\n\"Introducing one of the league's most iconic teams to the Maracana Stadium marks a powerful milestone in the continued growth of the sport worldwide,\" said Luis Martinez, general manager of NFL Brazil.\n\nThe Cowboys' opponent and date for the game are yet to be confirmed. The 49ers will face the Los Angeles Rams, with the game expected to take place near the start of the season in September.\n\nNFL executives have repeatedly mentioned the league's desire to become a \"true global sport property\" and they will stage a record nine international games in 2026 - across four continents, seven countries and eight stadiums.\n\nWhere the Super Bowl will be won and lost\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nThe NFL's international presence has expanded dramatically over the past couple of years.\n\nFive international games during the 2024 season increased to seven in 2025, and nine will be played abroad in 2026.\n\nThat has included expanding into Brazil, Spain and Ireland, with Australia and France new territories for 2026, when there will also be a return to Mexico.\n\nNext season there will be games in London (three), Madrid, Melbourne, Mexico City, Munich, Paris and Rio.\n\n\"We're in several new markets, we're excited by that,\" said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell this week.\n\n\"It's the ambition that we have to be a global sport, but it's also the demand that we're having. We're hearing from cities all over the world that want to host these games and they really want to get more American football.\"\n\nGoodell has mentioned venturing into Asia while Abu Dhabi is one of the cities where the NFL has conducted a site visit to examine the possibility of playing a game there.\n\nThis week he reiterated that his ultimate goal is to play 16 international games each season, meaning each of the NFL's 32 teams would play overseas once a year.\n\n\"I think that's an important mark for us to go for, and I think we're well on our way,\" Goodell added.\n\nMini Super Bowls & Christmas games - NFL's bid to become 'truly global'\n\nTwo west coast teams were expected to make the journey for the NFL's first game in Australia, to minimise the impact of travel.\n\nAnd the Rams have been handed an encounter with divisional rivals the 49ers, who have also been regular Super Bowl contenders in recent years, so it makes for an appealing match-up.\n\nAfter being named this season's Most Valuable Player in San Francisco on Thursday, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford said: \"It seems like a long flight, and I hope my back's not too sore afterwards, to be honest with you.\n\n\"But I am excited about it, it's a really cool opportunity. Playing an unbelievable team like the 49ers is going to be a huge challenge. It's a fun rivalry so I think the fans in Australia are going to get a great game.\"\n\nDavid White, interim executive director of the NFL Players' Association (NFLPA) said this week: \"Our members appreciate the global stage. They understand the excitement that the games are generating around the world.\n\n\"But we've got a lot of feedback about not having good experiences because it's inconsistent. It's a seemingly arbitrary approach that clubs take to travel.\"\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nBefore this season's game at Wembley, for example, the Jacksonville Jaguars flew out to London early in the week, while the Rams arrived the day before the game and returned to LA immediately after their 35-7 win.\n\n\"Some teams will stay near the practice site, some will have lengthy commutes for the players after that travel, when they're getting over jet leg,\" said White. \"It depends which team they play for, so it's the lack of standardisation that feels arbitrary.\n\n\"The game requires a certain amount of rest, preparation and restoration in order for players to be safe, so all of that needs to be accounted for if we're going to talk about [travelling] even further away or having more international games. That's a matter of negotiation.\"\n\nThe NFL's current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the NFLPA allows up to 10 regular-season games to held overseas per season.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings became the first team to have two international games in the same season in 2025, playing in Dublin and London on successive Sundays, and linebacker Jonathan Greenard said he \"would not like to do back-to-back [again]\".\n\nBut White said players gave a \"good deal of positive feedback because of the way they went about it. That is the trick.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is possible that 16 games worldwide gets to be too much, but that's for the players to decide once they have all the information.\n\n\"We do have some sense of what makes a positive experience when travelling internationally, and we're collecting data.\n\n\"It's about making sure that the players are at the centre of that debate.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Former German World Cup winner Thomas Müller is yet to decide when he will end his glittering playing career.\n\nMüller has a contract at Major League Soccer side Vancouver Whitecaps until the end of the year by when he will be 37. He joined the Canadian side last summer after 25 trophy-laden years at Bayern Munich.\n\n\"As always in my life, I don't commit myself unnecessarily. My\n main motivation for playing football is to enjoy it. The first few months here have been a lot of fun. Now my first full season is coming up,\" Müller told Germany's Welt paper.\n\nMüller named his fitness and health a key criteria, saying: \"How will my body cope with the whole journey? I struggled a bit towards the end of last season. That's another reason why I haven't fully made up my mind yet.\"\n\nMüller, who was speaking from a training camp in the southern Spanish city of Marbella where the Whitecaps are preparing for the new season, said he still enjoys the role of a player.\n\n\"Having the opportunity to decide a home game in the 90th minute with a penalty, feeling that pressure and having the chance to move so many people's emotions with one action when you score – that's still worth going to bed earlier for,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I'll just skip the cocktail and have still water instead.\"\n\nBayern hope that Müller will return to the club in a new capacity once he has ended his playing career but he said that nothing is decided yet.\n\n\"The connection to FC Bayern is still there, both emotionally and in terms of content,\" he said.\n\n\"And we have discussed with the club management that there is a possibility of going down a joint path in the future. There is no letter of intent or even a term sheet yet. I don't want to do my coaching licence now (while still playing) or start a degree.\"\n\nMüller said \"I want to consciously pursue my education\" after the playing career, \"instead of frantically trying to get a certificate on the side.\n\n\"When I do something, I give it one hundred per cent. I don't want to expect myself or anyone else to get anything less than my full passion, energy and attention.\"",

    "description": "Stellantis' eleven-figure write-down is the largest in a wave of EV charges on global automakers. For consumers, that means fewer vehicle options.",
    "fullText": "Another Detroit automaker is paying a steep price as it pulls back from electric vehicles.\n\nStellantis — the global auto giant behind brands like Jeep, Dodge, Ram, and Chrysler — said Friday that it would take a €22 billion ($26 billion) charge tied to a sweeping reset of its electric-vehicle strategy.\n\nIt's the largest in a wave of recent EV-related write-downs by major global automakers, bringing the total in charges across the industry to $55 billion.\n\nIn September, Volkswagen recorded a $3.5 billion charge linked to its electric division. Ford followed that up in December with a $19.5 billion charge as it canceled plans to build large EVs. Last month, General Motors announced a $6 billion write-down tied to reduced EV production.\n\nThe moves underscore how aggressively some of the world's biggest automakers are cutting back on electric-vehicle bets.\n\n\"The reset we have announced today is part of the decisive process we started in 2025, to once again make our customers and their preferences our guiding star,\" Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a press release. \"The charges announced today largely reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition that distanced us from many car buyers' real-world needs, means, and desires.\"\n\nFilosa, who took over as CEO in May 2025, laid much of the blame on decisions made under the company's prior leadership, citing \"poor operational execution\" that left Stellantis with expensive EV investments that failed to sell.\n\nHis predecessor, Carlos Tavares, departed the company in December 2024.\n\nDuring Tavares' tenure, Stellantis spent billions positioning itself for what it believed would be a rapid shift in consumer demand toward electric vehicles. Formed in 2021 through the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France's PSA Group, the company poured money into new factories, battery development partnerships with LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, and an ambitious slate of future EV models.\n\nThe demand never materialized at the pace executives anticipated. Stellantis' profit dropped 70% during Tavares' final year on the job.\n\nStellantis has been holding costly EV-related assets — factories, platforms, and technology — that are now being written down.\n\nFor consumers, that means fewer options. The automaker has canceled or delayed several high-profile electric vehicles, including the Chrysler Airflow, the all-electric Ram 1500, and a planned $25,000 electric Jeep Renegade.\n\nIn January, the company also discontinued its fleet of plug-in hybrid vehicles, ending production of the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe, Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, and the Dodge Hornet Plug-In.\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, Stellantis' remaining electric launches include the $65,000 Jeep Recon and an extended-range Ram 1500 REV, which incorporates a gas generator paired with the battery motor.\n\nThe company is also reintroducing gas-fed powertrains to its lineup — including the V8 Hemi-powered Ram pickup series and a six-cylinder Dodge Charger.\n\nThe reset extends beyond Stellantis' vehicle lineup. Business Insider recently reported that the company is rolling out a five-day return-to-office order, effective March 30.\n\nStill, investors reacted swiftly to the eleven-figure EV write-down. Stellantis shares plunged 25.5% in early trading Friday, falling to about $7.10 a share roughly an hour after markets opened.",

    "fullText": "Caroline Dubois expects \"an easy night\" against Terri Harper as the world champions ramped up their increasingly bitter rivalry before their 5 April showdown.\n\nThe unified lightweight title fight will take place at London's Olympia, topping Most Valuable Promotions' first event in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"This is the start of my future, my legacy, my greatness. I believe I'm going all the way and it starts with Terri,\" said Dubois, 25.\n\nShe doubled down on calling Doncaster's three-weight world champion \"irrelevant\" and described her as a \"lottery\" ticket to bigger fights as the pair came together at a news conference in London.\n\nHarper, who holds a 16-2-2 record, has shared the ring with some of the sport's best boxers, including Sandy Ryan, Cecilia Braekhus, Natasha Jonas and Alycia Baumgardner.\n\nHaving also claimed world titles at featherweight and light-middleweight, Harper accused Dubois of overlooking her.\n\n\"For me this fight isn't about the belts. For me I just want to beat Caroline and this will be the sweetest win of my career,\" said the 29-year-old.\n\nAs expected, there was no handshake or warm embrace in the face-off as Dubois - keeping in theme with the news conference - did most of the talking.\n\nEdwards to fight Powar for British title on BBC\n\nShields calls out Price for blockbuster fight\n\n'Boxing can be messed up' - how to build a prospect\n\nAll the signs beforehand have pointed to a fiery encounter between two women who share genuine animosity.\n\nIn December, Dubois accused her fellow champion of having \"lost her pen\" during fraught negotiations, while earlier this week Harper walked out of Sky Sports' Gloves Are Off after a heated exchange during filming.\n\nAs Dubois smiled and took centre stage on Friday, a more reserved Harper looked slightly fed up.\n\nAsked when the rivalry first started, she said she felt disrespected by Dubois calling her out after the loss to Ryan in 2024.\n\n\"She's doing a great job of selling the fight. She's doing my job for me,\" added Harper.\n\nDubois is undefeated in 13 professional bouts - 12 wins and a draw - and made an impressive start to life under the MVP banner with a points win over Camilla Panatta in December.\n\nLong touted as the future of British boxing, she has grown in confidence and found her voice in recent years.\n\n\"This is going to be an easy night,\" said the Londoner, adding Harper's experience \"doesn't mean anything\".\n\nDubois was also involved in a tense war of words with Baumgardner at a news conference in Miami late last year.\n\nAnd she warned the 31-year-old American: \"I'm coming for her next.\"\n\nMVP - headed up by Nakisa Bidarian and Jake Paul - have invested heavily in female boxing and this bill showcased the depth of their British stable.\n\nIn the co-main event, super bantamweight Ellie Scotney will face Mexico's WBA champion Mayelli Flores Rosquero in an undisputed title fight.\n\nThey were due to fight in December before an injury to the Londoner.\n\n\"I've not got to pay for my mum to fly to America so my pocket is a little bit better there,\" joked Scotney.\n\nShe was in good spirits as she talked about her faith and the joy of fighting on Easter Sunday with her pastor attending the contest.\n\n\"We're bringing church to the Olympia on the night,\" said the 27-year-old.\n\nScotney could become Britain's fourth - and youngest - undisputed champion of the four-belt era with victory.\n\nNorthampton's Chantelle Cameron, 34, also features on the card with an opportunity to become a two-weight world champion when she faces the unbeaten Michaela Kotaskova for the WBO light-middleweight title.\n\nFormer undisputed light-welterweight champion Cameron's only defeat came against Ireland's Katie Taylor in 2023, while her 34-year-old Czech opponent has two losses and 11 wins in her 13 bouts.\n\nNorwich's Emma Dolan, 27, will challenge vastly experienced IBF super-flyweight champion Irma Garcia for her first world title.

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has indicated the knee injury that scuppered Jean-Philippe Mateta's planned move to AC Milan could also thwart the striker's \"dream\" of playing at the World Cup.\n\nMateta was on the verge of joining Milan for £30m on deadline day, but the deal was called off after knee issues emerged over the course of two medical examinations.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been dealing with the injury to his right knee during the first half of the season.\n\n\"We knew and he knew there was an issue. He was not really pleased,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"We took a higher risk, that's why he could play in most games, but we rested him for some games and some training sessions.\n\n\"To be honest it was not a big surprise to everyone that he could fail [the medical]. We knew that this can happen and he knew it.\"\n\nFrance international Mateta has yet to decide what his next steps should be, with this summer's World Cup on his mind.\n\n\"There are two ways we can do this: manage the knee like we have until after the World Cup, which is Mateta's dream to play in. The other one is he undergoes surgery,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"We don't know how long he would be out. There are a few predictions: it could be two months, three months, six to nine months. There are many opinions, but it is about doing the right thing and we will decide next week.\"\n\nMateta ruptured his meniscus in 2019 when playing for Mainz and spent about six months on the sidelines following surgery. A similar absence this time would end his World Cup hopes, with the tournament just four months away.\n\nMateta faces uncertain future for club and country\n\nPalace criticised over collapse of move for McNeil\n\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\n\nDespite retaining Mateta, who is Palace's top scorer with eight league goals this season, the Eagles paid a club record fee to sign striker Jorgen Strand Larsen from Wolves.\n\nPalace were also on the verge of bringing in Everton winger Dwight McNeil until the deal fell through late on deadline day.\n\nGlasner said he had \"learned to accept situations\" after Palace were also unsuccessful in finding a replacement for captain and centre-back Marc Guehi, who joined Manchester City earlier in the window.\n\n\"At the end of it, the club tried everything with huge offers and huge bids for a Marc Guehi replacement, but clubs said they don't sell on deadline day,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"Credit to the club that without getting any money for Mateta they still spent a big fee on Strand Larsen.\n\n\"On the other side, McNeil was the last one we thought we could finalise, but in the last minutes the terms of the deal changed again and the deal failed. I expected him and planned for him in the next day's training.\"\n\nMcNeil's partner, Megan Sharpley, criticised Crystal Palace on social media for the way they handled the situation.\n\nEverton boss David Moyes said the breakdown had \"nothing to do\" with his club and insists McNeil is \"fine\".\n\n\"He's in and he's training as well, so Dwight's OK,\" Moyes said.\n\n\"We understand exactly where it went wrong, how it broke down. He knows everything about it and there's no problems there.\n\n\"We had given permission for Dwight to go and have a medical and do all of the things required for it, so it was very hard to do much more than we have done.\"\n\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "With much of the cricketing world apathetic towards this T20 World Cup, England captain Harry Brook and coach Brendon McCullum need it more than most.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-nine days since Sydney and the final ball of the Ashes - barely enough time for some of England's players to return home.\n\nControversy has made no attempt to return to its box over the weeks that have passed. One positive for England is they are not alone in struggling to keep it in check.\n\nAhead stands a World Cup - the 10th in the T20 format and fourth since the Covid-19 pandemic - which few seem to want but one plenty, captain Harry Brook, coach Brendon McCullum and their England team included, need.\n\nThe cricket, which begins on Saturday with Scotland and India among those in action, will be entertaining over the next four weeks, make no mistake.\n\nWatching this sport in India, especially when the home team are involved, is one of the game's thrills.\n\nSri Lanka will offer plenty as co-hosts too and the expansion to 20 teams, which this time allows Italy to make their major tournament bow, was one of the triumphs of the 2024 edition in the Caribbean.\n\nBut this tournament begins under the darkest of clouds.\n\nBangladesh have decided not to be there. Unless there is a late change of heart, Pakistan are not going to play India in Sri Lanka under instruction from their government.\n\nEight months ago, South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen and West Indies' Nicholas Pooran, two of the best and most sought-after batters in the T20 game, called time on their international careers.\n\nAged 33 and 29 respectively, they opted for the franchise world.\n\nWould that happen so close to a major tournament if the draw of a World Cup was as strong as it once was?\n\nA factor in these issues is, in part at least, the oversaturation of cricket's major events.\n\nAdd in the 50-over World Cup in 2023, last year's Champions Trophy and four women's World Cups, there have been 10 such tournaments in little over four years.\n\nBut the wider mess, one absorbing an increasing amount of the subcontinent and which will threaten the future stability of the sport if not resolved, is a result of years of weak management.\n\nPolitical posturing has not crept into cricket slowly over the past three months.\n\nIt has stamped all over it for a decade, all while the International Cricket Council stood and watched.\n\nIndia played the Champions Trophy in Dubai rather than Pakistan as scheduled – an issue predictable from the moment the hosts were selected.\n\nBangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman was then removed from the Indian Premier League without explanation at the start of the year, kicking off this latest crisis.\n\nThe easiest option has been taken at every turn. This is the result.\n\nTrends and tactics to look for at 2026 T20 World Cup\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?\n\nEngland's issues may not run so deep, but they are no less pressing.\n\nThe talk of the past four weeks has been of nights out, clockings and identifying who was in a New Zealand nightclub and who was not.\n\nWhat happened in Wellington is English cricket's latest drama.\n\nThe controversies also overshadowed an impressive two-week tour of the Indian Ocean.\n\nThey were asked to be smarter after the Ashes and clinched the subsequent T20 series by winning on a road, before sealing a 3-0 whitewash on a slow turner - all in conditions in which they will play their entire Super 8 phase, should they progress through the initial stage of this World Cup.\n\nYet the narrative has remained focused on Brook.\n\nMcCullum said this week his captain's escapades in New Zealand have been spoken about too much. Some supporters may agree.\n\nWhile naive not to expect it to emerge, choosing not to reveal the incident from the start was fair. Brook was punished with a heavy fine in any case.\n\nBut by lying in his apology and those untruths not being immediately corrected afterwards, Brook and England only ensured the spotlight returned to their off-field activities.\n\nThe tight turnaround between the Ashes and World Cup was always one obvious stumbling block for those who would have already sacked Brook and McCullum.\n\nThere was no time for another coach to be found, but after this there are three months before England's men play again - plenty of time for replacement feet to get under the table if results are poor again.\n\nOf course, there is a scenario where McCullum simply sees the break as the time to walk away - though he maintained his desire to stay on earlier this week.\n\nThe New Zealander's takeaway from his only previous white-ball tournament in charge of England - when his side exited the Champions Trophy without winning a match - was that the players cared too much.\n\n\"If anything they are too harsh on themselves,\" he said. \"They need to be able to give themselves a break and be able to let go a little bit so all of that talent can come out.\"\n\nNavigating that, given the scrutiny around a perceived relaxed, care-free environment and his bosses' wish for change, appears a difficult challenge.\n\nFor McCullum and Brook, reaching the semi-finals in the first week of March is the minimum requirement. Having won 10 of their past 11 completed T20s, they should be capable.\n\nDoing so in 2024 was not enough to save the job of McCullum's predecessor as white-ball coach, Australian Matthew Mott, so much will also be about how England play.\n\nWill they, unlike in the Caribbean, truly challenge the best?\n\nThey have been billed as serious contenders once this winter and failed miserably.\n\nWhether to secure futures or merely change the narrative, England must hope those 29 days since Sydney have provided the time to ensure they do not do so again.\n\nTop run-scorer, wicket-taker and champion - T20 World Cup predictions\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola defended his stance of speaking up about global conflicts by asking, \"why should I not express what I feel, just because I am a manager?\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Manchester City boss said he wants to use his position to \"speak up to be a better society\" as he talked at a football news conference about the \"hurt\" he feels for victims of global conflict.\n\nGuardiola received both praise and criticism for his passionate words, with Jewish community leaders advising the Spaniard to \"focus on football\" and \"be more careful in his future language\".\n\nBut the 55-year-old did not back down when asked to respond to those comments by BBC Sport, saying: \"To be honest, I didn't say anything special. I don't feel that.\"\n\nLast week, Guardiola gave a speech in support of Palestinian children at a charity event in his home city of Barcelona.\n\nHe used the news conference before Manchester City's Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Newcastle to speak about children being killed and injured in conflict zones across the world, saying the footage he sees \"hurts me\".\n\nHe referenced conflicts in Palestine, Ukraine, Sudan and even recent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the United States.\n\nThe Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester & Region said Manchester City have been \"let down\" by Guardiola \"repeatedly straying into commentary on international affairs\".\n\nSpeaking in his news conference before Sunday's Premier League game at Liverpool, Guardiola said: \"Why should I not express what I feel, just because I am a manager? I don't agree but I respect absolutely all opinions.\n\n\"What I said basically is how many conflicts are there right now all around the world? How many? A lot - I condemn all of them.\n\n\"If innocent people are [being] killed, I condemn them all and not putting a selection on one being [more] important than the other - not this country is [more important] than the other one.\n\n\"If you don't understand my message it's fine. I cannot say otherwise.\"\n\nAsked whether he will now stick to speaking about football, Guardiola replied: \"OK you focus on being a journalist and you cannot talk about the economy, because you are not an economic journalist.\n\n\"[Being] involved in football, don't talk about that or that or that. That's why the world remains silent, that is what the world wants, right? Be silent, don't say anything.\n\n\"I think it is completely the opposite but anyway, it is what it is.\"",

    "fullText": "Nintendo’s monster-collecting franchise was pilloried as a ‘pestilential Ponzi scheme’ in the 90s. But as its celebrates its 30th birthday, it now stands as a powerful example of video games’ ability to connect people\n\nWhen I was 11, it was my dream to compete in the Pokémon World Championships, held in Sydney in 2000. I’d come across it in a magazine, and then earnestly set about training teams of creatures, transferring them between my Pokémon Red Game Boy cartridge and the 3D arenas of Pokémon Stadium on the Nintendo 64. I never made it as a player but I did finally achieve this dream on my 26th birthday, when I went to Washington DC to cover the world championships as a journalist. I was deeply moved. Presided over by a giant inflatable Pikachu hanging from the ceiling, the competitors and spectators were united in an unselfconscious love for these games, with their colourful menageries and heartfelt messaging about trust, friendship and hard work.\n\nIt is emotional to see the winners lift their trophies after a tense final round of battles, as overwhelmed by their success as any sportsperson. But it’s the pride that the smaller competitors’ parents show in their mini champions that really gets to me. During the first wave of Pokémania in the late 90s, Pokémon was viewed with suspicion by most adults. Now that the first generation of Pokémaniacs have grown up, even becoming parents ourselves, we see it for what it is: an imaginative, challenging and really rather wholesome series of games that rewards every hour that children devote to it.\n\nOver the three decades since the original Red and Blue (or Green, in Asia) versions of the video game were released in Japan in 1996, Pokémon has earned a place among the greats of children’s fiction. Like Harry Potter, the Famous Five and Narnia, it offers a powerful fantasy of self-determination, set in a world almost totally free of adult supervision. In every game, your mother sends you out into the world with a rucksack and a kiss goodbye; after that, it’s all on you.\n\nLike The Simpsons, Pokémon is a kind of cultural shorthand for the millennial generation. More than Mario, Zelda or any other Nintendo creation, Pokémon brings people together. It was designed from the beginning to be a social game, encouraging (and indeed necessitating) that players traded and battled with each other to complete their collection of virtual creatures and train their teams up into super-squads. Today, the internet has entirely normalised the idea of video games as social activities, but in the late 90s this was a novel idea. You can’t play Pokémon without other people: in 1999, that meant huddling in the playground, using a cable to link your Game Boys together; later, in 2016, at the height of the Pokémon Go phenomenon, it meant hundreds of people converging improbably at the same park with their phones to catch a Gengar.\n\nPokémon is often thought of as a turn-of-the-century fad, so it might be surprising to learn that it brings in more money now than it ever did at the height of its first wave of popularity. It has become the highest-grossing entertainment franchise of all time: between the TV series, the merchandise, the trading cards, the games and everything else adorned with the adorable faces of Pikachu and pals, the franchise has brought in north of $100bn, more than Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThis global phenomenon has its roots in Machida, a city on the outskirts of Tokyo, where Pokémon’s creator Satoshi Tajiri was born in 1965. Like many Japanese children in the 60s and 70s, little Satoshi collected bugs, becoming such an expert that his elementary school classmates referred to him as Dr Bug. As a teenager a new obsession arrived: video games, then just making their way into Japanese arcades. His enthusiasm was such that he started putting together a monthly zine, with his friend Ken Sugimori, called Game Freak – later the name of the video game development company they founded together, which still adorns the title screens of modern Pokémon games.\n\nThe idea for Pokémon began to percolate for Tajiri around 1990. Watching people link their Game Boys together with cables to play Tetris, the hit puzzle game, he envisioned the bugs he’d collected crawling between the consoles. But it took six long years for this idea to transform into a monochrome world full of 151 collectible critters, in chunky black Game Boy pixels. During this time the developer nearly went bust several times, taking on projects for Nintendo and other game developers to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salary.\n\nPokémon’s astronomical success wasn’t instant, but the result of slow-burning sales over years. When it eventually came out in 1996, Pocket Monsters Red and Green – as they were known in Japan – were indie underdogs, made by a tiny team with limited technology for the ageing handheld Game Boy console. Nobody expected it to be much of a hit, but the world of Pokémon Blue has an unexpected sense of place that transcends their technical limitations. The symbiotic relationship between humans, nature and Pokémon permeates every aspect of life, and is often quite touching – particularly at in-game locations such as Lavender Town, where the mourning owners of dead Pokémon come to honour them at a giant commemorative tower.\n\nBut the real marketable genius of Pokémon was the fact that the game came in different versions. The reason that Pokémon games always come in pairs is that different monsters reside in each cartridge. If you want to collect them all, to complete your Pokédex field guide, you need to trade them. Creatures could be sent between cartridges, so friends with different versions of the game could help each other accumulate covetable creatures. With Tetris, the Game Boy’s link cable was used for competition. Here it was used for connection.\n\nPokémon’s popularity spread through playground word-of-mouth. By the time it arrived in the US in 1998, and Europe in 1999, it was already a franchise: Pikachu-adorned games, TV shows, toys, films and lunchboxes, were rolled out carefully by marketers with a proven playbook.\n\nToday, Tajiri is a reclusive figure. Almost everything we know about him comes from a single 1999 interview with Time magazine. The tone of Time’s piece is shockingly dismissive. Declaring the series “a pestilential Ponzi scheme” it describes the “delinquent” and “criminal” behaviour of young Pokémon fans, and the moral bankruptcy of the whole craze – which, it comforts, is likely to peter out soon, like it did for the Power Rangers.\n\nNow that Pokémon has become one of the most enduring and successful entertainment properties of all time, this alarmist attitude seems ridiculous. But the scaremongering was very real. Some of this was simply older people failing to understand the new thing that the kids were into. But there was also an alarmingly xenophobic flavour to the moral panic, this scary Japanese thing with its sinister monsters coming over the seas to captivate children. Christian pastors in the US were proclaiming Pikachu to be a demon. There were movements to ban the TV show from airing.\n\nPerhaps understandably, given the disrespectful and, presumably, hurtful tone of that Time interview, and the moral panic that Pokémania unwittingly ignited, Satoshi Tajiri has shunned the limelight ever since. Now 60, he remains at Game Freak and is still involved in the creation of each new Pokémon game (as of 2025, there are 38 in total), though he reportedly stepped back from day-to-day development in 2012.\n\nJuly 2016 saw the launch of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that quickly became the most popular in US history, with 232 million players across the world. Pokémon Go works kind of like magic. With the app open, you walk around your neighbourhood; on your phone screen, you see a map of your real surroundings, with icons showing where Pokémon might be found. When you encounter a creature it is superimposed on your real surroundings, a Gengar posing casually in your local park. From there you simply flick a Pokéball at the creatures to capture them.\n\nThere’s a unique aspect too to Pokémon Go that makes it different to every other video game-related phenomenon I’ve witnessed. Most of the time when we talk about how games can help people through hard times, we talk about escapism: how virtual worlds can be a reprieve from the problems of the real one. But Pokémon Go was not so much about escapism as connection, a continuation of the lineage of those first games decades before.\n\nAt its height, it connected its players with their local area and the people around them. For a few months, there we were, all looking at our surroundings through a different lens, thinking that there might be a little bit of magic out there in the world, like a bug hiding under a rock.\n\nDr Bug may not be as involved as before, but the pastoral nature he instilled in Pokémon has persisted throughout the last 30 years: the interrelationships between people and Pokémon form the touching core of the games, movies and TV shows, and there is even a quasi-environmentalist bent to its stories. This is, after all, a game about evolution and living in harmony with the natural world. There is a resonance with nature that prevents this $100bn franchise from feeling nakedly cynical or exploitative. Pokémon’s story speaks to an important truth about video games: they are a powerful vector for connection between people. Millions are united by these imaginary creatures, born from one boy’s love of the natural world.\n\nSuper Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun by Keza MacDonald is published by Guardian Faber.

    "fullText": "Several Italy internationals moved clubs during the January transfer window, but which ones will be hoping to earn more regular minutes ahead of a potential World Cup campaign in the summer of 2026?\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – JANUARY 25: Giacomo Raspdori of Atalanta celebrates scoring his team’s third goal with teammate Nikola Krstovic of Atalanta during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and Parma Calcio 1913 at Gewiss Stadium on January 25, 2026 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nGiacomo Raspadori is back in Serie A after a short-lived, six-month spell in LaLiga with Atletico Madrid. The two-time Scudetto winner struggled to break into Diego Simeone’s first-team plans in the Spanish capital and was limited to just one start from a possible 18 league matches prior to his joining Atalanta.\n\nRaspadori has already featured in two Serie A matches for Atalanta, starting and scoring in their most recent match against Pisa, which ended in a resounding 4-0 victory for La Dea.\n\nHe has already been a regular in Gennaro Gattuso’s Italy national team squad and now just needs a consistent run of games before becoming a sure-fire pick for the 2026 World Cup squad assuming that Italy qualify.\n\nOfficial: Lorenzo Lucca joins Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy from Napoli (picture: www.nottinghamforest.co.uk)\n\nIt had been a disappointing season at Napoli for the towering centre-forward, who has since joined Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy.\n\nNapoli brought in both Lucca and Rasmus Hojlund to strengthen their options at centre-forward over the summer, but even after a serious injury to Romelu Lukaku the week before the season began, Lucca was limited to just four starts in Serie A and none since the end of October.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Lucca will become a regular starter in the Premier League under Sean Dyche, but if he is given regular minutes, he will certainly be an option for Gattuso to consider in Italy’s slightly understocked centre-forward department.\n\nDaniel Maldini wears the Lazio jersey\n\nAnother attacker hoping to impress ahead of the World Cup is Daniel Maldini, who joined Lazio on loan with a potential obligation to buy from Atalanta during the January window.\n\nThe son of Italy legend Paolo Maldini was limited to just three Serie A starts with Atalanta during the first half of the season, but looks set to be handed more consistent opportunities under Maurizio Sarri at the Stadio Olimpico.\n\nThere have even been suggestions that Sarri could look to deploy Maldini as a false nine.\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – JANUARY 27: Marco Brescianini of ACF Fiorentina battles for the ball with Nico Paz of Como 1907 during the Coppa Italia match between of ACF Fiorentina and of Como 1907 at Stadio Artemio Franchi on January 27, 2026 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images)\n\nAnother Italy international who left Atalanta in January was Brescianini, who has joined Fiorentina on loan with an option and potential obligation to buy.\n\nBrescianini has already earned more minutes over his first four games with Fiorentina than he had done in his last four months with Atalanta, earning his first league start since October during La Viola’s recent 2-1 loss against Napoli.\n\nBrescianini still faces a difficult task to break into the Italy midfield department with stiff competition from the likes of Nicolo Barella, Sandro Tonali, Manuel Locatelli, Davide Frattesi, Bryan Cristante and Samuele Ricci.\n\nOfficial: Diego Coppola joins Paris FC from Brighton & Hove Albion (@Diegocoppolass via Instagram)\n\nDiego Coppola has taken the decision to move away from the Premier League after six months on the south coast with Brighton and Hove Albion. He had to wait until December to earn his first starts in the English top flight, and has since joined Paris FC on loan, where he will team up with fellow Italy representatives Ciro Immobile and Luca Koleosho.\n\nCoppola has two Italy caps to his name at the age of 22, and will be hoping for more regular minutes in Ligue 1 to challenge the likes of Alessandro Bastoni, Alessandro Buongiorno, Riccardo Calafiori and Gianluca Mancini for a spot in a potential World Cup squad.",

    "description": "The new A380 business class is an example of how Lufthansa is keeping the world's largest passenger plane competitive amid widebody shortages.",
    "fullText": "Lufthansa is doubling down on a jet that many thought was history.\n\nThe German flag carrier announced Friday that it will install a new business-class cabin on all eight of its Airbus A380 superjumbos as part of its broader multibillion-dollar fleet renewal.\n\nAirlines are racing to meet growing demand for high-dollar premium experiences on long-haul flights. The new A380 business class will deliver an upgrade over the current layout, with more space, modern technology, and aisle access for all passengers.\n\nHowever, it will not be part of Allegris, Lufthansa's new signature economy and premium cabins rolling out across its old Boeing 747-8s and newly delivered Boeing 787s and Airbus A350s.\n\nLufthansa said the A380 seat, from manufacturer Thompson Aero, was chosen strategically because it is already certified for the jet type. Allegris is not, and using it would require a separate, lengthy certification process.\n\nThat means Lufthansa can quickly retrofit the A380 planes and get them back in the air. The project is expected to start in February, with the first refreshed jet returning to service in April.\n\nThe move comes as airlines face delayed deliveries of next-generation widebodies — particularly the Airbus A350-1000 and the yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777X — creating a crunch in long-haul, money-making capacity.\n\nA company spokesperson told Business Insider that Lufthansa's A380 refurbishment was planned well in advance and isn't a direct response to shifting delivery timelines.\n\n\"Lufthansa is investing in an aircraft that has already been in scheduled service for several years,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, we always want to offer our guests a modern and high-quality cabin product.\"\n\nStill, Lufthansa has repeatedly delayed retiring its A380s.\n\nIt considered ditching the jet after COVID halted travel (six aircraft were permanently removed from the fleet), but a strong post-pandemic rebound brought some planes back from storage and pushed the retirement of the remaining A380s to 2026.\n\nIt now has at least another five years. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said in October 2025 that the A380s will continue flying into the early 2030s as the airline awaits new widebodies.\n\nLufthansa is the expected launch customer for Boeing's 777X, now expected to be at least seven years late in 2027 due to production and certification issues. The airline has also faced delivery delays for the 787 and A350.\n\nCarriers like Dubai-based Emirates, Australian flag carrier Qantas, and British Airways are similarly keeping older planes flying longer as they await new planes — including refurbishing the A380 with expensive new economy and premium cabins.\n\nData from the aviation analytics firm Cirium shows roughly 91,500 A380 flights are scheduled for 2026, about 1,500 more than in 2025. That uptick comes after the number of A380 flights plunged from about 120,000 in 2019 to just under 14,000 in 2021.\n\nThis increase comes despite the A380's inefficiencies. Its four fuel-hungry engines make it costly to operate, its size limits the number of airports it can serve, and its roughly 500 seats are challenging to consistently fill. While a few ultra-high-demand routes can justify the capacity, it doesn't work across an entire network.\n\nAirlines are also increasingly favoring smaller, more flexible twin-engine widebodies that can better adjust to fluctuating demand and efficiently serve both point-to-point routes — nonstops that don't go through a mega hub — and traditional hub-and-spoke networks.\n\nAirbus ultimately ended A380 production in 2021.\n\nLufthansa's A380s presently feature a 2-2-2 business-class layout, which forces window-seat passengers to climb over a neighbor to reach the aisle — a frustration for travelers paying a premium for privacy and flexibility beyond what economy offers.\n\nRenderings show the new cabin will switch to a 1-2-1 layout, giving every passenger direct aisle access. The design also adds Bluetooth connectivity, privacy partitions, and a lie-flat bed longer than six feet when the seat is fully reclined.\n\nOnce retrofitted, the A380 will feature eight seats in first class, 68 in business, 52 in premium economy, and 371 in regular coach.\n\nThe cabin won't have sliding doors, double beds, or big front-row suites — features that have become increasingly popular across the industry and are included on certain Allegris seats.\n\nThat added complexity, however, has slowed Allegris' rollout. The cabin includes multiple seat types and configurations within a single aircraft and has not yet been certified for the 787.\n\nAs a result, some Dreamliners are currently flying with business-class seats blocked from sale while Lufthansa awaits regulatory approval, limiting premium-cabin capacity and revenue.",

    "fullText": "It is almost time for the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nIndia head into the tournament as defending champions following their success in the Caribbean and United States in 2024.\n\nThey are strong favourites in their home conditions - but the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket makes for an exciting tournament.\n\nHere is a full guide to the 10th edition of the men's 20-over global showpiece.\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup starts on 7 February at 05:30 GMT with Pakistan facing the Netherlands in Colombo.\n\nIt is one of three games on the opening day, with the West Indies v Scotland at 09:30 and India v USA at 15:30.\n\nThe initial 20-team group stage, that sees four groups of five, continues until 20 February, with three games every day at the same times as above, bar the final day when there is just one game at 13:30.\n\nThe Super 8s follow with one or two games a day at 09:30 and 13:30, before the semi-finals across 4 and 5 March.\n\nThe final is on Sunday, 8 March at 13:30 BST in Ahmedabad.\n\nFull T20 World Cup fixture list including start times and venues\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup follows the same format as 2024, which was the tournament's biggest with 20 sides taking part.\n\nAll of the teams are involved from the off in an initial group stage, with each side playing four games and the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nThe Super 8s, which will take place across India and Sri Lanka, will consist of two groups of four, with eight sides seeded to help with the planning and schedule.\n\nThose eight sides are: Australia, India, South Africa, West Indies (Group 1) and England, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Group 2).\n\nShould those sides progress they will go into their respective group based on their seeding, rather than their finishing position in the initial group phase.\n\nIn the Super 8s, the top two teams progress to the semi-finals with the winner of each group facing the runner-up in the other.\n\nThroughout both phases teams are awarded two points for a win, one for a no result and zero for a loss. There's no ties in T20 cricket - more on that below!\n\nAll 12 Test-playing nations have qualified for the tournament after Zimbabwe came through their qualifying stage.\n\nItaly are the only tournament debutants, while Canada are at their first global tournament since 2014.\n\nScotland were a late replacement for Bangladesh, who pulled out of the tournament after the governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), refused to meet their request to play their matches in Sri Lanka rather than India due to safety concerns amid rising tensions between the two countries.\n\nScotland, who were the highest-ranked side to not qualify, took Bangladesh's place in Group C and will fulfill their fixtures as scheduled.\n\nPakistan also considered a full boycott, but their government has decided it can play in the tournament, apart from the game against India on 15 February. The impact of that decision is yet to be communicated by the ICC.\n\nThey will play their games in Sri Lanka as part of an agreement reached in 2024 around India and Pakistan matches not being played in the other country.\n\nThe 20 sides are split into the following four groups in the initial phase:\n\nGroup A: India (X1), Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan (Y3), USA\n\nGroup B: Australia (X2), Ireland, Oman, Sri Lanka (Y4), Zimbabwe\n\nGroup C: England (Y1), Italy, Nepal, Scotland, West Indies (X3)\n\nGroup D: Afghanistan, Canada, New Zealand (Y2), South Africa (X4), United Arab Emirates\n\nFull squad lists for the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup\n\nA total of eight venues are being used - five in India and three in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn India, Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad and Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi will host games.\n\nR Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground - both in Colombo - and Pallekele Cricket Stadium put on matches in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Narendra Modi Stadium, which holds 132,000 fans and is the biggest cricket venue in the world, is due to host the final, unless Pakistan qualify, with the game then moved to Colombo.\n\nThe tournament is played in a T20 format, so both teams will face 20 overs unless they are bowled out beforehand or the team batting second reaches their target before then.\n\nEach innings will start with a six-over powerplay and there are different fielding restrictions in that phase.\n\nMatches should last three hours and 10 minutes, with each innings allocated one hour and 25 minutes and separated by a 20-minute interval.\n\nIn limited-overs cricket there is a 'stop-clock' meaning the bowling side must be ready to bowl each over within 60 seconds of the previous one finishing.\n\nEach side will be allowed two unsuccessful reviews per innings.\n\nShould the number of runs scored by each team be level after 20 overs, the match will go to a super over (each team will face six balls - highest score wins). If that finishes a tie then super overs will continue to be played until a winner is found.\n\nIn the two group phases a minimum of five overs per side must be played to constitute a result, but that rises to 10 overs in the semi-finals and final.\n\nIf a match is halted after that point due to weather conditions then DLS (Duckworth Lewis Stern method) will be used to decide the winner.\n\nThe ICC are yet to publish playing conditions around reserve days and extra time allocated to the knockout matches.\n\nIf Pakistan reach the semi-finals, Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium will replace Kolkata as the venue for the first semi-final, while the final would also move if Pakistan qualify.\n\nIf India make the last four and face any side that is not Pakistan, they will play in the second semi-final in Mumbai on 5 March.\n\nGlossary of cricket terms including DLS and powerplay\n\nThere have been six winners of the nine Men's T20 World Cups. They are:\n\nThere will be ball-by-ball commentary of all 55 matches across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nOur commentary team includes Henry Moeran, Prakash Wakankar, Aatif Nawaz, Daniel Norcross, Simon Mann, Nikesh Rughani, Kevin Howells and Melissa Story.\n\nExpert analysis will come from multiple Ashes winner Steven Finn, World Cup winner Alex Hartley, T20 World Cup champion Dawid Malan, Scotland and England T20 World Cup spinner Kirstie Gordon, former Ireland wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien and Big Bash winner Michael Carberry.\n\nThe BBC Sport website and app will have live text commentary on selected group-stage matches then every match from the Super 8s onwards.\n\nThere will be daily reports and score updates alongside in-play and post-match video highlights, alongside regular coverage on the BBC Cricket Instagram, external account.\n\nThe tournament is available to watch live in the UK on Sky Sports.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Under-19 World Cup, final, Harare\n\nIndia 411-9 (50.0 overs): Suryavanshi 175 (80); Minto 3-63\n\nIndia teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi made a stunning 175 from just 80 balls in the Under-19 World Cup final against England.\n\nThe 14-year-old hammered 15 sixes and 15 fours at a strike rate of 218.75 during a brutal and breathtaking knock at the Harare Sports Club in Zimbabwe.\n\nHe scored 24 off his first 24 balls, meaning his last 151 runs came off just 56 deliveries.\n\nSuryavanshi's 126-minute stay at the crease was eventually ended by England seamer Manny Lumsden in the 26th over to leave India 251-3.\n\nLumsden took pace off the ball and Suryavanshi gloved an attempted slog sweep to England captain and wicketkeeper Thomas Rew.\n\nA number of England's players shook Suryavanshi's hand as he left the field in recognition of the brilliance of his innings.\n\nIndia finished on 411-9 from their 50 overs - the fifth highest total in U19 World Cup history and a record for a final eclipsing the 253-7 made by Australia against India in the 2024 final.\n\nSuryavanshi's score took his World Cup tally to 439 runs in seven innings at 62.71 - four runs clear of Afghanistan's Faisal Khan as the tournament's leading run-scorer.\n\nSome other notable statistics from Suryavanshi's innings:\n\nIt was the highest score in an Under-19 World Cup final, beating Unmukt Chand's 111* for India in the 2012 final against Australia.\n\nThe innings gives him the ninth highest score in the history of youth ODIs. South Africa's Jorich van Schalkwyk (215 vs Zimbabwe) is the only player to make a double century.\n\nIt was the sixth-highest individual score in the history of all matches played at U19 World Cups.\n\nHis knock included the record for most sixes (15) in a youth ODI innings, beating his own record of 14 against the United Arab Emirates at last year's U19 Asia Cup.\n\nHis 15 sixes is the highest number in an Under-19 World Cup innings. Only two other players have managed double digits.\n\nThe century off 55 balls is the second fastest in U19 World Cups, behind Will Malajczuk's 51-ball hundred for Australia against Japan earlier in this year's tournament\n\nIt is the latest achievement for Suryavanshi, who shot to global fame in April last year when he smashed his first ball in the Indian Premier League for six.\n\nHe then became the youngest player to hit a century in men's T20s when he made a 35-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans.\n\nIt was also the second-fastest century in IPL history, behind Chris Gayle's 30-ball ton in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, he struck what was then the fastest recorded century in a youth ODI, making 143 from 78 balls as India beat England by 55 runs at Worcester.\n\nHe took 52 balls to reach three figures, bettering Kamran Ghulam's 53-ball effort for Pakistan against England in 2013.\n\nFour months later, he struck a 32-ball century in India A's victory against the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup Rising Stars T20 match. He was eventually dismissed for 144 from 42 balls.\n\nListen to ball-by-ball commentary of the final on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Shovelling snow, finding childcare and a frenetic scramble for plane tickets.\n\nIt's been an unexpectedly stressful few weeks for Scotland's cricketers, who were thrust into action by Bangladesh's decision to boycott the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Scots were called up by the International Cricket Council (ICC) by virtue of being the highest-ranked team not already at the tournament, but the players were finding out as everyone else was - via social media and news outlets.\n\n\"It was just so many screenshots of Bangladeshi journalists and all these tweets,\" Scotland spinner Mark Watt told the BBC's No Balls: The Cricket Podcast.\n\n\"All the boys were just flying round saying 'is this true? Is this going to be happening?'\n\n\"It was like that scene in The Office - 'it's happening, it's happening, stay calm'. Cricket Scotland have done really well to get to organise everything so quickly and getting everyone out to India so quickly.\"\n\nNo Balls: Watt's this? Scotland at the T20 World Cup?\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nNo sponsor, kit on order & visa wait - Scotland embrace late World Cup call\n\nScotland had failed to reach the World Cup because of a hugely disappointing qualifying campaign in the Netherlands last summer, which included defeats by Italy and Jersey.\n\n\"It's so surreal,\" Watt said. \"I did a chat at a local club and they were saying, 'what are you going to do when the World Cup's on?' And I was like, 'I'm not even going to watch any games because I'm still so gutted that we're not playing in it'.\"\n\nInstead of prepping for subcontinental conditions, players based in Scotland were undergoing fitness programmes and going about their day-to-day lives when the news started to filter through.\n\n\"[Michael Leask] lives in Aberdeen and he was shovelling snow as we were getting all these calls,\" Watt said.\n\n\"We were doing boxing and between sets we're saying 'do you think we're actually going to go?'\n\n\"Not a lot of cricket was going on, it was other things. [Matthew] Cross is trying to build his house at the moment, so he's doing all his DIY.\n\n\"He's been stressed trying to get other people to go in and do the stuff he was going to do.\n\n\"People who have kids were trying to get them minded.\n\n\"I got all my holidays out of the way last year. I was looking forward to a little break, but I'm very happy to be here.\"\n\nThe last-minute nature of Scotland's entry has drawn comparisons to a famous equivalent in the world of football.\n\n\"Everyone keeps saying Denmark [at the Euros] in 1992, because they didn't qualify and won it,\" Watt said. \"Anything's possible. Imagine that?\"\n\nAfter Watt and his team-mates knew they were going to India, they were not sure when they would depart.\n\nFlights were booked in the hope that visas would come through, and when they did the rush to get halfway around the world began.\n\n\"It was like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\" Watt said. \"I got my golden ticket and I was like, 'you need to get me on the flight tonight'.\n\n\"Leasky in Aberdeen had to drive two and a half hours to Edinburgh, he got his visa through the same time as me.\n\n\"We're all so excited and so grateful this opportunity came about, but also feel sorry for Bangladesh on the other side of it.\"\n\nScotland are one of five European sides at the competition and one of nine associate ICC members.\n\nAfter warm-up defeats by Afghanistan and Namibia, they take on West Indies in their opening match on Saturday, before games against Italy, England and Nepal in Group C, with the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nWatt says the prospect of seeing different match-ups can only be a positive.\n\n\"Obviously I've got a bit of favouritism for their associates,\" he said.\n\n\"But I just think the more the merrier. You see these Test-playing nations play against each other so often, it's a little bit samey and I think it's really refreshing when the associates come to play against these big teams.\n\n\"Obviously sometimes the results don't go your way, but it's the only way these teams and ourselves are going to learn how to play against them.\n\n\"So it's a great learning curve, but also, we're not there just to learn, but we're there to beat teams.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The 2026 World Cup is almost upon us.\n\nIndia are defending champions after their 2024 win and have home advantage as co-hosts alongside Sri Lanka.\n\nCan anyone stop them? And who will be the best batters and bowlers?\n\nHere are the Test Match Special team's predictions before it all gets under way on Saturday, 7 February.\n\nFormer England bowler Steven Finn: It is hard to look beyond India, but the romance of South Africa winning after how close they got to winning by reaching the 2024 final is something I would like to see.\n\nI do actually think England are dark horses to win the tournament given how well they played in Sri Lanka and the options they have.\n\nFormer England bowler Alex Hartley: No team has ever won a men's T20 World Cup on home soil, so I'm going India.\n\nFormer England bowler Tymal Mills: India will be tough to beat in their own conditions. Obviously all their players are well-accustomed to playing on those decks, so I'll go with India.\n\nEngland and Scotland bowler Kirstie Gordon: It is probably a popular answer but it is hard to look past India in their own conditions. They look incredibly strong and well balanced. I would love to see South Africa give them a scare.\n\nAs for Scotland, it is hard to say given their lack of preparation time, but they have some excellent players and will be keen to show they deserve to be there.\n\nI think they will beat Italy and Nepal but West Indies and England's firepower could be too big a hurdle.\n\nBBC cricket reporter Henry Moeran: India will be hard to beat at home, and having won the last two global white-ball events will be full of confidence.\n\nBut as we saw in the final of 2023, home pressure can sometimes be a hindrance and so many top players from around the world having Indian Premier League experience means knowledge of conditions perhaps will not be as significant.\n\nSouth Africa could be a threat having broken their hoodoo with the Test Championship win.\n\nTMS commentator Prakash Wakankar: While India will be among the favourites, the pressure will be immense.\n\nI would never write off Australia, and South Africa are really well placed with the variety in their bowling and depth in their batting.\n\nIf pressed, I would go for a repeat of the 2023 50-over final between India and Australia, but hopefully with a different result...\n\nTMS commentator Daniel Norcross: India. It is the obvious choice but that is because India come into this World Cup in formidable form and have home advantage.\n\nIn addition, if their match with Pakistan does not go ahead, they will not only pick up two points without playing a game but will also not have to leave India.\n\nTMS commentator Aatif Nawaz: Though both England and Pakistan are heading into the World Cup with strong form, getting the better of India will be a Herculean task.\n\nBBC cricket writer Matthew Henry: I was all set to try and be clever. Like before the 2023 50-over World Cup in India, Australia have lost their past two series.\n\nAt that World Cup, Australia were without Travis Head for the start. This time Josh Hazlewood was set to miss the opening weeks but now he has been ruled out entirely, they surely have little chance.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nTrends and tactics to look for at 2026 T20 World Cup\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - fixtures\n\nFinn: England's Phil Salt. He has been outstanding in both the IPL and T20 internationals recently. Opening is the best place to bat in India and expect the top run-scorer to bat in the top two.\n\nHartley: Australia's Ashes hero Travis Head. He's become more consistent over the last 18 months and also plays with complete freedom. He does not care about getting out which will help him push the boundaries.\n\nMills: I'll go with South Africa captain Aiden Markram. He's in good form at the moment and he does well in India too.\n\nGordon: India's Abhishek Sharma. He's got a ridiculous strike-rate and has provided so much firepower at the top of the order for India recently. First World Cup. Home conditions. Are the stars aligned?\n\nMoeran: It might be his debut tournament, but Abhishek is a brilliant player and I think he will do some serious damage to bowling attacks.\n\nNorcross: Abhishek. The Indian opener is in frighteningly good form and will have plenty of opportunity to go big on friendly, run-drenched pitches at home in India.\n\nNawaz: Abhishek is the smart bet. He will open for India and doubtless hit sixes for fun. He stands head (sorry Travis!) and shoulders above everyone else in T20 cricket right now.\n\nWakankar: Head is my pick. He is just so dominant in this format. His hand-eye co-ordination is of a different level. He has been top of the pops for Sunrisers Hyderabad consistently in the IPL and knows the conditions really well.\n\nHenry: India captain Suryakumar Yadav scored 242 runs at 80.66 during the recent series win over New Zealand. One thing that could stop him may be the form of others in India's top order denying him enough time at the crease.\n\nHartley: Sherfane Rutherford. He had a great SA20 campaign with 334 runs and a strike-rate of 165. Nothing beats watching a West Indian when they get going.\n\nMills: South Africa's Dewald Brevis, who I played with recently at the SA20.\n\nObviously people know about him, but he probably hasn't really exploded in terms of international cricket just yet. He played some special innings for us.\n\nFinn: So much has been talked about Brevis from a young age and it finally feels like he has come of age. A fantastic SA20 - 370 runs and a strike-rate of 156.11 - should give him confidence.\n\nGordon: I'm going to go for New Zealand's Finn Allen. He's off the back of a great Big Bash campaign for Perth Scorchers, where he was the leading run-scorer with 466 in 11 innings. It seems like his batting has really matured in the last couple of years.\n\nNorcross: Allen is hit and miss, but if he gets going those small grounds in India won't be able to contain his monstrously destructive hitting.\n\nMoeran: Tom Banton of England looked in excellent touch with an unbeaten 54* in the second T20 in Sri Lanka and feels a very different player to his first iteration in the England side back in 2019 and 2020.\n\nHenry: Brevis is a good shout. England have seen what Pathum Nissanka, now sixth in the world T20 rankings, can do in recent weeks.\n\nNawaz: Let's go for someone a little less obvious. Wayne Madsen. Obviously Italy are unlikely to go past the group stage but the 42 year old's storied career feels like it has one more fairytale chapter in it...\n\nFinn: Kuldeep Yadav. He could clean up in the group stage, looking at India's opponents, and wrist spin is always a potent wicket threat as the tournament wears on.\n\nMills: It is hard to look past Jasprit Bumrah, an outstanding bowler across all formats but particularly within T20 and he'll obviously play a huge part in India's claim to winning the title.\n\nGordon: Australia's Nathan Ellis. A highly skilled T20 bowler who can bowl in all phases but is especially strong at the death.\n\nHe often goes under the radar in a top-quality attack but regularly bowls some of the toughest overs.\n\nMoeran: How can we look past Bumrah? He won India the tournament two years ago in the final against South Africa and will again be key. Few bowlers can do what he does, and his overs at the death will be integral.\n\nHartley: I do not like copying my friends but, as they have said, how do you look past Bumrah? I want to pick a spinner and I want that man to be Varun Chakaravarthy but I'm not sure he will play all the games.\n\nNawaz: I'm certain it will be a spinner. There are so many to chose from, but I'll go with Adam Zampa. He was one of Australia's few positives in their 3-0 hammering at the hands of Pakistan.\n\nWakankar: I expect Hardik Pandya to be that person, fitness being the only challenge. He is the key cog in the India team for sure as their main seam-bowling all-rounder.\n\nNorcross: Abrar Ahmed. A left-field pick maybe but hear me out.\n\nPakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka where the pitches have shown strong signs of favouring spin.\n\nThe bespectacled leg-spinner recently had the Australians in a pickle and has a great chance to bag a hatful of wickets in the opening group stage against weaker teams.\n\nHenry: The leading wicket-takers in the past three editions of the IPL have all been seamers. Always improving, always moving the new ball, I'll go with South Africa's Marco Jansen.\n\nHartley: Pakistan's Usman Tariq - not for the amount of wickets he will or won't get but the hype around his controversial bowling action.\n\nFinn: Tariq was relatively unknown until recently. Mystery spinners who burst on to the scene usually have a good first tournament, so I wouldn't be surprised to see him do well.\n\nGordon: Azmatullah Omarzai. I could have picked one of a few bowlers from Afghanistan, who I think could cause an upset in the group of death which also includes South Africa and New Zealand.\n\nA spinner might have been the common choice but Omarzai has been central to them becoming a more balanced team.\n\nMills: Maybe someone like Noor Ahmad from Afghanistan, the left-arm wrist spinner. Obviously all eyes will be on Rashid Khan but Noor is an excellent bowler in his own right as well.\n\nMoeran: South Africa quick Anrich Nortje is in fine form, taking a stack of wickets in the SA20 for Sunrisers Eastern Cape as they won the tournament. He knows the conditions, knows his game and can bowl economical and rapid spells.\n\nWakankar: I have a nagging suspicion it could be someone like Chakravarthy, given the Indian conditions.\n\nHe is deceptive and has a way of picking up wickets. His mystery element still seems to get batters in the key middle part of the innings.\n\nNawaz: Saim Ayub from Pakistan. He has established himself as a genuine all-rounder over the past 12 months and been very effective in the powerplay.\n\nI know it is a big call to go with an opening batter as bowler to watch - but that's how good he's been.\n\nNorcross: Keshav Maharaj. The South African slow left-armer is in the form of his life.\n\nA complete master of his craft, he will be desperate to go one better after South Africa's loss in the final last time around.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.",

    "fullText": "World Skeleton champion Shelley Rudman was the star of Team GB Winter Olympics back in 2006 when she was the only one to return with a medal, creating a fever in her Wiltshire village which is still felt by some today.\n\nAs this year's Winter Olympics kicks off in northern Italy, Rudman said she would never have guessed the lasting legacy that bringing home the silver medal would have on Pewsey, where she was born and still lives.\n\nTwo streets are now named after her, Olympic Road and Silver Road, which she says makes her children very proud.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal, my children love the fact they are named after me,\" Rudman added.\n\nVillagers were invested in her success from the start. They played a key role in fundraising to send her to Turin to compete on the ice, and still proudly remember their involvement.\n\nOne of them being Emma Dainton, who along with Colin Harris, canoed a 35-mile route from Pewsey to Bath along the Kennet and Avon Canal.\n\nEmma said: \"It was so quiet on the canal until a swan chased us for a while, and we joked about it and we cheered each other on.\"\n\nDuring the Games, Emma was travelling in Australia and watched the heats on TV with her fellow backpackers.\n\n\"I told them all about Shelley and how I was part of her fundraising team and she was from my village,\" she added.\n\nBack at home, nothing could prepare landlord Jerry Kunkler for the world's media and fans cramming into his Moonrakers pub.\n\n\"My phone kept ringing and ringing, all the local and national media wanted to come to the pub, it was all happening.\n\n\"I had to get up early for breakfast TV and was able to talk to Shelley live from Turin. It was a whirlwind,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the Games, Shelley was greeted by a champion's welcome when she arrived home.\n\nLocal newspaper reporter Nigel Kerton organised an open-top bus parade to travel through the village.\n\nNigel recalls how he phoned a bus company to see if it was possible.\n\n\"I had a dream for this to happen. You see football teams do it after cup finals, so why not for Shelley.\n\n\"It left the train station and we could see the crowds building. There must have been thousands there,\" he added.\n\nShelley said she was in disbelief when she returned home and saw how many people had turned up to cheer her home.\n\n\"There were so many friends from school I recognised and just people I saw around the village,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she will always feel grateful to those that supported her and the strong community that Pewsey still has today.\n\n\"It is just stunning around here, there's a great community spirit. I always appreciate what they did for me,\" she added.\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "fullText": "“It makes me sad that women’s football is sexualised and disrespected,” read Liverpool midfielder Marie Hobinger’s victim statement. “No woman, no matter her job, should have to put up with this type of behaviour.”\n\nMangal Dalal, 42, contacted Hobinger, 24, via social media before waiting for her at the side of the pitch after Liverpool’s away game against Manchester City in February 2025. He was handed a two-year restraining order and sentenced to 18 months of community service in January after pleading guilty to stalking the Austria international.\n\nThis is only one example that highlights the growing concerns around the safety of Women’s Super League (WSL) footballers. “There is that fear among players that it could happen to anyone,” Fern Whelan, women’s football equality, diversity and inclusion executive for the Professional Footballers’ Association, tells The Athletic.\n\nDuring the 2025 European Championship, England and Gotham defender Jess Carter spoke out about the racist abuse she received on the internet, later telling the BBC she feared leaving the team hotel. A 60-year-old man pleaded guilty to malicious communications in January. Mark Roberts, the national lead for football policing, called the comments “appalling”.\n\nAt the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, when England reached the final, the Lionesses received fan mail from Australia that contained death threats. The UK football policing unit (UKFPU) conducted a joint investigation, including forensics, with Australian police, but as yet, nobody has been charged.\n\nIn January, Arsenal deleted a video on X and turned comments off on Instagram of new signing Smilla Holmberg promoting ticket sales because of inappropriate sexualised and misogynistic comments. Tottenham Hotspur also turned comments off on their X post announcing the arrival of Matilda Nilden, 19, for the same reason. Some of the replies asked X’s artificial intelligence tool Grok to produce sexualised images of the player.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement for Matilda Nildén to join us from BK Häcken in January, 2026 ✍️\n\n🗞️ https://t.co/bLC1QvkmsS pic.twitter.com/xPUfesurS2\n\n— Tottenham Hotspur Women (@SpursWomen) December 31, 2025\n\n“It is really worrying,” says Whelan. “It’s difficult to manage unless it is stopped at source.”\n\nSome players have spoken about their fear of staying in their own homes after receiving rape and death threats online, Whelan told a Women and Equalities Committee held in the UK Parliament in October. Online abuse of women players, she said, has become “alarmingly worse” and “catapulted” since 2024 to the point where it is becoming “dangerous”.\n\nOther areas of concern for players include the control and management of access on matchdays, their safety when off duty, and the amount of contact they have with fans and the general public via social media.\n\nSome player representatives have put preventative measures in place, such as limiting the number of private drivers who can take a player home, to reduce how widely their addresses are known. Another noted that their players expressed no concern at all about their safety.\n\nThe UK’s All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on football has recently launched an inquiry into online harms across the men’s and women’s games. “We are clear that the women’s game faces some specific and heightened risks,” said Fair Game, secretariat to the Football APPG.\n\nThe Athletic has spoken to stakeholders within the game, including WSL Football, which oversees the top two tiers of women’s football in England; data science company Signify; and the PFA and the UKFPU to investigate how safe WSL players feel. The English Football Association was approached for comment, as were all WSL clubs.\n\nIn some incidents detailed below, clubs in question remain anonymous to respect the confidentiality of their security arrangements.\n\nThe message may read: “I know where you park your car”, “I know what car you drive”, or “I know where you live”. Whether genuine or not, such messages force players to judge the level of threat.\n\nWomen’s football is in a period of generational transition. The increased investment and global broadcast exposure have seen a fundamental shift in the game’s profile, especially in England, following the Lionesses’ consecutive European triumphs in 2022 and 2025. All publicity, however, is not good publicity.\n\nHistorically, women’s football has leaned into accessibility — players signing autographs, taking photos and engaging closely with supporters. As the game’s profile has grown, that openness has created tension between connection and safety.\n\n“It is becoming increasingly difficult for elite-level women’s players to embrace fan access to the same levels as has been the case historically,” says Jonathan Sebire, co-founder at Signify, which works across multiple sports and with several WSL clubs to collect, triage and assess the threat online abuse poses to players.\n\nThe majority of online abuse players receive contains sexual elements, according to Signify, including sexualised content of the individual player or their partner. Other categories of online abuse include racist and violent threats, the latter of which often contains a sexualised element. Some abuse, particularly from male online users, centres on the quality of the women’s game, but there is another concern, says Signify, that has increased far more rapidly.\n\n“One of the fundamental differences in the women’s game is there are openly gay players, some of whom are in relationships with other footballers, some of whom are at the same club,” says Sebire.\n\n“We see a large number of young women who look up to these players because of their sexuality. They’re seen as openly gay icons and role models in the sport. It starts with a level of fandom that has sometimes tipped over into fixation, infatuation and developed into something more problematic.”\n\nSuch behaviour is not exclusively linked to sexuality, but most cases known directly to Signify fall into this category.\n\nIn some rare instances, but increasing in occurrence, people have followed players around supermarkets and visited the same bars or restaurants as them. Contact can start online and move offline or vice versa. For example, players have reported people making contact via direct messages online and then seeing them appear in their local surroundings.\n\n“It’s not uncommon,” says Sebire. “If you speak to a group of players, some will almost certainly have experienced it.”\n\nSignify observes that often the behaviour does not involve physical contact or direct interaction. Instead, it centres on attempts to create the appearance of a relationship for others to see — for example, by taking selfies of themselves with players in the background. They then message players later online to suggest a personal connection.\n\n“If they’re doing that every week, that has become an infatuation,” says Sebire. “In most cases, when the club or police warn them and tell them this behaviour is problematic, it stops because they are shocked it has been noticed and received in that way.”\n\nIn other extreme cases, players have suspected a person was tracking their car’s movements, as they appeared wherever the players went. Clubs have sanctioned season-ticket holders, and law enforcement agencies have carried out risk assessments in response.\n\nThe answer, though, is not for women players to simply abstain from social media. “It is not their responsibility; they are just doing their jobs,” says Whelan.\n\nMany women’s players, after all, earn significantly more through off-field commercial deals than via playing contracts. Social media is a critical tool for connecting with fans, building personal profiles, and securing sponsorship income.\n\nIt is also far more likely that women’s players still run their own social media accounts, whereas in the men’s game, certainly among Premier League stars, others tend to manage players’ online profiles. According to Sebire, that is something that needs to and is starting to change.\n\nIt is also very different for a WSL player, who may live a relatively ‘normal’ life, to receive a threatening message than perhaps a Premier League footballer who lives in a house with significant security provisions and perhaps access to a private chef or barber. Premier League clubs also have established onboarding processes for their players, with, for example, security briefings including dedicated services for players’ properties.\n\nThat does not negate the impact of online abuse for a men’s player, but it is important context to consider, even if some WSL players are now household names.\n\n“In some clubs, the infrastructure around women’s teams’ safety is catching up with the men’s game,” says Sebire. “But it has not been universal. Those are fundamentals that have to change for women’s players to feel safe.”\n\nThe nature of the online abuse suffered by women’s players is often different, too. Unlike violent or racist abuse, it does not necessarily fit into a clearly defined category with reporting mechanisms, policies and consequences.\n\nThe Online Safety Act, fully enforced as of 2025, means OFCOM, the UK’s independent regulator for the communications industries, can take action against social media platforms, including removing content or working with law enforcement. But there are nuances to the women’s game that need to be considered.\n\nSome platforms do not recognise a lot of the abuse and threat directed at women because universal language, such as “kitchen” — referring, for example, to the misogynistic phrase ‘Get back in the kitchen’ — is repurposed or not seen as harmful without the necessary context.\n\nThe AI tool Grok is another example. X has now prevented Grok from being used to edit images of real people in revealing clothing after OFCOM launched an investigation in January. The public body Sport England decided to stop using X last month to stay true to its values of the “mission is to ensure sport and physical activity are safe and inclusive for everyone,” it said in a statement. WSL Football had already scaled back its use of X, and some WSL clubs have said they continue to monitor the situation.\n\nAnother growing pain for WSL clubs is the contrast between playing games at the women’s home grounds and the main club’s stadia.\n\nIt is easier for the club to use the same security infrastructure at a Premier League ground when their women’s team plays there, but when switching to smaller grounds, there are different security measures around the pitch, players’ entrance, or car park.\n\n“It’s safer in general to be at the Emirates,” England captain and Arsenal defender Leah Williamson told the New Statesman in December. “You’re more accessible. It’s a five-metre difference (between the players and fans).”\n\nSome players have reported concerns of being repeatedly approached by the same people outside stadiums and hassled as they approach their cars.\n\n“If players make themselves accessible signing autographs in the ground with stewards but are approached once they leave the ground, when do they say: ‘No, this isn’t appropriate?” asks one person. “That feels like an invasion of space.”\n\nSupporter interaction has become increasingly challenging as attendances have increased. WSL Football, WSL clubs and the English Football Association are trying to balance maintaining the game’s unique atmosphere and sense of community while grappling with a rapidly changing landscape.\n\nAhead of the 2024-2025 season, Chelsea changed their player access rules before and after games, citing it was “no longer safe or sustainable” for players to sign autographs or take selfies “in an uncontrolled way”. Many clubs followed suit. Some now have more organised meet-and-greets with season-ticket holders in a controlled environment, while others have close-protection officers pitchside. When on England duty, players walk around the pitch after games but do not stop and sign autographs.\n\n“It would be a shame if it got shut down to the extent that the men’s game has,” says Sebire. “But the risk is there.”\n\nClubs are taking player safety seriously, according to numerous people, and are investing to try to keep players safe. “Everybody is just trying to find a way through,” comments one observer.\n\nWSL Football’s safeguarding standards require that each “club ensures that physical and online environments promote safety and wellbeing while minimising the opportunity for children, adults at risk and players to be harmed and/or exposed to harmful or inappropriate behaviour, materials or content”.\n\nEach club undertakes its own risk assessments and all clubs in the top two leagues have a nominated police officer. WSL Football has its own safety and security working group and regularly engages with the UKFPU and clubs via monthly safety officer meetings.\n\nThe FA and several WSL clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea, London City Lionesses, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, say they have robust security provisions and educational resources. Some employ dedicated safeguarding, player care and close-protection measures, alongside partnerships with external monitoring firms, while others have players escorted at matches and events, administer online safety training, and have formal reporting routes.\n\nThe biggest barrier to prosecution a few years ago was obtaining player statements. “With the national teams, we’ve certainly broken through that,” Chief Constable for Cheshire Police Mark Roberts tells The Athletic.\n\nNow, the UKFPU prepares players by explaining the reporting process proactively, and before tournaments, officers conduct security briefings and education sessions with the England team to offer advice regarding security and online abuse.\n\n“Don’t just delete it, try to keep it,” says Roberts. “We’ll capture it, try to identify the person, ask for a statement, and give the player support. It’s the shock of receiving something and making sure they know what to do. If you debunk the system, hopefully it makes it easier for people to come forward.”\n\nSignify has found that in some of their education sessions, players may understandably find it embarrassing to talk about their experiences, whether it’s the content of the material or that it has affected them. Often, individuals report incidents in private after group sessions.\n\n“If anything is happening in places that no one else can see, tell someone about it because you shouldn’t be dealing with this on your own,” says Sebire. “It’s not OK.”\n\nNikki Doucet, CEO of WSL Football, has spoken with Meta’s global head of safety and the Women’s National Basketball Association about the tools they use. She recently met at UK Parliament with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s Women’s Sport Taskforce, hosted by minister Stephanie Peacock, alongside representatives from OFCOM, the police, and other sports leaders to discuss protections for sportswomen online.\n\n“It is top of the PFA’s agenda, including pushing the clubs to see how we can protect the players better,” says Whelan, adding that online abuse is a “massive barrier” to participation for many young girls and parents.\n\n“It is not football that is the problem; it is the perpetrators behind it all,” she adds. “We have to make sure the people who are looking after the footballers are taking it really seriously. I would hate for it to come to a point where those threats become reality, and then we act.\n\n“Everyone is working hard behind the scenes to find a solution. Clubs are aware of the concerns the players have raised. There is a real shift; players are not going to stand for this. The more we see perpetrators held to account, the more they are emboldened.”\n\nAdditional reporting: Philip Buckingham\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, England, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Global warming means the future of Winter Games “is literally melting away.”\n\nSome of the world’s greatest winter sports athletes have called on the International Olympics Committee to stop taking fossil fuel industry money, including from Italian oil giant ENI, a “Premium Partner” of the 2026 Winter Olympics. “The time has come to question the ethical implications of…normalizing the connections between our sports and the detrimental effects of the product that [fossil fuel companies] sell,” reads a petition delivered yesterday to IOC officials in Milan, Italy, where the Games’ opening ceremony takes place on Friday.\n\nBurning oil, gas, coal, and other fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming, which is raising winter temperatures and reducing the snow cover that skiing and other winter sports require. Winters are rapidly warming across much of the Northern Hemisphere, threatening not only the Olympics but also communities economically and culturally dependent on skiing and other winter recreational activities.\n\nTo date, the petition to the IOC and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation has attracted more than 20,000 signatories, including Alex Hall of the US, who won the Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Games; Helvig Wessel of Norway, the 2024 Freeride World Tour skiing champion; and Nikolai Schirmer, also of Norway, whose nonprofit Ski Fossil Free organized the petition and hand-delivered it to IOC officials on February 4; a full list of signatories is available here.\n\nAlthough neither the IOC nor ENI have yet commented on the petition, the IOC did purchase 2.4 million cubic meters of artificial snow to enable reliable conditions for events taking place in the Italian Alps town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. ENI, which has said it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, announced in December that “90% of the fuels that Eni…will supply to power the Games will be derived from renewable feedstocks.”\n\nFebruary temperatures have warmed by 3.6 degrees Celsius (6.4 degrees Fahrenheit) over the 70 years since Cortina hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1956, according to new research from the scientific nonprofit Climate Central. Cortina now experiences 41 fewer freezing days per year than it did in 1956. Globally, only half of the locations deemed suitable for future Winter Olympics will have reliably cold temperatures by the year 2050, Climate Central found. “Unless we address human-caused climate change and the fossil fuel burning that we’re doing, the possibility of having Winter Olympics is literally melting away,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, a Climate Central scientist who conducted the research, said at a press briefing on January 28 cohosted by Climate Central and Covering Climate Now.\n\n“People in my community aren’t discussing whether or not climate change is real.… it’s very, very apparent when we look at the high mountains,” said Graham Zimmerman, a professional alpinist and director of athletic alliance for the nonprofit Protect Our Winters, which supported the petition drive. Zimmerman and a team were 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) up Pakistan’s K-2, the second-highest peak in the world, when melting snow and ice forced them to shelter in place on a narrow ledge for 14 hours. “It’s an altitude where, generally speaking, you are putting on all of the puffy clothes to stay warm,” he said. “Instead, we found ourselves in temperatures of 42 degrees [F] in the shade, having to take shelter from avalanches and rock fall because the mountain was literally falling apart.”\n\nAlthough amateur climbers, skiers, and snowboarders are not immune to such dangers, the greater risk for them is simply fewer opportunities to enjoy their favorite winter sports. “Climate Central data shows a steady decline in snowfall at nearly two-thirds of monitoring stations” in the United States, Ben Tracy, a climate journalist on assignment for Climate Central, said in a TV report shown during the briefing (and available for TV stations to air free of charge). “For the ski industry, that meltdown means billions in lost revenue.” A resort Tracy visited in Idaho that normally would have 42 ski runs open had only one—and that one was open only because of costly artificial snow.\n\nThat winters are rapidly warming even as bitter cold grips much of the US at the moment may seem counterintuitive to some people (including the nation’s climate-denier in chief), but scientists explain that weather is not the same thing as climate. “In a warming world we’re still going to have cold snaps, they’ll just be less frequent,” Trudeau said. A good way to think about it, she added, is that “weather is [the clothes] you’re wearing today. Climate is the clothes you have in your closet.”\n\nThe unreliability of winters on a warming planet leads Rocky Anderson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, to emphasize the urgency of phasing out fossil fuels. Anderson was the mayor when Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Games, a role it is scheduled to repeat in 2034. But during his interview with Tracy, he pointed to the majestic peaks east of the city and noted, “There’s almost no snow anywhere in those mountains,” adding, “I don’t think we’re going to see a Winter Olympic Games in Utah in 2034.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

For the first five years of his career, Urquidy was a valuable depth piece for an Astros team that went to three World Series in four years. His best season came in 2022 when he went 13-8 with a 3.94 ERA in 164.1 innings. In 2023, Urquidy developed an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery. He last pitched for the Astros on September 29 of that season.\n\nAfter spending the 2024 season on the sidelines, Erquidy signed with the Detroit Tigers for the 2025 campaign. He only made two appearances for the team, posting a 7.71 ERA. The 30-year-old right-hander has some work to do to get back to where he was, but perhaps a fresh start in Pittsburgh could help him achieve those goals.\n\nBD community, what do you think of the signing of Urquidy?

    "title": "Tarik Skubal arbitration, future after Tigers' Framber Valdez signing",
    "description": "How does the Framber Valdez signing impact the Detroit Tigers' plans for Tarik Skubal in 2026, and the pursuit of a World Series ring?",
    "fullText": "It has been a busy past few days for the Detroit Tigers.\n\nThey made a surprising move Wednesday night in MLB free agency, signing lefty starter Framber Valdez to a three-year, $115 million deal. The move gives the Tigers the best chance to win the American League Central Division (per FanGraphs), and pairs a top-end starter with the two-time, reigning AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal.\n\nSpeaking of Skubal, he had his arbitration hearing earlier Wednesday. We await the final ruling, but it may determine whether the Tigers can continue adding to their roster a few weeks before the Tigers' spring training exhibition schedule begins.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of Detroit's busy week, how much the Tigers have improved and where they can go in the future.\n\nMORE: Does Tigers' big swing on Framber Valdez change narrative about team?\n\nUnless the Tigers make another unexpected move in signing their ace to a long-term deal, Skubal will be making less money than Valdez in 2026. How much less is still a mystery, however.\n\nThe Tigers and Skubal underwent a salary arbitration hearing yesterday, with a three-person panel's decision on Skubal's 2026 salary expected to be released today.\n\nPlayers entering their fourth year of MLB service are eligible for salary arbitration if he and his team cannot agree on a contract for the upcoming season. Through arbitration, the team and player each submit a salary they believe the player should be paid, and a three-person panel (generally made up of legal professionals who work outside of baseball) decides whether the player is worth more or less than the midway point of each filing.\n\n[ MUST LISTEN: Make \"Days of Roar\" your go-to Tigers podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify) ]\n\nSound complicated? Let's use an example Tigers fans are paying close attention to.\n\nThe Tigers submitted a $19 million salary in Skubal's arbitration, while Skubal filed at $32 million. That means that if the panel decides Skubal is worth more than $25.5 million in 2026 (the midway point of each filing), he will win his case and earn an arbitration record-breaking $32 million salary. Conversely, if the panel decides Skubal is worth less than $25.5 million for the upcoming season, the Tigers will win the case and pay Skubal $19 million.\n\nThe Tigers and Skubal can still agree to a long-term deal following the arbitration decision, but the likelihood of that happening is low with Skubal's agent Scott Boras traditionally taking his clients to free agency instead of signing long-term deals beforehand.\n\nNo matter how the decision shakes out, however, Skubal's salary in 2026 will fall below Valdez's $38.3 million in average annual value (with Skubal likely eclipsing that figure when he signs a long-term deal of his own).\n\nThere has been some speculation that Valdez is a top-of-the-rotation replacement for Skubal, but The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal has already reported that the Tigers plan on keeping Skubal for 2026 in a win-now move.\n\n\"One rival executive, granted anonymity for his candor, speculated Wednesday night that a potential trade partner for the Tigers might want to see what Skubal gets in arbitration before finalizing its proposed blockbuster. But really, what are we talking about? If the Tigers traded Skubal after signing Valdez, their fans would be perfectly justified marching on Comerica Park in a massive protest,\" he wrote.\n\nThat means that Tigers fans can breathe easily, for now, and look forward to Skubal and Valdez at the top of the rotation for 2026. Whether Skubal returns to the Tigers in 2027, however, is still yet to be determined.\n\nBefore Wednesday, the Tigers had made few notable offseason transactions in comparison to AL rivals like the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox, whose odds to win the AL pennant are currently higher than those of the Tigers per BetMGM. The Tigers also entered the offseason with an urgent need to improve with only one guaranteed year left of Skubal in a Tigers uniform.\n\nThe Valdez signing in theory primarily does two things: It immediately makes the Tigers starting rotation one of the most formidable in the AL and signals to fans that the organization is serious about competing for the World Series in 2026.\n\nThe Tigers can also benefit from high-level pitching from Valdez without needing to commit to a long-term contract. The three-year deal Valdez signed with the Tigers could become a two-year deal if his opt-out is exercised after the 2027 season, turning a nine-figure deal into a much cheaper eight-figure deal for a Tigers front office with a reputation of avoiding big-money contracts. That means that even if the Valdez signing doesn't work out for Detroit (or if the Tigers need to reset without Skubal in 2027), he'll be off the books soon after and give the front office more room to work with.\n\nValdez hasn't commanded the same sort of attention recently as other AL stalwarts like Skubal, Boston's Garrett Crochet or New York's Gerrit Cole, never finishing higher than fifth in the AL Cy Young Award vote. But his steady success has made him one of MLB's most valuable pitchers over the last five seasons and fits very well with what the Tigers need.\n\nValdez's 18.3 FanGraphs WAR since 2021 is second among AL pitchers to Skubal, while his 3.20 ERA in the same span is third behind Skubal (2.96) and Yankees ace Gerrit Cole (3.15) among AL starters with at least 500 innings pitched in the same span. Valdez's 60 games of at least seven innings pitched since 2021 also leads all pitchers (Skubal, by comparison, has 30 in the same time frame), while his six complete games since 2021 is second in MLB behind Miami Marlins ace Sandy Alcantara's 10.\n\nValdez likely won't compete with Skubal for the top spot in the Tigers rotation, but he might be the best No. 2 pitcher in the AL heading into 2026 and a worthy ace should the Tigers miss Skubal for any reason in 2026 or 2027.\n\nNeed to catch up on the news during your lunch break? \n\nYou can reach Christian at cromo@freepress.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: Tarik Skubal arbitration, Tigers future after Framber Valdez signing",

Per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he is worth $668 billion. The second-richest person in the world, Larry Page, is worth $285 billion.\n\nMusk's wealth has soared by $49 billion since the start of the year, buoyed by SpaceX's high valuation and news of its merger with his AI startup, XAI.\n\nStudies show that money does bring happiness, but there could be a limit for the ultrawealthy.\n\nDavid Bartram, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Leicester, told Business Insider that while wealth and happiness are linked, \"It's very much a matter of 'diminishing returns.'\"\n\n\"Once you've got a few million, anything extra is meaningless for happiness,\" he said.\n\nBartram said for the very wealthy, \"happiness is probably best achieved by having a sense that you've done some good in the world, and that you've treated people around you with care and kindness. It's not exactly rocket science.\"\n\nA 2021 study by Matthew Killingsworth, a senior fellow at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, found that happiness and feelings of well-being increased in tandem with a person's rising income.\n\nHowever, the amount of money needed for happiness becomes an exponentially moving goalpost, Killingsworth concluded in a 2024 paper.\n\nWhile the data he analyzed did not examine what millionaires or billionaires are experiencing, Killingsworth said it was \"plausible\" that the pattern would continue among the world's wealthiest.\n\nMusk discussed the relationship between happiness and wealth in a recent conversation with Nikhil Kamath on the \"People by WTF\" podcast.\n\n\"Aim to make more than you take. Be a net contributor to society,\" Musk said in November.\n\n\"It's kind of like the pursuit of happiness. You know, if you want to create something valuable financially, you don't pursue that. It's best to actually pursue providing useful products and services. If you do that, then money will come as a natural consequence, as opposed to pursuing money directly,\" he added.",

    "title": "I toured the USS Massachusetts, the 680-foot battleship that fired the last shot of World War II. Take a look inside.",
    "description": "The USS Massachusetts, known for its pivotal role in World War II, is now a museum and war memorial in Massachusetts.",
    "fullText": "The USS Massachusetts fired America's first 16-inch shell of World War II. It also fired the last.\n\nIn 1942, the 680-foot battleship fired the first US 16-inch projectile of the war in combat with French forces off the coast of Casablanca, Morocco, as part of Operation Torch. Three years later, the USS Massachusetts fired the last 16-inch projectile of World War II against Japanese forces in the final naval bombardment in Kamaishi, Honshu, Japan.\n\nAfter the war, the decorated battleship was decommissioned and destined to become scrap metal until its former crew members stepped in to raise the funds to save it.\n\nIn 1965, the USS Massachusetts opened to the public as a museum and war memorial in the very state it was named for.\n\n\"The most important function here is that we serve to honor veterans and active duty personnel,\" Christopher Nardi, Battleship Cove's chief operating officer, told Business Insider.\n\nTake a look inside the USS Massachusetts.\n\nThe USS Massachusetts was one of four battleships built as part of the South Dakota class, which was designed to be more compact than previous battleship classes.\n\nI visited Battleship Cove in January, when the museum operates with limited winter hours due to the frigid temperatures on board the ships. The full list of hours of operation can be found on Battleship Cove's website.\n\nGeneral admission costs $25 per adult.\n\nThe ship weighed 44,519 tons when fully loaded for combat.\n\nThe Below Deck tour takes visitors through the inner workings of the ship's technology, including the engine room, the gun plotting and handling rooms, and the radio room.\n\nThe World War II-focused tour features historical exhibits about the war as a whole and spotlights some of the battle damage the ship endured.\n\nThe Crew tour brings visitors through spaces that were part of the sailors' daily life on board, such as their bunks, galley, and laundry room.\n\nThe Topside tour explores the deck of the ship, including its many guns.\n\nColor-coded arrows direct visitors along each of the routes.\n\nThe ship has a total of nine 16-inch, 45-caliber Mark 6 guns: two three-gun turrets at the front of the ship (\"forward\") and one three-gun turret at the back (\"aft\"). They could hit targets up to 23 miles away.\n\nThe 16-inch measurement refers to the bore diameter, or the size of the hole that the shell is fired through. The cannons themselves are over 60 feet long.\n\nThe Bofors 40-millimeter guns featured a range of 6.25 miles and could fire between 120 and 160 rounds per minute.\n\nAt the height of World War II, the USS Massachusetts was outfitted with 72 40-millimeter guns.\n\nThe 20-millimeter Oerlikon autocannons featured a range of 2.75 miles.\n\nSome of the ship's 5-inch guns still work and are used for ceremonial gun salutes.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the seagull that decided to perch on one of the guns when I visited.\n\nEach nautical flag represents a letter or signal. For example, the flag representing the letter \"O\" can also mean \"man overboard.\"\n\nCrew members opened and closed the light's shutter to send messages in Morse code.\n\nWhen the ship was deployed, officers would have eaten their meals here off fine china.\n\nThe wardroom still features tables and seating for large groups.\n\nIn addition to functioning as a museum, Battleship Cove is the official World War II memorial for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nDuring World War II, the crew of the USS Massachusetts grew from its normal number of 1,793 enlisted men to 2,500. When the berthing rooms were full, the ship set up hammocks in other areas.\n\nOfficers were in charge of censoring crew members' letters to their loved ones, blacking out information like their location or even the weather.\n\nDuring the war, maintenance had to be performed while the ship was in the middle of the ocean.\n\nToday, museum volunteers use 3D printers to create replacement parts.\n\nThe galley prepared four meals per day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight rations known as \"mid-rats.\"\n\nSailors labeled every item of their clothing, but some items still ended up in the lost-and-found, known as the \"lucky bag.\"\n\nIn the brig, sailors received only bread and water for meals.\n\nDuring the Battle of Casablanca in 1942, an 8-inch projectile hit the main deck and exploded in a bunk room. No one was injured since all of the sailors were at their battle stations, but the ship sustained damage from the shrapnel.\n\nThe holes have since been repaired, but red outlines on the walls show where they once were.\n\nThe sick bay treated battle wounds as well as everyday ailments such as ear infections or athlete's foot.\n\nOn Iowa-class battleships like the USS New Jersey, Broadway is the longest, straightest passageway on the ship. On South Dakota-class battleships like the USS Massachusetts, Broadway is thinner and not built in a straight line since the class was designed to be more compact.\n\nGunner's mates loaded shells and powder cases into the hoists, which moved them up to the upper handling room and then up to the gun mounts.\n\nSix powder bags were required to fire one 16-inch projectile.\n\nThe USS Massachusetts could hold over 1,200 projectiles.\n\nA device called a Mark 8 Rangekeeper computed where to aim the 16-inch guns based on factors such as the ship's course and speed and the direction of the wind.\n\nIn order to work in the distribution room, an electrician had to pass a test showing that he could get from his bunk to the distribution room and identify any circuit while blindfolded.\n\nRadiomen were responsible for typing messages and passing them to supervisors.\n\nNardi told Business Insider that the equipment in radio central is still operational thanks to the work of volunteers who continue to maintain it.\n\nCanvas bags with lead bottoms were kept in the code room just in case any top-secret information had to be thrown overboard if the ship was compromised.\n\nEven with a map of the ship and color-coded arrows pointing the way, touring the USS Massachusetts was a dizzying experience full of ladders, hatches, and tight corners. On a battleship that big, there's an endless amount of history to learn.\n\nNardi told me that touring historic battleships like the USS Massachusetts can provide insight into how modern Navy ships operate.\n\nBasic navigational equipment looks and works largely the same as it did on World War II battleships, Nardi said. Some communication devices, such as sound-powered telephones that harness the electricity generated by the user's voice, are also still widely used.\n\n\"I hear Navy personnel come on board and say, 'Oh, that hasn't changed much,'\" Nardi said.\n\nIn December, Trump announced a new \"Trump-class\" of ships, referring to them as \"battleships,\" as part of his plan for the US Navy's new \"Golden Fleet\" to reinvigorate American shipbuilding. White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly previously told Business Insider that Trump is \"prioritizing this vital industry to strengthen our country's economic and national security.\"\n\nHowever, the Trump-class ships would not technically qualify as battleships. To earn that title, they would have to be the largest, most heavily armored ships with the largest guns relative to other ships.\n\n\"The word 'battleship' can be used very generically, which is not accurate. We don't have them anymore, and President Trump's not going to build battleships. He's calling them that, but a battleship is what we have over here,\" Nardi said, gesturing at the USS Massachusetts floating in the Taunton River. \"That's a real battleship.\"",

    "fullText": "Not everyone in finance and tech is sold on the idea that AI is going to kill the software business.\n\nWall Street's fears of AI-related disruption has been driving a sell-off of software stocks after the release of Anthropic's new industry-specific plug-in.\n\nFrom Nvidia's CEO dismissing the concerns, to Zoho's founder acknolweding the industry is \"ripe for consolidation,\" here's what leaders in tech and finance are saying:\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" Huang said during a recent Cisco AI event. \"You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.\"\n\nHuang named ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, as bright spots in the industry.\n\nSridhar Vembu, founder of Zoho, a cloud-based software company, said SaaS was \"ripe for consolidation\" long before the rise of AI.\n\n\"An industry that spends vastly more on sales and marketing than on engineering and product development was always vulnerable,\" he wrote on X. \"The venture capital bubble and then the stock market bubble funded a fundamentally flawed, unsustainable model for too long. AI is the pin that is popping this inflated balloon.\"\n\nVembu said he asks his employees to consider the possibility of the company's death.\n\n\"When we accept that possibility, we become more fearless and that is when we can calmly chart our course.\"\n\nSteven Sinofsky, who helped lead the development of Windows 7 and 8, said AI may change \"what we built and who builds it,\" but tales of software's demise are just \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"Wall Street is filled with investors of all types. There's also a community, and they tend to run in herds. The past couple of weeks have definitely seen the herd collectively conclude that somehow software is dead. That the idea of a software pure play will just vanish into some language model,\" Sinofsky wrote in a lengthy post on X. \"Nonsense.\"\n\nSinofsky said it is true some companies will fail. He also noted that such cycles have happened in retail and media.\n\n\"Strap in,\" he wrote. \"This is the most exciting time for business and technology, ever.\"\n\nArm CEO Rene Haas isn't panicking.\n\n\"As I look at enterprise AI deployment, we aren't anywhere close to where it can be,\" Haas told the Financial Times.\n\nHaas, who leads the SoftBank-owned semiconductor company, said the current market reaction is \"micro-hysteria.\"\n\nJPMorgan analyst Stephen Parker said investors shouldn't be too worried by the sell-off.\n\n\"We're seeing a rotation,\" Parker told CNBC. \"It's about a broadening of the recovery story. Cyclicals are picking up the slack, and it's not just the AI infrastructure plays and the hyperscalers that are driving markets higher.\"\n\nParker, the co-head of global investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, said AI developments are likely to continue to cause disruption in the software industry.",

    "fullText": "Hull KR's treble-winning head coach Willie Peters says he is \"keen\" to have talks about taking charge of England for this year's Rugby League World Cup.\n\nThe Australian, 46, is among the contenders to succeed Shaun Wane, who stepped down on 14 January.\n\nPeters led Rovers to their first Super League Grand Final triumph last October, along with the League Leaders' Shield and the Challenge Cup.\n\nHe then joined up with the Australia squad for the Rugby League Ashes series as an assistant to head coach Kevin Walters, helping them to a 3-0 series win over England.\n\nPeters told BBC Sport: \"I'd be keen to have discussions if and when that arose. It'd be a privilege to coach England, that's for sure.\"\n\nFormer Wigan coach Wane, 61, stepped down after just under six years in the role, having led England to a World Cup semi-final in 2022.\n\nWane worked on a full-time basis but the Rugby Football League has said the role is \"expected to revert to a part-time position\".\n\nAsked if he had been approached regarding the role, Peters said: \"No, I haven't spoken to anyone yet.\n\n\"It's a job that many, many people would be interested in and whoever coaches England will have a squad that competes very hard. They show a lot of passion and effort, that's what an England team does.\n\n\"Shaun did that, got them firing in terms of effort and competing.\n\n\"There are probably a few different areas that they need to work on. As I've said openly, the spine is probably an area that needs focus but they're not too far away.\"\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be staged in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea between 15 October and 15 November.\n\nAll of England's matches will be in Australia, with their opener against Tonga in Perth on Saturday, 17 October.\n\nWarrington skipper Williams to leave at end of 2026\n\nEngland head coach Wane steps down in World Cup year\n\nWigan's Matt Peet has ruled himself out of the running.\n\n\"It's not in my thoughts, no,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It's not something I'm interested in doing in the short term. Maybe one day - but now my focus is 100% on Wigan and my family for the next few years.\"\n\nEngland captain George Williams, who announced on Tuesday that he will leave Warrington at the end of 2026 to move to the NRL, said that Wane's replacement needs to bring \"passion\" to the job.\n\nWilliams, who is widely expected to link up with England team-mates Herbie Farnworth and Morgan Knowles at the Dolphins, said: \"I was disappointed that Waney lost his job and I think a lot of players would say the same thing.\n\n\"Whoever comes in, I'm sure they're passionate and keen to get us moving forward.\n\n\"If you're coaching England, you're going to be good at your job. That's automatic. But I think the passion is a big one.\n\n\"You're getting an elite group of players that pretty much half-coaches itself.

    "description": "The story of Afghan refugee Zainullah Ihsan, who is going to the T20 World Cup with Scotland three years after his first net session.",
    "fullText": "Three-and-a-half years ago, a teenager peered over a fence on Glasgow's Crow Road and told those training at GHK Cricket Club: \"I like cricket\".\n\nZainullah Ihsan had only ever played tapeball cricket - which uses a tennis ball tightly wrapped in electrical tape - in the park at that point.\n\nHowever after 10 minutes of his first GHK net session, more people were watching the young tearaway than were following the match taking place on the adjacent ground.\n\nNow, the 19-year-old is part of Scotland's squad for the T20 World Cup in India.\n\nHis story is remarkable, a tale of hardship and strength that started with him leaving Afghanistan as a 13-year-old before crossing Asia and Europe to join his older brother in Scotland two years later.\n\nIt is striking how grounded the seamer is, given his age, and he is determined to make the most of the opportunity before him.\n\nThe word 'kismet' was mentioned to me by those who know him best. It literally translates as 'luck' or 'fate', but carries more weight than that. It is the idea that certain things are meant to be and that the stars align to make it happen.\n\nIhsan missed the cut-off to qualify for the Under-19 World Cup that is taking place in Zimbabwe, but his absence there opened the door for him to travel with the senior team to India after Scotland's own late call-up.\n\n\"When Bangladesh boycotted the World Cup, I kept my eyes on my phone - all day it was in my hand and then [head coach] Owen Dawkins called me,\" Ihsan recalls about his selection.\n\n\"He said 'congratulations' and I can't explain how I felt, I was very excited.\n\n\"It was a surprise. My first selection. Every cricketer dreams to play in a World Cup and I didn't expect it.\n\n\"Straight away I called my older brother. I spoke to my Mum and Dad back in Afghanistan too. They are very excited.\"\n\nScotland pick uncapped Ihsan in World Cup squad\n\nNo sponsor, kit on order & visa wait - Scotland embrace late World Cup call\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nHis dramatic rise to full international honours has been swift, but has not been without its challenges.\n\nAs an unaccompanied refugee, Ihsan was supported by Aberlour Children's Charity through a service called Guardianship Scotland.\n\nGHK members also helped him get to training and matches around the country, while also providing him with the necessary kit.\n\nIt is not just Ihsan either. A number of children housed all over Scotland have found cricket clubs thanks to Guardianship Scotland, with many of them viewing Ihsan as a role model.\n\nAnd yet, apart from his brother, his family were unaware of his rising stock.\n\nFor many who settle in the United Kingdom from the Asian subcontinent, there is a responsibility on them to financially support family back home.\n\nIhsan played regional cricket and represented Scotland Under-17s off the back of impressive performances for GHK, but it was not until he played for Scotland A last year that he told his parents about his achievements.\n\n\"I told my parents just that I'm studying,\" he said. \"After I was selected for the A team I told my Mum and Dad and they told me to work hard and go for my dreams.\n\n\"I have the biggest dreams. The first dream was to be selected and now the dreams are higher, to be one of the top bowlers in the world and play in leagues around the world.\"\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nThroughout our interview, Ihsan kept coming back to his determination to do his best and leave no stone unturned.\n\nThere is no arrogance about him, just a steely confidence and a drive that is built into his psyche.\n\nIhsan, along with team-mate Safyaan Sharif, received their visas after the rest of the travelling Scotland party and so were unable to play in the Scots' first warm-up match against Afghanistan.\n\nDespite that disappointment, he still took the opportunity to pick the brains of Hamid Hassan - former Afghanistan opening bowler and now coach - and one of the sport's most experienced campaigners in Mohammad Nabi.\n\nGlobal superstar Rashid Khan also came over for a chat before the game.\n\nThese are some of Ihsan's heroes, but there are no split loyalties.\n\n\"Scotland gave me respect and believed in me,\" he said. \"I was born in Afghanistan but my country is Scotland.\"\n\nHe experienced his first taste of international cricket on Wednesday, taking 1-49 as Scotland were narrowly beaten by Namibia in a high-scoring game.\n\nThe teams then played a practice super over, with Ihsan trusted to bowl for Scotland.\n\n\"He's got decent pace, he's able to deliver a yorker, slower balls and a bouncer, which in T20s are good commodities to have,\" assistant coach Gordon Drummond said.\n\n\"He played his first game and it showed if you're off the mark a little bit you can get punished. The more experience he has, the more he will develop.\n\n\"He's going to learn a lot from the guys we've got out here and he really enjoyed having conversations with the Afghanistan players the other day.\n\n\"He's quite a grounded individual and the really nice thing from [the Namibia game] was he came off the park and was annoyed at how he bowled. That shows how much character he has and his willingness to learn.\n\n\"We can't predict the future, but there's not been a huge amount of input from Cricket Scotland staff.

In his view, the first wave is already underway: white-collar work.

Is That a Bad Sign for NVDA Stock?\n\nA Potential Sentiment Mismatch Makes Rocket Lab (RKLB) Stock Options an Enticing Proposition\n\nWhy Needham Warns That Meta Platforms Stock Could Be Headed for 10%-15% Downside\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. \n\nBlue-collar work comes next. Musk believes humanoid robots, paired with increasingly capable AI models, will replace much of physical labor shortly after. Manufacturing, logistics, construction, and even service work would eventually follow. His estimate for this transition is strikingly aggressive: three to seven years.\n\nThe end result, Musk argues, isn’t mass deprivation, but abundance. If AI and robots can produce goods and services at near-zero marginal cost, then scarcity collapses. Food, housing, transportation, energy, and manufactured goods all become dramatically cheaper. Productivity explodes, not because humans are working harder, but because machines are doing nearly all of the work.\n\nThat’s where Musk’s idea of “universal high income” comes in, a phrase he’s used before to distinguish his view from traditional universal basic income. This isn’t a modest government stipend meant to keep people afloat. It’s a world where the cost of living drops so sharply that most people can afford a high standard of living regardless of whether they hold a conventional job.\n\nIn that context, he made a statement that cuts directly against decades of financial planning orthodoxy.\n\n“One side recommendation I have,” Musk said, “is don’t worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years. It won’t matter. You won’t need to save for retirement. If any of the things we’ve said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant.”",

    "fullText": "The World Anti-Doping Agency could investigate if evidence emerges that male ski jumpers are injecting their penises in a bid to improve sporting performance.\n\nIn January, German newspaper Bild, external reported that jumpers were injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid before being measured for their suits.\n\nHyaluronic acid, which is not banned in sport, can be used to increase penis circumference by one or two centimetres.\n\nThis would increase the surface area of their suits during competition, which, according to FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, could increase their flight in the air.\n\n\"Every extra centimetre on a suit counts. If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further,\" said FIS ski jumping men's race director Sandro Pertile.\n\nAsked about the claims in Bild at a press conference at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, Wada director general Olivier Niggli said: \"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance.\n\n\"If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"\n\nClearly entertained by the question, Wada's Polish president Witold Banka joked: \"Ski jumping is very popular in Poland so I promise you I'm going to look at it.\"\n\nFIS communications director Bruno Sassi told BBC Sport: \"There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.\"\n\nBefore the start of each season, ski jumpers are measured using 3D body scanners, in which they must wear only \"elastic, body-tight underwear\".\n\nRules state their suits must have a tolerance of only 2-4cm, and as part of the measuring process, their crotch height is also measured.\n\nThe crotch height of their suit must conform to the athlete's crotch height, with the addition of 3cm for men.\n\nHyularonic acid injected into the penis can last up to 18 months.\n\nThere have been previous attempts to improve performance through manipulations of the suits.\n\nIn August, Norwegian Olympic medallists Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang accepted three-month suspensions for their part in the tampering of suits during the men's large hill event at the World Ski Championships in Trondheim, Norway, in March.\n\nWhile it later transpired the athletes themselves were not aware of the tampering, FIS said their team had \"tried to cheat the system\" by putting reinforced thread in their jumpsuits.\n\nBoth athletes are set to compete at these Winter Olympics, which officially start on Friday.\n\nThe men's ski jumping competition begins on Monday.\n\nBBC Sport has contacted FIS for comment.",

    "description": "The Official World Golf Rankings ruled that only the top 10 finishers at LIV Golf events will be awarded world ranking points",
    "fullText": "Jon Rahm has lamented the restrictions put on LIV Golf as unfair after the Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR) awarded the tour world ranking points five years after its establishment.\n\nThe OWGR approved LIV’s submission for ranking points with some conditions due to the less than traditional nature of the breakaway tour, including the lower competitive fields, and awarded LIV players world ranking points if they finish in the top 10.\n\nThe Saudi Arabia-backed league called the decision a “long overdue moment of recognition” but revealed its disappointment at the limits placed on them from the OWGR, demanding a more “transparent” and “equal” system which does “reflect performance over affiliation”.\n\nAnd while Rahm admitted his delight “that we’re being recognised in a way”, he hit out at the harsher treatment given to LIV golfers.\n\n“I don't like how we're not being treated the same as every other tour,” he said at LIV Golf’s season opener in Riyadh.\n\n\"It seems like the rules that have been in place don't really apply to us, with only 10 of us getting points.\n\n\"It doesn't seem fair. The small fields out there throughout the course of the year, their players get full points.\"\n\nThe Spaniard, a two-time major winner, still believes there is “work to be done” as he highlighted the pitfalls of the restrictions.\n\n\"While it's good for some people, it could cause some players to actually lose world ranking points instead of gaining them because finishing 11th is basically a missed cut, and we're already adding to the divisor,” Rahm added.\n\n\"But I'm thankful that LIV Golf got their foot in the door, and there's a possibility for us to walk in the room and be recognised as a tour, as we should be.\"\n\nThe significance of LIV obtaining OWGR points is because they are important to players aiming to qualify for the annual four majors. The rankings are worked out via a two-year rolling system with more weight given to the most recent results.",

She is accredited with Georgia as the coach of European champion Nika Egadze.\n\nValieva, then aged 15, was at the center of a legal battle during the 2022 Beijing Games when a sample she gave two months earlier tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine. The revelation came after Valieva won team gold with other Russian skaters. She was later disqualified from that event, which upgraded the United States to gold. Valieva was a contender for the women’s gold medal but placed fourth and was criticized rink-side by Tutberidze.\n\n“It’s not our decision the coach is here,” Banka said Thursday at a news conference in Milan. “The investigation found no evidence that this particular person was engaged in this doping process, so there’s no legal basis to exclude her from the presence during the Olympic Games.”\n\n“But of course, if you ask me personally about my feelings,” he continued, “I don’t feel comfortable with her presence here in the Olympic Games, for sure.”\n\nThe Georgian Figure Skating Federation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nValieva's ban expired in December, despite legal efforts to have it overturned.\n\nRules have been changed to raise the minimum age for skaters to 17 in time for the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",
