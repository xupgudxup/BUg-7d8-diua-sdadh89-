    "description": "“The idea that the Northern Ireland international has suddenly become a weak link just doesn’t stack up”.",
    "fullText": "It’s a familiar movie, with the same script, a different director and different subject matter, yet the same core theme — a Sunderland player becoming a lightning rod for the team’s failure to perform on any given day.\n\nFor years, the starring role was played by Luke O’Nien, ludicriously branded a “liability” (a word I’d gladly see cast out of all Sunderland-related discourse — there are no liabilities in this team) and viewed in some circles as a weak link and someone who couldn’t trap a football, let alone play a key role in our eventual rise to the Premier League.\n\nIt was untrue then; it’s still untrue now, and although we might’ve hoped that singling out certain players for often disproportionate criticism is a habit we’d try to break, it’s nonetheless disheartening that as Sunderland’s form has hit choppier waters, a wholehearted, committed and high-quality footballer in Trai Hume has found himself under the microscope.\n\nLet’s nail something down: pound for pound, Hume is one of the best, most effective and successful signings made by Sunderland during Kristjaan Speakman’s time at the club.\n\nWhen he arrived from Linfield in 2022, he had the feel of a low-risk, “one for the future”-type signing but during four years in red and white, his ferocious will to win and refusal to take a backwards step have been a key component of Sunderland’s rise from League One to the Premier League.\n\nHe’s also far more technically accomplished than we often highlight and his low-key attitude is a perfect fit for the times: no nonsense and no razzle-dazzle — just a rugged approach to the game that Régis Le Bris and his teammates clearly appreciate.\n\nWhy, therefore, has Hume suddenly become such a polarising figure among pockets of the fanbase?\n\nYes, recent results have been average and our performance levels aren’t currently hitting the heights that they did earlier in the campaign, but as Le Bris is often at pains to point out, collectivism is the name of the game at the Stadium of Light and it was good to hear him offer some staunch backing for Hume earlier this week.\n\nOK, the absence of Bertrand Traoré and the spectre of Lutsharel Geertruida (a superb and extremely versatile player in his own right) may be factors here, but the idea that the Northern Ireland international has suddenly become a weak link just doesn’t stack up.\n\nPerhaps Le Bris is asking Hume — a hard-tackling right back by trade — to push his versatility a shade too far at times, but that’s not on Hume himself and after a challenging afternoon against West Ham, has he not handled himself well as captain during the subsequent clashes with Burnley, Arsenal and Liverpool on Wednesday night?\n\nLet’s be frank: Granit Xhaka’s absence has forced the head coach to adapt and the results have been mixed, but hanging a player out to dry because he’s perhaps not living up to your expectations in a role he’s still learning is hardly sound reasoning.\n\nCollectively, Sunderland weren’t anywhere near their best against Liverpool.\n\nOn reflection, it seemed as though we showed the visitors too much respect, and there was a timidity to our play that I found slightly puzzling at times, with safe passes being chosen too often for my liking and Alisson not really being troubled for the majority of the game.\n\nThis isn’t entirely attributable to Hume, however, and if we’re going to analyse where things aren’t quite clicking for Sunderland, it’s grossly unfair to turn on a player who’s demonstrated throughout the season that he does have Premier League quality and for whom the step up from the Championship has not proven impossible to make.\n\nHe’s doing what’s being asked of him; he’s doing it to the best of his ability and if Le Bris opts to bring Geertruida into the fold for Sunday’s FA Cup tie at Oxford or next Sunday’s league meeting with Fulham, I’m sure Hume, as a double promotion winner and one of our longest-serving players, will respond as professionally as possible.\n\nOn a final note, it should be highlighted that legitimate and constructive criticism of players’ performances is fine.\n\nThat’s part of the deal, but I really do wish we’d take a moment before tossing words such as ‘liability” around so flippantly and laying into players with unnecessary venom. It adds nothing the discussion and potentially does more harm than good — not least given the scrutiny these lads are already under as they compete in such a tough and demanding league.",

But, the lines have been jumped over more often in recent years and I think Van Dijk is right about that.\n\n\"Because of the clickbait, it is so much easier to get more likes, views and work if you're a little bit more extreme. Ex-players aren't stupid and they know that. If you are too sensible and sit on the fence you won't get the big gigs.\n\n\"You have a dichotomy. Most ex-players would like to be balanced but they know if they are too balanced and sensible they won't be there next week.\n\n\"My criticism would always be constructive criticism which is explained. One-dimensional labeling of players should never happen. Sometimes if a big name says something enough it becomes accepted wisdom.\"\n\nVan der Kraan added: \"There are two different kinds of pundits; those who need to be on every week and those who are genuinely focused on what is right and what players should do.\n\n\"For Van Dijk, after so many years enough is enough.\n\n\"It all started after he came into the Netherlands team and became a big player at Liverpool. The first ex-player to really criticise him was Marco van Basten, saying he was not a leader. Van Dijk was biting his lip after every match because it became a bit of a stigma.\n\n\"Eventually it filtered to England and every time he had a bad game it became an open nerve.\"\n\nListen to the full episode on BBC Sounds",

Remember, each of the last seven MVP awards have been won by players born outside the USA — and they are coming to compete.\n\n\"I'm never stepping onto the court to lose, you know, or not caring,\" said the Spurs Victor Wembanyama, who was voted a World starter by the fans. \"Just like at home, I'm never stepping into a board game, not caring or thinking I'm gonna lose, or I'm thinking it's okay to lose.\n\n\"So I'll be out there, might as well win.\"\n\nHere's all you need to know about the 2026 NBA All-Star Game and how not to miss a moment of the action/\n\nWhere: Intuit Dome, Inglewood, CA\n\nThis year, the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock — and it falls right in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. That was a perfect setup for the first-of-its-kind All-Star Game format, a USA vs. World showdown that fans and players have been asking for.\n\nThe 24 All-Star players have been divided into three teams, two USA teams — USA Stripes and USA Stars — and one World Team. Those three teams will compete in a round-robin tournament of four 12-minute games, each team playing at least two games.\n\nAt the end of the round-robin, the two top teams will play a championship game (the fourth 12-minute game of the day) for the title. (If there is a tie, it comes down to point differential.)\n\nThe 75th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, at 5 p.m. Eastern, an earlier time than in previous years, leading into more coverage of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nThere are two USA teams — Stars and Stripes — and one World team. Fans voted for five starters from each of the Western and Eastern Conferences, and the NBA coaches voted in the 14 reserve players (plus NBA Commissioner Adam Silver added one more USA player to balance the rosters, and also picked the injury replacements). The league divided up the teams.\n\n• Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee/Greece)\n• Luka Doncic (Los Angeles Lakers/Slovenia)\n• Nikola Jokic (Denver/Serbia)\n• Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio/France)\n• Karl-Anthony Towns (New York/Dominican Rep.)\n• Pascal Siakam (Indiana/Cameroon)\n• Deni Avdija (Portland/Israel)\n• Jamal Murray (Denver/Canada)\n• Alperen Sengun (Houston/Turkiye)\nCoach: Toronto's Darko Rajakovic (Serbia)\n\n• Cade Cunningham (Detroit)\n• Tyrese Maxey (Philadelphia)\n• Anthony Edwards (Minnesota)\n• Chet Holmgren (Oklahoma City)\n• Jalen Duren (Detroit)\n• Devin Booker (Phoenix)\n• Scottie Barnes (Toronto)\n• Jalen Johnson (Atlanta)\nCoach: Detroit's J.B. Bickerstaff\n\n• Jalen Brunson (New York)\n• Jaylen Brown (Boston)\n• LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers)\n• Kevin Durant (Houston)\n• Donovan Mitchell (Cleveland)\n• Kawhi Leonard (LA Clippers)\n• Norman Powell (Miami)\n• Brandon Ingram (Toronto)\nCoach: San Antonio's Mitch Johnson\n\n• Stephen Curry (Golden State)\n• Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City/Canada)\n• Both Luka Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo have missed games this week with injuries, but neither has been officially ruled out yet. The World team currently has nine players; if one drops out, there will be no need for Adam Silver to name a replacement.\n\nRising Stars G1: Team Melo vs. Team Austin - 9:00 PM ET\n\nRising Stars G2: Team Vince vs. Team T-Mac - 9:55 PM ET\n\nCastrol Rising Stars Championship - 10:35 PM ET\n\nNBA HBCU Classic Presented by AT&T - 11:00 PM ET\n\nState Farm 3-Point Contest - First Event - 5:00 PM ET\n\nEvery moment of All-Star Weekend — the Rising Stars challenge on Friday.

Coast 2 Coast Tuesday presents doubleheaders on Tuesday nights throughout the regular season on NBC and Peacock.

    "fullText": "The bitter cold Arctic air of last week has created a lot of ice on Lake Superior. Here’s a look at the ice situation on the largest freshwater lake in the world, by surface area.\n\nYes, Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world if we use surface area as the criterion for size. Lake Superior’s surface area is 31,000 square miles.\n\nLake Superior takes up just slightly less area than the state of Indiana, which is around 35,000 square miles.\n\nIn the past week, Lake Superior’s ice cover grew from 34 percent coverage to 52 percent covered with ice.\n\nThe high resolution satellite image shows our massive Great Lake with a much smaller area without ice. Unfortunately, we very rarely get an entirely clear sky at this time of year for a great look at the ice.\n\nOne visual we definitely get, aside from growing ice, is the reduced lake-effect clouds. In the image above, you can see that the ice-covered west and east ends of Lake Superior don’t have lake-effect clouds forming over them.\n\nThe growth of ice in the past week added 6,000 square miles of ice to Lake Superior. That’s about the size of Connecticut.\n\nWhile satellites are an okay way to look at ice cover, a more accurate map is the human/digital combination of an ice map.\n\nThe entire Great Lakes system is now 52 percent covered with ice.\n\nLake Huron is 71 percent ice covered, and Lake Erie is 94 percent ice covered.\n\nWith the warm pattern developing this weekend into next week, the Great Lakes may have reached peak ice coverage for the winter. Peak ice typically occurs in the last week of February or first few days of March.",

    "description": "A Purdue faculty group calls for Provost Patrick Wolfe's resignation, citing over a dozen issues including alleged bans on international students, DEI program cuts, and hiring freezes.",
    "fullText": "WEST LAFAYETTE, IN — A group of Purdue faculty is calling for the resignation of the university’s provost, pointing to more than a dozen issues they say have caused students and staff to “suffer.”\n\nThe Purdue chapter of American Association of University Professors, an advocacy group that represents the faculty and has been at the forefront of criticizing the university’s administration, wrote in an open letter in January that Provost Patrick Wolfe has undertaken “unilateral decision-making” since his appointment in 2023.\n\nWolfe’s policies, the faculty said, have “negatively impacted” Purdue.\n\n“Boilermakers across campus have lost confidence in Provost Wolfe’s leadership and have been unable to get Provost Wolfe to course-correct through internal channels,” they wrote in the letter, which was first obtained by Based in Lafayette on Tuesday. “Our ethical and professional obligations to Purdue and to the state of Indiana require us to speak up in order to protect the community we hold dear.”\n\nThe letter points to a number of issues that the faculty say warrant Wolfe’s resignation, including reports that Purdue administrators have effectively banned graduate students from China and other countries.\n\nIn December, a host of faculty told the Journal & Courier that departmental admissions committees were quietly pressured by university leadership to end admission for students of certain nationalities. The de facto policy change, they said, was passed off as an “unwritten” policy disseminated through in-person meetings and private conversations.\n\n“The Purdue administration attempted to do this quietly through in-person meetings, private conversations, and pressure on graduate admissions committees following a March inquiry from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party,” the AAUP said in its January letter. “Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 establishes country of origin as a protected class.”\n\nWolfe has denied that such a ban exists.\n\nThe group also alleges that Wolfe, along with other Purdue administrators, has pressured faculty into “self-censorship,” scaring them out of researching or teaching controversial topics for fear of “being fired.”\n\nThe elimination of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives at Purdue last year, the faculty say, has also resulted in the firing of 60 student staff members and many full-time employees.\n\n“Provost Wolfe did not adequately justify these firings, which were made over the summer in an apparent attempt to evade notice,” the letter reads. “These actions, which have sent shockwaves across campus, are at odds with Purdue’s ‘people first’ mantra.”\n\nOther apparent issues the AAUP pointed to include:\n\nHalts on the hiring of new faculty, with Wolfe reportedly refusing to sign employment offers for new professors. The group says this has resulted in high turnover and teaching shortages in several departments.\n\nA “non-transparent” restructuring of Purdue’s Honors College late last year that resulted in as many as 17 professors losing employment.\n\nAn unfilled dean position in the College of Education, which has sat without leadership for three years, as well as in Purdue Libraries.\n\n“Broad overreach during tenure & promotion processes,” with the faculty saying new tenure requirements have left tenure virtually unattainable for many professors. The group also points to supposed pressure from university administrators on faculty to withdraw themselves from tenure consideration.\n\nA supposed lack of pushback from Purdue administrators against the U.S. Department of Education after the agency cancelled a $34.9 million grant to the university last year.\n\n“A lack of leadership on social and political issues that directly impact Purdue’s ability to meet its teaching, research, and service mission,” including a policy of institutional neutrality during “attacks on higher education.”\n\n“Provost Wolfe’s conduct has negatively impacted the careers of faculty and staff who are here to serve the student population, with devastating consequences for student learning and campus governance,” the faculty said in their letter. “His resignation is urgently needed in order to restore faith that the Purdue administration will treat its community with appropriate fairness and transparency and demonstrate a sense of duty to its alumni, faculty, staff and students.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lafayette Journal & Courier: Purdue faculty group demands provost's resignation",

    "fullText": "Many social media posts by Tesla CEO on his platform are indiscernible from those of white supremacists, say experts\n\nElon Musk’s longtime fixation on a white racial majority is intensifying. The richest man in the world posted about how the white race was under threat, made allusions to race science or promoted anti-immigrant conspiracy content on 26 out of 31 days in January, according to the Guardian’s analysis of his social media output. The posts, made on his platform X, reflect a renewed embrace of what extremism experts describe as white supremacist material.\n\n“Whites are a rapidly dying minority,” Musk said on 22 January, a short time before taking the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, while reposting an Irish anti-immigrant influencer’s video about demographic change.\n\nMusk’s posts included him repeatedly claiming white people face systemic discrimination, endorsing the conspiracy that there is an ongoing genocide against white people in countries around the world and promoting a claim that white people would be “slaughtered” by non-whites if they become a demographic minority.\n\n“If you stripped Elon Musk’s name off of these things and showed them to me, I would think that this was a white supremacist,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Extremism, who reviewed a selection of the posts.\n\nMusk has for years promoted anti-immigrant and far-right content in his posts, as well as endorsed rightwing activists and political parties around the globe. The Tesla CEO’s most recent output displays a more consistent and explicit engagement with white supremacist content and nativist activists than in the past, however, lending them the imprimatur of the world’s richest person and spreading their ideas to his audience of over 200 million followers. Beirich said he appeared “deep into the world of white nationalism”.\n\n“The White ‘liberal’ standard for behavior is extremely strict, but is only applied to Whites,” Musk said on 26 January, commenting on a post that claimed there was discrimination against white conservatives.\n\nMusk’s posts repeatedly echoed prominent white supremacist narratives and ideologies, said William Braniff, the former director of the Department of Homeland Security’s office for prevention of terrorism and extremism. Several of Musk’s posts included what Braniff described as “textbook examples” of white supremacist conspiracy theories such as “the great replacement” – a belief that liberal elites or Jewish people are conspiring to use immigration to replace white populations.\n\nThe danger of Musk’s obsession lies in mainstreaming ideas that are deeply tied to violence and discrimination, according to Braniff, who is now executive director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (Peril) at American University. “The great replacement has been an especially important mobilizing narrative for highly lethal white supremacist attacks in the United States and elsewhere,” he said.\n\nMusk has repeatedly denied he is racist or antisemitic, stated that he condemns terrorism and said he does not advocate for violence. He asserted in a 2024 interview with Don Lemon that he does not He also told Joe Rogan in March last year that he is not a Nazi, weeks after facing condemnations from Jewish groups and the chairman of the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel over his speech to Germany’s far-right AfD party in which he told Germans to move beyond their “past guilt”.\n\nAlthough Musk wrote a number of posts on race and immigration himself last month, much of his output involved reposting far-right activist accounts or replying to them with brief endorsements such as a bullseye emoji, implying agreement. On 10 January, Musk replied “yes” in reply to a post from a white nationalist account that claimed “race communism that destroyed Rhodesia and South Africa are the same things they are bringing to America and the rest of the Occident to turn us into the Global Favela”. The author of the post previously published a blog titled How To Build An American Orania – a reference to the privately owned, whites-only town of Orania in South Africa.\n\nSimilar interactions took place throughout the month. After a far-right influencer posted “they just want to eradicate White people it’s that simple” in reference to the New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration speech, Musk replied on 7 January “some people really do”. On 9 January, he wrote “true” in a quote-tweet of a post that claimed white people would be “slaughtered” as a minority and that “White solidarity is the only way to survive”. On 16 January, Musk reposted a rightwing influencer’s post claiming “white genocide is the official Democrat party platform”. The same day, he promoted another rightwing influencer’s anti-diversity post that used an AI-generated image of tattooed black women on Yale’s rowing team.\n\nWhile some of the accounts Musk interacted with are fringe social media influencers, several others are prominent far-right activists whose extremist views have been well-documented. On 17 January, Musk reposted a screed against “ethno-cultural upheaval” in Europe from Martin Sellner, far-right Austrian activist, who is the founder of the ethno-nationalist Identitarian Movement. Musk, who reinstated Sellner’s banned X account in 2024, replied to the anti-immigration post that “this is simply a statement of fact”.\n\n“Martin Sellner is probably the most significant global white supremacist right now,” Beirich said. “He’s the one who pushed the great replacement, and has now pushed the idea of remigration – ethnically cleansing western countries of non-whites.”\n\nSellner gave a presentation in 2024 at an event in Germany on the logistics of carrying out mass deportations that was attended by neo-Nazis and other extremists. The event sparked immense backlash and protests against the far-right across the northern European nation. Lawmakers attempted to ban him from the country. The Austrian activist also received a €1,500 donation from and communicated with white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, who would later go on to commit a terrorist attack in 2019 that killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\n Sellner rejected being described as a white supremacist and said he respects “the dignity of all others” in a statement to the Guardian, while taking credit for politically mainstreaming the concepts of the great replacement and remigration. “Now, from Trump to Musk, everyone is talking about replacement migration, the ethnic vote and remigration,” Sellner said. He additionally claimed that the Potsdam event was “misrepresented” by media and that he rejected any form of terrorism. Sellner described his interactions with Tarrant, which included offering to get a drink with Tarrant if he ever visited Austria, as limited to standard thank-you emails to a donor.\n\nExtremism experts said the ideas Musk has publicized are deeply tied to some of the most notorious, violent extremist attacks of the past decade, including the 2018 antisemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the 2022 racist mass killing of 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket. The shooter in Buffalo left a 180-page manifesto filled with mentions of white supremacist replacement theory.\n\nMusk’s posts also reflect an increasing embrace of white supremacist figures and talking points among prominent Republicans and government agencies in the past year. Some of that shift has played out on X, where Musk reinstated a number of formerly banned accounts such as prominent antisemite Nick Fuentes. Federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security have meanwhile posted content that aligns with white supremacist propaganda. Earlier this month, Donald Trump also drew widespread backlash after posting a racist video to his Truth Social platform that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nMusk has repeatedly mocked those who have criticized his comments as far-right or racist, framing his views as common sense or simply reiterating facts and statistics. His rhetoric reflects a widespread tactic among people on the far-right, experts say, when extremists attempt to defend their worldview of an in-group of white people against everyone else.\n\n“That reductionist worldview breaks down when people in your in-group say you’re full of it, that what you’re saying is wrong,” Braniff said. “So now the main requirement is to attack the dissenting in-group, to delegitimize them as race traitors and as woke.”\n\nAs February began, Musk was still posting about race and immigration on a consistent basis. He replied to an anti-immigrant activist this week who claimed that Ireland’s civilization would end “because Irish men are afraid of being called racist and upsetting people from the 3rd world”.\n\n“Such men are pathetic traitors,” Musk responded.",

    "fullText": "We explore the cosy world-building spin-off with Game Freak’s Shigeru Ohmori and his fellow developers – and learn how it began with a Pokémon-hunting dream\n\nPokémon is celebrating its 30th anniversary this month, and everybody knows what to expect from these games by now. The concept is simple: head into a cartoonish paradise full of whimsical creatures, capture them in red-and-white balls and assemble a team of warriors from them, before battling other aspiring Pokémon masters. But the latest entry in the series is different – a game that’s more about building than battling.\n\nIn Pokopia, a refreshingly pacific twist on the series, players are dropped into a virtual world where Pokémon are freed from their spherical prisons and happily roam their natural habitats. There’s one minor caveat – you have to create those habitats by hand, building them from what you can find.\n\nTaking its cues from Nintendo’s all-conquering Animal Crossing, this Switch 2 game sees you rebuilding decaying habitats in order to attract new Pokémon to move into your sanctuary. (Players of the Xbox classic Viva Piñata, rejoice.) It’s a welcome departure from the main series’ long-running training and battling loop. Veteran Pokémon developer Shigeru Ohmori, who started thinking about Pokopia’s concept while working on 2022’s Pokémon games Scarlet and Violet, says that the idea for Pokopia arose after spending many years dreaming about finding Pokémon in tall grass.\n\n“The first Pokémon game I worked on was [2003’s] Ruby and Sapphire,” recalls Ohmori with a smile. “My first project for that game was to create the map – and whenever I put grass on to the map, Pokémon appeared on screen. That feeling of Pokémon appearing when creating the habitat, and then meeting those Pokémon, was something that I really cherished.” He created a basic prototype for Pokopia in his spare time, and then Pokémon’s developers Game Freak brought on Dragon Quest Builders 2 studio Omega Force to help.\n\nThis feeling is lovingly recreated for players in Pokopia. As you create tufts of grass, a Bulbasaur suddenly appears, shuffling his way towards you to say hello. There are no humans to be found anywhere in this virtual utopia. In the strange and initially desolate patch in which you create your Pokémon paradise, you control the adorably wobbling mass of everyone’s favourite shape-shifting jelly, Ditto. Haunted by memories of its former trainer, Ditto decides to take a humanoid shape that you determine in a character creation screen. This is your uncanny-looking avatar, doing its best to approximate a faded memory of a human being.\n\nAfter you’ve customised your Ditto/human-hybrid, you are greeted by a sentient shrub, Professor Tangrowth, complete with a data disc attached to his curly tendrils and a pair of glasses strapped to his chin. The prof informs you that it’s your job to restore this barren land. Where do you begin? In exactly the same way that Ohmori did, all those years ago – by making lush, green grass.\n\nIn order to create new habitats, Ditto borrows moves from each new creature you meet, mimicking their abilities so that you can till the land. Bulbasaur’s ability transforms Ditto’s appendages into floppy, leaf-producing vines. Squirtle’s water gun sees Ditto puke water like a derpy Roman fountain, and Scyther’s cut blesses Ditto with comically oversized razor-sharp blades for arms. In a nice touch, whenever Ditto learns a new move you’re treated to the classic Pokémon level-up music.\n\nFor an hour I wander the barren wasteland, working to turn sand into grass and hacking trees for wood. Everything feels effortlessly charming, with a level of care and polish that elevates Pokopia’s opening 60 minutes above the series’ many middling spin-offs. Like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokopia also allows you to visit friends’ islands and meet their Poké pals, surfing between lands as a Ditto-Lapras or soaring through the skies in the form of a Dragonite.\n\nMarina Ayano, the game’s art director, tells me that she grew up with the franchise – making this something of a dream project. During development, Ayano and the sound director landed on two key words to steer the game’s cutesy and laid-back vibe: “chill and pop”. “Chill is slow and cosy, and pop ensures that everything is colourful … [we wanted] a very universal cuteness,” she says. As I make friends with a Pidgey, build a straw bed for a sleepy Charmander and field a request from an amusingly emo Umbreon who desires a black-painted home, it’s certainly very cute. For Ayano, Pokopia offered a chance to let the cutest Pokémon shine: creatures that are usually cast aside in the mainline games in favour of stronger battlers.\n\nPlaying as a Pokémon rather than the games’ usual human protagonists, you can fully understand – and converse with – every species of Pokémon, and given that Pokémon’s writing is normally pretty bland, the dialogue has unexpected personality. “Because there are no trainers in the game, we really thought about how the Pokémon communicate with each other,” says Takuto Edagawa, Pokopia’s director. “What are they thinking? How are they feeling? We made sure that if you put one piece of furniture anywhere in the world, Pokémon will react based on their personalities. I really liked how it came out.”\n\nPokopia is the first spin-off game that Game Freak has worked on directly, and Ohmori suggests that it may have influenced the direction of future mainline Pokémon games. “Battles have always been the focus, but there are so many [other elements] to these games, and I believe that fans have enjoyed these components as well,” he says. “I would like to show this more and scale the Pokémon games up, outside of battling. And I would like the Pokémon franchise to seek new possibilities to grow the Pokémon world.”\n\nPokopia is released on 5 March; £58.99/$69.99",

    "description": "Bitcoin's struggles are rooted in the wild world of meme coins, with investors fatigued by constant celebrity-backed tokens that quickly plunge, Gerber said.",
    "fullText": "One year into Donald Trump's presidency, bitcoin is worth less than it was before he was elected, and the entire market is in the throes of a crypto winter. According to famed investor Ross Gerber, blame the meme coin ecosystem for the broader decline.\n\nThe CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management thinks the launch of the Trump and Melania coins around the time of the inauguration, followed by a subsequent boom in meme tokens, has left investors fatigued and wary of digital assets.\n\nIn his view, meme coins either endorsed or launched by celebrities are either rug pulls or end up looking like one. In either case, normal investors are left holding the bag while celebrity boosters get rich.\n\nHe pointed to World Liberty Financial Coin and the Melania token, which have both plummeted in price, while the Trump meme coin has also shed about 80% of its value in the last year.\n\n\"People dive in and buy this stuff because they buy into the fraud, basically, and then they get burned, and that money doesn't come back. It's stolen from them.\"\n\nThis is only part of the problem that Gerber sees. When people lose money betting on meme coins, he added, they typically turn their back on crypto and don't come back. He also thinks the Trump administration's looser approach to crypto regulation is making the market less appealing to everyday investors.\n\nHe said it is extremely difficult for bitcoin to rally when investors are being scared away from crypto, as demand rises only when new participants enter the market.\n\nGerber also cited other celebrity-launched cryptos, such as the token launched by former NYC mayor Eric Adams and the $HAWK coin launched by internet personality Haliey Welch, as examples of celebrities meme coins that plummeted shortly after they debuted, while leaving investors holding the bag.\n\nGerber isn't the only one arguing that a growing lack of faith in crypto is compromising bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Economist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, recently argued that it will be hard for bitcoin to rise again until institutional investors increase their participation.",

    "fullText": "The International Cricket Council has been urged to review the rules concerning 12th man duties which denied Scott Currie the chance to play for Scotland at the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nPoole-born Currie, 24, has played three one-day internationals for Scotland having qualified for the Saltires through his Scottish father.\n\nPotentially he could have been lining up to play for Scotland against England in Kolkata on Saturday, alongside brother Brad, only to be deemed ineligible for the tournament because of ICC red tape.\n\nThe Hampshire all-rounder was called up by England for a three-match T20 international series against Ireland last September as a replacement for the injured Saqib Mahmood.\n\nCurrie was not picked in England's playing XI for any of the matches which took place in Malahide, but because he undertook 12th man duties he is now ineligible for Scotland for three years.\n\nSection 2.2 of the ICC's player eligibility regulations state that Currie \"participated\" as a \"non-playing official substitute\".\n\nCricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade said the ICC ruling seems \"quite strange\" compared to other sports.\n\nUnder the rules governing football and rugby union, Currie would have been eligible to play for Scotland having not won an official cap.\n\n\"I don't know when that rule was last looked at, so maybe it is time to have a re-look at that and confirm that what is in place is correct or whether alterations are needed,\" Lindblade told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Is that rule still relevant today in that evolution of our sport where players do move around a lot more from that perspective?\"\n\nUnder ICC regulations players can switch allegiances from associate countries like Scotland to full members like England immediately provided they meet all the other qualification requirements, but they must wait three years the other way.\n\nCurrie declined to comment but has previously spoken of his \"immense pride\" at playing international cricket for Scotland.\n\n\"Taking the field with my brother [Brad], knowing what is means to my old man and his side of the family, is something that always puts a smile on face,\" he said last year.\n\nAn ICC spokesperson told BBC Sport that should a member \"wish to revisit this clause\" then it can be \"raised and discussed, in the first instance, at a men's cricket committee meeting later this month\".\n\nListen to the full interview with Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade broadcast on 31 January on BBC Stumped.\n\nEngland too 'careful' in defeat by Windies - Brook\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Four-time world champion Max Verstappen says the new cars in Formula 1 this year are \"not a lot of fun\" and \"like Formula E on steroids\".\n\nThe Red Bull driver says the increased demands for energy management with new hybrid engines are \"just not Formula 1\".\n\nThe new engines are energy starved because of the way the rules have been structured and require several kinds of recovery to ensure the battery has sufficient levels of charge for optimum lap times.\n\nThis is leading to unusual forms of driving, such as not accelerating out of the final corner before a qualifying lap, lifting and coasting to save energy when trying for ultimate performance, and changing down to lower gears in corners for optimum energy harvesting.\n\nAston Martin 'look four seconds off top teams'\n\nVerstappen, whose team have built their own engine for the first time this season, said: \"The right word is management. But on the other hand, I also know how much work has been going on in the background. Also from the engine side, for the guys. So it's not always the nicest thing to say.\n\n\"But I also want to be realistic. As a driver, the feeling is not very Formula 1-like. It feels a bit more like Formula E on steroids.\n\n\"As a pure driver, I enjoy driving flat out. And at the moment, you cannot drive like that. There's a lot going on.\n\n\"A lot of what you do as a driver, in terms of inputs, has a massive effect on the energy side of things.\n\n\"For me, that's just not Formula 1. Maybe it's better to drive Formula E, right? Because that's all about energy efficiency and management. That's what they stand for. Driving-wise, it's not so fun.\"\n\nHe added: \"All the good drivers will be able to adapt to it. That's not the problem, but it's just the whole way of racing is changing, and I would say less pure.\n\n\"I just want normal driving, just how it should be, without having to, 'oh, if I brake a bit longer or less or more, or one gear up or down', you know, stuff like that, that it so heavily impacts the performance on the straights.\"\n\nThe all-electric Formula E series has become known for featuring heavy energy management to ensure cars can get to the end of the races without running out of charge.\n\nF1 is not in the same situation. Rather than a single amount of charge that depletes from maximum to empty from the beginning of the race to the end as in Formula E, the batteries in F1 will go from full charge to very low and back again several times a lap.\n\nBut Verstappen's point is that a lack of energy to run flat out all the time is taking the sport away from its traditional form of driving.\n\nSenior figures in F1 have cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the new rules at such an early stage when everything about the cars is new.\n\nThe biggest regulation change in F1 history has this year seen new rules for chassis, engines, tyres and the introduction of sustainable fuels.\n\nThe engines have a near 50-50 split between the internal combustion and electrical parts and have three times as much electrical power as last year with a battery of more or less the same size.\n\nThere are ways the rules could have been constructed to ensure energy management was not such a feature, for example by slightly reducing the power of the hybrid element and allowing the engines to use more fuel, or even by allowing recovery of energy from the front axle as well as the rear. But none of those have so far been allowed.\n\nOn the chassis side, a straight-line mode has been introduced which reduces drag from the front and rear wings specifically to aid energy recovery. The tyres have been made narrower for the same reasons. And the cars are smaller and lighter and have less grip and downforce.\n\nThe cars recover energy in four ways:\n\nRunning the engine at high revs in corners\n\nLifting off early and coasting at the end of straights\n\nRunning the electrical motor against the engine at 100% throttle\n\nVerstappen is considering competing in the Nurburgring 24 Hours at the famous 14-mile long Nordschleife circuit this year in a GT car - a modified road car.\n\nVerstappen said: \"Looking at it now, at least maybe I can drive flat out there, without looking after my battery. I mean, I want to do it, we are working on it to make it happen, but I cannot confirm it yet.\"\n\nF1 2026 cars in pictures at Bahrain testing\n\nActive aero and overtake mode - F1's new terminology\n\nCadillac unveil split livery in Super Bowl advert\n\nRussell 'wants to go head-to-head' with Verstappen\n\nBarcelona 'shakedown' offers first hints of F1 2026\n\nBiggest rule change ever and Brit teen - what's new in F1 in 2026?",

    "fullText": "Marc Cucurella has been an absolute soldier for Chelsea in the last two years, playing a crazy number of games in a really demanding position.\n\nThe addition of Jorrel Hato this summer was supposed to help him out, but the Dutchman has not proved himself reliable yet, and time again Chelsea have to turn to Cucurella.\n\nThe pressure on his body finally told against Leeds on Tuesday night, when he was taken off with a hamstring problem. In an update in his press conference yesterday, Liam Rosenior said that the club were still awaiting scans to see how bad the damage was.\n\nMarc Cucurella looks sad. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\nSigns from Spain aren’t good. Joaquin Marota reports for AS that the Spanish football federation are “worried” about a potential muscular problem, with the World Cup closing in.\n\nThey say that the full back will have an MRI today to discover the full extent of the damage. The Spaniard has already been ruled out of tomorrow’s FA Cup game, and even in the best case it feels likely that he misses the league game a week after that too. That gives him two and a half weeks to try and recover to face Arsenal on March 1st.\n\nAtletico Madrid have been linked with a summer move for Pedro Neto, but at the moment the main transfer sources are saying that’s unlikely. We certainly don’t see the reported £80m price as realistic – although if it was, Chelsea would have a hard time saying no to such a profit.\n\nOne player taking a fair bit of flak recently has been Alejandro Garnacho. Fans want to see more, and Liam Rosenior has even been forced to defender him pretty openly in recent press conferences.",

    "fullText": "In the normal WNBA calendar, February is generally a good time to check in on the state of the draft. The college season is about three-fourths complete, allowing for ample scouting of the domestic prospects. The European and Australian seasons are in full swing as well for international prospects.\n\nOf course, this isn’t a normal WNBA offseason. The college and international seasons have proceeded according to plan, but without a new CBA, there has been no free agency and not a single trade since the Nov. 23 draft lottery, when The Athletic published its first mock draft of this season. As a result, the draft order is the same as it was in November — it actually remains undecided, as we still don’t know where in the 15-team order expansion teams will select.\n\nNevertheless, enough time has passed and enough has changed in the evaluation of this year’s class to warrant another mock draft. Expect a lot more movement once the WNBA’s offseason begins in earnest.\n\nDallas should be the biggest winner of 2026 free agency. With the league’s newest superstar Paige Bueckers under contract and a practice facility scheduled to open in April, the Wings have two enormous carrots to dangle in front of the league’s best players, and as has been repeated ad nauseam, almost every veteran in the WNBA is available to change teams. If all goes according to plan, this is the last time Dallas will be drafting in the lottery in the foreseeable future. As a result, the Wings should take a big swing, and that swing is Awa Fam.\n\nThe 19-year-old is a fantastic athlete and already shows veteran instincts on the defensive end. Her upside as a rim protector and play finisher is the highest in the class. It’s worth noting her offense hasn’t exactly popped in EuroLeague, as she’s averaging seven points and less than six rebounds this season. But Fam is still playing more than 20 minutes per game against the highest level of European competition and holding her own as a teenager. That usually bodes well for WNBA prospects.\n\nThe length of Awa Fam has been evident in some brief 1Q moments vs Estepona, but there’s this one:\n\n– able to block Sika Kone (W-level player) after a slip & finish attempt https://t.co/UpvqFv15st pic.twitter.com/TkbeCnprrV\n\n— Alford Corriette (@alfcorriette) February 7, 2026\n\nWNBA talent evaluators have been waiting five years to see Azzi Fudd healthy and playing consistently. The UConn guard has finally delivered in her super senior season. She has played every game and is averaging career-bests in points (17.4), assists (3.0) and steals (2.4). She is also shooting the absolute leather off the ball. Even after a relative slump during January, Fudd is making 53 percent of her 2s and 45 percent of her 3s. She doesn’t get to the line much but is near automatic when she does, missing only two free throws all season.\n\nFudd still doesn’t project as a No. 1 scoring option. Her handle is a little limited, and she has used only eight percent of her possessions in isolation or as a pick-and-roll ballhandler, per Synergy. But she is particularly valuable as a spot-up threat in the half court and in transition with her high, steady release, and she is equally excellent coming off screens and handoffs. Fudd has also been a high-impact defender. She is an easy fit on any roster, especially a franchise that has historically valued Huskies products.\n\nMiles’ drop from my last mock draft has little to do with her own production and more to do with Fudd’s ascent. In her first season at TCU, Miles has been as dominant as ever running the show, even with an entirely new set of teammates. She can make every read and every pass in the halfcourt and in transition, and when defenses play her as a scorer, Miles gets to the rim and scores efficiently. The swing skill with Miles was her 3-point shooting, and though she hasn’t been as productive as she was in 2024-25 at Notre Dame, she is still making 35.2 percent of her triples and 39 percent of her catch-and-shoot attempts. Considering Miles has also improved her free-throw percentage to 85.2 percent, her jumper should be plenty good enough for the pro level and force defenders to stay honest with her on the perimeter.\n\nThe main drawback with Miles is her lack of defensive playmaking, but that’s less important at point guard than at any other position. Her turnover rate is also a smidge high; however, that’s the creativity tax for her audacious passing.\n\nThe Mystics hope to have their center of the future in Shakira Austin. In his most recent public comments, Washington president Michael Winger said as much while acknowledging the uncertainty of her future as a restricted free agent. “I love Kira, I foresee her being a part of this team for a long time,” he said. “She’ll have the opportunity to explore her options. I hope that we are an attractive option for her.”\n\nIf Austin chooses to move on, what a great opportunity to reunite what should have been the latest in a long line of dominant Stanford frontcourt duos. Betts and Kiki Iriafen only played one season together in Palo Alto — and Betts barely saw the floor as a freshman — but their games have grown to complement each other. Iriafen has a smooth face-up game, and Betts thrives without the ball in her hands as a screener and on put-backs. While Iriafen can cover more mobile forwards and even perimeter players, Betts is a dominant paint defender, arguably the best rim protector in college basketball; opponents shoot 13 percent worse at the rim when Betts is in the game, per CBB Analytics.\n\nSydney Johnson developed the Mystics’ identity as a defensive team in his first season in Washington. With cornerstones already on the wing (Sonia Citron) and at power forward, Betts is another strong defensive piece to add to the young core.\n\nThe goal of this exercise wasn’t to recreate great college teams of recent memory, but it is a happy accident. Flau’jae Johnson could pair with not one, but two former LSU teammates in Chicago: Angel Reese and Hailey Van Lith. More importantly, the Sky need a perimeter shot creator.\n\nJohnson’s usage has decreased with the Tigers’ increased depth this season, but her efficiency is as good as ever. She gets such good lift on her jumper and excels off screens and as a spot-up shooter. Johnson is a force on the offensive glass, especially for her position. It’s a little concerning that she still isn’t LSU’s No. 1 option as a senior, but her Tigers keep winning, and she finds a way to help them find success no matter the surrounding context. Seeing Johnson under a coach who prioritizes offensive initiation from the wings would be interesting.\n\nThis is probably too high for a role player, even one as highly regarded as Jaquez. At some point, I might have to course correct. But everyone I’ve spoken to in the WNBA loves Jaquez. She can play multiple positions. She shoots well (62.9 percent on 2s, 43.8 percent on 3s and 87.5 percent on free throws), moves off the ball — UCLA scores a ridiculous 1.47 points per possession off of her cuts, per Synergy — and defends.\n\nEvery time Jaquez takes the floor, she seems to get a little better. If you’re building a culture from the ground up, you couldn’t do better than opting for the life Jaquez breathes into a program.\n\nThis is another pick that hasn’t changed since November. After winning the EuroLeague’s young player of the year award last season, Martín is averaging 12.5 points and 5.2 assists in EuroCup games in 2025-26. That would have been a top 10 assist mark among qualified players in the WNBA last season. Her team is 9-1 in those contests with a 20-year-old running point. Martín’s 3-point percentage has dropped 10 percent since last season, but her free-throw percentage has gone up by a similar margin to 82.8.\n\nThe French wave is inevitable. After the rapid success of Dominique Malonga and Leïla Lacan, there’s much less skepticism about French prospects and how they perceive the WNBA. France is developing an incredible generation of talent, and if those players want to come to the U.S., the WNBA is more than happy to have them.\n\nIt should come as little surprise that a foreign player is mocked to Golden State after the Valkyries rostered 10 internationals over the course of their debut season. Angloma is on the come-up thanks to a prolific scoring season in France’s top league. Opponents can’t stop Angloma from getting to the basket, even though she doesn’t have much of a jump shot. She’s averaging 16.2 points per game and earning 6.1 free-throw attempts per contest. At 19, she already has the physicality to survive in the league, though her jumper will have to improve to make her a viable shooting guard or small forward.\n\nKneepkens led the Big 12 in effective field-goal percentage and free-throw percentage last season, making 57 percent of her 2s, 45 percent of her 3s and 89 percent of her foul shots. Since transferring to UCLA, she has become even more efficient from every area. Kneepkens is simply one of the best shooters college basketball has seen in recent years, no matter her usage. The Bruins improve their effective field-goal percentage by 7.6 percent when Kneepkens is on the floor.\n\nShe uses an unorthodox form on her jump shot, but after five seasons in three conferences, there is enough of a track record to believe it will translate to the professional level. The Mystics took and made the fewest 3s in the WNBA in 2025. Bringing in an ace shooter like Kneepkens is a quick way to fix that.\n\nLeger-Walker is the second-best pure point guard in this class behind Miles, though her age (she turns 25 in September) limits her upside relative to Martín. Nevertheless, she knows how to run an offense and makes a mean skip pass. She’s also a bully on drives and has become a surprisingly good screen navigator on defense at UCLA after being a more inattentive defender during her Washington State days.\n\nAll of those attributes make her a useful complement to Caitlin Clark. Leger-Walker can give Clark opportunities to play off the ball, letting the Fever star come off screens and function as a movement shooter instead of having to bring the ball up and do all of the shot creation. Leger-Walker’s passing craft rivals Clark’s, allowing her to mimic some of Clark’s sets as a backup point guard.\n\nIndiana is trying to win now, and Leger-Walker has as much experience as possible for a rookie. In addition to her six years of college basketball, she has been playing for the New Zealand national team since age 16.\n\nKiki Rice has been the starting point guard for UCLA for four seasons, and I’m still uncertain if she can be a point guard in the pros. But the WNBA is trending more positionless; not every team needs a classic floor general if they have playmaking at other positions. And regardless of Rice’s position, she has enough certainties in her game. She defends the point of attack (she has the second-best defensive on-off differential for the Bruins behind Betts), she puts pressure on the rim, and she holds herself accountable. Rice shot 21.7 from 3-point range and 79.1 percent from the foul line as a freshman; those figures are 40 percent and 89.5 percent as a senior. Bring Rice home to D.C. and let her continue to improve through Washington’s rebuild.\n\nAnother balanced attack last night, 4️⃣ Bruins finished in double figures! #GoBruins pic.twitter.com/iF2e6k6fxk\n\n— UCLA Women’s Basketball (@UCLAWBB) February 10, 2026\n\nThe Sun have a ton of defensive talent on the perimeter with Lacan and Saniya Rivers. They don’t have much offensive pop. Let Latson change that. The adjustment to South Carolina has been a bit more uneven than Latson or the Gamecocks might have hoped, but she is still a fearsome scorer and dynamic downhill attacker; 47.4 percent of her shot attempts come within 4.5 feet of the rim, and she earns 5.8 free-throw attempts per game. Connecticut will have to find some stretch bigs to accommodate spacing challenges at other positions, but Latson will insist her way to the basket no matter who else is on the floor. The Sun could desperately use that type of player.\n\nThe Dream are building around Rhyne Howard, Allisha Gray and Naz Hillmon, and that trio needs an organizing force at point guard. That’s Raven Johnson. She controls pace, knows how to get all of her teammates involved and is loath to hijack possessions when a better option presents itself. She also has consistently helmed great defenses and makes dribbling difficult for opposing guards for 94 feet. If there were any consistency on her jump shot, she’d be a better prospect. Perhaps playing for Karl Smesko and being forced to launch from 3 will improve her confidence in her jumper.\n\nJackson looks like a 3-and-D player — she has a pro body and takes a high volume of 3-pointers, and she does so confidently. The stats don’t totally support that hypothesis, neither the shooting nor the defense, though her 3-pointer was much better in the two seasons before this one. Yet, Jackson has been heavily relied upon by some excellent Duke teams. She makes her foul shots, a rarity for the Blue Devils in the Kara Lawson era. She’s emerged as a valuable playmaker. She holds up well in one-on-one defense and has improved as a screen-and-roll defender as she learns how to navigate those offensive possessions. She has a lot of tools to like, even if the whole package hasn’t quite come together at Duke.\n\nThis pick could go in many directions. In addition to the three players listed below, Grace VanSlooten, Dariana Littlepage-Buggs and Janiah Barker were all considered here. VanSlooten is a personal favorite, but it’s hard to justify picking her when the Sun already have two young power forwards in Aneesah Morrow and Aaliyah Edwards. Ultimately, the spot goes to Okot. She does exactly what you want from a center: seals her defender, protects the paint and boxes out. Okot has shown massive improvement in just two years of college basketball, and she’s young for this class since she won’t turn 22 until August. There is so much room to grow.\n\nAlso considered: Maggie Doogan (Richmond), Tonie Morgan (Kentucky), Laila Phelia (Syracuse)\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nMinnesota Lynx, New York Liberty, Seattle Storm, Los Angeles Sparks, Washington Mystics, Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Indiana Fever, Dallas Wings, Las Vegas Aces, Phoenix Mercury, Duke Blue Devils, UCLA Bruins, South Carolina Gamecocks, TCU Horned Frogs, Connecticut Huskies, LSU Lady Tigers, Golden State Valkyries, Portland Fire, Toronto Tempo, WNBA, Women's College Basketball\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "According to a report from The Athletic, Liverpool remain hopeful of Ibrahima Konaté (26) signing a new contract with the club. The French international defender’s current deal at Anfield is set to expire at the end of the season, and there is no agreement between the two parties on a new contract.\n\nThe Premier League champions are currently enduring a difficult season domestically, which has seen the form of several key players drop, including the Frenchman at times. However, in recent weeks, the 26-year-old has returned to form. He was key in the Reds’ ending Sunderland’s unbeaten run at the Stadium of Light on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Merseyside outfit believes that the former RB Leipzig defender could follow the same pattern of his teammates in Mohamed Salah and Virgil Van Dijk by signing a new contract at the end of the season. Extending his contract at Anfield is not Konaté’s only option. Real Madrid are also interested in signing him on a free transfer.",

    "description": "The shift to gold looks to be fueled by trade tensions between the US other nations, and concerns about the growing deficit, David Einhorn said.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire David Einhorn thinks gold is well on its way to becoming the world's ultimate reserve asset.\n\nThe Green Light Capital founder said he believed the metal had already begun to replace US Treasurys as the top reserve asset among the world's central banks, attesting to its safe-haven status and shakier confidence in the US macro and fiscal outlook.\n\nEinhorn pointed to reports that China has told its banks to scale back its holdings of US Treasurys.\n\nMeanwhile, central banks' appetite for gold has been rising in recent years, he added. Central banks around the world purchased around 863 metric tons of the metal in 2025, according to data from the World Gold Council.\n\n\"The Chinese have decided they want to sort of want to compete on a currency basis. The central banks around the world are buying gold. Gold is becoming the reserve asset as opposed to Treasurys, or it's kind of mostly even at this point,\" Einhorn said.\n\nEinhorn, who said his firm had been investing in gold for more than a decade, pointed to two issues in particular he believed were making gold more attractive as a long-term investment compared to Treasurys:\n\n\"Our thesis on gold over the longer term is that our fiscal policies and our monetary policies don't make any sense,\" Einhorn said, adding that the US's growing deficit is unsustainable.\n\nThe demand for US Treasurys has been solid at recent auctions, but investors have been preoccupied with the idea that the US is losing its dominance in financial markets for the past several years.\n\nWorries about de-dollarization — the idea that the US dollar is losing its status as the world's reserve currency — began to pick up steam in 2022, when Russia and other BRICS nations shifted away from the greenback after being targeted by sanctions.\n\nFears of a broader shift away from the US intensified when President Donald Trump introduced tariffs last year, triggering a \"Sell America\" episode among foreign investors that has continued to flare up periodically since. The sentiment has also popularized the debasement trade, with investors scooping up hard assets out of fear that the US dollar and other fiat currencies will lose their value.",

    "fullText": "Today, Windows 11 powers over a billion devices and supports millions of apps across business, creativity, education, gaming and productivity. For decades, our commitment to openness and compatibility, in partnership with our global community of developers, has enabled a rich and enduring ecosystem. However, users are increasingly seeing apps override their settings, install additional software or alter core Windows experiences without their awareness or consent. And your feedback is clear: Windows must both remain an open platform and be secure by default — protecting the integrity of your experience regardless of the apps installed. Our developers and ecosystem partners echo this need. They have called for stronger, more consistent security foundations in the operating system. Windows is evolving to take more accountability to place you firmly in a consent‑first model by making app and AI agent behavior transparent, decisions reversible and access limited to clearly approved capabilities. At the same time, we remain committed to app compatibility and will provide developers with the tools and guidance needed to adapt to this strengthened security model.\n\nMicrosoft has made security a top priority, investing deeply through company‑wide efforts like the Secure Future Initiative to make Windows more secure by default and focused on helping organizations prevent, manage and recover from incidents through the Windows Resiliency Initiative along with our ecosystem partners. We’ve strengthened Windows with security controls designed to meet customer needs, delivered through capabilities like Smart App Control and Administrator protection. Building on this, we are starting new SFI efforts for Windows Baseline Security Mode and User Transparency and Consent in Windows. This establishes a more robust security model that advances app transparency and user consent, with features that make app behavior more visible and app permissions easier to understand and manage.\n\nWith Windows Baseline Security Mode, Windows will move toward operating with runtime integrity safeguards enabled by default. These safeguards ensure that only properly signed apps, services and drivers are allowed to run, helping to protect the system from tampering or unauthorized changes. Users and IT administrators will still have the flexibility to override these safeguards for specific apps when needed. Developers can also check whether these protections are active and whether any exceptions have been granted — giving them insight and control over the conditions under which their apps run.\n\nWith User Transparency and Consent, we are bringing a more consistent and intuitive approach to how Windows communicates security decisions. Just like on your smartphone, Windows will now prompt you when apps try to access sensitive resources — like your files, camera or microphone — or when they attempt to install other unintended software. These prompts are designed to be clear and actionable, and you’ll always have the ability to review and change your choices later. Apps and AI agents will also be expected to meet higher transparency standards, giving both users and IT administrators better visibility into their behaviors. These updates raise the bar for security and privacy on Windows, while giving you more control and confidence in how your system and data are accessed.\n\nWindows has a long-standing tradition as an open platform. We will continue to preserve what has made it successful: freedom to install any app and openness to every developer. Building on that foundation, Windows Baseline Security Mode and User Transparency and Consent are grounded in a set of principles that put users clearly at the center.\n\nWe recognize that change takes time. That’s why this will roll out through a phased approach guided by clear principles – developed in close partnership with developers, enterprises and ecosystem partners to ensure a smooth and thoughtful transition. We’ve already begun this work alongside some of them to shape the early direction. We’re learning and adjusting from their feedback and perspectives as we refine our approach to stronger security, user transparency and consent, and how this evolution of Windows supports their needs.\n\nJacob DePriest, CISO and CIO at 1Password, says, “We’re excited to see Microsoft’s commitment to hardening desktop app security by making app behavior more transparent and strengthening security by default. As more people continue to rely on SaaS apps, agents and AI-driven tools, clarity and consent at the operating system level are critical to protecting sensitive data without adding friction. The focus on user transparency and choice for security is something we deeply value at 1Password.”\n\nMichael Draper, VP of Global Consumer Trust at Adobe, says “Adobe has always taken a proactive approach to security and we are collaborating across the ecosystem to strengthen customer protection. These efforts align with our broader focus on trust and we appreciate the opportunity to work alongside companies that share this commitment to keeping people safe.”\n\nAlex Ionescu, Chief Technology Innovation Officer at CrowdStrike, says, “CrowdStrike is looking forward to being an early partner in the development of a new, more secure and resilient runtime model for Windows applications, which helps raise the bar for user security and privacy. When applications and agentic workloads are well-behaved and respect user consent settings with proper security boundaries, security software can better protect users from attackers with reduced performance overhead.”\n\nElise Murphy, Head of Game Security at Electronic Arts, says, “At EA, delivering great player experiences through fair and competitive play is foundational to how we build games. We support platform initiatives that build stronger foundations for security and integrity, and raise the cost of cheating.”\n\nRaycast is a popular productivity tool used by developers and professionals. Thomas Paul Mann, Co-founder and CEO of Raycast, says, “At Raycast, privacy and security have always been core to how we build. As a tool that works deeply with Windows, we believe users deserve full transparency about what apps can do. This matters even more as AI agents start to act on their behalf. We’re excited to support User Transparency and Consent and shape it together.”\n\nNow, we’re expanding the conversation to our broader community. Through upcoming blogs and dedicated feedback channels, we’ll invite you to engage with us, share your insights and help refine this journey. Together, we can strengthen the Windows ecosystem and build the next 40 years of innovation — grounded in trust, transparency and user consent.",

    "description": "The Nations League does not carry the prestige of other competitions, but Thursday's draw still carries huge importance to Scotland and the Tartan Army.",
    "fullText": "Who needs the Nations League? Now Steve Clarke has ended decades of heartache and taken Scotland to the World Cup, does anything else matter?\n\nUnderstandably, ever since December's gala draw for the summer's finals in North America, every Scotland fan has been consumed with thoughts of facing Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.\n\nThe prospect of partying at the finals for the first time since 1998 has given long-suffering supporters plenty to savour and there's been no need to look beyond, nor anything definite to anticipate.\n\nThat changes the Nations League draw in Belgium on Thursday evening, when Scotland's opponents for matches in the second half of 2026 are confirmed.\n\nCompared to Fifa's festival of football, or even the Euros, it's small potatoes, of course, but these games could hold huge importance for tournaments to come and the development of the national team after their tests in North America.\n\nHow does the Nations League work and when is the draw?\n\nAnother plot twist in Scottish title race for the ages\n\nSince being introduced in 2018 in an attempt to add more structure to the international calendar and phase out meaningless friendlies, the competition has followed a familiar format.\n\nNational teams are split into four tiers based on promotion and relegation from the last edition, theoretically putting sides of the same level together.\n\nEach of these tiers are split into groups of four and there's promotion and relegation through the divisions. The best teams in League A then go on into a knock-out finals tournament the following summer with the champions crowned at the end. Simple.\n\nScotland played in the top flight in the last edition back in 2024 but finished in third place in their group behind eventual champions Portugal and Croatia. That put the national team in a play-off to fight for survival and defeat by Greece meant relegation to League B.\n\nRevenge on the Greeks was served in the successful World Cup qualification last year, of course, but Thursday's draw will put Scotland back in familiar territory in the second tier of the Nations League.\n\nScotland are in Pot 1 of the League B draw, but a quick look at the possible opposition puts paid to any ideas that it means an easy draw.\n\nHungary, Poland and Israel are the only sides Scotland cannot face, but with the likes of Switzerland, Republic of Ireland and Sweden as a potential group of opponents, fans won't be taking success for granted. Though do we ever?\n\nPot 1: Scotland, Hungary, Poland, Israel\n\nPot 2: Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria, Ukraine\n\nPot 3: Slovenia, Georgia, Republic of Ireland, Romania\n\nPot 4: Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Kosovo\n\nScotland will play each opponent home and away, with the fixtures grouped into three double-headers in September, October and November.\n\nGroup winners are promoted automatically, runners-up go into a play-off against a League A side, third faces a relegation play-off and fourth takes a drop straight into League C.\n\nEven eight years after its introduction, the competition does not have the allure of its counterparts, but it is still an important part of the international calendar, especially for Scotland.\n\nHead coach Clarke has spoken repeatedly about how his players need to face strong opposition to keep improving.\n\nThis time around, they will not be playing Europe's elite, but competitive games against sides of a similar level present a good test and strong preparation for the next set of European Championship qualifiers.\n\nPromotion brings prestige, glamour games next time around and prize money, but arguably the real prizes come in how a successful campaign sets Scotland up for the future.\n\nThe seeding for qualification campaigns and finals is always a complicated affair, but there is one simple truth that applies to them all. Winning games pushes a team up the rankings and into a better position - and winning competitive games is more valuable than victory in friendlies.\n\nThere is also the importance of a good Nations League as a lifeline to reach major finals. Four teams who failed to qualify for the World Cup directly have been given a second chance through the play-offs due to their Nations League record.\n\nAnd let us not forget that Scotland's long exodus from a major finals was ended because of a Nations League lifeline – the emotion of the play-off victory in Serbia that sealed a place at Euro 2020 was only possible because of a strong campaign.\n\nIt should not be the case that the national team needs a similar chance to reach Euro 2028, but a horrible set of circumstances could arise that make Nations League success essential.\n\nAs co-hosts of the tournament, the idea of Scotland not making the finals and seeing fans of other nations celebrating at Hampden in unthinkable.\n\nHowever, with four nations hosting the finals, Scotland, England, Wales and Republic of Ireland all have to go through the qualification campaign.\n\nIn an ideal world, the national team succeeds there and books a place, with three group games at Hampden guaranteed.\n\nUefa has set aside two places for host nations who fail to qualify in an attempt to make sure all four are in the tournament proper.\n\nHowever, if more than two of the four fail to qualify automatically, it comes down to qualifying ranking and Scotland could conceivably miss out altogether.\n\nIn that specific case, having a play-off place banked from the Nations League would be heaven sent.\n\nThere is one other intriguing footnote to the draw: it could set up the opposition for the next Scotland head coach's first game in charge.\n\nClarke's contract expires after the World Cup and there is no indication if he will carry on in the job, regardless of what happens at the finals.\n\nIf Clarke does leave in the summer, his successor's first matches will be in the Nations League and a new era for the national team will begin when League B kicks off.\n\nBBC Scotland will have live text coverage of the Nations League draw from 17:00 GMT.",

    "fullText": "When Trent Alexander-Arnold came off the bench in Real Madrid's 2-0 win against Valencia last weekend, there was much anticipation around the former Liverpool right-back's return.\n\nAfter another two months on the sideline, Real supporters had seen very little of the England defender this season.\n\nSince joining the Spanish side in June 2025, he has been limited to just 17 appearances in all competitions.\n\nTwo separate injuries have disrupted his rhythm and denied him the sustained run of games needed to build momentum and a connection with supporters.\n\nThe relationship he built with Xabi Alonso became redundant when the manager was sacked after less than eight months in charge.\n\nNow though, he is fit again and the timing feels significant. The season is entering its decisive stretch and Alexander-Arnold has the opportunity to reassert himself.\n\nWhy are Real Madrid players training in masks?\n\nHasty or a shrewd move? Madrid in shock at swift Arbeloa appointment\n\nAfter a strong Club World Cup, where he started five of Madrid's six matches, Alexander-Arnold began the 2025–26 season sharing right-back duties with Dani Carvajal.\n\nSpanish media praised his early performances, noting he \"showcased his trademark ability to drift inside from full-back\".\n\nBut his campaign was soon disrupted. A hamstring injury in Madrid's opening Champions League game in September put him out for seven weeks and was described by local media as \"a blow to Trent's new chapter\".\n\nHis comeback in November felt particularly poignant as he faced his former club Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nHe subsequently made five more appearances, with Spanish newspaper AS suggesting that \"the initial criticism [of Alexander-Arnold] revealed a lack of understanding of the footballing ability the England international has always possessed\".\n\nMomentum was building and fans were beginning to see the benefits of their star signing, but a thigh injury against Athletic Club in December left him injured and recovering for another two months.\n\nThe 27-year-old admitted he was \"absolutely gutted\".\n\nThat setback kept him out for 14 matches, until his long-awaited return last weekend.\n\nDespite only playing for the final 15 minutes of the match, Alexander-Arnold's return was met with largely positive reaction from supporters.\n\nOn social media, the Madridistas didn't hold back:\n\n\"Trent Alexander-Arnold's minutes against Valencia felt like a prime performance. Our style of play even changed!\"\n\n\"Trent Alexander-Arnold completely changed the game when he came on. Does he deserve to start every match?\"\n\n\"His passes are so satisfying. Football has missed him.\"\n\nThe brief but impressive appearance has raised expectations, especially with the first leg of Real Madrid's Champions League knockout tie against Benfica looming next week.\n\nYet head coach Alvaro Arbeloa was quick to manage the excitement, emphasising that full recovery remains the priority.\n\n\"After being out for a long time, we are taking the same approach with him as with others returning from injury,\" said Arbeloa.\n\n\"We are proceeding cautiously and calmly because what we want is for him to find his rhythm, his best playing form. That's how it will be with Trent.\"\n\nIt was the first time Arbeloa had publicly addressed Alexander-Arnold, and the comments put to rest earlier rumours suggesting he might not feature in his long-term plans - speculation that Real Madrid had carefully shielded the England international from.\n\nThis was a clear signal that Alexander-Arnold remains central to the club's long-term vision. And, as a former Liverpool and Real Madrid right-back himself, Arbeloa may be uniquely placed to help strengthen their relationship off the pitch.\n\nWith Federico Valverde moving back into a central midfield role following Jude Bellingham's recent injury, Real Madrid's right-back picture has shifted, opening the door for Alexander-Arnold to feature more prominently in that position against Benfica and beyond.\n\nArbeloa now has all his options available on that flank: captain Dani Carvajal, Alexander-Arnold (who played ahead of Carvajal against Valencia), Valverde as an emergency option, and academy player David Jimenez, who started in Valencia.\n\nCarvajal's season has been equally frustrating, having battled a series of injuries as well as knee surgery.\n\nDespite now being fit and available, he has barely played any minutes under Arbeloa. In fact, his last start was in September. It's a complex situation given his contract expires in the summer and there appears to have been little progress in renewing it.\n\nThat context places Alexander-Arnold in a strong position to become Madrid's leading option at right-back once fully fit, with Valverde still available as an emergency alternative and Jimenez also impressing when called upon.\n\nWhether Alexander-Arnold will be eased back into the starting XI as he builds fitness, or whether he will leap straight into a key role, given the significance of upcoming fixtures, remains to be seen as Arbeloa manages the reintegration.\n\nIt would be fair to say that, at this stage of the season, Alexander-Arnold's chances of making England's squad for this summer's World Cup appear slim, with his limited minutes at club level the most obvious reason.\n\nInternational selection is usually built on form and fitness, and the England coaching staff are likely to prioritise players who are consistently competing at the highest level.\n\nHe has not had the chance to demonstrate the consistency required to challenge for a place.\n\nHe was omitted from Thomas Tuchel's World Cup qualifying squad in August, with the England coach saying: \"There's no doubt I'm a big fan of Trent, for his talent and his personality. But for this call-up, I've gone with Reece James and Tino Livramento.\n\n\"I know he wanted to be here, which is very important. I just chose others due to competition.\"\n\nEven if Alexander‑Arnold delivers spectacular performances for Real Madrid over the coming weeks, the competition for the England right-back position remains strong.\n\nWith Tuchel preparing to finalise his squad for friendly matches against Uruguay and Japan on 27 and 31 March respectively, selections are likely to prioritise players who have been performing consistently week in, week out.\n\nStill, as Tuchel himself emphasised: \"He's a great player who will always be in contention.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Matt Weston underlined his status as the world's best skeleton pilot by setting the track record on his way to taking a significant halfway lead at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe two-time world champion - Team GB's biggest medal hope in Milan-Cortina -put down a statement second run to open an advantage of 0.30 seconds over the field, with two medal-deciding runs to come on Friday.\n\nWeston was the only slider under 56 seconds as he clocked 55.88secs in heat two, to add to his 56.21secs in run one on the new Cortina sliding track.\n\nAfter a frustrating opening run, which began with a costly bump against the wall near the top of the track, Weston was clearly annoyed with his performance.\n\nBut, under pressure from two German sliders, he tidied up those errors with a slick and highly impressive second run, shaving 0.33secs off his opening effort, to give him an overall time of one minute 52.09secs.\n\n\"I was quite annoyed after the first run. I tried to be a bit too relaxed because I tried to over-compensate for race-day nerves,\" Weston said.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy [to be the overnight leader] but I take every run as run one. I will completely reset myself, switch off for a bit and then re-focus on Friday.\"\n\nGiven skeleton medals are often decided by hundredths of a second, Weston's fist pumps at the end of his second run were not only a sign of his elation at a cleaner run, but also marking the significance of his advantage.\n\nCompatriot Marcus Wyatt sits seventh with a combined time of 1:53.21 - 0.66secs outside of the medal places.\n\nWyatt, 34, was also a strong medal contender coming into the Games but has struggled on the technical Cortina track and a podium-finish already seems like a tough ask.\n\nAxel Jungk, silver medallist in Beijing four years ago, is in second place with a time of 1:52.39 while fellow German and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer is third with 1:52.55.\n\nThe final two heats will take be shown live on the BBC from 18:30 GMT on Friday with all four run times added together to give an overall result.\n\nWeston arrived in Cortina as Team GB's best hope of a gold medal but now has the added pressure that he is likely to be chasing a first medal of these Games for the British team following a series of misses for the nation's other hopefuls.\n\nHe has been the dominant slider of recent seasons on the global stage, claiming five race wins and two further podium finishes this season as he won a third successive World Cup title.\n\n\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston said.\n\n\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"\n\nThe build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by 'helmet-gate' - with the British team hoping to a wear a new design in Italy.\n\nThe helmet was banned by the sport's governing body - the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Foundation (IBSF) - who said it did not comply with rules around shape as the back of the helmet protrudes, giving an aerodynamic advantage.\n\nThe British team lost an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to overturn the decision, meaning they could not wear them at the Games.\n\nThe athletes said they were unphased by the issue and pointed out that all of their success this season has come with the old helmets.\n\nGB have long been a dominant force in skeleton, winning medals at every Games since the sport was reinstated to the programme in 2002.\n\nThat was until 2022, when Team GB failed to win a medal in what was a disappointing Olympic campaign in Beijing.\n\nWeston's 15th-place finish was the highest of the four British athletes competing on the Yanqing track with Wyatt coming 16th.\n\nWeston thought about quitting the sport after that but four years later looks primed to fulfil his promise on the Olympic stage.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

On the pitch, they meet frequently, as PSG and Bayern Munich can’t seem to avoid each other in the UEFA Champions League. Off the pitch, Upa seems glad that his childhood friend has reached the pinnacle of world football.\n\n“We went to the same school, we played on the same pitches, I played against him as kids,” said Upamecano (via @iMiaSanMia). “Honestly, I don’t have the words. We all knew he would become a great player, but still… When I saw him lift the Ballon d’Or, it brought tears to my eyes.”\n\n“I should have been there for the ceremony, but I couldn’t come. Seeing him thank his mother, his family, his friends, Moustapha, everyone who was there… It was a wonderful moment.”\n\nUpamecano and Dembélé could potentially face each other again this season, depending on how far their respective clubs go in the Champions League. When that happens, all bets are off. In the meantime, this little anecdote shows that these players are human, and have a history that stretches beyond the football pitch.",

    "fullText": "Chris Gotterup’s rapid rise through the world rankings has already seen him reach the top five, and the PGA Tour star has since opened up on what’s changed for him.\n\nChris Gotterup has broken into the top five of the Official World Golf Rankings after a phenomenal start to his 2026 PGA Tour campaign.\n\nGotterup hasn’t just been playing well – he’s looked completely at ease under pressure. He picked up two wins in his first three starts this year, and each time he found himself in contention, he looked right at home.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that Gotterup was ranked outside the top-200 in golf. Fast forward to now, and there are plenty who believe he’s got what it takes to challenge Scottie Scheffler this year.\n\nGotterup has usually been a slow starter in his PGA Tour career, until this season.\n\nHe missed eight cuts in his first 12 events last year, with his best finish being a T-16 at the Puerto Rico Open.\n\nThe season before that, he missed five cuts and withdrew from another event, with his top result being a T-35 at the Cognizant Classic.\n\nThis year is different. Gotterup has hit the ground running in 2026, and there’s a clear reason behind the change.\n\nHe moved from Oklahoma to Florida during the offseason. This allowed him to practice and play all winter without interruption, keeping his game sharp heading into the new year.\n\nChris Gotterup’s move to Florida appears to have had an immediate impact on his game. The change in climate gave him the opportunity to stay sharp throughout the off-season, something that wasn’t possible during the colder, windier winters in Oklahoma.\n\nAfter the first round of the Sony Open in January, he spoke about how beneficial that move had been.\n\n“Yeah, I made a move this offseason down to Florida for hopefully reasons like this,” he said. “Feel like my game is in better shape just because I’ve been putting in more work at home.”\n\nThat improvement has already shown itself on the course. His natural swing allows him to shape shots both ways and control ball flight with ease.\n\nThis season alone, Gotterup has already collected two PGA Tour wins and there’s every reason to believe more could be on the way soon.\n\nRory McIlroy highlights what Scottie Scheffler is the first to do since Tiger Woods\n\nJohnson Wagner disagrees with Brandel Chamblee’s ‘infuriating’ opinion on The Players Championship\n\nThe score that Peter Finch shot over 18 holes at Pebble Beach weeks before the PGA Tour plays there",

    "fullText": "PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox, Switch 2; Tarsier Studios\nChildhood terrors come to wretched life in a grim fairytale of a puzzle-platformer that’s as beautifully macabre as it is hard to put down\n\n“I thought you were dead,” are the first words you’ll hear from the child protagonists of this horror puzzle-platformer. It’s your first sign that things were going badly long before you got here. Exploring dark waves and desolated urban environments in a rowboat, they’re on a search for their lost friends across a world of rabid, malformed entities. As the children struggle with their outsize fears, so will you, but you’ve at least got the option to play co-op if you want someone on the couch to brave the horrors with.\n\nIn the early 2000s, irreverent gaming blog Old Man Murray pioneered the “crate review system”. The rubric was simple: the sooner the player encountered their first wooden cube of heinous mediocrity, the more uninspired the game. Updating this method for 2026, we’ve got a few new contenders: how soon before you shimmy slowly through a gap, boost a companion over a high ledge so they can pull you up or tediously rotate some mechanism with the analogue stick? Reanimal pulls out all these hits within the first 20 minutes and, by the time the credits roll, six hours in, it feels as if developer Tarsier has wrung the final drops of interactive novelty from its formula of light exploration puzzles, tense but simple stealth and ghastly chases. And yet this grim fairytale is still difficult to put down.\n\nTarsier’s Little Nightmares games were rightly praised for how their imposing and exaggerated worlds hold up a creepy funhouse mirror to a child’s thoughts and fears. Adults are gangly and terrifying; work is bizarre; bureaucracy is uncanny. Reanimal draws from that same well of fear, but with occasional riffs that feel at odds with childhood disempowerment, such as moments where the kids pilot a tank, or find a big honking bazooka.\n\nThe world’s worn and weary architecture feels fascinatingly wretched, with assured cinematography and arresting scale. Concrete and steel creak out sorrowful stories of decay and disaster. The starring pair make their way through crumbling bulkheads, a rotting orphanage and a forest so dark and dense that sunrise as a concept feels like a fanciful myth. Obscured crawlspaces hide away moments of reprieve in the form of silly, sad little secrets, proving that even your worst nightmare is more bearable with a traffic cone on your head.\n\nObserving their confidence and resourcefulness, you get the sense these kids have been dealing with hell for a long time. But they’re still kids. You’ll clumsily swing a crowbar at giant seagulls, or take a break to use a rusted slide. You’ll play grandmother’s footsteps through a flooded basement, sneaking in time with clattering washing machines to hide the sound of your movement from the awful, lanky presence just a few feet away. Lovingly animated detail brightens up the murkiness; the kids will help each other up and dust themselves off after falls, and beds quiver when you jump on them. A lighter and lamp to banish the gloom provide small comforts, but comforts all the same.\n\nAnd, yes, the handful of marquee moments spent running from or tussling with gargantuan creatures are spectacular. I will never turn my back on a pelican again as long as I live. Throughout, Reanimal drip-feeds clues to compelling mysteries surrounding the nature of its world and the children’s place within it. A shame, then, that it whiffs its apparent swing at recapturing the gut-punch of Little Nightmares II’s ending.\n\nOne early sequence sees you creep through a dilapidated theatre while a projector flickers between macabre images. Reanimal, too, relies on a celluloid reel of darkly beautiful scenes: they’re undeniably memorable in isolation, they just don’t form an especially cogent whole.",

    "description": "Failing isn't the problem in the business world these days. Doing it too slow is.",
    "fullText": "\"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.\"\n\nIrish playwright Samuel Beckett's famous quote has become Corporate America's new mantra.\n\nFrom Okta to Salesforce to Blackstone, executives told BI's Sarah E. Needleman and Ana Altchek getting it wrong is ok. Just do it quickly and learn from it.\n\nThe tech industry has always been a big proponent of failing fast, but Corporate America is now catching on thanks to AI. The tech allows companies to quickly launch new tools to a wide group.\n\nAnd, perhaps more importantly, it's a way for executives to prove the big money they are spending on AI isn't going to waste. (Hence why they want you to fail fast.)\n\nIt's not just for launching products either.\n\nEven the ideation phase can be quickly sped up with chatbots that can talk through ideas. What previously might have taken executives (or, more likely, their underlings) hours of research can get figured out a lot faster.\n\nThere are still some hurdles with the fail-fast approach.\n\nWhat does failing even look like? There isn't a big, red alarm that goes off every time an AI project fails. (Although that sure would be fun.) Executives will say they set clear guidelines for a prototype beforehand, but a tool's benefits can be nuanced. And maybe you just need a little bit more time to really make it sing. All that makes it a lot harder to decide when to pull the plug.\n\nBuilding airplanes in the sky. The rush to get things out can lead to the belief you'll just fix things on the fly. But that's a dangerous precedent. Just ask the video game industry. When games came in physical copies you had to blow on to get working, companies made sure their product was bulletproof. Nowadays, they can digitally ship a game knowing an update for a glitch wont be far behind. It's a dangerous game that can cause major headaches.\n\nOpening the floodgates. A formalized product launch slows things down, but it also makes sure everyone is on the same page. A massive greenlight risks a lack of standardization. That might not seem like a big deal for a prototype. It becomes a bigger problem down the road if the product needs to be reconfigured to fit into the company's wider tech stack.",

    "fullText": "Season 3 of Love Island All Stars is well underway, and if you're looking to get caught up or watch new episodes, you've come to the right place. Below, we've gathered everything you need to know about where to watch Love Island All Stars.\n\nLove Island All Stars returned for Season 3 in mid-January after a slight delay due to wildfires in South Africa, the series' filming location. However, the premiere was only forced back by a few days, and since then, it's been full steam ahead for the all-star showdown. The series, hosted by Maya Jama, gathers fan favorites from the past 12 seasons of Love Island (UK) for another chance at love (or at least some prize money).\n\nThere are just a handful of episodes left in the third season, and things are certainly heating up, but there's still time to get caught up before the finale. Keep reading to learn how to stream the show around the world, including free options.\n\nLove Island All Stars is available for free in a few countries, including its home, the UK, where it streams on ITVX. In Australia, Love Island All Stars is available to stream for free through 9Now.\n\nIf you'll be away from the UK or Australia when a new episode drops, you can still keep up with the show with the help of a VPN. Short for virtual private networks, VPNs are handy tech tools that let people change their virtual locations, so their favorite websites work from anywhere. They're popular services among those looking to upgrade their cybersecurity or keep up with their usual apps and services while traveling abroad.\n\nNordVPN is one of the best VPN services on the market. It's user-friendly, has a massive selection of global servers, and includes a 30-day money-back guarantee if you find that it's not what you're looking for. You can learn \n\nNew episodes of Love Island All Stars go out on ITV2 in the UK. Season 3 premiered on January 15 at 9 p.m. GMT. New episodes are available to stream through ITVX, a free service that just requires account creation to use.\n\nIn the US, Peacock is the home of Love Island All Stars. Season 3 was released on the streaming service with a two-day delay behind the UK release schedule. The season premiered on Peacock on January 17 at 9 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. PT.\n\nNew episodes of Love Island All Stars also reached Australia slightly after their UK air dates, launching on January 17 at 12 p.m. AEDT. Episodes are available to stream through 9Now, a free streaming service. Users just need to create an account if they don't already have one, and then they're all set to start watching.\n\nLove Island All Stars brings together the best of the flagship Love Island series, but the fun doesn't end in the UK. Several countries around the world have launched their own versions of Love Island. Love Island USA and Love Island Australia, two of the most popular offshoots, released their seventh seasons in 2025. Love Island Games, another popular spinoff, dropped its second season last year. If you're interested in tuning into other shows in the franchise, make sure to check out our massive roundup on where to watch all Love Island series.\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.",

I think we didn't start the game the way we would have liked - Australia got away from us in the powerplay.\n\n\"Our spinners made a great effort to pull it back, but ultimately they finished off really well before we lost wickets in our own powerplay. We got off to a pretty poor start.\"\n\nStirling took a brilliant catch to dismiss Josh Inglis but it proved costly for Ireland after the opener hobbled off after the first delivery of Ireland's reply.\n\n\"I think he just took a knock on his knee taking the catch - he tried to go out and see our innings off to a good start but he wasn't able to unfortunately,\" added Tucker.\n\n\"It was massively disappointing and I think after that it sort of set a train in motion. Hopefully he'll be back for the next game.\"",

They go back generations.\n\nIf fans hoped this iteration had found a successful method when in Sri Lanka before this tournament, this result - under the pressure that comes with a World Cup chase - suggests otherwise.\n\nWhen the ball was hard and with pace to face, England, who were beaten by West Indies in the final of the 2016 T20 World Cup in India, had no issues.\n\nPhil Salt took 24 from the second over, bowled by Holder, and West Indies' total looked 15 runs below par.\n\nHowever, the game changed when Buttler miscued Chase to long-on for 21.\n\nIt opened the door to Motie, who impressively mixed wrist and finger-spin to have Banton and Brook chipping catches either side of zipping one through Bethell's defence and onto the stumps.\n\nCurran was England's hero with the ball in their final-over win against Nepal but he never really looked like finding the boundaries needed when pace returned at the death.\n\nIt was a fine all-round performance from West Indies, who caught every chance in the field, and now top the group with two wins from two.\n\nThey face Nepal at this venue on Sunday, before playing Italy in Kolkata on Thursday, 19 February.\n\nThough Archer had captain Shai Hope caught in the first over and fellow opener Brandon King slashed Curran to deep point in the second, West Indies were always dangerous given their stacked batting line-up.\n\nEngland continued to take regular wickets but only Adil Rashid, who claimed 2-16, managed to slow the scoring.\n\nWhereas Chase took 2-29 after being brought into the XI, England's part-time off-spinner Will Jacks was hit for 32 in two overs - Brook's decision to give him one over in the powerplay costing 19 runs.\n\nArcher, who also struggled against Nepal on Sunday, was wayward with his lines.\n\nRutherford had his moments. The first chance offered was a leading edge that flew to deep third man, with Rashid unable to take the catch or flick the ball back inside the rope.\n\nThat was a tough chance but Rashid would be disappointed not to take a chance off his own bowling when Rutherford skied a slog sweep in the 18th over.\n\nThe left-hander added another 18 runs from seven balls after that miss while Holder hit four sixes, three of which came in the 18th over bowled by Curran.\n\nWith dew not playing a part in making the ball harder to grip for the West Indies bowlers, it proved too much for England when the ball turned.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - results & fixtures\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Nvidia (NVDA) is currently valued at over $4.5 trillion, having become the world's most valuable company on June 18, 2024, when its market capitalization exceeded $3.3 trillion. It later hit $4 trillion in 2025 and briefly reached $5 trillion last October. Yet the stock has largely traded sideways since last August around its current price of $189.\n\nReasons include investor concerns over rising competition in AI accelerators from players like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), geopolitical constraints such as U.S. export restrictions to China, production delays on next-generation chips like Blackwell, slowing revenue growth momentum, and valuation fatigue after years of rapid gains.\n\nThe Shocking Reason This Analyst Says Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy Stock Will Take Bitcoin Prices to $0\n\nIs the Market Running on Borrowed Time?

In recent years, Alphabet has made significant strides in AI, launching Gemini 3 in 2025 as its most advanced model yet, requiring less prompting and delivering smarter responses.\n\nOther advances include the Ironwood AI chip (its seventh-generation TPU) for scaling large models, Gemma 3 for efficient open-source AI, SIMA 2 for AI agents in 3D worlds, and integrations like AI Mode in Search and Gemini Robotics for physical interactions.

    "title": "Why a bridge over the Detroit River is the latest flare-up in the US-Canada trade spat",
    "description": "Trade tensions between the US and Canada escalate as Donald Trump threatens to delay the Gordie Howe International Bridge, challenging Mark Carney.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is singing \"No Canada\" as a sprawling bridge connecting Ontario to Detroit nears completion.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is set to connect Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. Construction began in 2018, with an anticipated opening planned for 2024. Delays pushed the opening to 2026 — and Trump's threats could delay it even longer.\n\nThe US and Canada are engaged in an ongoing trade spat that includes liquor sales, travel, and electric vehicles. On Monday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he wouldn't allow the bridge to open until Canada compensated the United States \"for everything we have given them.\"\n\nNegotiations would start immediately, Trump wrote. The bridge now remains in a state of limbo. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThere's already one bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario.\n\nThe Ambassador Bridge opened in 1929. It's been privately owned by the Moroun family for decades. It reportedly carries about $360 million a day, or about 25% of the value of goods traveling between the US and Canada. It's also limited in its scale, with only four lanes, limited shoulders, and constricted traffic patterns leading up to it in Windsor.\n\nIn 2012, both Canada and Michigan approved the construction of a second bridge, the Gordie Howe. They officially broke ground in October 2018 on the 1.5-mile, six-lane bridge, which will also include a walking and biking path.\n\nThe bridge cost an estimated CA$6.4 billion, or about $4.7 billion. Canada paid for the entire project and plans to recoup its investment through toll revenues.\n\nMichigan will also own a part of the bridge, and the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority will manage operations.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump wrote that the bridge would not open until Canada treated the US with the \"Fairness and Respect that we deserve.\"\n\nThe feud between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has reached a fever pitch. At Davos, the two world leaders exchanged fiery speeches. Canada recently reached a \"preliminary agreement\" for a trade deal with China, and Trump responded with the threat of 100% tariffs.\n\nCanada's deal with China would allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles to enter the Canadian market at the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In exchange, Carney expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian agricultural tariffs.\n\nCanada's deal with China was a point of contention in Trump's post about the bridge. He wrote that China would \"eat Canada alive,\" and said the country would ban hockey and eliminate the Stanley Cup.\n\nTrump wrote that the US \"should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset.\" (Michigan and Canada already jointly own the bridge.)\n\nThere's also the Moroun family, which owns the existing Ambassador Bridge. They've publicly lobbied Trump to stop the new bridge, going so far as to air a commercial in 2018. And on Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Matthew Moroun met with Howard Lutnick, the US Commerce Secretary, about the project. Hours after that reported meeting, Trump posted about the bridge on Truth Social.\n\nIt wasn't always like this. During Trump's first presidency, he issued a statement with then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in support of the project.\n\n\"We look forward to the expeditious completion of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will serve as a vital economic link between our two countries,\" the two leaders wrote.\n\nCarney said he spoke to Trump on Tuesday morning about the bridge, explaining that Canadians had paid in full for the project and that Michigan already had an ownership stake.\n\nOne of Trump's critiques was that the bridge was not built using American products. Carney said he told Trump the bridge was built with American and Canadian workers and steel from both the US and Canada.\n\n\"It was a positive conversation,\" Carney said.\n\nMichigan, the second party in the agreement with Canada, doesn't seem thrilled, either. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that she was in communication with Trump's staff, and that the bridge was a \"really important part of our economy.\"\n\nAnd they may not wait for Trump's approval. Whitmer's press secretary said on Tuesday that the bridge would open \"one way or another.\"",

    "fullText": "World number two Rory McIlroy says the Players Championship has \"more of an identity\" than the US PGA Championship but does not believe the tournament should become men's golf's fifth major.\n\nThe 36-year-old, from County Down in Northern Ireland, became just the sixth man to win each of the sport's four majors - the Masters, US Open, Open Championship and US PGA Championship - in April when he earned a first Green Jacket at Augusta National to complete the career Grand Slam.\n\nThe Players, held in March at TPC Sawgrass, has long been nicknamed 'the fifth major', and used to boast of the strongest field in golf, although has been without a number of big names since the start of LIV Golf in 2022.\n\nLast week, the tournament began a promotional campaign for this year's edition with the tagline 'March is going to be major'.\n\nWhile women's golf already has five majors, McIlroy does not feel the men's game needs to expand its own designation.\n\n\"Look, I'd love to have seven majors instead of five, that sounds great,\" McIlroy said referencing his two previous Players Championships to go alongside his five majors.\n\n\"I think the Players is one of the best golf tournaments in the world. I don't think anyone disputes that or argues that. I think from a player perspective it's amazing. I think from an on-site fan experience it's amazing. It's an amazing golf course, location, venue.\n\n\"But I'm a traditionalist, I'm a historian of the game. We have four major championships. If you want to see what five major championships looks like, look at the women's game. I don't know how well that's went for them.\"\n\nMcIlroy also called for the US PGA Championship to be moved back to August.\n\nHis PGA titles in 2012 and 2014 came when the tournament was held in August, but since 2019, it has been staged in May in between the Masters and US Open.\n\nWhen it was the final major of the year, it was branded 'glory's last shot', and McIlroy believes \"it needs to go back to August\" to regain that identity.\n\n\"The Players, it doesn't need to be anything else. I would say it's got more of an identity than the PGA Championship does at the minute,\" he added before making his 2026 PGA Tour debut with the defence of his Pebble Beach Pro-Am title on Thursday.\n\n\"So from an identity standpoint, I think the Players has got it nailed. It stands on its own without the label, I guess.\"\n\n'Doesn't seem fair' - Rahm criticises LIV rankings call\n\nPGA Tour success vindicates rejecting LIV - Rose",

two of which have played in the top flight before.\n\nBradford Bulls and Toulouse Olympique have both featured in Super League in the past but newcomers York Knights will make their debut this season as the sport continues to expand outside its traditional heartlands.\n\nKnights, whose women's team York Valkyrie have enjoyed plenty of success in the Women's Super League, were selected to join rugby league's top flight by an independent panel along with Toulouse, who come back to the top table following a one-season stint in 2022.\n\nThe panel judged applications against each club's financial performance in 2025, as well as their financial performance and sustainability forecasts for 2026 to 2028 and their ability to \"field a competitive team in 2026 and beyond\".\n\nHeadlined by the high-profile signing of Paul Vaughan from Warrington, York have ushered in a total of 14 new faces as they aim to hit the ground running in their maiden top-flight campaign.\n\nToulouse, meanwhile, welcome Wigan's Tyler Dupree on a season-long loan, hoping to establish themselves alongside Catalans as the league's French representation.\n\nSuper League to expand to 14 teams from 2026\n\nYork and Toulouse to play in expanded Super League\n\nBradford replace Salford in Super League for 2026\n\nTo those of a certain vintage, Bradford Bulls and Super League success are synonymous.\n\nThe club dominated the early Super League era, clinching four league titles and two Challenge Cups during their late 1990s and early 2000s heyday.\n\nFormerly a dominant force, the club lost their top-flight status in 2015 with Wigan Warriors, Leeds Rhinos and St Helens taking it in turns to dominate after Bradford ran out of steam.\n\nDuring their 11-year absence, the club has been plagued with financial troubles and had a stint in the former third-tier League One but, off the back of last season's grading system, they return to Super League.\n\nIconic head coach Brian Noble came back to the club last season and steered them to third in the Championship but they will enter the 2026 campaign under the stewardship of highly-rated former Salford coach Kurt Haggerty.\n\n\"The work we've done leading to round one has been probably more stressful than what's coming ahead,\" Haggerty told BBC Radio Leeds.\n\n\"We've had a lot of stress before we kicked a ball so if I can remain as calm as I have done up to now, I think we'll be ok and I'll be ok.\n\n\"There's a lot of good people around me like Brian Noble who I can rely on and get advice from if I need it.\"\n\nBradford, Toulouse and York have all had to piece together their respective squads for the 2026 season from October onwards, meaning it has been a mad dash to the line for the newcomers to contest the season.\n\nAsked what his ambition was for the coming campaign, Haggerty added: \"I think if we come away from this year with a load of respect, I'll be happy with that.\"\n\nThe expansion to 14 teams means the previously maligned loop fixtures are no more.\n\nThe format was introduced when the league was reduced to 12 sides and ensured that every team played 27 games over the course of a regular season.\n\nIn order for that to happen, however, four of those matches would be so-called loop fixtures where some clubs would face each other again during the regular season based on the final league table from the previous campaign.\n\nThis structure would occasionally lead to some teams having a pretty lopsided campaign - as was the case with St Helens last season, who virtually had a free hit against a chaotic Salford Red Devils side on three occasions while other clubs arguably had a more difficult run-in.\n\nThis led to criticism from many a coach over many a season but returning to a 14-team set-up means the regular season will now consist of 13 home games, 13 away and one Magic Weekend fixture played at a neutral venue - which this year takes place at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nOne side who will not feature in Super League this term are former Grand Finalists Salford.\n\nThe formerly named Red Devils endured a torrid 2025 campaign due to financial issues and frequently fielded youthful sides who were on the receiving end of some demoralising drubbings.\n\nThe club lost their place in Super League due to the end-of-season gradings and were later placed into liquidation by the High Court in December, which plunged its future into doubt.\n\nHowever, former player Mason Caton-Brown led a consortium to take over the club - now running under the Salford RLFC moniker - as they frantically put together the shell of a side to contest the 2026 Championship season in a matter of weeks after being given the go ahead from the Rugby Football League.\n\nHull KR come into the 2026 season off the back of a campaign which saw them win a clean sweep of Challenge Cup, League Leaders' Shield and the Super League Grand Final.\n\nThat success has shattered the glass ceiling as Willie Peters' side muscled their way in to the northern hemisphere elite, becoming only the fifth club in Super League history to win a Grand Final.\n\nBut will their dominance be tested? After all, Wigan came into last season off the back of a historic quadruple of trophies, yet they could not mount a challenge against Hull KR and came away at the end of the season empty-handed.\n\nSt Helens, Leeds and Leigh Leopards have recruited well as they look to dethrone the Robins, who also have a trip to Las Vegas to face the Rhinos and next week's World Club Challenge against National Rugby League premiers Brisbane Broncos to contend with in a packed calendar in the early part of the season.\n\nThere has been some turnover at the Robins, with Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and Micky McIlorum retiring after October's showpiece, but the club have kept the spine of what has made them so successful in recent seasons.\n\nTalismanic half-back Mikey Lewis signed a huge five-year deal before the 2025 season ended and balancing the old and new is crucial to inspiring success in the future, KR forward Dean Hadley said.\n\n\"You look at any successful team, whatever sport that might be and they always have a core group of players and people, which includes the staff,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"When you've got a group where the majority have been together, you build relationships and connections and you get used to each other.\n\n\"Off the back of that it's important to bring in a few new additions and new energy. The boys that have come in have been really good and added to it but the majority of us have been together now for two or three years and hopefully we can carry on.\"\n\nWhat adds some extra spice to the season is the fact there is a World Cup at the end of it, as England's best and brightest aim to put themselves in the picture for a spot in the squad that will travel to Australia in October.\n\nWith Peters \"keen\" to have talks for the role of England boss after the departure of Shaun Wane, how many of his KR cohort will be on the plane down under later this year?",

    "fullText": "\"It's all about the fingertips\" replies Crishan Kalugamage with a wink when asked about the similarities between bowling leg-spin and making pizzas.\n\nKalugamage moved from Sri Lanka to Lucca in Tuscany as a 15-year-old and is one of five home-based players in Italy's 15-man squad for the T20 World Cup.\n\nA sporty kid, Kalugamage made friends competing in athletics and then started playing some amateur cricket near his adopted hometown. His natural talent for the game set him apart and he was soon scouted to play for Roma Cricket Club, one of the oldest in the country.\n\nThe now 34-year-old is one of many players in the Italian squad who have known sacrifice to get where they are today, namely playing in front of thousands of people at famous cricketing stadiums such as Kolkata's Eden Gardens and Mumbai's Wankhede. A global audience of millions watching at home.\n\nKalugamage's job as a pizza maker often came second to playing cricket. \"I lost a lot of jobs,\" he says ruefully, \"Sunday is a very busy day, lots of bosses aren't keen on you not working because you are playing cricket.\"\n\n\"Crish is a very dangerous weapon\" Italy's head coach, John Davison, says on a separate call. \"He can spin it sharply both ways and he will have the element of surprise, hardly anyone in the tournament will have ever faced him.\"\n\nDavison knows his rotations - he is also known as 'The Spin Whisperer'. He has spent the last decade and a half as an in-demand spin coach. Nathan Lyon called Davison the \"best spin coach in the world\" and has worked with him since his teens.\n\nHis dough-spinning days behind him, it'll be Kalugamage's fast googly, rather than a Sloppy Giuseppe, that troubles the batters of Group C (England, Scotland, Nepal and West Indies) who are set to face him.\n\nNone of the 15 squad members were born in Italy and only a few are fluent in the language.\n\nSeveral players hold Italian passports or qualify because of a relative, and some people have baulked at the Italian Cricket Federation casting their net so wide rather than concentrating on developing more homegrown players.\n\nSouth African born and South African capped (six ODIs and 16 T20Is between 2017 and 2021) all-rounder JJ Smuts will play for Italy during the tournament by dint of his marriage but has never even stepped foot in the country.\n\n\"People can have their opinion but we've got a real togetherness,\" says captain Wayne Madsen, speaking before his side's opening match against Scotland on Monday, which saw him dislocate his shoulder and his team soundly beaten.\n\nThe 42-year-old South African born batter is club captain at Derbyshire and has a wealth of experience with teams around the globe. Even so, this group of players has had a real effect on him.\n\n\"That heritage and the journeys that guys have gone on to get here, there's a bond which is pretty hard to describe outside of the feeling that we get as a group,\" said Madsen.\n\n\"It really is probably our biggest strength. Everyone's got a story to tell in terms of how they got to this position and everyone's is unique. Whether it is guys who have grown up in Italy or guys with grandparents who moved away many years ago. We've had some really powerful conversations, it has really bonded us.\"\n\nFor Madsen and Davison, success on the pitch in this tournament is part of a wider plan to build on the growing cricketing roots in Italy.\n\n\"We want to win games and we know and believe that we can. If we can finish in the top eight, that'll change the lives of a lot of our cricketers and put Italian cricket on the map\" says Madsen.\n\n\"I think for us, the main thing is leaving a legacy in Italy and the platform to develop the game further in the country.\"\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nFor some of the squad, the prospect of playing in front of a large crowd will be something of an alien prospect. Davison mentions that the players had a training session inside Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium a few days earlier and it was the first time that the Pakistani born and Italian raised left-arm seamer Hassan Ali had stepped foot inside a cricket stadium of any kind.\n\nThe players have been working with Dr Andrew Hooton, Head of the School of Sports and Exercises Science at the University of Derby, in order to prepare themselves. Hooton has worked with Madsen and Micky Arthur at Derbyshire and also with Burton Albion Football Club.\n\n\"Some of the squad definitely haven't had experience of playing in a big stadium, under lights with huge crowds\" says Hooton, \"One of the things I've been working with them on is being able to perform their skills and maintain their basics in this heightened scenario.\n\n\"We've done some work around 'centering'. Like when you see Ronaldo before he takes a free-kick or penalty, he closes his eyes and does a whole body breath. It allows for attentional focus but also helps to guard against nerves and anxiety. It's physical as well as mental.\"\n\nDavison mentions the 33,000 seater Wankhede stadium in Mumbai is sold out for their second game against Nepal.\n\n\"The ICC give us about 75 tickets for friends and family, that leaves a heck of a lot of supporters for us to win over, but we'll be giving it our best shot,\"\n\n\"We have a platform to take cricket further, to take it to another level,\" adds Madsen. \"We've got the players to make that happen and we're dreaming high. We aren't just here to make up the numbers, we can take sides down.\"\n\nSat next to his captain as he says these words, pizza maker Kalugamage smiles and surreptitiously flicks his fingers. The next part of the journey about to begin.\n\nMadsen dislocates shoulder in Italy's World Cup bow\n\nLeask & Munsey star as Scotland beat debutants Italy\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "From housewives with brooms to Olympic lifters - step inside the world-leading National Curling Academy in Stirling.",
    "fullText": "One of the first things you notice is the number of cameras. They're everywhere, trained on the four ice sheets at a variety of angles. Some fixed. Some swooping down on cables. Others manoeuvred on long arms.\n\nCoaches clad in anoraks and armed with laptops discuss data posted on large screens, their conversations punctuated by the clunk of granite on granite as Team GB's curlers hone their games on the perfectly prepared ice.\n\nThis is the National Curling Academy in Stirling. From the outside, it's just a public leisure centre on the edge of town, with sprightly pensioners staying flexible in aerobics classes and excitable kids in for swimming lessons.\n\nBut slipping past the joyful chaos in reception and through a side door takes you to another world. A world in which British Curling leads the way.\n\n\"We hope we are a bit ahead of the curve in our behaviours around nutrition, physical performance, conditioning, innovation and technology, but it's getting competitive,\" says British Curling's head of performance services Nikki Gibson.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nIt's now 24 years since Rhona Martin delivered the Stone of Destiny in Salt Lake City, watched by millions of rapt viewers at dark o'clock in the UK.\n\nBritain's first Winter Olympics gold in 18 years had been won by a group of Scottish housewives in an odd little sport. 'Look at them on the ice with their daft wee brooms…' was the perception by some.\n\nThat derogatory view wasn't correct then and it is even further from the truth now.\n\nThe 10 curlers who are representing Team GB in Cortina right now lift weights like sprinters, strategise like chess players, and fuel like Tour de France cyclists.\n\nEvery weekday morning, the athletes on the GB programme will start training at 08:30. Each day includes two two-hour ice sessions and one in the gym.\n\nAcross a week, three of those gym sessions are strength-based and two conditioning. Most will add another at the weekend, just to keep themselves right.\n\nThey are supervised - no sitting on a bench next to the weights while doomscrolling for this lot - and are specifically designed with curling in mind.\n\n\"It's Olympic lifts we're doing - clean and jerk, snatches, squats, the lot,\" says Hammy McMillan, whose gold medal-tipped men's rink start their campaign on Wednesday. \"And we're using ski machines, rowers, and assault bikes to really condition our bodies.\"\n\n\"The numbers we put up, I don't think people would expect them,\" adds Bobby Lammie, who is credited alongside McMillan as having changed the physicality expected of sweepers.\n\n\"It's allowed us to separate ourselves slightly from the rest of the world.\"\n\nSimilar can be said of the women's game, where 2022 gold medallist Jen Dodds - one of the world's best with a brush - is lifting just as much as some of the men. \"More than me, to be fair,\" admits men's vice-skip Grant Hardie.\n\n\"Jen is incredible in the gym,\" says Team GB women's skip Rebecca Morrison, who takes a slightly different view of the gym work.\n\n\"You need a lot of core strength to even stay upright on the ice,\" she says.\n\n\"Maybe we're not flinging ourselves off massive jumps or sliding down a track at 80 miles per hour, but it's a lot harder than people realise to even keep your balance.\"\n\nWhen you consider the schedule of curling competitions, the fitness regime begins to make more sense.\n\nDuring the Olympics, for example, Mouat will play for 17 consecutive days - often more than once - should the men reach the semi-finals as expected. Mixed doubles partner Dodds, at least, will get a day off before the women's event starts.\n\nThen layer up the travelling during the season - five or six times to Canada or the United States as well as shorter European jaunts and occasionally to Asia - and suddenly the demands look daunting.\n\nTo do it and still perform, you need to be fit. And you need to be properly fuelled.\n\nBritish Curling employs a nutritionist who successfully argued that there is no reason curlers should not approach food in the same way as a Tour de France team.\n\nAnd while it's unlikely cyclists are munching the cereal bars and sweets favoured by the curlers when on the ice, many of the same principles are the same.\n\n\"Our nutritionists would never say 'you can't eat a Mars bar', but I want the athletes to not want to eat the Mars bar,\" says Gibson. \"That's the culture we're trying to create.\n\n\"One of our Paralympic athletes said our nutritionist is great because he realises he's a 40-year-old man who's not suddenly going to start eating salads.\n\n\"But he's managed to make little changes, like eating berries before going to bed at night to help with sleep.\n\n\"We're not looking at them being perfect 100% of the time - it's more looking at what are the areas we can really target that will make a difference to performance.\"\n\nThose areas include travel packs for curlers, which include high-protein snacks, hand sanitizers, face masks, chewing gum to increase saliva production and help avoid illness, and even dehydrated meals when going to Asia.\n\nAll of that falls within British Curling's 'what it takes to win' model.\n\nThat plan covers any number of areas, including performance lifestyle advisors - who can talk to the athletes financial planning and work-life balance - and psychology.\n\nThat can range from on-ice aspects such as pre-shot routines and performing under pressure, to team dynamics and communication.\n\nAnd every person is different, which heightens the challenge for Gibson and her team. Some, like men's alternate Kyle Waddell, like to \"just turn up, have a chat, and crack on\", but others need energy plans to manage their state of mind building up to matches.\n\n\"Not every athlete needs everything,\" Gibson says. \"And part of it is learning to not throw the kitchen sink at everybody, because some people just will not cope with that. And it's not how we get the best out of them.\n\n\"My job is to take away all the other stuff, all the stress, so the athletes can just focus on competing.\"\n\nSo how might things change for the next Olympic cycle? Gibson points to two key areas - physicality and artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile stopping short of conceding that today's curlers will look out of shape by the 2034 Games, she does believe sweepers will become bigger, stronger, and able to put more pressure on the brush.\n\n\"They will end up training like 400m sprinters,\" she says.\n\nBut it is in the area of AI that the most significant developments might come.\n\nBritish Curling already collects reams of data on training sessions and competitions, but how might that be better used to develop match strategies? Could they run simulations based on every conceivable shot played in an end, for example?\n\n\"We're looking for these guys to be making 96% of their shots, so one wrong shot can decide a game and be the difference between gold and silver,\" Gibson says. \"So every little innovation we make could matter a whole lot.\n\n\"This is the top of the sport, but I don't think people would expect us to do all this stuff. It's very much not just 'rock up, throw 32 stones and then go to the pub'.\n\n\"The hours, the number of stones thrown, bars lifted, protein shakes drunk, discussions with psychologists, mental strategies - these curlers work incredibly hard and we work hard with them to help them be the best.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "We cannot fully know the answer. But there is an alternative scenario where Liverpool are merely publicly backing him but behind the scenes perhaps something else is going on.\n\nThe club may already be preparing for his successor.\n\nBut what if that successor is not available right now? What if that successor is only available in the summer so Liverpool have to wait?\n\nThis could be entirely possible. The most perfect candidate to replace Slot might be Julian Nagelsmann, who won't be leaving his role as manager of Germany until the World Cup concludes in North America.\n\nNagelsmann is the ideal fit because he has very similar principles to Jurgen Klopp, just with a more modern hint.\n\nHe is also a young and developing manager with world-class potential. In fact, given his achievements in the game at Bayern Munich, RB Leipzig, FC Hoffenheim and now the German national team, you'd probably already call him world-class.\n\nNagelsmann is only 38-years-old but he already has so much experience for someone of his age. His methods are extremely effective and despite Germany not having a great squad, they will be one of the favourites because of Nagelsmann at the World Cup.\n\nWhat makes the German such an ideal fit is that he comes from the pressing mindset. He was someone who admired Jurgen Klopp's style of play and who always implemented successful gegenpressing systems.\n\nRight now, Liverpool's lack of pressing is a massive issue. Slot just doesn't seem to be able to introduce a press that works effectively. It's all over the place.\n\nNagelsmann has a track-record of doing this at international and club level. He has worked at more teams than Slot and more importantly he has worked with several of the club's current stars, including Dominik Szoboszlai, Ibrahima Konate and Florian Wirtz.\n\nHe's the perfect candidate, and waiting for him might make sense.",

    "fullText": "A few weeks ago, I was staring at a system prompt that was 127,000 tokens long. One hundred and twenty-seven thousand tokens - just the system prompt. Most of it was, you guessed it, tool schemas: JSON definitions for every possible thing the agent could do, most of which it would never touch in any given run.\n\nMy solution? I propose AgentScript: a code-first execution language where the LLM can only interact with the outside world by writing programs. No tool schemas, no function calling, no MCP, no multi-modal response gymnastics. The model writes code, a sandboxed runtime executes it, and the return value is the response. As simple as that.\n\nHere’s how tool calling works today: you define a bunch of tools as JSON schemas, stuff them into the system prompt, and hope the model picks the right one. Each tool needs a name, a description, parameter definitions, and examples. A single tool can easily consume hundreds of tokens. A production-grade system might have tens, sometimes hundrends, of tools.\n\nAnd the tools the model never uses still consume tokens - they’re sitting in the context window like furniture in a storage unit you’re paying rent on but never visiting (I would know something about that). As systems grow, you get this compounding problem: context inflation drives up latency and reduces alignment, both in turn drive up costs, and costs scale non-linearly because you’re paying for all those schema tokens on every single inference call.\n\nSince many agent tasks require iteration, filtering, branching, retries, and aggregation, when you encode these behaviors through repeated LLM calls or chained tool invocations, you’re effectively using natural language as a programming language. You’re asking the model to be both the thinker and the doer, when decades of CS have taught us that these should be separate concerns.\n\nIn the last few months, I’ve seen this become an exciting idea space: Program-of-thought prompting, code interpreter systems, Anthropic’s work on code execution with MCP - they all point to the same conclusion: models are better planners than executors, and deterministic computation belongs outside the model.\n\nAgentScript takes that insight to its logical conclusion.\n\nAgentScript enforces a code-only contract between a language model and its execution environment. In this world, the LLM is not an API client, not it is a conversational participant; it’s a program author that can only emit AgentScript code. So there is only one execution entry point, and all interaction with the world happens through code.\n\nThis collapses tool calling, function responses, and structured outputs into a single universal abstraction: program execution.\n\nThe execution model is deliberately boring:\n\nIntermediate data never enters the model’s context unless the program explicitly reads the persisted logs from the file system. This is my main insight: pull-based data access instead of push-based context stuffing.\n\nThe API surface can be intentionally tiny, for example:\n\nThe model already knows JavaScript. The API is small enough to learn once and never forget.\n\nAnd the safety model is simple: constraints are enforced by the runtime, not the model. The model can write whatever code it wants. The sandbox decides what actually executes, like only mounting the working directory, allowlisted commands, or network access.\n\nTo start with, a backwards-compatible model would be to force a tool call from LLM responses and only give it a single tool: execute_agentscript, and stop the loop based on the execution of the code.\n\nThere are also a few extensions I’m thinking about:\n\nWhen systems become too complex to reason about in prose, you re-found them on code. This has happened repeatedly in computing history, and it’s happening again now to agents.\n\nWritten on a flight from Amsterdam to New Delhi",

    "description": "An Australian scientist says he has figured out the leading cause of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances. Here's the answer.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAn Australian scientist says probabilities are the leading cause of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances.\n\nAdd in suspect weather, and iffy plane and boat piloting, and Karl Kruszelnicki believes there’s no reason to believe in the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon.\n\nWhile the conspiracy of the Bermuda Triangle has existed for decades, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and Lloyd’s of London has long championed the same ideas.\n\nPick any one of the more than 50 ships or 20 planes that have disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in the last century. Each one has a story without an ending, leading to a litany of conspiracy theories about the disappearances in the area, marked roughly by Florida, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles.\n\nAustralian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki doesn’t Neither does the United States’ own National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Both have been saying for years that there’s really no Bermuda Triangle mystery. In fact, the loss and disappearance of ships and planes is a mere fact of probabilities.\n\n“There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean,” NOAA wrote in 2010.\n\nAnd since 2017, Kruszelnicki has been saying the same thing. He told The Independent that the transparent volume of traffic—in a tricky area to navigate, no less—shows “the number [of ships and planes] that go missing in the Bermuda Triangle is the same as anywhere in the world on a percentage basis.” He says that both Lloyd’s of London and the U.S. Coast Guard support that idea. In fact, as The Independent notes, Lloyd’s of London has had this same theory since the 1970s.\n\nNOAA says environmental considerations can explain away most of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances, highlighting the Gulf Stream’s tendency towards violent changes in weather, the number of islands in the Caribbean Sea offering a complicated navigation adventure, and evidence that suggests the Bermuda Triangle may cause a magnetic compass to point to true north instead of magnetic north, causing for confusion in wayfinding.\n\n“The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard contend that there are no supernatural explanations for disasters at sea,” NOAA says. “Their experience suggests that the combined forces of nature and human fallibility outdo even the most incredulous science fiction.”\n\nKruszelnicki has routinely garnered public attention for espousing these very thoughts on the Bermuda Triangle, first in 2017 and then again in 2022 before resurfacing once more in 2023. Throughout it all, he’s stuck to the same idea: the numbers don’t lie.\n\nEven with some high-profile disappearances—such as Flight 19, a group of five U.S. Navy TBM Avenger torpedo bombers lost in 1945—pushing the theory into popular culture, Kruszelnicki points out that every instance contains a degree of poor weather or likely human error (or both, as in the case of Flight 19) as the true culprit.\n\nBut culture clings to Bermuda Triangle conspiracy theories. The concepts of sea monsters, aliens, and even the entirety of Atlantis dropping to the ocean floor—those are fodder for books, television, and movies. It sure does sound more exciting than poor weather and mathematical probabilities, anyway, even if the “boring” story holds more water.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "International team creates quick-charging, long-lasting prototype with potential for renewable energy storage",
    "fullText": "A little-known fact: In the year 1900, electric cars outnumbered gas-powered ones on the American road.\n\nThe lead-acid auto battery of the time, courtesy of Thomas Edison, was expensive and had a range of only about 30 miles. Seeking to improve on this, Edison believed the nickel-iron battery was the future, with the promise of a 100-mile range, a long life and a recharge time of seven hours, fast for that era.\n\nAlas, that promise never reached fruition. Early electric car batteries still suffered from serious limitations, and advances in the internal combustion engine won the day.\n\nNow, an international research collaboration co-led by UCLA has taken a page from Edison’s book, developing nickel-iron battery technology that may be well-suited for storing energy generated at solar farms. The prototype was able to recharge in only seconds, instead of hours, and achieved over 12,000 cycles of draining and recharging — the equivalent of more than 30 years of daily recharges.\n\nThe technology was built from tiny clusters of metal patterned using proteins that were then bonded to a two-dimensional material, made of sheets only one atom thick. Despite the innovative ingredients, the techniques are deceptively straightforward and inexpensive.\n\n“People often think of modern nanotechnology tools as complicated and high-tech, but our approach is surprisingly simple and straightforward,” said study co-author Maher El-Kady, an assistant researcher in the UCLA College’s chemistry and biochemistry department. “We are just mixing common ingredients, applying gentle heating steps and using raw materials that are widely available.”\n\nThe study was published in the journal Small and is featured on the back cover.\n\nThe natural world provided some cues for the researchers. Of particular interest was the process by which animals form bones and shellfish form their hard outer casings. Whether skeletons are inside or outside, they’re made by proteins that act as scaffolds for collecting calcium-based compounds.\n\nThe researchers sought to mimic this mechanism to generate their tiny clusters of nickel or iron, according to co-corresponding author Ric Kaner, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry in the UCLA College and of materials science and engineering in the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering.\n\n“We were inspired by the way nature deposits these types of materials,” said Kaner, who is also the holder of the Dr. Myung Ki Hong Endowed Chair in Materials Innovation and a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. “Laying down minerals in the correct fashion builds bones that are strong, yet flexible enough to not be brittle. How it’s done is almost as important as the material used, and proteins guide how they are placed.”\n\nIn the study, the team used proteins that are byproducts of beef production. The molecules served as templates for growing clusters of nickel for positive electrodes and iron for negative electrodes. The nooks and crannies in the folded protein structure limited the size of the metal clusters to fewer than 5 nanometers. That’s so small that it would take about 10,000 to 20,000 clusters to match the width of a human hair. The researchers even detected single atoms of iron and nickel in their electrodes.\n\nThe proteins were combined with graphene oxide, an ultrathin 2D material that comes in sheets a single atom thick comprising carbon decorated with oxygen atoms. While the oxygen can create clogs that make the material act more like an insulator, the process that followed changed everything.\n\nThe ingredients were superheated in water then baked at high-temperature, causing the proteins to char into carbon, stripping away the oxygen in the 2D material and embedding the tiny metal clusters guided by the proteins. The resulting structure was an aerogel, made of almost 99% air by volume.\n\nPart of the technology’s secret sauce is surface area — the more exposed, the more space for the reactions behind battery chemistry to take place.\n\nThere was plenty of such room provided by the graphene aerogel’s thinness and surplus of empty space. And the tininess of the metal nanoclusters takes advantage of a fundamental mathematical principle: as objects get smaller, the size of the exposed outer surface increases far more than volume does.\n\n“As we go from larger particles down to these extremely tiny nanoclusters, the surface area gets dramatically higher,” El-Kady said. “That’s a huge advantage for batteries. When the particles are that tiny, almost every single atom can participate in the reaction. So, charging and discharging happen way faster, you can store more charge, and the whole battery just works more efficiently.”\n\nDespite its advantages in charging speed and durability, this iteration of the technology does not match the storage capabilities of today’s lithium-ion batteries. With range at a premium in the electric car market, the researchers think that this Edison-inspired battery of the future may one day find application in other areas.\n\nFor instance, the technology’s fast charging, high output and robust endurance suggest a good fit for storing excess electricity generated at solar farms during the daytime, to power the grid at night. It may also be useful for backup power at data centers.\n\n“Because this technology could extend the lifetime of batteries to decades upon decades, it might be ideal for storing renewable energy or quickly taking over when power is lost,” El-Kady said. “This would remove worries about the changing cost of infrastructure.”\n\nThe researchers are exploring the use of their nanocluster fabrication technique with other metals. They’re also looking at possible replacements for bovine proteins, such as natural polymers that are more abundant, and thus less expensive and easier to scale up for future manufacturing.\n\nThe study’s first author is Habibeh Bishkul of Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran, Iran.

    "fullText": "Through carbon dating, researchers have ruled that the artifacts are between approximately 11,700 and 12,900 years old, a time when Ice Age temperatures had returned after a brief warm period.\n\nResearchers have identified what is believed to be the world's oldest sewn animal hide, along with Ice Age eyed bone needles, discovered in Oregon, according to researchers from a consortium of North American universities.\n\nThe study, published in Science Advances, analyzed 55 artifacts discovered in the Cougar Mountain Cave (CMC) and Paisley Caves in central Oregon, and Smith Creek Cave and Bonneville Estates Rockshelter in Nevada, though the significant findings were discovered in the former two.\n\nThrough carbon dating, researchers have ruled that the artifacts are between approximately 11,700 and 12,900 years old, a time when Ice Age temperatures had returned after a brief warm period.\n\nCMC was originally dug up in 1958 by an amateur archaeologist named John Cowles. The artifacts analyzed in the study are part of Cowles’ original collection of excavated findings, now housed at the Favell Museum in Klamath Falls, Oregon.\n\nPaisley Caves, or Paisley Five Mile Point Caves, were first studied by archaeologist Luther Cressman in the 1930s, and were added to the US National Register of Historic Places in 2014.\n\nAccording to researchers, the most remarkable find was a piece of elk hide with thread sewn through its edge. The thread, which researchers determined was made from plant fiber and animal hair twisted together, connected the main hide piece to a smaller fragment, which is tied in a knot.\n\nThe hide was dated three times to confirm an age of roughly 12,000 years, according to the study, and chemical analysis confirmed it came from a North American elk.\n\nResearchers also studied 14 bone needles from four different sites and determined that they had been carved from the bones of both bison and mountain sheep.\n\n“In all of North America, there are only 17 sites with bone needles in Pleistocene-aged [Ice Age] contexts, while in South America, there are none,” according to the study.\n\nThe two caves contain 80% of all the dated plant and animal materials from the Ice Age period found anywhere in North or South America, the study explained, noting that 23 fiber artifacts, 12 wooden tools, and three pieces of hide had been found in CMC alone.\n\nThe fiber artifacts are mostly three-strand braided rope made from sagebrush bark, and fragments of tightly woven basketry were also found, marking the oldest evidence of baskets in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe caves also contained 79 stone spear points, many resharpened multiple times, alongside bison, elk, and rabbit bones.\n\n“The abundance of bone needles and the presence ofadornment items and very fine eyed needles suggest that clothingwas more than a utilitarian survival strategy but also an avenue of expression and identity,” the study concluded.\n\n“This evidence pushes beyond conventional assumptions to confirm that Pleistocene peoples in the Americas used clothing as both survival technology andsocial practice.”",

    "fullText": "The transfer market in Mexico continues to buzz with international prospects. Thiago Espinosa, the promising right-back from Racing de Montevideo, has officially joined Club América. The young defender arrives at the azulcrema team on a loan with an option to buy, representing a strategic move to strengthen the defense of the most decorated team in Mexican football.\n\nAt 21 years old, Espinosa has established himself as one of the fastest-evolving fullbacks in Uruguayan football. Initially trained in Peñarol's youth teams, it was at Racing where he got the chance to debut and shine in the First Division. His playing style is characterized by refined technique, intelligence in positioning, and an offensive drive that makes him a constant threat in the opponent's area, qualities that perfectly align with the historical demands of the \"Águilas\".\n\nEspinosa's arrival at the Nest reinforces the tradition of Uruguayan players succeeding in Aztec territory. Uruguayan football experts had noted the unusual nature of a talent of his caliber not having emigrated earlier, considering his exponential growth in recent seasons. Now, under the pressure and spotlight that América offers, the young player will seek to prove that he is ready to make the definitive leap in his professional career.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie named the Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem as the individual Jeffrey Epstein had emailed about a \"torture video\".\n\nSulayem is chairman and CEO of DP World, a major global logistics firm based in the UAE. Newsweek has contacted DP World's media office via email for comment.\n\nThe emails were released by the Department of Justice in the Epstein files, but one sender's name was redacted. Lawmakers have been able to view the unredacted files.\n\nEpstein sent an email on April 24, 2009, that said: \"where are you? are you ok , I loved the torture video\"\n\nThe recipient's email address and name were redacted.\n\nBut Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the recipient was identified in the file EFTA00666117, which names \"Sultan Bin Sulayem\" while redacting the email address.\n\nThe nature of the \"torture video\" is not known.\n\nThey replied a day later to say: \"I am in china I will be in the US 2nd week of may\"\n\nSulayem was a friend of Epstein's, and the DOJ documents show that the pair corresponded about sexual experiences.\n\nThe Emirati businessman continued a relationship with disgraced financier Epstein for years after the latter's conviction for soliciting an underage prostitute in 2008.\n\nAppearing in the Epstein files is not indicative of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nMassie, who spearheaded the congressional push to secure the full release of the Epstein files, had said of the \"torture video\" email chain in a post on X: \"A Sultan seems to have sent this. DOJ should make this public.\"\n\nBlanche replied, also on X: \"You looked at the document. You know it’s an email address that was redacted. The law requires redactions for personally identifiable information, including if in an email address. And you know that the Sultan’s name is available unredacted in the files. See EFTA00666117. Be honest, and stop grandstanding.\"\n\nUnder the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress in November, the DOJ was ordered to release all of the documents in its possession relating to Epstein, with only limited redactions permitted.\n\nThe Department has so far released around 3.5 million files concerning Epstein.\n\nOn Monday, Maryland Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, who is the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, said the DOJ has withheld a further “three million documents.”\n\nRaskin was one of several members of Congress granted access to view unredacted copies of the Epstein files at an office in Washington, D.C.\n\n“I went over there and I was able to determine, at least I believe, that there were tons of completely unnecessary redactions in addition to the failure to redact the names of victims,” Raskin told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe Democrat added that he and other members of Congress had been given only four computers to review the files, and that he had only been able to see between 30 and 40 on Monday.\n\nIn a polarized era, the center is dismissed as bland. At Newsweek, ours is different: The Courageous Center—it's not \"both sides,\" it's sharp, challenging and alive with ideas. We follow facts, not factions. If that sounds like the kind of journalism you want to see thrive, we need you.\n\nWhen you become a Newsweek Member, you support a mission to keep the center strong and vibrant. Members enjoy: Ad-free browsing, exclusive content and editor conversations. Help keep the center courageous.

    "description": "Humanity likes to think big. The largest man-made moving object in the world doesn't disappoint, with its sheer size dwarfing even the closest runner-up.",
    "fullText": "From massive stone edifices like the pyramids in Egypt and the Great Wall in China to the high-tech (and incredibly expensive) International Space Station zipping overhead in low-Earth orbit, humanity has been driven to build big things since the dawn of time. No matter the locale, we feel the innate need to plant an everlasting metaphorical flag in the ground that says we've been here (and done that).\n\nBack in the 1970s, Greek billionaire and shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos had a dream to construct an ultra-large crude carrier (ULCC) to add to his already monumental shipping fleet. Little did he know at the time that it would have a very colorful history and bear a jumble of different names. Even though it was eventually decommissioned and scrapped in 2010, the oil tanker he originally envisioned is still considered the largest ship — and man-made moving object — ever built. In fact, Guinness World Records lists it in three categories, including longest ship, largest ship by deadweight tonnage, and largest ship ever scrapped.\n\nJapanese shipbuilder Sumitomo Heavy Industries began work on the \"Oppama\" in 1979. Its first official name is a reference to the Oppama, Jaopan shipyard where it was built, which itself had only been completed in 1971. What happens next depends on the source you read; Niarchos either went bankrupt and/or defaulted on the ship's payments. Another says he refused delivery because of vibration issues, while another claims he walked away because the shipping market had since taken a massive downturn. Whatever the scenario, the lore adds a nice dash of spice to this sea giant's story.\n\nThe ship was sold in 1979 to a Hong Kong-based shipping magnate by the name of C.Y. Tung, who owned Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL). Taking what Niarchos had started, Tung added several more feet to the overall length, which also increased its capacity. She finally launched in 1981 as the Seawise Giant, though she would later be renamed several times.\n\nFrom bow to stern, she stretched 1,504 feet (over four football fields). If placed vertically, that's taller than both Kuala Lumpur's Petronas Towers (1,391 feet) and Manhattan's Empire State Building (at 1,453 feet). Additionally, the Seawise Giant makes every other ocean-going vessel pale in comparison. For instance, the USS Enterprise, the first of the U.S. Navy's aircraft carriers to bear that name, was just around 1,119 feet long. Even the the current champ of the seas, the MSC Irina, comes in at just shy of 1,312 feet.\n\nWith a deck measuring 339,500 square feet, the Seawise Giant was so large that it could take as long as 30 minutes to walk from one end to the other, so crew members used bicycles to get around. Her 46 oil tanks could carry over four million barrels of crude oil at once. Yet despite its prodigious size, it's not the largest container ship by capacity. That distinction goes to three different vessels from the Evergreen A class (Ever Alot, Ever Atop, and Ever Aria), all capable of holding 24,004 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units, the standard measure of container-carrying capacity). Even still, the Seawise Giant's oil capacity is still staggering. The largest oil tanker currently in operation is the FSO Oceania, which can \"only\" carry 3 million barrels.\n\nOther features of the Seawise Giant were equally impressive. Her rudder weighed 230 tons, the propeller tipped the scales at 50 tons, and a single chain link on the 36-ton anchor was heftier than an automobile. When fully loaded, she took nearly six miles to come to a complete stop and had a turning circle of over two miles. What's more, she was built with a one-inch-thick reinforced double hull and could withstand whatever Mother Nature threw at it without capsizing.\n\nUnfortunately, her massive size was also the source of her biggest problem. She simply couldn't navigate through some of the world's most important thoroughfares, such as the English Channel, Suez Canal, and the Panama Canal, which takes most ships (even aircraft carriers) roughly 10 hours to traverse. Instead, she was forced to scoot around the Cape of Good Hope, and with a top speed of just 16 knots (18 mph), travel time was often lengthy. Still, her ability to move such vast volumes of crude oil made the Seawise Giant vital in the world's insatiable oil trade.\n\nIncredibly, in 1988, she became a casualty of the Iran-Iraq War. While navigating through the Strait of Hormuz, she was hit by Iraqi missiles and sank in relatively shallow waters. Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL) deemed salvaging her as too expensive and declared a total constructive loss. However, Normal International (a Norwegian company) spent millions of dollars (and 3,700 tons of steel) to salvage, repair, and return her to service, now christened as the Happy Giant.\n\nAlmost immediately after it relaunched the massive ship under a new name, Normal International was offered $39 million by Jørgen Jahre, another shipping mogul from Norway. Needless to say, it took the money. Jahre renamed the vessel Jahre Viking, and she returned to moving vast amounts of crude oil around the globe for another decade.\n\nTechnology finally caught up to the aging ship in the early 2000s as oil companies switched from using old, massive (and slow) bulk cruisers to much smaller, faster, and more agile ships. So, in 2004, Jahre sold the Viking to Singapore-based First Olsen Tankers, which converted her into a floating storage and offloading (FSO) unit, changing her name once again — this time to the Knock Nevis. She remained at the Qatar Al Shaheen oil field in the Persian Gulf for the next five years.\n\nIn 2009, this incredible ship's decades-long voyage came to an end when she was sold to a ship-breaking company in Gujarat, India, for dismantling — a far cry from how U.S. Navy ships are handled at the end of their life cycle. The Viking was so big that she had to be broken down into far more manageable pieces first, and in doing so was given one final name — Mont. It took 18,000 workers over a year to dismantle her entirely, all of which was turned into scrap. The only piece still intact is the 36-ton anchor, which is currently on display as a centerpiece for the Hong Kong Maritime Museum at its Jockey Club in Anchor Plaza.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "What are the odds Google will still be around in 2126? According to investors bidding on a rare 100-year bond from the tech titan this week, they're pretty strong.\n\nAlphabet is offering a 100-year bond as part of its latest borrowing bonanza to finance its massive AI spending. The firm is seeking tens of billions of dollars for its projects via debt issuance in a range of currencies.\n\nIt has already raised $20 billion from US investors this week in a heavily oversubscribed offering, and is seeking at least $7.5 billion denominated in UK sterling and $3.6 billion in Swiss francs.\n\nAlphabet is expected to spend at least $175 billion on its AI buildout in 2026. That's second only to Amazon's $200 billion among mega-cap hyperscalers. Equity investors have largely encouraged the Google parent's capex plans. The stock is up 68% in the last year.\n\nNow, bond investors are casting their own vote of confidence.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the century bonds, as well as the bonds with shorter maturities, drew strong demand. The £1 billion slice of the deal attracted £9.5 billion worth of bids. Its dollar bond offering in the US on Monday drew record demand from investors, Bloomberg said.\n\nAlphabet's borrowing spree is the latest big debt raise by a mega-cap tech company, with Meta Platforms and Amazon also recently completing their own bond sales. The move comes as investors and commentators have expressed some concern that debt financing for AI could be a risk if the market wobbles and investor appetite wanes.\n\nYet, if demand for Alphabet's bonds is any indication, there's no sign yet that investors are shying away from lending to the top tech firms pursuing AI.\n\nCentury bonds are rare in the corporate debt world. Issuance of debt at such a long maturity is seen in sovereign bond markets. Ford issued a hundred-year bond in 2021, but the market hasn't seen such an issuance from a tech firm since the 1990s, when companies like Motorola and IBM were selling them.\n\nAlphabet's bonds are highly rated by credit rating agencies, stamped Aa2 by Moody's and AA+ by S&P Global.",

She combined playing with a job as a teacher.\n\nConnor, one of the most influential administrators in the game, became the first female president of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 2021-22.\n\nShe became the first woman to sit on the International Cricket Council's (ICC) cricket committee and remains the chair of the governing body's women's cricket committee.\n\nConnor also served as the ECB's interim chief executive between 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe Ashes triumph she led in 2005 was the first time England women had beaten Australia for 42 years.\n\nShe retired from playing at the age of 29 and has arguably had an even greater impact on the game in the boardroom than on the field.\n\nIn Connor's time with the ECB, English women's cricket has moved from an amateur game into the professional era, including multiple changes to the domestic structure.\n\nThe decision to depart is a personal one, and Connor's exit will come after the World Cup, which ends with the final at Lord's on 5 July.\n\n\"Helping to grow women's cricket for the past 18 years has been an absolute privilege,\" said Connor.\n\n\"Having fallen in love with the game in a quite different era from the one we are in now, my goals as an administrator have been firmly rooted in making cricket more equal for women and girls.\n\n\"For it to be as normal for a girl to pick up a cricket bat as a boy. For a young woman to know - not just dream - that she can become a professional cricketer.\n\n\"To have played a part in removing some of the barriers that were preventing those things from being possible and to know that cricket is now a more inclusive and more gender balanced sport, is deeply rewarding.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "PlayStation 5 (version tested), Xbox, PC; Grasshopper Manufacture/Marvelous Inc \nAfter some dumb fun hacking at zombies, legendary developer Suda51’s first original game in a decade sadly only delivers a host of incoherent disappointments\n\nEver since he baffled GameCube owners with 2005’s Killer7, Japanese game director Suda51 has had a reputation for turning heads. From parodying the banality of open-world games with 2007’s No More Heroes to collaborating with James Gunn for 2012’s pulpy Lollipop Chainsaw, his games often offer a welcome reprieve from soulless, half-a-billion-dollar-budget gaming blockbusters. It was with considerable excitement that I fired up Suda’s first new game in 10 years.\n\nThe game kicks off with a slick cartoon that shows our hero, Romeo Stargazer, being eaten by a zombie. Hastily resurrected by his zany scientist grandfather, Romeo returns from the brink imbued with new powers – and then we’re off. Almost immediately I am bombarded by an impenetrable wall of proper-noun nonsense. It’s like this for the next 20 hours.\n\nRomeo is now a “deadman” – a being trapped between life and death – who has been recruited by the FBI’s space time police to stop interstellar criminals from terrorising the cosmos. Along the way you’ll be taking down wave after wave of unstoppable zombies – known in this world inexplicably as “bastards” – while a woman called Juliet sporadically appears in different dimensions, terrorising your dreams in PS2-era 3D, before battling you as an end of level boss. If this description sounds like it’s been written by a kid who hasn’t done his homework, I’m sorry to say that’s because even after playing this game to completion, I’m still none the wiser.\n\nIn an interview last year, Suda cited Rick and Morty as a major influence on Romeo Is a Dead Man, struggling to explain the game’s story while espousing his love of chicken katsu and sticking it to “the bastards”. I remained hopeful that there would be a deeper meaning underneath all the bafflingly juvenile nonsense, but more fool me.\n\nOutside of the story, the game itself initially seems promising. Main missions see you swinging a legally distinct lightsabre as you carve up wave after wave of “bastards”, playing like a souped up successor to the seminal No More Heroes series. Hacking and slashing at zombies is dumb fun, with stylish attacks inviting screen-filling bursts of colour. The boss fights are fun and stylised, and everything feels satisfyingly chaotic. Yet as the game drags its nonsensical story kicking and screaming to the end, even the game engine decides it’s had enough. Despite reviewing this on a PS5 Pro, I found that the frame rate regularly slowed to a crawl as I was mobbed by waves of enemies in later levels, making an already flawed game almost unplayable.\n\nIn between inter-dimensional killing sprees, players roam a charmingly retro hub world – your FBI-branded spaceship. Here everything is depicted in 16bit-era 2D pixel art, as you roam the spacecraft chatting to Romeo’s shipmates – which include an ancient Roman god, a talking cat and a Jamaican journalist. You can buy new stuff, play mini games and tend ability-granting plants inspired by the different zombies you slay along the way.\n\nOne thing Romeo Is a Dead Man has going for it is it’s always interesting to look at. From fully animated cartoon sequences to PS2-tribute polygons and sculpture-esque art, this is a game that features more disparate visual styles than most game publishers’ entire catalogue. Yet while it looks eye-catching in trailers, the final playable collage ultimately feels less auteur-led and closer to a child mashing together all the disparate contents of their toybox.\n\nRomeo Is a Dead Man is certainly not predictable. It’s capable of getting a baffled smile out of you, and its anti-gaming-establishment attitude will have diehard fans searching for an irony-drenched reason to celebrate it. But where No More Heroes’ simplistic yarn kept the fights flowing and the jokes rolling, Romeo Is a Dead Man’s sprawl feels disappointingly directionless. Instead of coming together as a kitschy universe-spanning epic, this sci-fi story is sadly told with all the mastery of a rambling drunk in Wetherspoons.\n\nRomeo Is a Dead Man is out 11 Feb; $49.99",

    "fullText": "Scottie Scheffler is currently dominating golf, as the sport looks for the next big name who can challenge the world number one.\n\nTiger Woods needed his Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia to push him to greatness, and Scheffler equally needs rivals to contend with him week in, week out, for the good of the sport.\n\nShockingly, the player who is currently taking on this role isn’t Rory McIlroy or Jon Rahm, but Chris Gotterup. The 26-year-old has won two of his three starts early in the PGA Tour season and has risen to the top five in the official world golf rankings.\n\nBut PGA Tour veterans Tommy Fleetwood and Tony Finau have chosen two different young tour rookies who they believe can be ‘special’ in the future.\n\nSix-time PGA Tour winner Finau has identified two talents on the PGA Tour who he thinks will be special, and Fleetwood agrees.\n\nAfter playing against them on TGL, he predicts a bright future for both Neal Shipley and Luke Clanton. When asked what advice he would give to them, Finau said, “I would just say keep doing what they’re doing.\n\n“They’ve gotten their careers off to a great start. The only thing they’re looking is the experience, but these young guys, what I’ve learned from a lot of these guys coming out of college, they’re not afraid of the spotlight. They’re not afraid to win. They’re not afraid to play well and be the star.\n\n“From what I’m seeing from Luke and Neal, I think they’re great kids. I can call them that because they’re younger than me. They’re in their 20s. But they’re great guys, and they have games to back it up.\n\n“I think they are both going to be special players on the PGA TOUR, and I don’t know that I would really share anything with them other than you guys, make sure you have good people around you to guide you down your path onward to success.”\n\nFleetwood added, “Yeah, I agree with Tony. I think the most important thing for those guys is to keep doing what they’re doing, and in no time, I think there’s just so many examples of — a lot of us have done it, but go searching for something that you feel like you want or lack in detriment to what you’ve already got. They’ve got so much.\n\n“You see them, it’s amazing watching them play golf. They’ve got such a great attitude and passion for the game. I think just always protect that. It’s great watching young players like that with the fire in them and how much they love it. As long as they protect that, they’ll be fine.”\n\nShipley was first thrust into the limelight when he played a round with Tiger Woods at Augusta National as an amateur. He impressed at his first Masters, making the cut and finishing T53, but it’s not been the start to his first full PGA Tour season that he’d have hoped.\n\nShipley missed the cut at his first three starts of the season, but the WM Phoenix Open saw a slight improvement in form. The popular American made the cut and finished T68 to claim his first paycheck of the season.\n\nClanton has had no such luck so far. He’s yet to make a cut, missing the weekend at the Sony Open and the Farmers Insurance Open, and he withdrew from the American Express.\n\nBoth need to improve their form if they want to retain their tour cards in 2027.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations said Monday it’s waiting to find out how much of the nearly $4 billion the United States owes the world organization the Trump administration intends to pay and when the money will arrive.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week that the world body faces “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues, a message clearly directed at the United States.\n\nThe U.S. owes $2.196 billion to the U.N.’s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year, according to a U.N. official. The U.S. also owes $1.8 billion for the separate budget for the U.N.’s far-flung peacekeeping operations, and that also will rise.\n\nThe U.S. Mission to the United Nations confirmed that U.S. Ambassador Mike Waltz said the Trump administration planned to make a significant down payment on its arrears in a matter of weeks, with the final amount still to be determined. His comments were first reported by Reuters.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Monday that Guterres has been in touch with Waltz “for quite some time,” and the U.N.’s controller also has been in touch with U.S. officials.\n\n”We’re waiting to see exactly when payments will be made and in what amount,” Dujarric said.\n\nGuterres said in a letter to all member nations last week that cash for the U.N.'s regular operating budget could run out by July, which could dramatically affect its operations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said the United Nations has not lived up to its potential. His administration did not pay anything to the United Nations in 2025, and it has withdrawn from U.N. organizations, including the World Health Organization and the cultural agency UNESCO, while pulling funding from dozens of others.\n\nU.N. officials have said 95% of the arrears to the U.N.’s regular budget is from the United States.\n\nThe country second on the list for not paying its mandatory regular dues is Venezuela, which owes $38 million, the U.N. official said. The South American nation, whose economy was struggling before the U.S. military raid in January that deposed then-President Nicolás Maduro, has lost its right to vote in the General Assembly for being two years in arrears.\n\nNearly 60 countries paid their annual dues by the Feb. 8 due date.",

    "description": "Think GPS runs the world? China's BeiDou is a fast-rising rival with military and disaster uses, plus a rapidly expanding satellite and ground network.",
    "fullText": "The term \"GPS\" has become ubiquitous in American life. You know it as the foundational technology of navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze, but in most of the world, GPS is just a meaningless trio of letters. The Global Positioning System is owned and operated by the U.S. military, and it is just one of many Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in operation around the world. In the European Union, people find their way with help from a GNSS called Galileo. In Russia, they use GLONASS (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System). Japan has QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System), commonly known as Michibiki. But there's one system that matters more than people realize: China's BeiDou isn't just a GPS alternative, it's a fast-growing platform with uses that go far beyond navigation.\n\nThe first BeiDou satellites launched in 2000, and by 2020, it had achieved global coverage. Just like America's GPS, BeiDou is owned and operated by its home government, and the ruling Chinese Communist Party has kept most of its technological specifications secret. However, BeiDou has caught the attention of other governments, particularly the United States, due to its wide-ranging uses. BeiDou does a lot more than guide people on their way to work. Just as GPS is closely tied into the American military, BeiDou is becoming ingrained in China's military operations, used by guided missiles and bombs. It's also being used for monitoring and responding to natural disasters. BeiDou is already more advanced than GPS in many ways, and it's grown at a stunning pace.\n\nBeiDou is much younger than GPS, which first launched in 1978 and achieved full coverage in 1993. However, the Chinese government has pursued progress on its GNSS much more aggressively than the United States. BeiDou was born with a competitive spirit, as part of a push to bolster China's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, at the end of the last century.\n\nA defining moment for China's GNSS ambitions came amidst the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis, when tensions between the Chinese and Taiwanese governments led to the PLA conducting a series of missile tests in the East China Sea. During one of the tests, the Chinese missiles missed their targets badly. They had been relying on a GPS signal that went out, and Chinese officials later suggested the signal had been disrupted. The CCP resolved at that moment to develop a GNSS independent of, and superior to, the Americans'. From the beginning, national defense, and particularly missile guidance, was at the forefront of BeiDou.\n\nSince the 2010s, BeiDou has played a major role in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive infrastructure project aimed at expanding trade routes across the Eastern Hemisphere. In the process, China has begun heavily promoting BeiDou on the international scale. Their partnership with the military of Pakistan in 2018 drew particular attention. Amidst a steady air of tension between Beijing and Washington, China's ability to fortify its allies' militaries will have immense geopolitical consequences in any form of conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has been steadily rolling out GPS III. It will be an upgrade over the currently available GPS system, but it will probably still fall short of BeiDou on most fronts. GPS III will add more satellites to the GPS constellation, but the new satellites are only an incremental upgrade over what's already in use. In fact, GPS III was originally intended to launch in 2014, so the system is already outdated in some ways — and the first satellites for its planned successor, GPS IIIF, aren't scheduled to launch until Spring 2027.\n\nBeiDou has raised alarms within the U.S. government amidst a tight competition with Beijing for tech superiority that has already shown the Chinese can outmatch our drone technology. Perhaps the most concerning comment about BeiDou came from within the U.S. government itself, in a memo from former Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen from 2023, which plainly said, \"GPS's capabilities are now substantially inferior to those of China's BeiDou.\"\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "Real Madrid striker Endrick's impact on loan at Lyon has been immediate, and is fuelling the teenager's \"dream\" of playing for Brazil at the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "Even those who do not follow French football in its most granular detail will be aware of the plight that could have befallen Lyon this summer.\n\nSpared from administrative relegation to Ligue 2 just five and a half weeks before the start of the season, the club's future in the French top flight hinged on their capacity to fulfil financial promises.\n\nA firesale of the side's most valuable assets duly ensued, and with it, expectations of a third successive season of European football dwindled.\n\nConstrained by their financial frailties, Les Gones, spearheaded by sporting director Matthieu Louis-Jean, had to work diligently, embarking on an agile recruitment drive.\n\nSpotting talent from lesser-known European leagues became a central tenet of their philosophy.\n\n\"We worked on different markets,\" outlined the former Nottingham Forest right-back in September.\n\nAmid a flurry of moves, Pavel Sulc and Ruben Kluivert arrived on permanent deals from Viktoria Plzen and Casa Pia respectively, while Adam Karabec joined from Sparta Prague on loan.\n\nLouis-Jean has cultivated a burgeoning reputation as a strategic operator, but his most innovative market manoeuvre would have to wait until the winter window.\n\nHaving deviated from their reactive tendencies of the past, Lyon were left without a central striker of note, preferring to secure the temporary services of Martin Satriano on loan.\n\n\"We took a decision on the final day of the transfer window to leave the position of a first-choice striker open,\" said general director Michael Gerlinger.\n\nLouis-Jean, and Lyon's wider recruitment department, were convinced an opportunity would present itself in January. Their intuition soon morphed into prophecy.\n\nHaving amassed just 99 minutes of action for Real Madrid during the first half of the season, Brazil striker Endrick needed an escape. Lyon were more than happy to provide sanctuary for a player and talisman they desperately craved.\n\n\"We had been waiting for a number nine for so long,\" said Louis-Jean upon the 19-year-old's unveiling after joining on loan until the end of the season.\n\nAt a club where strikers are held in such reverence, his impact has been almost divine.\n\nHe scored 42 minutes into his debut against Lille in the last 32 of the French Cup. Another four goals have followed in five games.\n\nThree of those came against Metz, making him the youngest player to score a Ligue 1 hat-trick for Lyon, surpassing the great Bernard Lacombe, who had held the record for 54 years.\n\nBefore Saturday's match with Nantes, no Lyon player had been directly involved in more goals (six), had more shots on target (14), or completed more dribbles (19) than the Brazilian since his arrival.\n\nEndrick's signing perpetuates a long-held legacy of Brazilians representing the club.\n\nJuninho Pernambucano, Cris and Sonny Anderson are just a few to have spent significant portions of their careers with Lyon, each contributing to the club's unprecedented run of seven successive Ligue 1 crowns between 2002 and 2008.\n\n\"I know there are a lot [of Brazilians] that have played for the club, and many of them have had a fantastic career here,\" said Endrick during his first interview with French newspaper L'Equipe.\n\nLucas Paqueta and Bruno Guimaraes, Brazil team-mates of Endrick, provided counsel prior to his move.\n\n\"Before coming, I spoke with Paqueta and Bruno,\" he said. \"They told me it was a place I could be really happy.\"\n\nPersonal fulfillment, and a chance \"to play football\" with this summer's World Cup looming, he says were driving factors in his decision to join.\n\n\"Obviously it's a dream I have - that won't change. If you don't play well for your club, however, you can't have a chance of playing for Brazil,\" he added.\n\nIf strikers are revered in Lyon, they are held in almost sacred status in Brazil.\n\n\"We don't have that mobile number nine in the Brazil side,\" says former Lyon captain Cris.\n\n\"We have Gabriel Jesus, Richarlison, but there's a space there for him to help the side with his mobility and the way he sees the game.\"\n\nUltimately, Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will be the man who decides if Endrick makes the plane.\n\n\"We had a wonderful conversation,\" said Endrick when asked about whether the Italian had been in contact before his move.\n\n\"He gave me some advice that has stayed with me,\" he added. \"Now, I have to work in order to improve and become a better player.\"\n\nLyon, and Ligue 1, provide the perfect platform for him to do just that.\n\n\"He's very explosive, very quick, very good in one-on-one situations,\" enthused Lyon manager Paulo Fonseca after his debut against Lille.\n\nHis contentious sending-off for two yellow cards against Nantes on Saturday, however, following a petulant kick out after some robust challenges against him, provides a timely reminder of the adjustments Endrick needs to make.\n\n\"When there are players of that calibre, we have to make sure to contain them,\" said Nantes manager Ahmed Kantari in the aftermath.\n\nHerein lies the challenge Endrick will have to confront - at Madrid he was part of a constellation of stars, while here he assumes that mantle almost uniquely.\n\nThat influence transcends the pitch, too - his signing representing a commercial coup as well as a sporting one.\n\n\"It's obvious his notoriety will boost the club's image,\" Gerlinger said during the Brazilian's presentation.\n\nThe results have been tangible. His arrival video, published on the club's official Instagram account, is the club's most-watched on the platform, while highlights of games against Metz, Lille, Brest and Stade Laval - in which Endrick featured - top their YouTube charts.\n\nLyon will hope his impending one-game suspension does not stymie his, or their, seamless progress of late.\n\nPrior to Endrick's arrival, Fonseca's side had recorded a run of four wins in all competitions - subsequently extended to 12.\n\nHaving crafted a favourable route to the Europa League final courtesy of their top-place finish during the league phase, a spot in the quarter-finals of the French Cup secured, and firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification, Endrick's hopes of \"making history\" at the club - like so many compatriots before him - may just come true.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "description": "With Aden Durde having become the first overseas coach to win the Super Bowl, what does it mean for the NFL and the international game?",
    "fullText": "While most of the Seattle Seahawks' staff charged on to the field at the end of Super Bowl 60, Aden Durde took a moment for himself.\n\nHe was congratulated by one colleague but then threw his headset on to a sideline bench at Levi's Stadium, sat down and gazed skywards.\n\nAs fireworks and confetti filled the Santa Clara air, a smile spread across the Briton's face as it dawned on Durde what he had achieved.\n\nThe 46-year-old from north London had just become the first overseas coach to win American football's biggest prize.\n\nIt was a dream fulfilled, one that began with watching a video of the Chicago Bears team that won the Super Bowl in 1986.\n\nSome 40 years on, now he too is a Super Bowl champion and is inspiring others outside the US to follow their NFL dreams.\n\n\"It feels amazing,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I'm still trying to process it.\n\n\"To come from London and be here, I don't take any of that for granted. I'm so proud.\"\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nDuring five years as defensive co-ordinator of the London Warriors, Durde was able to earn coaching internships with the Dallas Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons, before the latter made him Britain's first full-time NFL coach in 2018.\n\nHe progressed through roles with Atlanta and Dallas before Seattle's new head coach Mike Macdonald made Durde his defensive co-ordinator in 2024.\n\n'AD', as he is known at the Seahawks, has since helped create a defence he describes as \"fast, physical, ball-hungry, and they work as a collective\".\n\n\"AD is an absolute game-changer for us,\" said Macdonald on Monday. \"It's not just an incredible story that got him to this point, it's him as a football mind, a football coach.\n\n\"He's someone that has really brought us together, and the way that our defence plays inspired football is a great tribute to how AD operates, and what he brings to our football team and our organisation. I'm really happy for AD.\n\n\"He's just an absolute beast and he's so much fun to work with. He's right there alongside, building this whole thing. It's been a special journey.\"\n\nThe Seahawks dominated the New England Patriots to win 29-13 on Sunday, but Durde has not just become a Super Bowl champion, he has helped forge a defence that will go down in NFL folklore.\n\nSeattle's defence has been dubbed 'the Dark Side' and produced a performance long-time NFL analyst Cris Collinsworth said was \"as good as I have ever seen\".\n\n\"That's pretty cool,\" said Durde. \"But we have to give credit to the players. They made a commitment, they wanted to be the best in the world, and we got the outcome we wanted.\"\n\nWas this the ultimate Super Bowl redemption story?\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nAs he finished speaking to reporters after Sunday's game, with a British flag around his waist, Durde admitted he felt emotional.\n\n\"I'm trying to hold it back, I just want to get out of here,\" he joked.\n\nNFL analyst Phoebe Schecter used to coach with Durde on the NFL's International Player Pathway programme and shared a moment with him on the field.\n\n\"As someone that's known him for quite some time, [I know] he doesn't like to be emotional, but he couldn't help himself,\" she said.\n\n\"The moment is so big, the achievement is so big, and he knows that he's made history.\"\n\nDurde has spoken about being the best he can be, to make it easier for others to follow his lead, and Schecter is excited about what Durde's story means for the international game.\n\n\"Aden's great because he's not just thinking about himself in the moment,\" Schecter said.\n\n\"For years he's been thinking about other people, building the NFL Academy and the International Player Pathway programme. He's constantly sending that elevator back down.\n\n\"I think he knows how much it means, not just to the UK but to the rest of the international space, [for people] to think 'I could be that person one day, I could coach in the NFL'.\"\n\nWhile working with NFL UK, Durde shared an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora and they founded the IPP programme.\n\n\"I remember Osi telling me about [Durde] back in the day and then followed his journey,\" said NFL executive Peter O'Reilly.\n\n\"How talented he is and how well respected he is by his players, and what a great person he is, that just makes him someone you want to root for.\"\n\nThe IPP helped Britain's Efe Obada and Australia's Jordan Mailata get into the NFL, and former rugby league player Mailata won a Super Bowl last year with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\"Whether it's coaching or playing, having those role models, those local heroes, where someone in the UK can look up and say 'OK, there's a path for me', is really important - like last year for a young Australian looking at Jordan Mailata,\" O'Reilly added.\n\n\"The IPP is also a great breeding ground for international coaches. You want that mix of coaches, and we've been in engaged in how we build that pipeline, making sure programmes for coaching development are not just US-based but global.\"\n\nAnd Durde has challenged others to take a shot, saying: \"You just have to set goals and understand there's always people out there that do believe in you. You've just got to push forward and go for what you believe in. That's what life's about.\"\n\nWhat's next for NFL as latest international games confirmed?\n\nOnce Durde joined Seattle's on-field celebrations at Levi's Stadium, he was joined by his wife Kate and their two sons.\n\nTheir eldest son, Kane Doyle-Durde, now works as a scout for the Dallas Cowboys and their youngest Dylan is working in coaching.\n\n\"We just hugged, we were grateful for the moment,\" said Durde.\n\n\"A lot of people have sacrificed a lot for me to be sitting here, but you don't see all the people around me that helped me get here. I'm very grateful for them.\"\n\nThey include many back in the UK, who Durde aims to catch up with now the NFL season is over.\n\n\"I've got to get back to London, get this mayhem out of the way,\" he laughed. \"I need to go home.\"\n\nIn particular, Durde is looking forward to seeing his close friend Marvin Allen, one of a few Britons to own a Super Bowl ring having been on the Pittsburgh Steelers' practice squad when they became NFL champions in 2009.\n\nDurde had two interviews for head-coach positions during the current hiring cycle and - although he is set to remain with Seattle next season - Allen is confident he will become the NFL's first overseas head coach.\n\n\"Aden has come from obscurity to take an American sport by storm,\" he said.\n\n\"One day NFL owners will say 'this guy that's comes from nowhere to win a Super Bowl, let's give that guy a go'.\"\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "They Found a 2,000-Year-Old Roman Tombstone in Their Backyard. Then the FBI Showed Up.",
    "description": "The discovery prompted an international search to figure out how the ancient headstone made it to New Orleans.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA nearly 2,000-year-old tombstone of a Roman sailor was discovered in the backyard of a New Orleans home.\n\nThe Latin inscription on the grave marker prompted a search for the origin story of the marble stone.\n\nThe buzz about the find in the local news led to the discovery of just how the ancient piece crossed the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThis story is a collaboration with Biography.com.\n\nThe discovery of a nearly 2,000-year-old Roman sailor’s tombstone wasn’t so much an excavation as a backyard cleanup at a New Orleans home.\n\nWhen Daniella Santoro and her husband, Aaron Lorenz, started clearing away brush in the yard of their home, they uncovered a marble slab with what appeared to be a Latin inscription carved on it. In a strange turn of events, the slab turned out to be the grave marker of a Roman military sailor originally housed in an Italian museum. How it ended up 5,250 miles away is quite a journey.\n\nWhen Santoro, an anthropologist at Tulane University and the owner of the historic home on Cambronne Street in the Carrollton neighborhood in New Orleans, initially found the slab, she thought it could have been from one of the city’s historic cemeteries. She contacted D. Ryan Gray, professor of anthropology at the University of New Orleans.\n\n“I never feel like I’ve seen it all,” Gray wrote on the website of the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans. “There are always surprises and new mysteries to solve.”\n\nThose new mysteries don’t often come with international intrigue that include World War II, garden decor, and the F.B.I.\n\nWith no cemeteries close by, Gray asked for help from a colleague at the University of Innsbruck and scholars at Tulane to decipher the Latin. They independently concluded that the stone featured a Roman funerary inscription for a sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus.\n\nThe second-century C.E. inscription read: “To the Spirits of the Dead for Sextus Congenius Verus, solider of the praetorian fleet Misenensis, from the tribe of the Bessi [of Thrace], (who) lived 42 years (and) served 22 in the military, on the trireme [warship] Asclepius. Atilius Carus and Vettius Longinus, his heirs, made (this) for him, well deserving.”\n\nMore shocking: this inscription was already known in the world of anthropology. “In fact, a stone fitting that exact description was missing from the city museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, near where it had originally been found,” Gray said. “This was a bit of a surprise, and it changed the scope of our inquiries.”\n\nAfter the backyard discovery and identification, the F.B.I.’s Art Crime Team got involved, picking up the one-foot-wide stone and keeping it in custody while the repatriation process kicked off to return the grave marker back to its original home.\n\nGetting the stone back to the Italian museum was one thing, but figuring out how it got to New Orleans was another.\n\nGray started investigating the owners of the home from the 20th century, when the house stayed in the same family for much of the 1900s. Thanks to the U.S. Census, Gray deduced that Frank Simon purchased the house for his family in 1909 while he was working at a wholesale shoe company. His daughters, working as seamstresses, later owned the home. But those facts provided no clues as to how a stone moved from Italy to Louisiana.\n\nWith that dead-end in place, Gray turned to the next-door neighbor, a U.S. Navy veteran who served in World War II. That, too, was a non-starter, showing he deployed in the Pacific and was never stationed in Italy.\n\nSusann Lusnia, associate professor of classical studies at Tulane, took the search to Italy, where she was already planning a summer research stint. She met with staff and curators at the city museum and learned the headstone’s original site, located northwest of Rome, was a major port for the Roman empire and remained a port into the 20th century. Allied bombing raids in 1943 and 1944 targeted the city in World War II, and the museum was destroyed and collections lost.\n\nLusnia discovered the marker was likely lost in the chaos after the war and confirmed the 34th division of the Fifth Army of the U.S. traveled through the town after liberating Rome, with units remaining in the area. At that point, Gray figured there had to be a connection between the soldiers of World War II and the slab, but he had no way of sifting through so many names.\n\nThat’s when crowdsourcing finished the job. As the local news picked up the story, a previous homeowner at the Cambronne Street site heard about the mysterious headstone and immediately made the connection, remembering placing the stone in the garden while planting a tree at her new house two decades ago.\n\n“I just thought it was a piece of art,” said Erin Scott O’Brien, according to Preservation in Print. “I had no idea it was a 2,000-year-old relic.”\n\nO’Brien’s grandfather, Charles Paddock Jr., served in the U.S. Army during World War II, stationed in Italy for a time. He returned to New Orleans in 1946 with his new wife, Adele, who he met in Italy. Charles taught at Loyola University and the tablet in question sat in a cabinet in his Baccich Street home. But with both grandparents passing in the 1980s, O’Brien didn’t know its significance. She ended up with what she thought was a decorative piece and added it to the backyard décor over two decades ago.\n\n“I was really thinking we’d have our list of possible people through whom it could have ended up here,” Gray said. “I didn’t really expect to actually find the actual person, so it’s pretty exciting to know how it ended up here.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "All the explanation in the world is worth less than a tenth of the solution, but we’re stuck with the former for now.",
    "fullText": "After coughing up a stoppage time equalizer to Torino on Saturday, Fiorentina’s emotional state is somewhere between crumbling and smoldering. It had looked as if the Viola were going to record their first comeback win of the Serie A season; they’ve conceded first in 13 of 24 league matches in this year, taking a total of 5 points from them. That’s left manager Paolo Vanoli and his squad facing what feels like their 15th consecutive inquest.\n\nI’m just as frustrated as everyone about Fiorentina’s inability to hang on in the dying minutes of a game, not least because this equalizer was so predictable that even I saw it coming. As I often do when I’m sad, I decided to suck as many of the emotions out of my head as possible and turned to the pure, cold realm of numbers, hoping to throttle my sadness with math like a healthy person does. Long story short, I made myself a little table.\n\nI started out wondering if Fiorentina’s conceded more late goals (final 10 minutes and stoppage time) of any team in Serie A this year, but I quickly realized how limited that approach was because it ignored everything else. I decided to include the number of goals teams had scored as well as conceded, as the net value felt more important.\n\nI also decided figure out the rate at which teams conceded late goals. Dividing a 90 minute game into 6 10-minute periods made the most sense. You’d expect teams to concede about 16.67% of their goals in each 10-minute period. Anyways, I grabbed my data and went to my trusty visualizing website. The table’s sortable by any column if you want to play around with it.\n\nMuch to my astonishment, I discovered that Fiorentina isn’t the worst team in Serie A at the end of games by any measure. Hellas Verona and Pisa have both conceded 10 goals in the final 10 minutes, while Fiorentina sits at “just” 9. The percentage of total goals conceded late pulled me up short: the Viola are only 5th-worst, with Verona and Pisa below them, as well as high-flying Roma and Inter Milan? What? That’s wacky.\n\nThe attacking numbers were equally anemic for Vanoli’s boys: just 3 goals scored in the last 10 minutes of games, comprising 11.11% of the total goals conceded. In a truly bizarre statistical quirk, that’s the same as Sassuolo and Udinese while also being considerably higher than both Verona and Roma. Inter, by the way, is blowing everyone else away in late goals, turning this apparent weakness into a strength. In short, the Mastini are for sure the worst late-game team in Serie A, with Fiorentina, Pisa, and Roma jostling for the other two spots on the podium.\n\nOkay, so we’ve determined that Fiorentina isn’t Serie A’s worst late-game team. Let the joy be unconfined, et cetera. The performance in crunch time, though, is obviously a concern and is one of several culprits for the Viola swoon into the relegation places. We’ve got the numbers here to contextualize how dire the situation is but they, like the stars, offer us no solutions.\n\nMuch of it comes down to that squishiest of hard facts: late-game mindset. Against Torino, Fiorentina dominated the second half, scored twice to overturn an undeserved first half deficit, and seemed to be cruising. The only shot the Granata mustered from minutes 46-80 was Saul Coco’s speculative blast from 30-odd yards. Clearly the Viola defense had bottled up the visitors: Torino had 3 touches in the Viola penalty area and none were threatening.\n\nRight around the 80 minute mark, though, Vanoli lost his nerve. He knew that Marco Baroni’s guys, seeing every opportunity to get something from a fragile opponent, would throw everything forward, and the Viola mister wasn’t sure his guys could weather the storm. To help, he brought on Luca Ranieri for Manor Solomon, adding an out-of-form defender for the winger who’d scored one of Fiorentina’s goals and had a hand in the other. Roberto Piccoli also replaced Moise Kean.\n\nIt’s obviously much easier to say this in hindsight but that was a massive error for three reasons. First, Torino no longer had to worry about Solomon and Kean’s pace. That allowed everyone to move up the pitch, safe in the knowledge that there was no counterattack coming. Indeed, Piccoli did some great work late on in beating 2 defenders and getting down the wing but there was nobody with him by the time he reached the end line and it went for a Torino goal kick.\n\nThe second reason was relational. Having defended with a back 4 for 80 minutes and done it quite well (aside from the opening goal), introducing Ranieri to create a back 5 threw everyone off. Torino easily overloaded the wings, forcing Fiorentina’s midfield 3 to shuffle back and forth across the pitch. That eventually created creases like the one Zakaria Aboukhlal found in stoppage time. Sure, Comuzzo shouldn’t have fouled him. But the Moroccan also shouldn’t have had half the pitch to himself and the Ginger Prince, uncertain about the covering defense, opted to bring him down rather than give him a free run.\n\nFinally, Vanoli’s substitutions told his players that they weren’t on the front foot anymore. Fiorentina’s got the mental and emotional strength of a clinically-depressed rutabaga so seeing the team brimming with confidence en route to retaking the lead was a welcome change. That mindset led to a strong second half performance. By dropping deep, the mister essentially told his players, “I don’t believe that you can keep this up so we’ve got to hang on by our fingernails instead.” Confidence isn’t quantifiable but, for a group like this, anything that could damage it has to be weighed carefully.\n\nIt’s easy to fall into the post hoc facto rationalizations, of course. Vanoli’s a smart coach and understands the game and this roster better than any of us. If Torino hadn’t scored, we’d be applauding his sensible parking of the bus. Alternatively, if he hadn’t changed anything and Torino had still equalized, we’d be fuming about his failure to react to the scoreboard in the final moments.\n\nThis is also an overreaction based on a single outcome. The Torino result was uniquely psychically damaging for a number of reasons, not least because it resulted in the 6th and 7th points lost to late goals over the past 10 league outings. To me, the difference is in perceived strength of the opponent. Fiorentina is terrible and Milan isn’t, so losing that game is irritating but also feels like justice. Losing to Hellas Verona, the worst late-game team in Serie A, is an act of god from which nobody is safe.\n\nTorino, though, is historically a club more or less on par with Fiorentina: not big enough to consistently trouble the Champions League places but too good to accept mid-table anonymity. Getting punked by your betters or ambushed by your inferiors stings but not as much as messing up against an equal. That’s the sort of result that forces you to take a long look in the mirror and reassess who you are.",

    "fullText": "While theme park giants such as Disney and Universal have continued to see high visitor numbers in an uncertain economy, many smaller amusement parks and themed hotels in different parts of the world have struggled with rising operational costs, to the point of having to shut down business.\n\nAfter posting a loss of more than $1.2 billion at the end of 2025, Six Flags shared its intention to close more \"underperforming\" locations in its amusement and water park portfolio across North America. A Six Flags park in Maryland had closed down month earlier in November 2025.\n\nAt the start of the new year, the Cartoon Network Hotel serving primarily visitors to the Dutch Wonderland park in central Pennsylvania also shut its doors over a string of financial challenges dating back to the Covid pandemic.\n\nOperating in the British seaside town of Somerset since 1946, Brean Theme Park has become the latest theme park to risk a total shutdown after being assigned liquidators over its financial situation.\n\nThe 80-year-old park was originally a campsite for visitors to the coastline along the Bristol Channel but was expanded into a theme park with rides in the 1970s.\n\nThe park that had become beloved local staple known for its free entry (visitors paid credits for rides they wanted to take) had more than 40 attractions and was preparing to open for the summer season in March when it announced that it was taking \"resolutions for winding-up\" on February 4.\n\nNicholas Stafford of Hazlewoods LLP is the insolvency attorney overseeing the liquidation of Brean in a way that helps creditors and shareholders recoup some of their losses.\n\nAs a former public company, Brean stopped trading at the end of January and, short of a last-minute Hail Mary, will be shuttered forever in the coming weeks. The local notice announcing this decision states that \"the Company be wound up voluntarily.\"\n\nAccording to local reports, visitor numbers dipped significantly during the Covid pandemic, and the theme park was not able to recover from the debt created during that period.\n\nThe closure marks a significant blow to both the Somerset community and vacationers from nearby cities such as Gloucester and Bristol.\n\nThe struggling theme park had been renting land from Unity Holidays, the company also behind parks such as Brean Unity Holidays, Brean Splash, Brean Play, and Brean Gym, reported U.K. outlet Daily Express. Those parks, according to their ownership, will continue to operate in the coming summer.",

The letter said many of these have increased costs, disrupted market access, blocked access to labor, and stopped important agricultural research. Combined, these effects were deemed catastrophic.\n\n\"Our farmers and ranchers can compete with the world, but they can't compete with the world with a chaotic set of policy circumstances,\" said former chief executive of the National Corn Growers Association, Jon Doggett, per The New York Times.\n\nOther signers included Buzz Mattelin, the previous president of the National Barley Growers Association, and Bart Ruth, the previous president of the American Soybean Association.\n\nDomestic agriculture helps people in the U.S. meet their dietary needs. Collapse of the industry would also create steep economic and cultural loss. The challenges imposed by government policy are compounded by a wildly erratic climate.\n\nExisting and ongoing pollution is trapping heat in the atmosphere, which exacerbates destructive weather trends. This includes floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires, all of which pose existential threats to farmers. These weather shifts have also introduced new opportunities for the proliferation of pests, which could obliterate staple crops.\n\n\"Congress needs to assert itself on behalf of farmers if we are to avoid a widespread collapse of American agriculture and our rural communities,\" said the letter.\n\nThe letter recommended nine actions to alleviate the pressure on American farmers. These included exempting farm inputs from tariffs, supporting more trade agreements, and restoring funding to agricultural research.\n\nWhile institutional action is needed, there are individual actions that can be taken.\n\nAdopting a plant-based diet can ensure cropland is being used efficiently to feed people.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is threatening to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, a long-awaited new border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump said he would not allow the bridge to open until the US is \"fully compensated for everything we have given them,\" adding that Canada must treat the United States with what he described as \"fairness and respect.\"\n\n\"We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY. With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,\" Trump added.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is expected to be completed in early 2026 and has been under construction since 2018. The $6.4 billion project is entirely funded by Canada's Federal government, and will feature six lanes and a pedestrian and cycling path.\n\nThe University of Windsor's Cross-Border Institute estimated in a 2021 study that the new route will save about 850,000 hours a year for trucks, which would mean billions of dollars in savings over the bridge's lifetime. The study also found that the Windsor-Detroit corridor is the largest pathway for trade between the US and Canada.\n\nTrump's remarks mark the latest escalation in tensions with Canada, a key US trading partner, as the president steps up his criticism of the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa moves forward with a trade deal with China.\n\nHe also bristled at comments made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which were widely seen as an implicit rebuke of Trump's foreign and economic policies.

But soon after, the American confirmed his departure from the league and announced plans to spend most of his season on the DP World Tour while serving a one-year suspension from the PGA Tour.\n\nReed’s suspension is set to end in August, but he was already planning to return as a past champion. His recent win at the Qatar Masters has nearly secured him one of the 10 full cards available through the DP World Tour.\n\nHowever, with two wins already this year, there are growing calls for him to be reinstated sooner rather than later.\n\nRyan Lavner discussed the possibility of an early return on the Golf Channel Podcast and argued that the PGA Tour should make use of Reed’s current form.\n\n“I love this idea because if we’re already rewriting the rules with this Returning Member Program, here’s another rule that they should write in: a battlefield promotion on the DP World Tour.\n\n“If you win three times, you should automatically jump to the PGA Tour. They already do it for the Korn Ferry Tour. You do have the strategic alliance, expedite Patrick Reed to the PGA Tour if he wins one more time,” he stated.\n\nIf Reed gets the chance to return to the PGA Tour and takes it, it would be a blow for the European circuit.\n\nHe has given an immediate lift to some of the DP World Tour events that do not carry the same profile as those in the Rolex Series.\n\nAs of now, it looks like his first event even partly connected to the PGA Tour will be at the Scottish Open in July.\n\nWith his world ranking now inside the top 20, Reed should also qualify for The Players Championship in March.\n\nBut his suspension is set to keep him out of TPC Sawgrass unless a rule change opens that door.

Endo - like Jones - is out of contract in 2027 with the club having listened to several offers for the Japan captain over previous transfer windows.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister has been heavily linked with Real Madrid and it remains to be seen what kind of conclusion contract talks reach with Gravenberch and Szoboszlai too.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nIt’s no wonder we’ve seen several midfield targets associated with an Anfield move ahead of the window opening. And one of those who HAS been sounded out for a deal is Newcastle’s wantaway playmaker Sandro Tonali.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been on Tyneside since 2023 - establishing himself as a consistent presence in both the Premier League and Champions League.\n\nBut it looks like the Italian international’s time with the Toon could be coming to an end. Under contract until 2028 the player’s agent revealed last week that it was perhaps time to consider his future.\n\nNewcastle will be against losing him for nothing in two years and so could be forced to entertain bids this summer instead.\n\nAnd a report in TEAMtalk is now claiming that Liverpool - as well as Arsenal and Manchester City have opened talks with the midfield schemer’s entourage over the terms of a deal.\n\n“Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City have all made contact with Tonali’s camp,” the report reads.\n\nBut right now Premier League suitors appear to be in second place - with Tonali preferring a return to Serie A for family reasons.\n\n“The midfielder’s heart is pulling him back to Italy, where he wants to settle again with his family,” the report reads.\n\n“Juventus and Inter Milan are both extremely keen to make that happen.”",

    "fullText": "Visit the ancient city of Anuradhapura on a full moon day and the past feels anything but distant.\n\nBuddhist pilgrims dressed in white walk barefoot along dusty paths. Saffron-robed monks chant at dawn. Foreign visitors — from Taiwan to Canada — join local worshipers in rituals that have been performed here, largely uninterrupted, for more than 2,000 years.\n\nSet on Sri Lanka’s north-central plains, Anuradhapura was the island’s first great capital. Today, it remains one of the most sacred cities in the Buddhist world, known as the first place to adopt Buddhism outside of India. Scattered across its vast archaeological park are monasteries, reservoirs and stupas that rank among the most ambitious religious monuments ever built.\n\nTowering above them is the immense, bubble-shaped dome of Jetavanaramaya — a structure so large that when it was completed in the early fourth century CE, it ranked as the third-largest man‑made building on Earth, surpassed only by the Great Pyramids of Giza.\n\nCompleted around 301 CE using an estimated 93.3 million baked mud bricks, the stupa originally rose to around 122 meters (400 feet), making it one of the tallest structures of the ancient world.\n\nToday, after centuries of collapse, abandonment and restoration, Jetavanaramaya stands at roughly 71 meters (233 feet) — still monumental, but little more than half its original height. Even so, it remains the largest brick structure by volume ever constructed.\n\nSo vast is its mass that archaeologists estimate its bricks could build a three-foot-high wall stretching from London to Edinburgh — or from New York City to Pittsburgh.\n\nYet outside Sri Lanka, Jetavanaramaya is little known. Unlike the pyramids, it was not continuously visible to history. Jungle growth, shifting religious priorities and selective preservation gradually buried both the monument and much of its story, leaving one of the ancient world’s greatest engineering achievements largely forgotten.\n\nJetavanaramaya refers not only to the stupa itself, but to the heart of a vast monastic complex known as Jetavana Vihara, designed to house hundreds of monks. Every structure in the complex was oriented toward the stupa, ensuring that monks stepping outside their residences would face it first — a daily reminder of devotion and cosmological order.\n\n“About 200 monks lived here,” explains Godamune Pannaseeha, a bespectacled monk and senior archaeology officer in Anuradhapura, and one of the foremost contemporary experts on Jetavanaramaya.\n\n“People came to offer robes, books, food — everything — to gain merit,” he says, pointing to the lower terraces of the stupa where offerings were once made, while walking a slow, clockwise circuit around its base. “This was a living religious city.”\n\nFrom the outset, however, Jetavanaramaya was controversial. It was built on land traditionally associated with the Maha Vihara, the orthodox Theravada Buddhist establishment, reportedly without the consent of its monks. The complex later became associated with the Sagalika sect, which followed Mahayana‑leaning doctrines.\n\nNo Mahayana chronicles from ancient Sri Lanka have survived. Today, Sri Lanka remains a predominantly Theravada Buddhist nation. As a result, much of Jetavanaramaya’s history — including the political and doctrinal tensions surrounding its creation — must be reconstructed indirectly, leaving historians with incomplete and sometimes contested versions.\n\nThe technical challenges involved in building Jetavanaramaya were immense. Unlike Egypt’s stone pyramids, this colossal structure was built almost entirely from mud bricks — a material far more vulnerable to erosion and collapse.\n\n“To replace one stone block, you need perhaps 10 bricks,” says Anura Manatunga, senior professor of archaeology at Sri Lanka’s University of Kelaniya. “That means millions upon millions of bricks had to be prepared, transported and laid with precision.”\n\nArchaeologists have identified ancient brick kilns in and around Anuradhapura, confirming large‑scale brick production in the region. None, however, can yet be definitively linked to Jetavanaramaya or securely dated to the early fourth century.\n\nMoving this volume of material would have required extraordinary organization — and labor.\n\nWhile no records specifically mention animals at Jetavanaramaya, historians believe elephants and bullock carts were almost certainly used, as they were at other major Sri Lankan construction sites — including Ruwanwelisaya, the city’s most sacred stupa, built centuries earlier in 140 BCE.\n\nElephants likely hauled bricks and stamped down soil at the foundations, a technique used in traditional construction on the island until relatively recent times.\n\nScaffolding would have relied heavily on bamboo, bound with coir rope made from coconut fibre and jungle creepers. Metal was used sparingly, reserved for tools rather than structural elements.\n\nJetavanaramaya reflects the height of ancient Sri Lankan engineering knowledge. Its massive hemispherical form distributes weight efficiently, while its foundations were carefully prepared. Ancient chronicles describe how builders flooded excavated ground to observe absorption — a rudimentary but effective form of soil testing.\n\nA fallen section of the stupa reveals further ingenuity. Pannaseeha points out a hollow, cylindrical chamber within the ruins that suggests an early understanding of ventilation.\n\nDespite this sophistication, time has taken its toll. Earthquakes, monsoon rains and centuries of abandonment caused sections of the stupa to collapse. The last major renovation took place in the 12th century, during the reign of King Parakramabahu I.\n\nMore recent restoration efforts introduced cement into some outer layers — a decision archaeologists now believe may have accelerated deterioration rather than prevented it. The original mortar used to lay its bricks was composed of a mixture of finely crushed dolomite, limestone, sieved sand and clay.\n\nExcavations have also uncovered reliquary caskets embedded throughout the stupa at different structural levels. These held sacred relics and ritual deposits, reinforcing Jetavanaramaya’s role not only as an architectural feat but as a sacred structure built from the inside out.\n\nAmong the most significant discoveries linked to Jetavanaramaya are gold panels depicting Bodhisattva imagery and inscribed with sections of the Prajñāpāramitā sutra, a foundational Mahayana Buddhist text. Now held at the National Museum in Colombo, the panels were written in Sanskrit using ancient local scripts.\n\nThey offer rare material evidence of Mahayana practice in ancient Sri Lanka, suggesting Jetavana was once a center of cosmopolitan Buddhist thought, connected by doctrine and trade routes to India and beyond.\n\nStanding at the base of the stupa, Pannaseeha gestures toward the damaged spire.\n\n“Historical accounts say that a diamond once crowned the pinnacle, possibly to deflect lightning during monsoon storms,” he says.\n\nThe spire itself is unusual. “It resembles a tower,” he notes — a form some scholars believe may reflect technological influence from the Roman or broader Mediterranean world, transmitted through Indian Ocean trade networks.\n\nWhether symbolic or functional, much about its construction remains unclear.\n\n“We can see small remains of the decorative motifs, including those of the Naga, a cobra-hood form,” Pannaseeha adds, pointing to intricate carvings at the base. “But we still don’t know exactly how they were fixed in place.”\n\nJetavanaramaya’s immense scale invites comparison with Ruwanwelisaya, the gleaming white stupa nearby that today holds far greater religious significance for Sri Lankans.\n\nRuwanwelisaya is believed to enshrine some of Buddhism’s most venerated relics, including a portion of the Buddha’s remains. It remains the focal point of pilgrimage and national religious life.\n\nThough smaller than Jetavanaramaya in its original form, Ruwanwelisaya has been continuously maintained and today rises higher than Jetavana’s truncated structure, standing at more than 100 meters (328 feet).\n\nWhere Jetavanaramaya represents architectural audacity and doctrinal debate, Ruwanwelisaya embodies devotional continuity.\n\nEetalawetunwawe Gnanathilaka Thero, one of the country’s most respected religious figures and chief monk at the Ruwanwelisaya, has noticed a steady increase in foreign visitors to Anuradhapura in recent years.\n\n“First there was civil war, then a pandemic,” he says. “But the past two years, there has been a noticeable increase in foreign visitors to our holy city.”\n\nTravelers are welcome to observe — and participate in — any of the nine daily puja rituals, with the first beginning at dawn.\n\nVisit on a full moon day and thousands of pilgrims arrive, waiting patiently to enter Ruwanwelisaya and Sri Maha Bodhi, the temple that surrounds a sacred fig tree believed to be grown from a sapling of the tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment.\n\nPerhaps the most striking fact about Jetavanaramaya is that nothing like it was ever built again. For nearly 700 years after its completion, no stupa of comparable scale was attempted in Sri Lanka.\n\n“This was the last truly gigantic stupa,” Manatunga says. “Not only here, but even in Southeast Asia, later builders adopted the same bubble-shaped form — but never at this scale.”\n\nJetavanaramaya stands today as evidence of an ancient society capable of organizing labor, materials and engineering knowledge on a scale that rivalled any civilization of its time.\n\nThat it remains relatively unknown beyond Sri Lanka may be one of history’s great oversights — a reminder that some of the ancient world’s most extraordinary achievements were not carved in stone, but shaped from earth, devotion and human ingenuity.",

    "title": "Meet ‘The Baroness’—the world’s longest wild snake",
    "description": "She's more than 23 feet long, and verified by Guinness World Records.",
    "fullText": "Nothing could have prepared Radu Frentiu for meeting the snake known as Ibu Baron, which means \"The Baroness\" in Indonesian.\n\n“I had never seen a snake this big,” says Frentiu. “This snake could easily swallow at least a calf, if not an adult cow.”\n\nFrentiu, an explorer and natural history photographer who has lived in Bali, Indonesia, for two decades, has encountered his share of big snakes. But Ibu Baron deserved a record-breaking distinction.\n\nGuinness World Records recently confirmed that Ibu Baron, a reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus), is believed to be the longest verifiably measured wild snake in the world. She was first discovered in the Maros region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, in late 2025.\n\nFrentiu learned about the giant python from Diaz Nugraha, a wildlife guide, rescuer, and licensed snake handler from Borneo. Together, they traveled to Sulawesi to see the animal firsthand and measure her.\n\nOn January 18, Frentiu and Nugraha weighed and measured Ibu Baron, documenting the process with photographs and video to be as transparent as possible. Using a surveyor’s tape that followed the snake’s natural curves, they recorded a total length of 23 feet and 8 inches from head to tail tip. The python also weighed in at 213 pounds—and that was on an empty stomach.\n\nFrentiu says the snake’s true length could be even longer, since she was not sedated when the measurements were taken. Under anesthesia, a snake’s muscles fully relax, potentially adding another 10 to 15 percent to her length.\n\nReticulated pythons are already the world’s longest snake species, typically reaching lengths between 10 to 19 feet. Larger individuals have been reported throughout history, but most claims rely on secondhand accounts or animals that were killed shortly after discovery. In many cases, the snakes vanish before their size can ever be verified. “These giant animals attract attention as status symbols,” Frentiu says. “They tend to disappear, or something bad happens to them.” Ibu Baron’s continued survival is what makes her exceptional.\n\nLocal conservationist Budi Purwanto, who acted quickly when word of the snake spread, has played an important role in Ibu Baron’s longevity. Rather than allowing her to be sold or killed, he acquired her and constructed a makeshift shelter on his property, where she now lives alongside several other rescued snakes. Releasing her into the local area would be risky. Large prey animals, such as babirusa and other wild pigs, are scarce, while human settlements are numerous.\n\n“A python this big will probably be drawn toward a village,” Frentiu explains. “And once that happens, it will almost certainly be killed.”\n\nAcross Indonesia, habitat loss and declining prey have pushed large snakes into closer contact with humans. Reticulated pythons are non-venomous, but their size and strength make them lethal predators capable of killing livestock and, in rare cases, people. Human fear is often fatal for the snakes, which are also hunted for bushmeat and targeted by the illegal wildlife trade.\n\nFor Frentiu, Nugraha, and Purwanto, Ibu Baron represents a chance to change that dynamic. By protecting her and keeping her visible, including through recognition by Guinness World Records, they hope to show that giant snakes can be worth more alive than dead. “It can give this animal importance and hopefully value,” Frentiu says. “It can empower local communities to look after these animals and view them as a resource for the long-term.” He points to a growing niche of herpetological tourism—wildlife tours focused on spotting reptiles and amphibians—as one possible path forward.\n\nFrentiu is careful not to frame Ibu Baron as the record-holder for all time—there could be even bigger snakes out there. “I do not believe in the slightest that this is the largest wild snake. I got lucky,” he says.\n\n“There are still wonders out there. This is one of them—and I don’t think it’s the last.”",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh have requested that Pakistan end their planned boycott of their T20 World Cup match against India, opening the door for the fixture to be played on 15 February as scheduled.\n\nThe match, the biggest and most lucrative in cricket, has been in doubt since the Pakistan government advised its team not to take the field against their long-time rivals.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that initial decision was made to \"support\" Bangladesh, who had a request for their matches to be moved out of India rejected and subsequently pulled out of the tournament.\n\nBut, after talks between officials at the Pakistan Cricket Board, the International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in Lahore on Sunday, BCB president Ameenul Islam requested the match go ahead \"for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem\".\n\n\"We are deeply moved by Pakistan's efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish,\" he added.\n\nThe match is scheduled to take place in the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka, the co-hosts for the tournament with India.\n\nPakistan will forfeit the points from the group-stage match should it not be played but the team's absence from the tournament would also have longer-term consequences for cricket.\n\nIt could lead to disputes over the ICC's current rights deals and continued uncertainty would likely impact future agreements, with the current TV deals set to run out after the 2027 World Cup.\n\nMany of the smaller cricketing nations rely on the money distributed by the ICC, so any cut in revenue would likely hit such countries hardest.\n\n\"Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,\" Islam said.\n\nWhile stopping short of confirming the match will go ahead, the ICC released a statement on Monday evening confirming Bangladesh will not be sanctioned for their boycott.\n\nIt also said Bangladesh will host an ICC event between 2028 and the start of the 2031 World Cup.\n\n\"The ICC, PCB and BCB, along with other members, remain committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport,\" a statement said.\n\n\"All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity.\"\n\nThere were no details on what event Bangladesh would host. All men's events have been confirmed up until 2031, with Bangladesh already scheduled to co-host the 2031 World Cup with India.\n\nThe hosts of women's tournaments have been chosen up to 2027, while the ICC also holds Under-19 World Cups.\n\nThe PCB has been contacted for comment.\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?",

    "fullText": "He has been jailed, tracked and threatened by China’s government. What was it like pay a visit home? As he publishes a polemic about surveillance and state control, the artist relives a momentous trip to see his mother\n\nAi Weiwei is talking me through the decision-making process before his first visit to China in over a decade. The artist, known around the world as the most famous critic of the Chinese communist regime, had to do some fraught arithmetic before deciding to head back home.\n\nBefore boarding a flight with his son, who had never met the artist’s elderly mother, Ai thought back to his time in detention when his captors told him he would spend the next 13 years in custody on bogus charges: “They said, ‘When you come out, your son won’t recognise you.’ That was very heavy and really the only moment that touched me.”\n\nHe ended up spending several months in captivity. Lao, his son, is now 17. Ai says Lao doesn’t really need his guidance any more so he decided to book their flights and roll the dice. “People said, ‘Are you scared?’ I said, ‘No, why should I be scared?’ I’m Chinese. I have a Chinese passport. I’m entitled to go back and see my mum. So I went back.”\n\nWelcome to the life of Ai Weiwei. For most people, returning home doesn’t involve weighing up the risk of whether you’ll see close family ever again, but that’s the reality for a 68-year-old whose whole existence has been shaped by authoritarianism and the struggle against it.\n\nHis trip to China went well. He ended up being interviewed at the airport and released after a couple of hours into a country whose smells, sights and sounds were soothing to him. Ai described the journey as being like “a phone call suddenly reconnecting”. Today, he’s more poetic, describing it as “a piece of jade broken that you can put back together because it matches very well. Everything’s so familiar: the light, the temperature, the people.”\n\nAi is meeting me in the London offices of his publisher to talk about his new book, On Censorship, a 90-page polemic on the nature of state control, AI and surveillance. The man certainly knows about these things. Born in Beijing in 1957, he grew up in labour camps in north-west China following the exile of his father, the poet Ai Qing. In 2011, he was detained for 81 days in a 170 sq ft windowless prison because of his own activism. Upon his release, he was tracked, interrogated and threatened by the Chinese state; then his passport was returned in 2015 and he began a life in exile. He currently divides his time between Lisbon, Berlin and Cambridge.\n\nHis artworks are as dramatic as his backstory. An army of 1,600 Chinese artisans created 100m hand-painted porcelain “seeds” that were scattered over the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in London 16 years ago. He cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus in 14,000 fluorescent orange lifejackets worn by refugees; and made a film dedicated to the children who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. That direct challenge to the official state narrative made him “the most dangerous person in China”.\n\nHis upcoming work, at Aviva Studios in Manchester, involves 30 tonnes of buttons, which were saved from a London factory that was closing down and smuggled into China to be turned into huge hanging artworks by craftspeople.\n\nThe book is a startling read, arguing that those in the west misunderstand the nature of censorship. He defines it as “the exercise of power over intellectual space”, both “an indispensable tool of mental enslavement and a fundamental source of political corruption”. It is not just authoritarian regimes, he warns. Liberal societies think that censorship is rare, “but people forget that even on sunny days, shadows are inevitable”.\n\nSome of the arguments are perplexing. In a section about the limitations of AI, the artist refers to the selfie he took with AfD leader Alice Weidel in 2018. He says AI decided that the image, which is real, must have been fake because the pair seemed to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At the time of the selfie, Weidel, whose grandfather was a Nazi, was considered to be in the more moderate wing of the far-right party, but since becoming leader has called for “large-scale repatriations” of foreigners, saying the country’s focus on the Holocaust is akin to a “guilt cult”.\n\nDoes Ai regret the selfie? He tells me that on many issues, her political demands “could be wrong”, but she’s still “more rational than other political opponents in Germany”. What about her anti-immigrant rhetoric – isn’t that anathema to him? “Some states don’t even accept one [immigrant] and Germany accepts 1.2 million, which is a pretty generous decision,” he replies. “So if they change the policy and they want to limit it, then there is nothing wrong.”\n\nHe’s also impressed by the fact that Weidel “openly wants Germany to be more independent from American influence”. He adds: “I think those are some of the things that we need to do.” Those who know German politics would find that argument surprising because the AfD are seen as the party who are closest to Trump and nearly all parties in the country want more independence from the US. A ringing endorsement of someone at the outermost reaches of far-right European politics might cause a few double takes, and there are more surprises.\n\nAi’s attitude to China has shifted dramatically. The nation, he said recently, is “in an upward phase,” pointing to the technological advancements made and increased personal freedoms. The west, however, struggles to “sustain its own logic”, has lost its “ethical authority” and has “descended into something barely recognisable”.\n\nAlthough a quick glance across the Atlantic at America in the age of ICE raids does somewhat make his point, he means Europe, too. So is the Chinese regime’s most famous critic now toeing the party line? “My position with China started before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in this black hole with my father,” he says, pointing to a picture on his iPhone of a desolate location in north-west China.\n\nHe’s not angry exactly, but the suggestion that he’s softened on the Chinese government has touched a nerve. “I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. So that’s my only relationship to China,” he says. “I’m not nostalgic. I’m not patriotic.” What about the claim that the west embraces censorship? Is that his experience in the UK? “I cannot get into details,” he says cryptically. “But I feel the same kind of surveillance, same kind of censorship in the west.”\n\nPressed for an example, he tells me a story about the Royal Academy in London, an institution that gave him a landmark exhibition in 2015 and made him an honorary member in 2011 following his detainment in China. In November 2023, an exhibition of new works to be shown at the Lisson Gallery was pulled after he posted a tweet that began: “The sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world.” The tweet was deleted, with the artist telling journalists his show had “effectively [been] cancelled”.\n\nIn the aftermath, a vote was then held at the RA to determine whether his membership should be revoked because of accusations that the post was antisemitic. “I don’t have the intention of an antisemite. My best friends, they’re all Jewish people,” says Ai. “I tweeted millions of tweets on Twitter, but [how is it that] this tweet can cause such trouble? Then they said the procedure is to let the Academicians vote.”\n\nHis peers supported him and he won the vote. Ai was then asked to write an article about freedom of speech for the RA’s magazine, which he did, arguing: “Speaking the truth and insisting on one’s own perspective is dangerous and may come at a heavy price. Books may go unpublished, exhibitions may be closed, concerts cancelled.”\n\nAfter he sent it, there was silence. Then he says the RA claimed they didn’t have room to run the piece. For him, this is the censorship in the west, which he argues in On Censorship can be “more covert, more deceptive and more corrosive” than in authoritarian regimes. “I have several cases like this,” Ai adds. “Happens in Britain and in Germany.”\n\nThe RA disputes this account, claiming the decision to drop the piece was made before Ai submitted it. A spokesperson added: “Plurality of voices, tolerance and free thinking are at the core of what we stand for and seek to protect.”\n\nI wonder how Ai feels about the world in 2026. His new book paints it as a place without refuge for those who value self-expression and freedom of speech. “I think today we are living in a complicated world, where life is more like a shattered mirror,” he says. “It reflects the reality, but the reality can be a broken reality.”\n\nDid his trip to China restore his faith in humanity? There’s a pause. “If we were in the time of the Tang dynasty, someone like me would go back and write beautiful poetry,” he says, smiling. “But not today. I just take a few selfies.”",

    "fullText": "Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender’s early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase\n\nMillions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDocuments published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.\n\nThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.\n\nEpstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.\n\nDocuments published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.\n\nIn communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.\n\nOn Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.\n\nIn communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.\n\nCharlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.\n\n“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.\n\nAs to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.\n\nCryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.\n\n“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.",

    "description": "Mercor found AI agents failed at most consulting tasks, but its CEO says the models are improving so rapidly consultants should be worried.",
    "fullText": "New research suggests an AI agent can't fully replace a human consultant — at least for now.\n\nMercor, the AI training giant, tested how well leading AI models, acting as agents, performed real-world consulting, banking, and legal tasks.\n\nThe models failed most of the time, but Mercor's CEO, Brendan Foody, told Business Insider that the results tell only part of the story.\n\nThe consulting tasks in Mercor's APEX-Agents benchmark were designed to simulate real management consulting work, based on expert surveys and input from consultants at McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte, Accenture, and EY.\n\nAcross all task categories, the AI agents successfully completed the tasks less than 25% of the time on the first try. Given eight attempts, the agents could only complete 40% of the tasks. For the management consulting tasks, OpenAI's GPT 5.2 initially performed the best, completing nearly 23% of the tasks on its first attempt. Anthropic's Opus 4.6, released this week, performed even better at nearly 33%.\n\nWhile many of the tasks were not completed, Foody said the success rate for GPT 3 was only 3%, compared to 23% for GPT 5.2. Anthropic's model went from 13% to 33% on consulting tasks in a matter of months. Foody said he expects the success rate of the models to be closer to 50% by the end of the year.\n\n\"These are some of the hardest tasks in the economy that people pay millions of dollars to consulting firms to do, and the models are finally being able to do them with an incredible rate of progress,\" Foody said.\n\nAI has already disrupted the consulting industry, changing the way firms hire and make money, but the likelihood of agents displacing consultants grows as the models continue to improve.\n\nMcKinsey chief Bob Sternfels recently said the prestigious management consulting firm had 60,000 employees, 25,000 of which were AI agents.\n\nSternfels recently said it's the first time in McKinsey's history that the company is able to grow without growing its head count.\n\nThe frontier models Mercor tested included those from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, among others.\n\nOne example consulting task instructed the AI agent to \"analyze category consumption patterns and market penetration using the Category Penetration Score methodology for PureLife's portfolio strategy,\" asking for several specific outputs in response. The AI agents failed to produce an accurate response.\n\n\"No model is ready to replace a professional end-to-end,\" the findings concluded.\n\nMercor found the AI agents were great at research and pretty good at data analysis, Foody said.\n\nWhere they consistently got tripped up was on longer-horizon tasks — the longer it would take a human to complete a task, or the more steps it took, was the biggest indicator that the model might have a hard time.\n\nUnlike a human, Foody said, the models struggle to understand where in a specific file system they should look for the right information, so they often end up looking at the wrong files. They struggle with the planning side of figuring out how to work with multiple tools and cross-referencing files at the same time.\n\nFor tasks that can be done in an hour or less or that only require the use of a single tool, the models perform relatively well.\n\nFoody said the agents are almost like interns, where they might have a 50% pass rate, and the partner is still noticing a lot of issues in the work.\n\nFrank Jones, a former KPMG consultant who now works as an expert contractor for Mercor, said in his experience training AI, he's found the models can get close at certain tasks, but that some human refinement is often needed.\n\nHe also said the models need very specific prompts because they don't always understand common expectations or phrases in consulting, like \"client-ready.\"\n\n\"Most consultants, they know what that means. But for AI, I think there's a lot of nuance in that,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Foody, continuing to improve the models doesn't require a breakthrough — it requires more and better training, which the frontier labs are already investing heavily in.\n\n\"That's why we have so much revenue,\" he said, adding, \"We're in the business of replacing human judgment.\"\n\nMercor, whose clients have included OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, secured a funding deal in the fall that valued the company at $10 billion. Mercor employs more than 30,000 contractors around the world who help train AI models through tasks like rewriting chatbot responses. Foody previously said the company grew its revenue in 2025 by 4,658%.\n\nFoody said he believes consulting, and especially lower-level roles, are among the jobs he's confident will be displaced by AI. He said the next version of the AI agents benchmark will expand to evaluate the whole value chain of a professional services firm: \"Instead of evaling the analyst, we're evaling McKinsey itself.\"\n\nRight now, he says Mercor's AI agent benchmark tells an appealing story for McKinsey, because the company could say it shows they can use AI to add value but not replace humans.\n\n\"The next version of APEX tells a very scary story for McKinsey,\" he said, adding, \"In the coming two years, we're going to have chatbots that are as good as the best consulting firm.\"",

    "fullText": "Authors, a newsreader, a lawyer and an esteemed colleague: they’re all great – but I’m not married to any of them. Can we really depend on this technology?\n\nRecently, the Rowsons accidentally invented a new game that anyone can play at home. I have yet to come up with a world-beating name for it, so for now let’s just call it “How bloody stupid is AI?” The playing of the game will change from player to player, depending on their circumstances – but essentially the rules remain the same. Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.\n\nIn my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.\n\nIt’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny. As a satirist, I have always been a fool for anything that points up the even greater folly of our leaders, the tools of their techbro masters or the true capabilities of our new robot overlords. Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”\n\nImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overview was “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically is not my wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:\n\nTextile designer Fiona Scott-Wilson.\n\nActor Fiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.\n\nJulia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this is the fantasy author, the illustrator, the late powerlifter or another Julia Mills altogether).\n\nWriter and journalist Emily Rees.\n\nLawyer and academic Siva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.\n\nWriter and journalist Carrie McLaren.\n\nChannel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman.\n\nCNN correspondent Clarissa Ward.\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Rachel Johnson.\n\nThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.\n\nThen it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does he exist?\n\nThere was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. Playwright Lee Hall got a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.\n\nAs for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).\n\nAnother search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalist Ann Widdecombe (his ex-wife), Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author, Polly Toynbee is a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”\n\nFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”\n\nI suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.\n\nWhile my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imagine that family Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.\n\nWe should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?\n\nI wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”\n\nMartin Rowson is a cartoonist and author",
