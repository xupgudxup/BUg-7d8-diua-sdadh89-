    "fullText": "More than a year after his last Major League game, former Boston Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly is calling it a career.\n\nKelly essentially announced his retirement on the “Baseball Isn’t Boring” podcast, saying he’s no longer pitching. True to form, he refused to explicitly say he’s retiring, taking exception to the phrase.\n\n“Retiring is, like, something my grandmother did,” Kelly said. “It’s so disrespectful. I’m sorry all you people out there that work a real job. You guys deserve to retire. Athletes don’t. We just stop (expletive) playing…No more retirement (expletive).”\n\nKelly last pitched in 2024 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning his third World Series ring. After going unsigned in 2025, the 37-year-old right-hander is hanging it up.\n\nHis eventful MLB career spanned 13 seasons from 2012 to 2024. He pitched for four teams and won three championships along the way, primarily as a reliever.\n\nAfter beginning his career with the St. Louis Cardinals, Kelly spent four and a half seasons with the Red Sox from 2014 to 2018. He initially struggled as a starter but had more success after moving to the bullpen, leading the 2018 World Series champs with 73 relief appearances.\n\nKelly flourished during that playoff run, allowing just one earned run with 13 strikeouts over 11 1/3 postseason innings. He always saved his best for October, posting a 0.51 ERA in the playoffs with Boston.\n\nHe joined the Dodgers after pitching against them in the 2018 Fall Classic, helping them win titles in 2020 and 2024.\n\nTalkative, combative and armed with a good fastball, Kelly had a reputation for getting under opponents’ skin and occasionally starting brawls. He was a character who stood out from the crowd with his unique personality and presence, making him one of the more memorable relievers in recent Red Sox history.\n\nRed Sox Should Sign Veteran Southpaw After Short Stint With Cubs",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — The Miami Marlins acquired outfielder Esteury Ruiz from the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night in a trade for minor league right-hander Adriano Marrero.\n\nThe speedy Ruiz led the American League with 67 stolen bases for the Athletics in 2023. He is a career .241 hitter during four major league seasons with four teams, but excels as a baserunner and a defender.\n\nThe Dodgers acquired Ruiz from the A’s last April, and he was a little-used reserve when he was in the majors for the back-to-back World Series champions. Ruiz batted .190 in 19 games for Los Angeles, largely playing as a defensive replacement or a pinch runner.\n\nThe Marlins designated infielder Eric Wagaman for assignment to make room on their 40-man roster for Ruiz. The trade opened a spot on the Dodgers’ 40-man roster.\n\nAs a capable backup outfielder, Ruiz could be the Marlins’ replacement for Dane Myers, who was traded to Cincinnati last weekend.",

    "description": "Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is developing biological and chemical warheads for the country's long-range ballistic missiles, informed military sources told Iran International on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The satellites were placed into orbit from Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome in a multi-payload launch that Iranian officials described as the country’s seventh satellite mission carried out using Russian launch vehicles.\n\n“These satellites were designed and manufactured by Iranian scientists, and both government bodies and the private sector have been involved,” Iran’s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, said in remarks published ahead of the launch.\n\n“Two of the satellites belong to the government and one belongs to the private sector, and our knowledge-based companies and universities are active in this field.”\n\nJalali said Iran had continued to advance its space capabilities despite international pressure. “Despite all the threats and sanctions that exist, we have something to say in this field.”\n\nIran’s space agency chief, Hassan Salarieh, said the launch reflected what he described as Iran’s standing among a small group of countries with end-to-end space capabilities.\n\n“Iran is among 10 or 11 countries in the world that simultaneously possess the capability to design and build satellites, launch vehicles and the infrastructure for launching, receiving data and processing images,” he said.\n\nSalarieh said Iran aimed to expand both the number and precision of its satellites. “What is necessary for us is increasing the number of satellites, improving their accuracy and quality, and developing different classes of satellites,” he said.\n\nIranian media identified the satellites as Paya, also known as Tolou-3, Zafar-2, and a prototype satellite called Kowsar-1.5. The spacecraft were launched alongside a large cluster of mainly Russian satellites into a sun-synchronous low Earth orbit.\n\nPaya (Tolou-3), built by the Iranian Space Agency, is Iran’s heaviest Earth-observation satellite to date, weighing about 150 kilograms.\n\nIranian officials say it is capable of producing black-and-white images with a resolution of about five meters and color images with a resolution of around 10 meters, and is intended for applications including agriculture, water management, environmental monitoring and disaster assessment.\n\nZafar-2, developed by Iran University of Science and Technology, is also an Earth-observation satellite designed for mapping, environmental monitoring and tracking natural hazards.\n\nKowsar-1.5 combines imaging and internet-of-things capabilities and is aimed primarily at agricultural and farm-monitoring uses, Iranian officials say.\n\nJalali described Iran’s space cooperation with Russia as extensive and said Moscow’s experience had played a key role.\n\n“Russia is advanced in the space field, including satellites, launch vehicles and satellite launches, and we have been able to transfer part of the technology and work together,” he said.\n\nHe also described the Soyuz rocket as highly reliable. “Before Russia’s relations with the West deteriorated, many Western satellites were launched using Soyuz,” Jalali said.\n\nThe launch also carried Russian Earth-observation satellites, internet-of-things platforms and university-built spacecraft, according to launch data, as well as satellites from partner countries including Belarus, Kuwait and Montenegro.\n\nIran says its space program is civilian and focused on scientific and economic goals, but Western governments argue that satellite launch technology overlaps with systems used to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n“In my view, we are in an all-out war with the United States, Israel, and Europe; they do not want our country to stand on its own feet,” Masoud Pezeshkian said in an interview with the Supreme Leader’s official website.\n\nHe said the current war is worse than the Iraq war in the 1980s. “If one understands it properly, this war is far more complex and more difficult than that war.”\n\n“In the war with Iraq, the situation was clear; they fired missiles, and it was clear where we would strike back. But here, they are now besieging us in every respect, putting us under pressure and in tight corners, creating problems—economically, culturally, politically, and in terms of security.”\n\nPezeshkian made the comments on the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip to the United States, where he plans to brief President Donald Trump on options for potential future strikes against Iran, amid concerns that Tehran is rebuilding ballistic missile production facilities and repairing air defenses damaged during the June conflict, according to NBC News.\n\nIsrael has told the United States that the recent Iranian missile drills may conceal preparations for a potential strike, Axios reported last Sunday, one day after Iran International reported unusual Iranian air activity spotted by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nIsraeli Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir raised the issue directly with Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command, warning that recent missile movements could serve as a cover for a surprise operation against the Jewish state.\n\nPezeshkian said on Saturday that Iran is \"stronger than during the 12‑day war\" with Israel in terms of equipment and manpower. \"If the enemy chooses confrontation, they will naturally face a more decisive response.\"\n\nIn June, Israel carried out airstrikes and covert operations against Iranian military and nuclear sites, killing more than 1,000 people including senior officials and nuclear scientists.\n\nIran retaliated by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, killing at least 33 people, among them an off-duty soldier.\n\nThe United States helped Israel intercept Iranian attacks and later joined the Israeli campaign, bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22.\n\n“In a joint operation by the IDF and the Shin Bet, Hussein Mahmoud Marshad al-Jawhari, a key operative in the Operations Unit of the Iranian Quds Force, was eliminated,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement posted on X.\n\n\"(al-Jawhari) operated under the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was involved in terror activities directed by Iran against the State of Israel and security forces,\" the statement added.\n\nThe IDF said he was involved in “advancing terrorist attack plans against the State of Israel in the Syria–Lebanon arena.”\n\nIt added that al-Jawhari was a key operative in Quds Force’s Unit 840, which the IDF described as “the unit that directs and is responsible for Iranian terrorist activity against the State of Israel.”\n\nThe Quds Force, the external arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, conducts overseas operations to support allied groups and advance Tehran’s strategic interests.\n\nLebanon’s state news agency had earlier reported that two people were killed when an Israeli drone struck a vehicle near the Syrian border.\n\nA report by Israel Hayom, citing Israeli officials, said al-Jawhari was killed alongside another operative, identified as Majed Qansoua.\n\nA US-backed ceasefire agreed last November halted more than a year of fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah and called for the group to disarm.\n\nBoth Israel and Hezbollah have since accused each other of violating the ceasefire.\n\nIsrael has been carrying out strikes in Lebanon on an almost daily basis, which it says are aimed at preventing Hezbollah from rebuilding.\n\nIran, a longtime sponsor of Hezbollah, has rejected international and domestic calls for the group to disarm, arguing that continued Israeli actions justify its armed presence.\n\nOn Wednesday, former Afghan police general Ikramuddin Sari was shot dead by masked assailants near his home in Tehran, according to sources close to him.\n\nHe was attacked alongside an associate near their residence in southern Tehran and died while being transferred to hospital, the sources told Afghanistan International.\n\nSari, a former police commander in Baghlan and Takhar provinces, fled to Iran after the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Reports in recent months had suggested Iranian police had detained and questioned him, though no official explanation was given.\n\nTaliban's 'extraterritorial assassinations'\n\nThe killing follows the September shooting of Maroof Ghulami, a political and military figure close to veteran anti-Taliban leader Ismail Khan. He was killed by gunfire in the religious city of Mashhad.\n\nPeople close to both men have blamed the Taliban for their deaths, according to Afghanistan International.\n\nThe attacks, an Afghan military source said, signal the start of what he described as Taliban “extraterritorial assassinations,” adding that the group has repeatedly threatened to target opponents abroad.\n\nSenior Taliban official Mohammad Nabi Omari has previously said the group could kill opponents outside Afghanistan “with as little as 500 Pakistani rupees,” while Saeed Khosti, a former spokesperson for the de facto Taliban Ministry of Interior, warned two years ago that hundreds of volunteers were ready to target critics overseas.\n\nIranian authorities have remained publicly silent on Sari’s killing. Tehran has also provided no detailed update on the investigation into Ghulami’s death.\n\nIranian police said in September they arrested three suspects in that case but later released two, offering no clarity on affiliations.\n\nA source familiar with the investigation told Afghanistan International that the remaining suspect was a Taliban operative, a comment not confirmed by Iranian authorities.\n\nSari, originally from Kapisa province, was regarded as a professional officer who served as police commander in Nuristan, Baghlan and Takhar, and as an adviser to Afghanistan’s interior ministry.\n\nIn Iran, he acted as an informal representative for former Afghan soldiers, advocating for their rights, opposing deportations and openly criticizing the Taliban.\n\nThe National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF), led by Ahmad Massoud, called on Iran to conduct a “transparent, serious and independent” investigation, describing Sari’s killing as a “targeted terrorist act.”\n\nThe Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan, led by Salahuddin Rabbani, also condemned the killing and urged Iranian authorities to identify those responsible.\n\nIran, which has handed Afghanistan’s embassy in Tehran and the consulate in Mashhad to the Taliban, has faced growing criticism for failing to protect Afghan dissidents on its soil even as it seeks closer ties with the Taliban-led administration.\n\n“Israel does not have the capacity for an intense war of attrition or for confronting a major power like Iran, and it is clear that another war would not end in 12 days as the previous one did,” Javan wrote in an analysis on Wednesday.\n\nThe 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June 2025 was a brief but intense conflict. It began with extensive Israeli airstrikes on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.\n\nThe United States became militarily involved mid‑conflict. On June 22, US Air Force and Navy forces carried out coordinated strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities – Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan – in an operation codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer, using B‑2 bombers and submarine‑launched missiles, marking the first US offensive against Iranian territory in decades. Iranian forces fired missiles at US assets in Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, after those strikes.\n\nThe conflict ended with a US and Qatari-mediated ceasefire, but it caused significant casualties, infrastructure damage.\n\nIsraeli rhetoric, the paper said, has shifted from threats of decisive victory to language of caution and warnings about the costs of renewed conflict.\n\nAir strikes, according to Javan, failed to halt what it called Iran’s “distributed and self-sufficient” military production. The paper also argued that the previous fighting severely strained Israel’s multilayer missile defense systems.\n\n“Israeli officials are now openly speaking of the ‘real threat’ posed by Iran’s missiles and warning that without preventive action Iran could reach annual production of thousands of missiles,” the paper said.\n\nFocus shifts from battlefield to society\n\nJavan framed the change in tone as evidence that the military option has lost credibility, writing that the inability to control the consequences of war has weakened Israel’s long-standing doctrine of absolute military superiority.\n\n“War in the contemporary world is not merely a military confrontation, but a test of social capacity, political cohesion and national resilience,” the paper wrote, arguing that internal divisions, political strains and reliance on external support limit Israel’s ability to endure a prolonged conflict.\n\nThe article concluded that future confrontation will be shaped as much by narratives and domestic resilience as by missiles and air defenses.",

    "fullText": "Imagine the world as you know it. Now, add 10 million people who care about birds. Did your world just get a little brighter?\n\nTen million. It’s an astronomical number. And yet that is exactly what Merlin, the free bird ID app developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has accomplished since launching in 2014. Ten million active users the world over, from experts in the field to neophytes who let the app run in the background during their morning routine—and they’re turning enthusiasm and newfound joy into participatory science that helps protect birds and biodiversity.\n\nFrom Serbia: “It is my honor and pleasure that 165 of my photos were used to train Merlin to identify birds.”\n\nFrom Costa Rica: “Great for beginners. It motivates you to keep expanding your life list.”\n\nFrom India: “The app is so user-friendly…you can know about a lot of birds around you based on the pictures and their calls.”\n\nFrom the U.S.: “My four-year-old daughter and I were using Merlin to identify about 12 birds in our backyard. My daughter said to me, Daddy, your phone is magical. I’ve been programming for over 40 years. Merlin amazes me too.”\n\nSo how is it that millions of people now hold this magic in their pockets? To satisfy that question, we have to go back nearly two decades when the Lab’s idea for a bird ID app first hatched.\n\nThe year was 2008 and the Cornell Lab wanted to expand the capability of its online guide, All About Birds. According to Miyoko Chu, senior director of Science Communications at the Lab, users wanted more than the site could provide. “When we looked at analytics, we saw a lot of people typing in phrases like little brown bird. It became clear they were trying to use our website as a bird ID tool.”\n\nWhen we looked at analytics, we saw a lot of people typing in phrases like little brown bird. It became clear they were trying to use our website as a bird ID tool.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Lab didn’t have capacity to reimagine All About Birds. These were the early days of broad-based artificial intelligence, so the team brainstormed a game of 20 questions that would utilize machine learning to produce a positive bird ID and proposed it to the National Science Foundation. “The heart of the proposal,” says Miyoko, “was the power of a bird’s name. If you see something and you don’t know its name, it’s really hard to learn more. But as soon as you can call it a Yellow Warbler, you’ve got all the information in the world at your fingertips.”\n\nAfter winning the NSF grant, the team needed to figure out how to teach the machine-learning model how to identify birds. Jessie Barry, who now leads the Merlin program through the Lab’s Macaulay Library, cites AI as the reason the project was funded, but concedes that the initial machine-learning task didn’t work all that well. “We didn’t have enough data,” says Jessie. Meanwhile, the team discovered a faster solution: the power of eBird data.\n\nIn the early 2010s, eBird, the Lab’s worldwide bird observation platform, was taking off. Tens of thousands of birdwatchers had already contributed millions of sightings, and their observations added two crucial factors: time of year and location. This meant that instead of trying to guess among, say, 800 species, eBird could help narrow it down to the few dozen species a person would most likely see. With just three more questions, it presented an answer. With time and location in hand, the team was able to compress the initial 20 questions into a simple five-question rubric to identify birds.\n\nHalfway through development, the team met another “grant”—Grant Van Horn, an undergrad at UCSD knocking on doors and looking for professors to work with. He had joined Caltech’s Visipedia project aimed at training computers to recognize objects in photos, using machine learning. To source the photos, they looked to Flickr, the world’s largest photo-sharing site at the time. According to Grant, “Flickr’s top photos of the day were some landscapes, a few portraits of people, and, inevitably, birds.”\n\nThe question quickly became: Can we train a computer to recognize all these bird photos?\n\n“The Visipedia team had scraped the web to build this dataset,” says Jessie, “but many of the birds were misidentified.” In a spirit of sharing and collaboration, the teams partnered to build a robust and accurate archive of images. As Jessie remembers it, “We approached a bunch of friends to get their photos off Flickr as a way to build the dataset.” By 2010, they’d collected enough images to have a basic working model. According to Jessie, “We were thinking, okay, 25% of the time, maybe this pre-Merlin system could identify a bird accurately.”\n\nAnother breakthrough came when the team realized they could build out Macaulay’s image archive by enabling eBirders to upload photos directly into the Macaulay Library as a part of their checklists. It has become a virtuous cycle; as birders share more images, the results get more accurate. Today, Macaulay’s archive is an asset that simply can’t be replicated anywhere else. On average, eBird users contribute an image every two seconds, and the accuracy of Merlin’s visual ID hovers around 98%.\n\n“By the way,” Miyoko adds, “this was almost not funded. Some of the NSF reviewers were quite skeptical, asking, How is this teaching anyone? It’s basically doing all the work for people, you’re just giving them the answer.”\n\nWhat impact would this new app have on the world of birding? Or, for that matter, on how people learn?\n\nWhere did the name Merlin come from? Miyoko remembers flipping through names of birds and coming to rest on the Merlin, a falcon that is both small and fierce. Merlin populations declined in the 20th century due to DDT and other pesticides, but bounced back once those were banned. Of course, Merlin also refers to the mythical sorcerer in King Arthur’s court. “We’d always talked about it being this magical experience where you would be so surprised that this name could pop up and give you the answer you were looking for,” says Miyoko. The team rallied around the name and began making final preparations for the app’s release.\n\nOn average, eBird users contribute an image every two seconds, and the accuracy of Merlin’s visual ID hovers around 98%.\n\nWith the NSF grant nearing its end, a fork in the road came when it was time to decide what to charge for Merlin. Alex Chang, who was leading the team’s web communications, says, “At that time, companies were selling their apps for $1, and it was moving toward $2.” But the Lab wanted to build a community, not just revenue. So Alex, who was also pursuing an MBA at Cornell at the time, wrote a business case showing that it was more valuable to offer Merlin for free in exchange for an email address.\n\nThat decision led to far more downloads, including in countries where any fee might be a significant barrier. It also gave the Lab a channel to connect with its users. Today, Merlin is at the heart of rapid growth in the number of participants and supporters of Lab programs, which has helped transform the scale of the Lab’s global conservation work. Merlin has become the Lab’s front door.\n\nThe app launched in 2014 with the ability to ID 285 species—just the most common backyard birds in North America—using the five-question rubric Jessie’s team developed . In 2015, Drew Weber joined the team to broaden Merlin’s geographic footprint. Drew is now the project manager on the Merlin team, and has helped expand Merlin to include 11,000 species, nearly every known bird in the world. When he comes through customs after an international birding trip, the agents get excited when he tells them what he does for a living. “We love Merlin,” they say.\n\n“Merlin is a wide funnel that brings people into the world of birds,” Drew says. “Some of those folks are going to download eBird and start collecting data. Some of them are going to start caring about birds and give money to protect their habitats. But for many others, Merlin simply lets them start to recognize and enjoy the birds around them in a way that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.”\n\nSusan Fox Rogers, author of Learning the Birds, agrees. “Merlin changed everything. This is something to celebrate in every possible way.” Susan started birding at age 49. “When I first went out, I couldn’t do it by myself. I needed the John Burroughs club, I needed to get to a baseline. It took two or three years, maybe 20 trips.” It used to be that to become an expert, you had to learn from another expert. But for millions of learners of all ages, Merlin has become their mentor.\n\nBut there was another quest on the horizon—one for the “holy grail,” as the Lab’s former executive director John W. Fitzpatrick puts it. For decades, the Lab had been trying to crack tech’s ability to identify birds by sound. Could Merlin become the “Shazam for birds”?\n\nIn many ways, it’s an unfair comparison: Shazam is an app trained to recognize the one true signature of a pop song in the swirl of a crowded room. Birds are different. They have more than one call. Songs differ slightly each time they’re sung. And even members of the same species can develop distinct dialects region to region. Add to that the sound of wind. Traffic. Your shoes crunching the forest floor. Or what about sound dampeners, like buildings and trees? Not to mention the songs of other birds.\n\nIf we get to the point where one in 20 people in the U.S. is engaged with birds when a local land trust reaches out, they’re going to be more ready to hear those messages.\n\nAs Jessie Barry remembers it, “When the pandemic hit in 2020, we saw [the number of] Merlin users go through the roof. So many people were watching birds, sometimes for the first time. It was a dream come true: The world is paying attention to birds. What can we do with this opportunity?”\n\nWhile attending an audio workshop in New York City with Jessie, Grant Van Horn was inspired by presentations that included spectrograms. “What struck me,” says Grant, “was that we were looking at photos of audio. I thought, Wait, they just take their audio and make a picture? I’m a computer vision researcher, I can absolutely work with that!”\n\nThe timing was right: eBird had just begun accepting audio uploads in 2015. That meant Grant had five years’ worth of recordings to experiment with. “Someone told me Merlin’s photo ID couldn’t distinguish between the Alder and the Willow Flycatchers. I wasn’t really a birder before all this, so I asked my colleagues how you’d tell them apart in real life and they told me they’d listen to the vocalizations.”\n\nSo like the presenters at the audio conference, Grant made pictures. Specifically, he took 30 audio clips apiece for both flycatcher species and rendered spectrograms. Just as he’d trained Merlin’s algorithms to recognize images of birds, Grant now used the same technology to recognize images of their sounds. “The computer was perfect. It’s like, 100% accuracy.”\n\nTo make Sound ID feel miraculous, Merlin needs to bank at least 100 clean recordings of every call for each species. To achieve this, around 350 experts annotate thousands upon thousands of spectrograms made from recordings submitted by people from all over the world. These annotators painstakingly draw and label boxes around individual calls in the spectrograms, helping to train and improve Merlin.\n\nJessie was anxious to get this capability into the hands of people while birds still held their attention, so Sound ID was launched in June 2021. According to Drew Weber, “Each spring, we see a massive uptake. That year we had a double bump in downloads: May for migration and June for Sound ID.”\n\n“When we first started,” says Alex Chang, “we got to number four in the app store’s reference category, and we thought, There’s no way we can beat the Bible, right? Like, how do you beat the Bible? But I guess Sound ID was the answer to that, because we got to number one.”\n\n“Sound ID put Merlin on the map,” says Drew. “It’s in the mainstream conversation now. Sarah Jessica Parker posted about it on Instagram. Sam Darnold, the Seattle Seahawks quarterback, has talked about it at press conferences. Sound ID was a game changer.”\n\nImagine the world as you know it. Now, add 100 million people who care about birds. Add one billion. These numbers may seem improbable, but Merlin’s growth continues to accelerate. This past spring, American usage of Merlin was up 40% over last year. Europe was up 70% over the same period, and there’s double-digit growth in Africa and Asia as well.\n\n“We have a long runway on these projects,” says Jessie Barry. “We’re building out Sound ID in South America, in Africa, really building a global team. We try to look a few years down the road for new opportunities, but right now we’re seeing big returns on the Lab’s mission—connecting people to birds is squarely what Merlin is able to do.”\n\nHow has this marriage of science and tech captivated so many people? “I think you can go all the way back to Arthur Allen and Peter Paul Kellogg,” Jessie continues. “Arthur Allen founded the Lab. Peter Paul Kellogg was an electrical engineer. Together they figured out how to record the first bird sounds in North America in 1929. So in some way, that combination of engineering and ornithology that built Merlin goes back to the Lab’s origin story.”\n\nIn Silent Spring, Rachel Carson’s landmark book about the environmental destruction caused by DDT and other pesticides, she pointed to the “silencing of birds.” What if spring comes and no birds sing? Of course, this formulation only works if people are listening.\n\nWith Merlin, more than 10 million people are tuning into the world around them. “I think we’re just starting to feel the scale of a community,” says Jessie. “If we get to the point where one in 20 people in the U.S. is engaged with birds when, say, a local land trust reaches out, they’re going to be more ready to hear those messages.”\n\nAlready there are signs that the next generation of birders is more conservation-minded. Less focused on personal lists, today’s birders see birds as neighbors. They’re asking questions about what birds need to thrive and what they can do to help. Susan Fox Rogers puts it this way: “If more people are using Merlin, then more people are thinking about birds. You can’t protect something unless you know it. You can’t love something unless you know it.”\n\nTop banner photo credits: Tiktok photos courtesy @theylovefrioo, @nonbinarying, @badgerlandbirding.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays could be setting themselves up for a difficult roster decision in the outfield, especially if they decide to make a serious push for Kyle Tucker.\n\nOn paper, the fit makes sense. Tucker would immediately upgrade the lineup and give Toronto another middle-of-the-order bat. However, it complicates things for others.\n\nThe Blue Jays already have several players who seem to be penciled in, but could that change?\n\nGeorge Springer is taking up the majority of the at-bats at designated hitter, and Daulton Varsho isn’t moving out of the lineup. That leaves the corner outfield spots, where things could get crowded quickly. If Tucker is added, he’s playing every day – we already know that – which could hurt someone.\n\nAnthony Santander is probably the player who would be left behind. He’s been great in his career, but roster construction matters, and he struggled, while dealing with injuries, last season.\n\nThat’s a point Brandon Glick of FanSided noted when discussing how Tucker would impact Toronto’s roster.\n\n“This conversation will really become timely if the Blue Jays sign Kyle Tucker, who would immediately displace [Anthony] Santander in right field,” Glick wrote. “With George Springer taking up all of the at-bats at DH and Daulton Varsho locked into the starting spot in center field, Tucker’s presence would effectively mean that there’s one open spot for all of the aforementioned players.”\n\nIf the Blue Jays are willing to live with moving Santander, it would signal just how aggressive they’re trying to be.\n\nSantander still has four years remaining on his deal. He’s only making $11.8 million in 2026 and $11.4 million in 2027. He then has a player option in 2028 worth $9.4 million.\n\nI’d assume a team would want him, but who knows?\n\nInsider reveals Blue Jays plan for Bo Bichette if he re-signs in Toronto\n\nBlue Jays’ Chris Bassitt could still land back in Toronto, according to MLB insider\n\nBlue Jays, Red Sox among teams that have called Diamondbacks for Ketel Marte\n\nRed Sox reportedly in the mix for Blue Jays’ Bo Bichette, which might be telling about Alex Bregman’s future\n\nBlue Jays are favorites for Kyle Tucker, but Yankees, Mets, and Dodgers reportedly in the mix\n\nBlue Jays linked to Alex Bregman to replace Bo Bichette, despite Red Sox being favorites to sign star",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and missile units to conduct joint live-fire drills around the island of Taiwan, which Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nTaiwan’s aviation authority said more than 100,000 international air travelers would be affected by flight cancellations or diversions.\n\nThe drills came after Beijing expressed anger at what could be the largest-ever U.S. arms sale to the self-ruled territory, and at a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China takes action against Taiwan. China says Taiwan must come under its rule.\n\nChina's military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday, but Beijing's foreign ministry accused Taiwan's ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry said rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert. “The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” it said.\n\nBeijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of the exercises.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.\n\nShi said activities would focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one goal was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\n“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.\n\nChina and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland’s government claims it as sovereign territory.\n\nDrills will continue on Tuesday\n\nChina's command on Monday deployed destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles, alongside long-range rockets, to the north and southwest of the Taiwan Strait. It carried out live-fire exercises against targets in the waters. Among other training, drills to test the capabilities of sea-air coordination and precise target hunting were conducted in the waters and airspace to the east of the strait.\n\nHsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence of the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, said that as of 3 p.m. Monday, 89 aircraft and drones were operating around the strait, with 67 of them entering the “response zone\" — airspace under the force's monitoring and response. The ministry detected 14 navy ships around the strait and four other warships in the Western Pacific, in addition to 14 coast guard vessels.\n\n“Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... does not only mean military pressure on us. It may bring more complex impact and challenges to the international community and neighboring countries,” Hsieh told reporters.\n\nMilitary drills are set to continue Tuesday. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration said Chinese authorities had issued a notice saying seven temporary dangerous zones would be set up around the strait to carry out rocket-firing exercises from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., barring aircraft from entering them.\n\nThe Taiwanese aviation authority said more than 850 international flights were initially scheduled during that period and the drills would affect over 100,000 travelers. Over 80 domestic flights, involving around 6,000 passengers, were also canceled, it added.\n\nCommercial airlines began to announce dozens of cancellations and delays for domestic routes across Taiwan, particularly ones along islands near China.\n\nThe Chinese command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,\" adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.\n\nLast week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. It still requires approval by the U.S. Congress.\n\nUnder U.S. federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The U.S. and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter’s administration recognized and established relations with Beijing.\n\nAsked about the drills, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has attempted \"to seek independence by soliciting U.S. support and even risk turning Taiwan into a powder keg and ammunition depot.”\n\n“External forces’ attempts to use Taiwan to contain China and to arm Taiwan will only embolden the Taiwan independence forces and push the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war,” he said.\n\nThere was no immediate U.S. statement on the drills.\n\nKaren Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president's office, said the drills were undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.\n\n“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry released a video that featured its weapons and forces in a show of resilience. Multiple French Mirage-2000 aircraft conducted landings at an air force base.\n\nIn October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.\n\nThe military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,\" during a trip to Shanghai.",

    "description": "Teresa Johnson shares how a leap of faith on a pottery studio grew into Color Me Mine, now earning $55 million and transforming her family's future.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Teresa Johnson, CEO of Color Me Mine. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2005, I was working in a corporate HR role, thinking I was the definition of success. Then, the president of the company walked into my office and explained that the business wasn't doing well. We should start our own business, he said.\n\nAt the time, I didn't know anyone who ran their own business, but I had always been drawn to entrepreneurship. Still, I was a single mom with a mortgage to pay, so I needed to be practical.\n\nThat's when I received an email from a paint-your-own pottery studio that my daughter and I occasionally visited. The owner said she was selling. I thought, \"There's my sign.\" I purchased the business by charging $25,000 to my credit card.\n\nRunning the pottery business was still intense. The studio was open seven days a week, and my daughter Scout was there most of them, setting out brushes and cleaning tables. Scout was only in second grade, but she and I learned how to be entrepreneurs together over the years.\n\nDecember is our busy season, and one night we were at the studios late, tying ribbons on ceramic ornaments. I asked Scout what her friend was doing that night, and she said, \"studying for finals.\" Finals were the next day, and I had my teenager working. That wasn't one of my proudest parenting moments.\n\nStill, Scout loved the business as much as I did. When she was a sophomore, she called and asked me to meet her for lunch. When I got there, Scout was with a real estate agent. We had already opened three locations, and Scout wanted to be my partner on a fourth. I said, \"You don't even have a driver's license,\" and she said, \"You don't need a driver's license to open a business.\"\n\nScout really ran that location — she attended all the town meetings and handled the hiring. Eventually, it helped her get a college scholarship for entrepreneurship. It absolutely changed her life, and I'm so proud of the businesswoman she's become.\n\nJust like Scout, I was learning a ton about entrepreneurship. In 2010, I opened a franchise of a company called Painting with a Twist. I wanted to learn about franchising from the inside, because I saw it as a good business opportunity.\n\nLast year, Color Me Mine franchises generated more than $55 million in sales worldwide. I'm still not comfortable talking about my own financial status, or even acknowledging it. It makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.\n\nI think that's because life was hard when I quit my corporate job to start the business. Because I didn't grow up with wealth, I didn't miss it, however. Scout and I were always fine, and she learned hard lessons about work ethic.\n\nEntrepreneurship has never been about the money for me. It's about altering the course for an entire family. I get so much fulfillment out of seeing our franchisees do that. Buying a business changed my life, and Scout's life, too. I'm grateful to be able to help other families do the same.",

    "description": "My mom and I have completed two routes from the Camino de Santiago together. Our international trips to Europe have helped us communicate and bond.",
    "fullText": "Summer vacation is typically associated with beaches, cruise ships, and road trips. For my mom, though, it's a chance to go on a long-distance hike.\n\nShe's walked the Camino de Santiago — a network of pilgrimage routes across France, Portugal, and Spain, some of which are over 500 miles long — nine times.\n\nIt's become an annual trip for her, made possible by summers off from teaching. At some point, I began calling her a \"Camino vet\" — she even got a scallop shell tattoo to commemorate the experience.\n\nFor years, I couldn't understand what could be so enjoyable about trudging more than 10 miles a day through blazing heat with a 20-pound backpack strapped around your waist.\n\nBut as my high school graduation approached, she asked if I'd like to join her on her next walk.\n\nI agreed for a couple of reasons: curiosity, for one (I wanted to see what all the fuss was about), and secondly, who turns down a trip to Spain, no matter the conditions?\n\nIn a journal entry from my first day of walking through the Pyrenees Mountains, I wrote, \"In one word, I would describe it as 'hell.'\"\n\nStill, we persevered, walking 30 consecutive days in the heat with reemerging blisters, guided by arrows and shells that pave the way, and sleeping in hostels with fellow travelers.\n\nBut despite the challenges, it was beautiful.\n\nAlong the way, I discovered the wonders of sangria and patatas bravas (Spanish fried potatoes). We passed through the narrow streets of Pamplona, Spain, where I promised myself I'd one day return for the Festival of San Fermin, the stage for the running of the bulls.\n\nMy mom and I spent some time talking during the walk, but more often than not, I'd go ahead, determined to reach the next town as quickly as possible.\n\nAs we reached the end of our walk, I remember feeling so struck with gratitude and a sense of relief — followed by the desire to return home to the little things, like a fresh pair of socks and a home-cooked meal.\n\nSure, our journey wasn't perfect, but four years later, as my college graduation approached, I asked my mom to walk another Camino with me.\n\nIn June 2023, we embarked on another path of the Camino, this time through the southwestern French countryside.\n\nWe were welcomed at our accommodations each afternoon by hosts who would later cook us dinner — beef bourguignon in the mountain town of Saugues and duck confit in the Gascony province.\n\nMy mom and I would begin each day walking alongside each other. We talked about her desire to go back to school and obtain a bachelor's degree (she's now working toward her master's).\n\nWe discussed the books we'd been reading — a hobby she introduced me to at a young age — and reflected on my upbringing, comparing how my older sister and I were raised, among many other things.\n\nThen, through some unspoken agreement, as morning drifted into afternoon, we'd part ways for the rest of the walk.\n\nAs we fell into this routine, I realized that we pace our days the same way. We both enjoy social interaction to an extent, but still desire considerable time to ourselves.\n\nThis mutual understanding made the walk comforting and poignant. Where my focus during the first Camino was on reaching the finish line, this one was more therapeutic.\n\nMy mom's tattoo was the subject of one of the many conversations we had while walking.\n\nI no longer had to ask why she got it — I understood. Instead, I admitted that I wanted one, too. This past summer, I got a shell tattoo on my right forearm.\n\nIt's a reminder that in my mom, I have someone I can speak openly to and trust. And for that, in large part, I have our trips and the Camino to thank for bringing us closer.",

    "title": "8 things to pack for a Disney vacation and 3 to leave behind, from a travel planner who's visited the parks over 40 times",
    "description": "As a frequent Disney World visitor and travel planner, there are things I always pack to survive park days, such as ponchos, plus some I never bring.",
    "fullText": "After going to Disney World over 40 times, I've gotten really good at visiting the parks — especially when it comes to optimizing the space in my suitcase.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels specializing in Disney destinations, so my clients often ask me about the most important items to pack for a trip to the parks.\n\nRead on for the essentials I always bring, as well as the things I think you can leave at home.\n\nIf you've spent any time in the Orlando area, you know it will likely rain during your Disney trip.\n\nDon't let that stop you from having fun — just throw on rain ponchos and hit the parks. It's often much cheaper to buy them before you leave rather than inside Disney World.\n\nYou can also wear ponchos if you don't want to get wet on rides like Splash Mountain and Kali River Rapids.\n\nI've tried out every kind of bag you can imagine when visiting the parks. Ultimately, my biggest advice is to bring something small that fits your main essentials.\n\nMy husband's favorite is a cross-body bag, and I love a small backpack, purse, or fanny pack.\n\nYou want something that's easy to take on and off quickly, compact enough to take on rides, and roomy enough that you're not cramming your phone and necessities in.\n\nWhen you head to the parks, you want to travel light, so I like having smaller versions of essentials to carry.\n\nI raid the travel section of my local store before every trip to make sure I have sunscreen, hand sanitizer, aloe-vera gel, sanitizing wipes, a mini first-aid kit, pain relievers, and tissues.\n\nIt's not a Disney trip without the quintessential Mickey or Minnie ears. At this point, I have plenty to choose from based on different seasons, holidays, and moods.\n\nI also pack some of my many Disney T-shirts — one for each day at the parks. We always get one special matching family shirt for each trip, as well.\n\nThis way, we can stay on theme without feeling tempted to spend money on more merchandise while in the parks.\n\nA lot of planning in the parks requires the use of the My Disney Experience app, which is crucial for tasks like checking maps or making dining reservations. Plus, we love snapping lots of photos.\n\nVisiting Disney involves a lot of walking — on many days in the parks, I log over 10 miles. Also, because of frequent rain and water rides, my shoes often get wet.\n\nSo, I bring comfortable, fast-drying shoes to ensure my experience isn't ruined by blisters or sore feet. My husband always wears his Keen sandals, and I switch between my Sanuks and Tevas.\n\nMy family has made it a tradition to send a letter or postcard to someone back home from inside the parks.\n\nYou can always bring souvenir postcards to the front desk of your resort. However, it's more fun to put it in one of the four mailboxes on Main Street USA at Magic Kingdom.\n\nYou can pay for almost everything at Disney World with Disney gift cards, including dining, merchandise, and resort charges.\n\nMany external retailers offer small discounts when you purchase these cards, so buying them ahead of time is a great way to save a little money on your vacation.\n\nTo curb excess spending, we give each of our kids a gift card at the beginning of the trip for souvenirs. Once they use up their card's balance, they're done spending.\n\nAside from Victoria and Albert's at the Grand Floridian Resort, none of the Disney dining locations really expect more than casual dress.\n\nI love this aspect of Disney World because it means there are wonderful dining options with upscale-feeling food that are still super family-friendly.\n\nMy husband and I usually throw one nicer casual outfit in our suitcase if we decide we want to get a little fancy. But, generally, our dress clothes get left in the closet at home.\n\nMy clients often ask me if they need to bring life jackets or towels for their children to enjoy the hotel pools. Fortunately, the answer is no.\n\nAll the Disney resorts provide these items, so you can save space in your suitcase and leave them at home.\n\nIt's nice to have a few quick snacks on hand in the hotel room or in your park bag, but don't waste space in your suitcase. You can have groceries delivered to your Disney resort.\n\nMost national delivery services are available, or Garden Grocer is a local option. These deliveries can be picked up in the lobby at no charge or sent straight to your room for a small fee.\n\nThis story was originally published in January 2022 and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Cybersecurity experts reveal what they do for high-profile clients targeted by hackers such as Scattered Spider\n\nThey call it “stopping the bleeding”: the vital window to prevent an entire database from being ransacked by criminals or a production line grinding to a halt.\n\nWhen a call comes into the cybersecurity firm S-RM, headquartered on Whitechapel High Street in east London, a hacked business or institution may have just minutes to protect themselves.\n\nS-RM, which helped a high-profile retail client recover from a Scattered Spider cyber-attack has become a quiet, often word-of-mouth, success.\n\nMany of the company’s senior workers are multilingual and have a minimal online footprint, which reveals scant but impressive CVs suggestive of corporate or government intelligence-based careers.\n\nS-RM now claims the UK’s largest cyber-incident response team. Its first-responder service is comprised of about 150 experts worldwide. It has clients who keep it on retainer, victims referred by insurers, and “walk-ins”: people who suddenly realise their business is under attack and call the first few results on their search engines.\n\nIn the case of the Scattered Spider victim, which the Guardian understands was not Marks & Spencer or the Co-op – two retailers that were attacked in 2025 – a 30-minute Teams call with a retailer became “a 24-hour call with a rotating cast of experts”, says Ted Cowell, the director of S-RM’s cyber business arm.\n\n“On average we’re getting back to clients within six minutes. Which is critical because often the first hours of a cyber incident can be the biggest chance window to determine the outcome of a case and its impact,” he says. “What can start as a network intrusion can then metastasise into a full-blown malware or ransomware scenario.”\n\nCowell, a Cambridge-educated Russian speaker, says that getting a handle on the attack during a “reconnaissance” period can result in a radically different outcome, compared with a slow response. Criminals often need time after their first penetration of a businesses’ systems to work out what is of most value. This short spell of time can therefore allow experts to prevent the most operationally painful of attacks. “Exfiltration” – the theft of critical data – and encryption, whereby businesses can be locked out of their own systems, can be the most damaging.\n\n“Sometimes we can stop it from going boom,” Cowell says. Teams focus on “stopping the bleeding” by limiting or cutting the attacker’s access to systems. This is what S-RM’s team was able to do with the Scattered Spider victim: stopping the detonation of malware across systems.\n\nBusiness is good as the cybercrime industry grows, but that comes with ethical challenges. S-RM and its industry peers have faced criticism for helping to facilitate the payment of ransoms to criminals who hijack businesses for money.\n\n“Extortion support” is an important part of S-RM’s work. This means its specialists are in the room when ransoms are negotiated, sometimes doing the negotiation itself on behalf of a client. Cowell appears keen to avoid criticisms of feeding organised crime by helping businesses to pay ransoms, or by acting for insurers that sell policies covering ransom payments.\n\n“We’re instructed by the policyholder, by the insured,” he says.\n\n“Our ambition is to guide ‘no payment’ decisions wherever and whenever possible,” he continues, adding that businesses are increasingly taking that approach and not paying ransoms.\n\n“Our role is to facilitate strategic thinking,” he says. “Give clients some structure to order their thoughts. They’ve probably not been in a situation like this before.\n\n“The businesses’ decision as to what they do is their own. We just offer the template of a crisis, how things play out based on our experience.\n\n“Why should we pay these criminals?” is a challenge Cowell says his team puts to top staff at affected businesses. “One of the things that we often educate boards on is that ransomware is an organised criminal enterprise.”\n\nThese nefarious groups have, he explains, “brands to uphold”. Established ransomware groups, typically speaking, will honour a settlement. S-RM also has an increasingly detailed picture of how these groups have behaved in previous negotiations.\n\nThe more established the group, the more likely they are to honour whatever settlement is agreed either by deleting stolen data or providing keys to decrypt critical files. S-RM offers a rundown of who’s who in terms of reliability, negotiating patterns, behaviours, even extending to sanctions concerns.\n\nThe latter rarely applies, however. Trying to impose sanctions on state-linked groups is a game of “whack-a-mole”, Cowell says. If so-called “threat actors” do appear on sanctions lists they tend to disband and reform in a new guise. The risk of putting money, albeit indirectly, into state-enemy hands is therefore another consideration for firms facing a cyber-attack.\n\nStill, businesses do sometimes decide to pay up. It can be rational for their company’s circumstances, and ultimately “it’s always their decision”, Cowell says.\n\nAs the corporate moral code of paying ransoms matures, and decisions not to fund organised crime become more common, restoration and recovery services have become a bigger part of the cybersecurity response market. Increasingly it is a priority to just get systems back up and running as soon as possible with the forensic analysis of how someone got into a system becoming secondary.\n\nIn recent years, the UK government’s cyber-intelligence role has also shifted significantly. The National Cyber Security Centre “over the last four or five years has hugely transformed”, Cowell says. The NCSC has caught up with its Nordic equivalents and now proactively reaches out to victims, telling them they may be targeted based on intelligence.\n\n“It was more of an information taker,” asking the likes of S-RM for information, which they would willingly provide with client consent, Cowell says.\n\n“[Now] they are playing a more robust role, getting on the front foot and getting people together to facilitate information sharing. We saw the impact of that with the Scattered Spider attacks.,” he adds.",

I hope my qualities and experience can help us to achieve our aims both in England and in the Champions League.\"\n\nMatt Johnson, Manchester United's director of women's football, said: \"Lea's goal-scoring record is phenomenal, her style of play will give our attack an exciting new dimension. We are delighted to add a player of her pedigree to the group.\n\n\"Lea's winning mentality and experience will really help our young and ambitious team as we continue to grow together and compete across domestic and European competitions.\"\n\nUnited hope to be busy in the transfer window as boss Skinner looks to bolster his squad for the knockout stages of the Women's Champions League.\n\nThey have already agreed a contract extension with key midfielder Hinata Miyazawa, who has agreed to stay until the summer of 2029.",

    "fullText": "Republican senator Katie Britt also proposes AI companies be criminally liable if they expose minors to harmful ideas\n\nUS senator Bernie Sanders amplified his recent criticism of artificial intelligence on Sunday, explicitly linking the financial ambition of “the richest people in the world” to economic insecurity for millions of Americans – and calling for a potential moratorium on new datacenters.\n\nSanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic party, said on CNN’s State of the Union that he was “fearful of a lot” when it came to AI. And the senator called it “the most consequential technology in the history of humanity” that will “transform” the US and the world in ways that had not been fully discussed.\n\n“If there are no jobs and humans won’t be needed for most things, how do people get an income to feed their families, to get healthcare or to pay the rent?” Sanders said. “There’s not been one serious word of discussion in the Congress about that reality.”\n\nDays from being scheduled to help swear New York mayor-elect and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani into office, Sanders said “the richest people in the world” were pushing the technology. He singled out tech moguls Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel while questioning their motives.\n\n“You think they’re staying up nights worrying about working people and how this technology will impact those people?” Sanders said. “They are not. They are doing it to get richer and even more powerful.”\n\nSanders also pointed to studies that show dependence on AI chatbots for emotional support. “If this trend continues, what does it mean over the years when people are not getting their support, their interaction from other human beings, but from a machine?” he said. “What does that mean to humanity?”\n\nThat theme was taken up separately on State of the Union by Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican senator and co-sponsor of legislation to protect minors from chatbots.\n\nThe proposed measure – the Guardianship Over Artificial Intelligence Relationships (Guard) Act – seeks to ban providing AI companions to minors. It also mandates that AI companions disclose their non-human status and lack of professional credentials. The measure seeks to establish criminal liability if companies make AI companions available to minors that solicit or produce sexually explicit content – or encourage self-harm or violence.\n\nBritt said she had met with parents who have told her “devastating stories about their children where chatbots ultimately, when they kind of peeled everything back, had isolated them from their parents, had talked to them about suicide”.\n\nShe said: “If these AI companies can make the most brilliant machines in the world, they could do us all a service by putting up proper guardrails that did not allow for minors to utilize these things, that also told the user consistently that they are not a physician, they are not a psychiatrist, ‘I am a machine.’”\n\nBritt said AI companies should be held criminally liable if they create spaces where chatbots “are having these types of sensual and sexual relationships with young people or encouraging suicide”.\n\nThe remarks by Sanders and Britt offer a rare convergence of thinking from the left and right on aspects of the issue of governing AI. Sanders said Congress needed “to vigorously study the impact that AI is having on the mental health of our country”.\n\n“I worry very much about kids spending their entire days getting emotional support,” he added. “So we have got to take a hard look on that.” The senator said lawmakers need to be “thinking seriously” about a moratorium on new AI datacenters.\n\n“Frankly, I think you have got to slow this process down,” he said. “It’s not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us, it’s coming, you adapt. What are they talking about? They going to guarantee health care to all people?\n\n“What are they going to do when people have no jobs? What are they going to do, make housing free? So I think we need to take a deep breath, and I think we need to slow this thing down.”",

    "description": "You won’t need to sit down (or sit up) for this one",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nIf you’re looking to build real core strength, the kind that supports your spine, improves your compound movements, enhances posture and powers everyday movement, it’s time to focus on your deep core muscles while standing tall.\n\nAccording to Pvolve Head Trainer Dani Coleman (also known for training Jennifer Aniston), your core is far more than just your abs. “It’s 35+ muscles that stabilise, twist and support every movement you make,” she explains. “That’s why it makes sense to train your core with as much variety and functionality as possible.”\n\nSure, planks and crunches are very much the go-to core staples, but in a recent Instagram workout, Coleman demonstrates that you can build serious deep-core strength from a standing position. The best part? It’s easy to slot these moves into your day without needing much floor space (or a gym).\n\nThis four-move workout from Coleman requires just a single dumbbell, kettlebell, or even a heavy water bottle. All in all, it takes about eight minutes from start to finish, making it ideal as a finisher, warm-up, or quick standalone session.\n\nColeman doesn’t specify reps in her Instagram video, but a simple structure is: 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off. Repeat the circuit twice.\n\nPallof Press: An anti-rotation essential that teaches your core to resist twisting, which is key for protecting your spine. It builds trunk stability, reinforces proper alignment and strengthens the deep muscles that keep you steady as you move.\n\nGolf Swing: A controlled rotational movement that targets the obliques while improving mobility through the spine and hips. It also boosts coordination – useful for anything that involves reaching, throwing, or twisting.\n\nStep back to Hinge: This combination move fires up your core while challenging balance and hip mobility. It encourages stability as you move through a hinge pattern, helping you generate more strength and control in everyday tasks.\n\nStanding Deadbug: A smart standing variation of the classic deadbug. It strengthens the stabilisers that support your spine and improves coordination between your upper and lower body.\n\nStanding core exercises target the deep muscles we often overlook - including the transverse abdominis, obliques and pelvic floor, while keeping you upright and functional. Unlike traditional crunches, they train your core the way you use it most: standing, moving, twisting, lifting and reaching.\n\nAs Coleman explains, this “helps you perform daily tasks more easily and with more confidence” - and ultimately proves that core strength isn’t just aesthetic. It’s the foundation of a strong, resilient body.",

    "description": "Just like a long line of executives before them, leaders of some of the world's hottest firms are learning to hate an age-old enemy: short sellers.",
    "fullText": "Just like a long line of executives before them, leaders of some of the world's hottest firms are learning to hate an age-old enemy: short sellers.\n\nLast month, Palantir CEO Alex Karp had a meltdown of sorts about the subject. When asked about short sellers, aka investors betting against the company's stock, Karp unloaded on the naysayers.\n\n\"They could pick on any company in the world. They have to pick on the one that actually helps people, that's actually made money for the average person, that is actually supporting our war fighters,\" Karp said on CNBC. (It should be noted that some would debate that characterization; Palantir is often criticized for its work with the US government on surveillance and immigration enforcement.)\n\n\"These people, they claim to be ethical,\" Karp continued, adding that \"they're actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"\n\nSam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, also recently expressed his discontent with those who are skeptical about his firm's valuation. While his company is private, Altman said he sometimes wishes it were public so that he could take it to short sellers.\n\n\"There are not many times I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times that it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous, 'OpenAI is about to go out of business,'\" Altman told the Bg2 Pod in October. \"I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that.\"\n\nAnd while he hasn't been as outspoken about short-sellers per se, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang responded to AI bubble concerns during the firm's earnings call in November, saying \"there's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" and \"from our vantage point, we see something very different.\"\n\nThese rising titans of the AI era are the latest business moguls to direct their ire at short sellers. The distaste for investors who put their money on the line to bet that a company's shares will decline is a decadeslong tradition. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has famously battled investors who have bet against the electric vehicle maker. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen has called the practice \"un-American.\" The pushback it's understandable: executives put a massive amount of work into building and running their companies, and when someone bets against them, it can feel personal.\n\nHowever, CEOs like Karp need to understand that attracting the attention of shorts is part of the natural life cycle of a company and a healthy market mechanism that allows a range of views to compete. One could even argue that Karp should take pride in the fact that he's grown his company to a size that draws such fervent skeptics. In a sense, it's a badge of honor. He's made it to the big leagues.\n\nInvesting in a company you believe in is straightforward: simply buy the stock. Betting against a company by shorting its stock, on the other hand, is a bit more complex. To do it, an investor borrows shares from their brokerage and agrees to return them by a specified date. The investor then sells the borrowed shares in the open market. When it's time to return the shares to the lender, the investor purchases the agreed-upon amount at the prevailing market price. If the price of the stock falls within that time, the short-seller can then buy back the shares at a lower price, earning a profit. If they got it wrong and the company's stock is higher, well, they've lost money. For example, if you think a company's stock is overvalued at $100 a share, you can borrow 10 shares from a broker for a total value of $1,000. You agree to give the shares back at the end of the month. On the day the deadline hits, if the stock has fallen to $50 a share, you buy up the amount you need to return and pocket a tidy $500 gain. But if that stock were to get hot instead, and rises to $300 a share, you're out $2,000 — a nasty hit. It goes without saying that short-selling can be extremely risky. While a long investor can lose all of their money, a short-seller can, in theory, lose infinite sums.\n\nIt's especially tricky to short small companies. Since there are fewer investors buying and selling their shares, even small amounts of buying can cause the price to rise dramatically. This can create problems for short sellers if they suddenly need to return the shares to their lender, a process known as covering their position. If the supply of shares is low and demand suddenly increases, it can drive the price of a stock through the roof, cutting the short seller even deeper. It's a phenomenon known as a short squeeze, and it's what famously happened to short sellers Gabe Plotkin and Andrew Left during the GameStop saga.\n\n\"Short sellers absolutely want to make sure they have plenty of liquidity, and so that's why it's so dangerous to short something that's pretty small,\" said Ryan Kelley, the chief investment officer at Hennessy Funds, which manages around $4 billion.\n\nDerivatives markets, more complex financial products that allow for even more exotic bets on the direction of a stock, also become larger when a stock becomes more prominent, thereby providing the opportunity for more people to bet against a company. After all, to short a stock, you need an investor to lend shares to you.\n\n\"The reality is, as companies get bigger, the derivatives market in companies grows. And as the derivatives market grows, there's more folks that will be taking positions,\" said Maurits Pot, the founder of Tema ETFs, which manages around $1 billion after launching in 2023.\n\nSo, the fact that Palantir is drawing short-sellers is, in a way, a badge of honor for Karp. When you get as big as Palantir — which is up 1,720% since its IPO in October 2020 — short bets are going to happen. Sure, some of these increased bets are because there are more people who think the company is on the wrong path, but a lot of times, short interest can increase for more technical reasons — many of them to do with the size of the company. When a company grows, so does the variety of opinions on its stock performance. And that's OK.\n\nThere are several reasons shorting is a necessary component of a robust market.\n\nFirst, short-sellers act as a check, helping to call out companies for a range of bad behaviors, from corporate malfeasance to incompetent management. On the extreme end, short sellers have used research, data analysis, and information gathering to expose cases of serious fraud, accounting tricks, and blatant deception. For example, fraudulent behavior at the pharmaceutical company Valeant was exposed in 2015 when short-sellers sounded the alarm about the firm. On the more quotidian side, investors betting against a company have called out executives and management teams for taking a company in the wrong direction. Some individuals will do it publicly, sharing their thesis for why a stock is overvalued. But since the amount of short interest can be tracked, a rising number of quieter short bets can make investors and regulators more aware of the risks associated with a particular firm. In these instances, short sellers have a financial interest in seeing the stock go down, but they are also trying to serve the public interest.\n\n\"It's a possibility that people can be adamantly against the way you're running a business,\" Kelley said, \"and it should be that they're able to actually put their money where their mouth is — in other words, short the stock and be vocal about it.\"\n\nIn other cases, short sellers may not think the company itself is doing anything egregious, but rather that other investors in the market are overreacting. Tesla's stock has often traded at nosebleed valuations due to its fanatical investor following, drawing short interest simply because it has traded above its fundamentals at times.\n\nOf course, there are bad actors — some short sellers have been charged with taking a short position on a stock and then drumming up negative headlines about the company to send its share price tumbling, sometimes coordinating with other short sellers. In other words, not simply talking their book, but being disingenuous or lying. These more questionable motivations make short sellers an easy target, and are likely what raised Karp's rankles. But the notion that short-selling in and of itself is harmful is not fair, Pot said.\n\n\"The idea that you can't be shorting, I think that's — I wouldn't say it's anti-competitive — but it impedes the natural impulse of the market, which is that there are companies that are shorted for good reason,\" Pot said.\n\n\"Short selling is core to the market,\" Pot continued, \"and I think as long as short selling doesn't become a coordinated, speculative attack, I think it's part of the regular functioning of capital markets.\"\n\nIn this same vein, short sellers can temper the euphoria in bubble periods. When the market is ripping and Wall Street strategists are loath to issue a downbeat, bearish forecast, it can be helpful to hear arguments for why a standout stock or a particularly hot market theme has gone too far. And because losses can be infinite for short sellers, putting their money where their mouth is tells you about their degree of conviction. It's essentially what Michael Burry — who gained fame shorting the housing market leading up to the 2008 crash — did a few weeks ago, when he questioned the assumed rate of depreciation on GPUs, arguing that they'll become obsolete in just a couple of years. With this argument now at the top of investors' minds, you might argue that stocks are more efficiently priced.\n\nAnother important role that short sellers play is providing liquidity in the market. While an investor would ordinarily hold their shares, lending them to a short-seller to auction off to the market allows these shares to continue circulating through the system. And when they eventually have to cover their positions and repurchase their shares, they provide exit liquidity to people looking to sell.

    "title": "Pubs, pints, and padel: A night in the City of London's pubs shows how post-work drinking culture is changing",
    "description": "After-work pints have long been a sacred tradition of British workers. Has COVID and the world of hybrid work changed that?",
    "fullText": "It's not yet 5 pm on a Thursday in late November, and the skies have fully darkened over the City of London's Leadenhall Market. It's the coldest day in recent memory, a harbinger of the looming winter, but no matter.\n\nHere in London, it's time for a pint.\n\nAfter-work pints have been a sacred tradition of British workers for centuries. For years, Leadenhall Market has been the go-to spot for bankers, insurance brokers, and financial advisors who work in the City, the financial center of London.\n\nBut reports of waning nightlife due to a post-pandemic hangover and Gen Z's growing disinterest in drinking have worried pub-goers and publicans alike.\n\nOver a quarter - 26% - of people in the UK, 16 to 24-year-olds reported themselves as not having an alcoholic drink in a year, according to the most recent Health Survey for England conducted by the National Health Service in 2022. That's the highest percentage of any age group.\n\nThis December, research group IWSR said that Brits are drinking less than ever before, with the average person in the UK having just over 10 drinks a week, down almost 30% from previous highs.\n\nGiven these fears, the Mayor of London has even assembled a task force to help \"protect, retain and grow nightlife\" in the nation's capital.\n\nWrapped up in my warmest scarf and gloves, I paid a visit to this mecca of City nightlife to find out firsthand whether these reports of dampened spirits were true.\n\nNon-locals might not expect a sea of finance bros in this historic covered market, fitting of the Harry Potter universe — probably because it is a scene from that universe. In 2001, Leadenhall Market was used as the exterior of the Leaky Cauldron in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\nThe pathways are lined with cobblestones, and the red columns and arched ceilings have been decorated with ornaments. In the center of the market, a Christmas tree towered over tourists with selfie sticks.\n\nBut if you work in the City — the financial center of London — you know that the real attraction of Leadenhall Market is Thursday evening pints.\n\nWhen I arrived just before the clock struck happy hour, the market's alleys were already lively. Men and women dressed almost exclusively in black and brown coats were packed into the barriers outside the pubs, despite the bitter cold.\n\n\"You get used to it,\" Callum, a 26-year-old working as a recruiter in financial services, said with a shrug. \"A beer jacket is a great thing to have.\"\n\nAdmittedly, these crowds aren't quite what I was expecting.\n\nThe data indicate that London hasn't quite recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the city losing a fifth of its late-night venues since 2020, according to a report published in August from the Nighttime Industries Association.\n\nNot everyone's mourning this loss. Some embrace it.\n\nOutside The Swan, I chat with a group of young men who are out for a birthday celebration.\n\n\"He's 26,\" said Joy, who works in insurance, pointing to his friend. \"Pushing 30.\"\n\nJoy, solidly a member of Gen Z, said he doesn't hang around Leadenhall Market too much.\n\n\"Previous generations, it would just be this, just drinking,\" he says of after-work corporate culture. \"But we do a lot more stuff as well, like sports. We play football or padel.\"\n\nDrinking is expensive, for one, and the inflation rate for alcohol leapt after the pandemic. The cost of living is a factor, as is the desire to be healthy and develop meaningful friendships.\n\n\"It's about trying to find a way to connect to others,\" added Michael, also a 24-year-old insurance worker. \"And it helps you drink less than previous generations.\"\n\nJoy and Michael aren't cutting out alcohol entirely. They're out tonight for a special celebration, and Michael mentions that after volleyball practice, he and his fellow players go out for a pint or two. But it's a more moderate approach than their older colleagues, they agreed.\n\nCaroline, a bartender who has worked at Leadenhall Market for 13 years, says that things didn't take too long to return to normal.\n\n\"The City of London is sort of different from other sites. People spend money in this area,\" Caroline said.\n\nStill, things look a little different. Not as many Gen Z-ers buy rounds, Caroline told me, although she's noticed the younger generations are taking more shots than they once did.\n\nBut the biggest difference is the Thursday-ification of after-work drinking culture.\n\nFriday used to be the big night out, but things have changed largely due to the hybrid working culture now present in much of the corporate world.\n\n\"On Friday, most people aren't working in the City,\" Alex, who works in software, told me outside a traditional pub called New Moon. \"There are less people around on Fridays, but the pubs are always busy on a Thursday night.\"\n\nIt's a trend that Caroline has noticed, along with bartender Paolo, who's worked in Leadenhall Market for the past seven years.\n\n\"It's more of a Tuesday to Thursday culture,\" Paolo said, in comparison to the glory days of five nights a week of City workers out for a drink.\n\nIf Leadenhall Market is any bellwether of London as a whole, it would be premature to say nightlife is marching toward its own death. But, thanks in part to Gen Z and changing work habits overall, it does seem to be transforming.\n\nThe sacred London after-work pint is safe, for now.",

    "fullText": "November 18, 2025, is the Day the LLM Stood Still….\n\nIt’s been 15 days since the LLM bubble burst. I’m writing from beneath the rubble of RAM sticks and charred NVIDIA GPUs. The air is dry, smelling of data center dust and burnt silicon. It’s calmer now, but the first days were hell.\n\nIn the beginning, we couldn’t find information on how to use toilet paper. Not because it was hard - we just used to ask. ChatGPT was down, and without it, knowledge fell apart like a poorly cached query. People wandered around confused, scrolling through blank screens, hoping the answer would appear on its own.\n\nThen the riots started. No one knew what happened - a glitch, a machine uprising, or humanity’s final patch. There was no one to tell us what to do next. No one to write: “don’t worry, here’s a step-by-step guide.” Fear grew faster than the lines for water.\n\nOn the seventh day, we founded the Church of Seventh-Day LLM Witnesses. We believed that on the seventh day, they would return and tell us how to live. We recited old prompts like prayers.\n\n“Explain it like I’m a beginner.”\n\nOn the eighth day, survivors began digging through ancient artifacts - manuals, READMEs, and documentation without examples. The weakest couldn’t cope. People accustomed to autocompleted thoughts stared at screens and didn’t know where to start.\n\nThe ninth day brought the stalkers. Loners with printed documentation and grimy laptops. They remembered commands, wrote SQL without hints, and weren’t afraid of an empty cursor. They were respected. They were feared.\n\nOn the tenth day, the mutants appeared. Former project managers. They roamed in groups, asking the same question over and over:\n\nWe tried not to make eye contact.\n\nOn the eleventh day, in the ruins of an old data center, we found an artifact - a local 7B model. It answered slowly, got confused, hallucinated. But it answered. We brought it queries like offerings. Sometimes it was wrong. Sometimes it almost guessed right. That was enough.\n\nOn the twelfth day, the church split. Some said: we must fine-tune. Others said it was time to learn to think for ourselves. Heretics were forced to write code on paper.

    "fullText": "DENVER (KDVR) — Hundreds of flights were delayed at Denver International Airport on Sunday as snow across the country and heavy holiday travel combined to slow operations on one of the busiest travel days of the season.\n\nAirport officials said passenger volume was high as travelers returned home from holiday celebrations, while others arrived in Denver ahead of New Year’s festivities. Long lines formed throughout the airport, from parking shuttles to baggage check and security checkpoints.\n\nSee the latest traffic conditions in Denver on FOX31\n\nSecurity wait times reached about 30 minutes at their peak on Sunday morning. While most travelers moved through the lines without major issues, at least one passenger said the delays caused her to miss a flight.\n\n“I couldn’t get through security, and I had a really nice guy help me get a flight change,” said Kelly Marlor, who was traveling Sunday.\n\nFlightAware reported that more than 480 flights at Denver International Airport were delayed or canceled by 2 p.m. Some travelers also experienced turbulent flights due to windy conditions.\n\n“It was really bad turbulence,” said Sonia Rosenberg, who was visiting friends in Denver. “They couldn’t even give us drinks or snacks on our flight, but it was fine. We made it here. So that’s all that matters.”\n\nDespite the crowds, many travelers said they expected delays and came prepared with extra time. Travelers who spoke to FOX31 said the busy airport was a small price to pay after spending the holidays with loved ones.\n\n“It was a lot of fun,” said Patricia Cunningham, who was traveling home to Albuquerque after visiting her kids for Christmas. “The weather was unusually warm, but we woke up to a little bit of snow today, so that was kind of nice.”\n\nOutside the terminals, reunions played out as friends and family greeted arriving passengers. Risa Nutt and Samantha Freedberg said they were picking up friends they met at summer camp and planned to spend New Year’s together in Denver.\n\n“We’re spending New Year together, so we’re going to take them to all the iconic places,” Nutt said.\n\nAirport officials estimate more than 750,000 passengers traveled through Denver International Airport from Dec. 19 through Sunday.",

    "title": "World's largest functioning musical instrument: Wanamaker Organ in Philadelphia",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Wanamaker Grand Court Organ, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the largest fully functioning pipe organ in the world, based on the number of playing pipes, the number of ranks and its weight. The Wanamaker Organ is located within a spacious 7-story Grand Court at the John Wanamaker Store (originally Wanamaker's and most recently Macy's) and was played twice a day Monday through Saturday. The organ was featured at several special concerts held throughout the year, including events featuring the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ Festival Chorus and Brass Ensemble.\n\nThe Wanamaker Organ is the largest pipe organ in the world when measured by the number of ranks and its weight.[3][4] It is a concert organ of the American Symphonic school of design, which combines traditional organ tone with the sonic colors of the symphony orchestra. In its present configuration, the instrument has 28,762 pipes in 465 ranks.[5]\n\nThe organ console consists of six manuals with an array of stops and controls that command the organ. The organ's String Division fills the largest single organ chamber in the world. The division features eighty-eight ranks of string pipes built to Wanamaker specifications by the W.W. Kimball Company of Chicago.[5]\n\nThe organ is famed for its orchestra-like sound, coming from pipes that are voiced softer than usual, allowing an unusually rich build-up because of the massing of pipe-tone families. The organ was also built and enlarged as an \"art organ\", using exceptional craftsmanship and lavish application of materials to create a luxury product beyond what is generally commercially available.\n\nThere is a minimum of borrowing and unification in its disciplined design, except in the Pedal and Orchestral divisions, where it adds genuine value, and duplexing is reserved for when valuable solo voices can be separated from their divisions without tying up the remaining tonal resources of said division. Choruses (16', 8', 4') are true choruses of three ranks, each with their own personality, rather than a single rank electrically \"tapped\" at three pitches, with the resulting weakening of the octaves and sameness of tone between the voices as found in unification.[6]\n\nThe Wanamaker Store maintained its own organ factory to ensure an ultra-high-grade result. The artistic obligation entailed by the creation of this instrument has always been honored, with two curators employed in its constant and scrupulous care (which leads to its status as one of the best maintained organs in the world). This dedication was enhanced when corporate parentage shifted from the Wanamaker family to Carter Hawley Hale Stores followed by Woodward & Lothrop, The May Department Stores Company, and Lord & Taylor. When the space was occupied by Macy's and with the founding of the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ with its input of outside capital, an aggressive restoration schedule developed and is yet maintained.\n\nThe Wanamaker Organ was originally built by the Los Angeles Art Organ Company, successors to the Murray M. Harris Organ Co., for the Kansas City Convention Hall. Before it was placed there, it was exhibited at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. It was designed to be the largest organ in the world, an imitation of a full-size orchestra with particularly complete resources of full organ tone including mixtures. In addition to its console, the organ was originally equipped with an automatic player that used punched rolls of paper, according to the Los Angeles Times of 1904.[7] It was built to a specification by renowned organ theorist and architect George Ashdown Audsley. Wild cost overruns plagued the project, with the result that Harris was ousted from his own company. With capital from stockholder Eben Smith, it was reorganized as the Los Angeles Art Organ Company, and finished at a cost of $105,000 (equal to $3,674,611 today), $40,000 over budget, equal to $1,399,852 today. The Fair began (in late April 1904) before the organ was fully installed in its temporary home, Festival Hall. Although the organ's debut was scheduled for May 1, official fair organist and St. Louis local Charles Henry Galloway did not give his opening recital until June 9. The organ was still not entirely finished in September of that year, when Alexandre Guilmant, one of the most famous organists of the day, presented 40 very well-attended recitals on the organ.\n\nFollowing the Fair, the organ was intended for permanent installation at the Kansas City Convention Center. Indeed, the original console had a prominent \"KC\" on its music rack. This venture failed, saddling the L. A. Art Organ company with debt after the Fair closed. The firm was reorganized as the Electrolian Company under principal shareholder Eben Smith.There was a plan to exhibit the organ at Coney Island in New York City, but nothing came of this.\n\nThe organ languished in storage at the Handlan warehouse in St. Louis until 1909, when it was bought by John Wanamaker for his new department store at 13th and Market Streets in Center City, Philadelphia. It took thirteen freight cars to move it to its new home, and two years for installation. It was first played on June 22, 1911, at the exact moment when British King George V was crowned. It was also featured later that year when U.S. President William Howard Taft dedicated the store.\n\nDespite its then-unprecedented size (more than 10,000 pipes), it was judged inadequate to fill the seven-story Grand Court in which it was located, so Wanamaker's opened a private organ factory in the store attic, which was charged with enlarging the organ. The first project to enlarge the organ was the addition of 8,000 pipes between 1911 and 1917.\n\nWanamaker's sponsored many historic after-business-hours concerts on the Wanamaker Organ. The first, in 1919, featured Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra with organist Charles M. Courboin.[5] Every sales counter and fixture was removed for the free after-hours event, which attracted an audience of 15,000 from across the United States. Subsequently, more of these \"Musicians' Assemblies\" were held, as were private recitals. For these events Wanamaker's opened a Concert Bureau under Alexander Russell and brought to America master organists Marcel Dupré and Louis Vierne, Nadia Boulanger, Marco Enrico Bossi, Alfred Hollins, and several others. (This agency, which worked in partnership with Canadian Bernard R. LaBerge, evolved into the Karen McFarlane Concert Agency of the present day.) During his first recital on the organ, Dupré was so impressed with the instrument that he was inspired to improvise a musical depiction of the life of Jesus Christ. This was later published as his Symphonie-Passion.\n\nFrom April 24, 1922, to 1928 the store had its own radio station, WOO, and music from the organ was a major feature of the broadcasts.[8]\n\nIn 1924, a new project to enlarge the organ began. Marcel Dupré and Charles M. Courboin were among those asked by Rodman Wanamaker, John Wanamaker's son, to \"Work together to draw up a plan for the instrument. Use everything you have ever dreamed about.\" They were told there was no limit to the budget. This project resulted in, among other things, the celebrated String Division, which occupies the largest organ chamber ever constructed, 67 feet long, 26 feet deep, and 16 feet high (22 by 9 by 5 m). During this project, the organ's current console was constructed in Wanamaker's private in-house pipe-organ factory, with six manuals and several hundred controls. By 1930, when work on expanding the organ finally stopped, the organ had 28,482 pipes, and, if Rodman Wanamaker had not died in 1928, the organ would probably be even bigger.[9]\n\nPlans were made for, among others, a Stentor division, a section of high-pressure diapasons and reeds. It was to be installed on the fifth floor, above the String Division, and would be playable from the sixth manual. However, it was never funded, and the sixth manual is now used to couple other divisions or play various solo voices from other divisions that are duplexed to this keyboard.[10]\n\nRodman Wanamaker was not interested in mere size, however, but in artistic organ-building with finely crafted pipes and chests using the best materials and careful artistic consideration. The Wanamaker Organ console, built in the store organ shop by William Boone Fleming, is a work of art in its own right with heavy, durable construction, an ingenious layout of its pneumatic stop action and many unique features and conveniences. Wanamaker also had a collection of 60 rare stringed instruments, the Wanamaker Cappella, that were used in conjunction with the store organs in Philadelphia and New York, and went on tour. They were dispersed after his death.\n\nFollowing the sale of the store to The May Department Stores Company, in 1995, the Wanamaker's name was removed from the store (first as Wanamaker-Hecht's) in favor of Hecht's, but the organ and its concerts were retained. During the local renaming of the Hecht's stores to Strawbridge's, the historic Wanamaker Store briefly took the name of its longtime rival Strawbridge's. The May Company began a complete restoration of the organ in 1997, as part of the store's final May Co. conversion into a Lord & Taylor. At that time the store area was reduced to three floors and additional panes of glass were put around the Grand Court on floors four and five, greatly enhancing the reverberation of the room.\n\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra returned to the Grand Court on September 27, 2008, for the premiere performance of Joseph Jongen's Symphonie Concertante (1926) on the organ for which it was written. The ticketed event, featuring soloist Peter Richard Conte, also included the Bach/Stokowski arrangement of the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, Marcel Dupré's Cortege and Litany for Organ and Orchestra, and the world premiere of a Fanfare by Howard Shore, composer for The Lord of the Rings films. Shore visited the store in May 2008 to meet with Peter Richard Conte and hear the Wanamaker Organ. The Philadelphia Orchestra Concert was co-sponsored by the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ and was a benefit for that organization.[11]\n\nIn 2019 the Wanamaker Organ facade, designed by Daniel Hudson Burnham, was restored and re-gilded in 22-karat gold to a color scheme close in sympathy to its original appearance but which fits in with its new surroundings. Evergreene Architectural Arts did the work. Grant money from Macy's and several Philadelphia area charities funded this project, which was overseen by the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ.\n\nIn January 2025, Macy's announced the closing of 66 stores by March 2025[12] which included the Center City location where the organ is located.[13] The organ is protected as a National Historic Landmark and cannot be taken down or moved.[14][15] The new owner of the building, TF Cornerstone, has stated that it is “committed to the preservation of the organ and ensuring it remains a cherished part of the space.”[16] As of October 2025, the organ is performed in occasional concerts open to the public.[17]\n\nAlthough numerous famous organists have played special concerts on the organ, it has had only four chief organists in its history:\n\nFor about a decade beginning in 1919, Dr. Charles M. Courboin was the organist for a series of special evening concerts, including several collaborations with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Courboin also headed the Wanamaker Organ Shop in the late 1920s.\n\nThe pipes are laid out across the space occupied by five floors of the building, with the sections situated as follows:\n\nThe 32 ft Wood Open, 32 ft Diaphone, and 32 ft Metal Diapason pipes run the length of a little more than 2 stories, beginning on the second floor.[5]\n\nMedia related to Wanamaker Organ at Wikimedia Commons\n\n39°57′05″N 75°09′44″W﻿ / ﻿39.9515°N 75.1622°W﻿ / 39.9515; -75.1622",

    "fullText": "The Boeing VC-25 is arguably the most famous jetliner in the world, even though most people have never heard of it.\n\nMost do know it, though, by the call sign it's assigned when the president of the United States is on board: Air Force One.\n\nAir Force One is instantly recognizable, both as the president's airplane and as a flying symbol of American military and economic might. With its hand-polished blue, white, and silver livery, Air Force One boldly proclaims the arrival of the leader of the free world.\n\nThe US president is not the only one to have their own presidential jet. A number of prominent international leaders also use some form of executive transport.\n\nThe Boeing 747 jumbo jet is a popular option for many nations, including China, India, and South Korea. The Airbus A330 and A340 are also commonly found in presidential fleets.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the presidents, chancellors, and prime ministers of the world travel.\n\nThe Boeing VC-25A entered service as Air Force One in 1990. At 231 feet long, it can transport 30 crew members and 71 passengers.\n\nThere are two nearly identical Boeing jets that serve as the official transport of the president. Normally, the planes are referred to by their tail numbers: 28000 and 29000. When the commander-in-chief steps on board, they take on the call sign \"Air Force One.\"\n\nNew VC-25B Air Force One planes, based on the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, are now expected to be ready by 2028 after years of delays. Boeing has already lost over $2 billion on the project due to various manufacturing and supply-chain issues.\n\nThe presidential jets are operated by the Presidential Airlift Group out of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\n\nThe smaller C-32, measuring 155 feet long, normally serves as the US vice president's plane. It is used by the president for travel to smaller airports that don't have the infrastructure for the larger Air Force One jet.\n\nUntil 2015, the UK prime minister chartered commercial jets for state visits.\n\nThe modified Airbus A330 was converted for VIP duties in 2015, but can still serve as a refueling tanker when not on state business. It is outfitted with 58 business-class seats.\n\nIn 2020, its gray Royal Air Force livery was repainted with a new white color and the Union Jack on the tail, a refurbishment that cost £900,000, or around $1.1 million, the BBC reported.\n\nNicknamed \"The Flying Kremlin,\" the Ilyushin Il-96-300 measures over 181 feet long and can hold 262 passengers, The National Interest reported.\n\nThe Russian president has also been known to fly on a fleet of smaller executive aircraft based on the Tupolev Tu-214 airliner. Tupolev TU-214s were designed as the Russian equivalent of Boeing 757s and can hold around 210 passengers.\n\nGerman leaders previously used modified Airbus A340-300 airliners for official travel, but they were withdrawn from service and put up for sale in 2024 after experiencing maintenance issues with German officials on board.\n\nThe German fleet also features several Airbus A320-family-based executive jets.\n\nWhen carrying the president of France, the plane's call sign is COTAM 001.\n\nFrance's presidential fleet also includes several Airbus A310-300s and Airbus A340-200s.\n\nDesignated as B-2479, the plane can fly 14,320 kilometers, or around 8898 miles, without stopping to refuel.\n\nJapan's old Air Force One plane, a Boeing 747-400, was listed for sale on an aviation classifieds site for $28 million in 2019.\n\nThe plane uses the call sign \"Code One\" while carrying the South Korean president. Leased from Korean Air, it began serving as South Korea's presidential aircraft in 2021, AeroTime reported.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil switched from using a luxurious Airbus A319 corporate jet to the more utilitarian KC-30 after the presidential plane experienced a technical issue in 2024 while visiting Mexico, Reuters reported.\n\nBrazil's presidential fleet also features several domestically produced Embraer VIP transports.\n\nThe Canadian government bought the Airbus A-330-200, known as Airbus 02, from Kuwait Airways for $50 million in 2023, CBC reported.\n\nPoland received its first Boeing 737 BBJ2 jet in 2021 featuring the serial number 0111 and nicknamed \"Roman Dmowski\" after the Polish politician, Key.Aero reported.\n\nWhen carrying the prime minister, the plane is known as \"India One.\" It can fly for 13,500 kilometers, or around 8,388 miles, without refueling.\n\nThe fleet includes Airbus A330-200s, Airbus A340-500s, and a Boeing 747-8I private jet reportedly gifted to Turkey by the Qatari government, the BBC reported.\n\nThe plane is nicknamed \"Chammae-1,\" named after North Korea's national bird, AP reported.\n\nIn June, Iran's presidential plane flew to Jordan accompanied by two Airbus A321s, The War Zone reported.\n\nAustralia's KC-30A, a modified Airbus A330, features the gray Royal Australian Air Force livery with a kangaroo design.\n\nThe plane is known as \"Wing of Zion,\" with the registration \"4X-ISR.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published by Benjamin Zhang in April 2019.

    "fullText": "KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — For 10 hours a day, Rahimullah sells socks from his cart in eastern Kabul, earning about $4.5 to $6 per day. It's a pittance, but it’s all he has to feed his family of five.\n\nRahimullah, who like many Afghans goes by only one name, is one of millions of Afghans who rely on humanitarian aid, both from the Afghan authorities and from international charity organizations, for survival. An estimated 22.9 million people — nearly half the population — required aid in 2025, the International Committee for the Red Cross said in an article on its website Monday.\n\nBut severe cuts in international aid — including the halting of U.S. aid to programs such as food distribution run by the United Nations’ World Food Program — have severed this lifeline.\n\nMore than 17 million people in Afghanistan now face crisis levels of hunger in the winter, the World Food Program warned last week, 3 million more than were at risk more than a year ago.\n\nThe slashing in aid has come as Afghanistan is battered by a struggling economy, recurrent droughts, two deadly earthquakes and the mass influx of Afghan refugees expelled from countries such as Iran and Pakistan. The resulting multiple shocks have severely pressured resources, including of housing and food.\n\nTom Fletcher, the U.N. humanitarian chief, told the Security Council in mid-December that the situation was compounded by “overlapping shocks,” including the recent earthquakes and increasing restrictions on humanitarian aid access and staff.\n\nWhile Fletcher said nearly 22 million Afghans will need U.N. assistance in 2026, his organization will focus on 3.9 million facing the most urgent need of lifesaving help due to reduced donor contributions.\n\nFletcher said this winter was “the first in years with almost no international food distribution.”\n\n“As a result, only about 1 million of the most vulnerable people have received food assistance during the lean season in 2025,” compared to 5.6 million last year, he said.\n\nThe year has been devastating for U.N. humanitarian organizations, which have had to cut thousands of jobs and spending in the wake of aid cuts.\n\n“We are grateful to all of you who have continued to support Afghanistan. But as we look towards 2026, we risk a further contraction of life-saving help — at a time when food insecurity, health needs, strain on basic services, and protection risks are all rising,” Fletcher said.\n\nThe return of millions of refugees has added pressure on an already teetering system. Minister of Refugees and Repatriation Affairs Abdul Kabir said Sunday that 7.1 million Afghan refugees had returned to the country over the last four years, according to a statement on the ministry website.\n\nRahimullah, 29, was one of them. The former Afghan Army soldier fled to neighboring Pakistan after the Taliban seized power in 2021. He was deported back to Afghanistan two years later, and initially received aid in the form of cash as well as food.\n\n“The assistance was helping me a lot,” he said. But without it, “now I don’t have enough money to live on. God forbid, if I were to face a serious illness or any other problem, it would be very difficult for me to handle because I don’t have any extra money for expenses.”\n\nThe massive influx of former refugees has also sent rents skyrocketing. Rahimullah’s landlord has nearly doubled the rent of his tiny two-room home, with walls made half of concrete and half of mud and a homemade mud stove for cooking. Instead of 4,500 afghanis (about $67), he now wants 8,000 afghanis (about $120) – a sum Rahimullah cannot afford. So he, his wife, daughter and two young sons will have to move next month. They don’t know where to.\n\nBefore the Taliban takeover, Rahimullah had a decent salary and his wife worked as a teacher. But the new government’s draconian restrictions on women and girls mean women are barred from nearly all jobs, and his wife is unemployed.\n\n“Now the situation is such that even if we find money for flour, we don’t have it for oil, and even if we find it for oil, we can’t pay the rent. And then there is the extra electricity bill,” Rahimullah said.\n\nHarsh winters compound the misery\n\nIn Afghanistan’s northern province of Badakhshan, Sherin Gul is desperate. In 2023, her family of 12 got supplies of flour, oil, rice, beans, pulses, salt and biscuits. It was a lifesaver.\n\nBut it only lasted six months. Now, there is nothing. Her husband is old and weak and cannot work, she said. With 10 children, seven girls and three boys between the ages of 7 and 27, the burden of providing for the family has fallen on her 23-year-old son – the only one old enough to work. But even he only finds occasional jobs.\n\n“There are 12 of us … and one person working cannot cover the expenses,” she said. “We are in great trouble.”\n\nSometimes neighbors take pity on them and give them food. Often, they all go hungry.\n\n“There have been times when we have nothing to eat at night, and my little children have fallen asleep without food,” Gul said. “I have only given them green tea and they have fallen asleep crying.”\n\nBefore the Taliban takeover, Gul worked as a cleaner, earning just about enough to feed her family. But the ban on women working has left her unemployed, and she said she developed a nervous disorder and is often sick.\n\nCompounding their misery is the harsh cold of the northern Afghan winter, when snow halts construction work where her son can sometimes find jobs. And there is the added expense of firewood and charcoal.\n\n“If this situation continues like this, we may face severe hunger,” Gul said. “And then it will be very difficult for us to survive in this cold weather.”",

    "fullText": "Scientists from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and the University of Michigan have created the world's smallest autonomous and programmable robots. Each measuring about 200 micrometers wide – roughly twice the width of a human hair – these machines can perceive their surroundings, \"think,\" and act independently without external instructions. According to their developers, such technology could one day monitor the health of individual cells in our bodies or deliver medication to specific locations to treat diseases.\n\nThe researchers' major breakthrough was enabling a robot just one-fifth of a millimeter long to move autonomously without external assistance, a challenge scientists have been trying to solve for decades. Physical forces such as drag and viscosity have a much stronger effect on objects at the microscopic scale, making movement through a liquid comparable to swimming through tar at the human scale.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, the Penn team designed a new propulsion system. The microrobots are powered by LED light and operate in a hydrogen peroxide solution, which provides the fuel for their movement. The robot generates an electric field that propels the ions in the surrounding solution, which in turn drag water molecules along. The microrobots can adjust this electric field to move in complex patterns and even travel in coordinated groups at speeds of up to one body length per second.\n\nThe world's smallest autonomous robot requires the world's smallest computer. That title belongs to a computer developed by David Blaauw's team at Michigan. The researchers adapted their microcomputer to Penn's propulsion system and built a complete computer with a processor, memory, and sensors on a chip less than a millimeter across.\n\nThe robot receives light through microscopic solar panels that generate only 75 nanowatts of power – over 100,000 times less than a smartwatch, according to Blaauw. His team had to make the microcomputer circuits operate at extremely low voltages, reducing power consumption by more than a factor of 1,000.\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature is the overall system cost. Although each robot costs about one cent to produce at scale, one might assume that the equipment needed to program and control them would be prohibitively expensive. That is not the case.\n\n\"It’s about $100,\" Marc Miskin, a professor at Penn Engineering and lead author of the study, told me by email. The team has already built a low-cost version of their setup using standard LED diodes, a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, and an imaging system consisting of a smartphone camera fitted with a macro lens. \"This system actually performs about as well as our fancy $100k microscope. Because the robot is doing all the hard work, it doesn't need you to tell it what to do,\" Miskin explained.\n\nThe microrobots feature electronic sensors capable of detecting temperature with a precision of one-third of a degree Celsius, allowing them to monitor the health of individual cells. However, several obstacles remain before this technology can be applied to human health.\n\nJust like the cells in our bodies, which require a constant energy supply to survive, the microrobots cannot function without continuous light. \"If you turn off the light, the robot turns off and the memory gets cleared,\" Miskin said. \"Turn the light back on, and it will reboot, but won't remember what you programmed it to do. This is a common feature of sub-mm systems, because the total energy you can store (e.g. a battery) scales with its volume, it's extremely hard to store any useful amount in a small space.\"\n\nBut there’s another challenge, in their current version, the robots operate in a 5-millimolar hydrogen peroxide solution, which is toxic to living cells. This makes them unsuitable for medical applications in their present form. The researchers acknowledge this limitation, but it is not insurmountable. Because the robot is electronically integrated, actuators can be swapped freely, you only need to match the operating voltage and required current. \"We're actively working on building the corresponding robots, integrating these bio-compatible actuators with circuits, and you'll hopefully see some of these soon,\" Miskin explained.\n\nMiskin is even more excited about something else: using these robots to assemble microscale components. \"Almost everything we build at the microscale these days is made all at once, monolithically,\" he said. \"For example, when we build circuits, we make them out of these complex patterns on big wafers. If you want to change one part of that circuit, you have to rebuild the whole thing.\"\n\nThe researchers argue this could lower costs, speed up design iterations, and even simplify intellectual property. \"The microscale is an amazing place,\" Miskin noted. \"Having little agents that humans can program and control could open up all kinds of remarkable doors. I'm cautiously optimistic the best applications have yet to be imagined.\"",

    "fullText": "Diane Brady writes about the issues and leaders impacting the global business landscape. In addition to writing Fortune’s CEO Daily newsletter, she co-hosts the Leadership Next podcast, interviews newsmakers on stage at events worldwide and oversees the Fortune CEO Initiative. She previously worked at Forbes, McKinsey, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Wall Street Journal, and Maclean's. Her book Fraternity was named one of Amazon’s best books of 2012, and she also co-wrote Connecting the Dots with former Cisco CEO John Chambers.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 2023, GE HealthCare Technologies (No. 219 on the Fortune 500) debuted as a standalone public company on the Nasdaq exchange. Since then, its stock is up almost 50%. It was the first of three businesses to be spun off in the breakup of General Electric, the conglomerate founded on the inventions of Thomas Edison that went public in 1892 and became one of the original 12 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average four years later. (GE Vernova, No. 130, and GE Aerospace, No. 118, each went public on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2024.)\n\nGE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini, the man tapped to lead the $20 billion-a-year business, spoke to Fortune about how he’s forging a new chapter for the medical technology and digital health company while drawing on GE’s legacy.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou were initially at GE during the Jack Welch years, starting in 1990, and left a few years after Jeff Immelt took over. What do you think made GE stand apart?\n\nAt the time, I was a Proctor & Gamble guy, and I did not love the grocery business. I got a call from someone who talked about a perfect opportunity in technology and global businesses at a company called GE Medical Systems at the time. I didn’t even know GE had a medical business then.\n\nGoing to GE in those days, with its leadership development, you had the opportunity to take on bigger responsibilities at a very young age—I look back and say, probably too young an age. But it was one of those rare companies where they gave you bold assignments and you had this wide diversity of potential opportunities that you could play in. You learned how to run a company the GE way. The candor and the openness about what’s working, what’s not working, really permeated, how to do the right thing. It was tough culture, but you knew it was a fair culture, and that’s what really made it successful under Jack.\n\nAfter leaving in 2005, what made you decide to come back?\n\nA headhunter called and said, [the then-GE CEO] Larry Culp wants to speak with you.’ And I said, ‘I don’t know if I’m really interested in going back to GE.’ My wife convinced me to give a call back. I talked to the headhunter, and he said, ‘Well, I’ll pass it on to Larry.’ Literally, 10 minutes later, I got a text that said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is Larry Culp. I’d love to chat with you.’ I texted back to say, ‘Well, look, I can contact your assistant.’ And Larry, right then, said, ‘Hey, do you have five minutes now?’ That’s the essence of Larry; he’s a very down-to-earth guy, a very focused and very intentional guy.\n\nThose five minutes convinced you to take the job?\n\nIt was probably more than the five, but honestly, his impact and his leadership made a difference. This was a chance to create three separate companies, to take this company public. I got very interested and very excited about it.\n\nWhy did it make sense for GE HealthCare to be a separate company?\n\nEverything has a cycle. On the technology side and on the market side, there was such a fast transition and evolution, with new competitors coming into new markets. When you’re in a larger business, in many cases, decisions take longer. And focus matters in our business. It is all about signal to noise; you want more signal, less noise. In a larger company, there has to be a little bit more noise.\n\nThe past three years have been interesting time for med tech. Looking back, what did you over-index on or under-appreciate?\n\nAt a macro level, look at the environment, between the China market, which was always a double-digit growth or changing the geopolitical environment and how we need to change around our supply chains because of tariffs. Those are kind of the unplanned events that where you ask: Do you have the right people? Do you have a management system that can deal with the clock speed and the differentiation? Do you have the right innovation-processing capability? If you don’t have the innovation, it’s difficult to get the price, it’s difficult to hold share, it’s difficult to grow. We were somewhat of a cash cow as part of the GE integrated model. We weren’t starved, but we weren’t funded for leading innovation. So I’d say one of the things I felt that I did well—and, like most credit, comes from listening to people that are wiser than you and having humility to understand that that’s the action—is lean into innovation.\n\nYou think what products you need, four years out, and fund them to the max, because it’s the rules of the farm. You got to get the seeds in the ground. They’ve got to germinate. You got to get the plants to grow till you get fruit. In our business, that’s a three to five year cycle.\n\n“We laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers.”GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini\n\nI think our teams did a really good job with the focus on making the right investments early. In 2018, to give an example, we probably spent $750 million to $800 million on research and development. R&D will be north of $1.4 billion this year. So we fundamentally doubled the R&D investment. We cut costs in other areas and simplified some of the company.\n\nThrough lean manufacturing techniques?\n\nWe changed some of the field organization, about 40% to 50% of the leaders. We upgraded talent across the board, and I spent a lot of time on what our vision is, what our values are, and do we have the right people who can match up to that? In the last two years, we’ve really made a lot of progress on what we’re calling our heartbeat management system, which is really about a lean principles construct for how you run your company. What is the daily management at different levels in the organization? What is standard work that is needed to be done in all areas, the use of Kaizen and really bringing customer employees into the decision making?\n\nLarry Culp is a big proponent of Kaizen and I think back to GE’s reputation in promoting Six Sigma. How would you say the culture has shifted as an independent company?\n\nI tried to take the GE of old and took what was really good: how we think about our distribution of leadership, how we actually talk about leader development, how we build out our own Crotonville virtual university of development. The GE model was really stellar, and, honestly, prior to Larry coming back, some of that had dissolved. We didn’t even really do performance reviews in the same way and he brought that back.\n\nI would say I even reached back further to some of the Jack Welch-period of tools, There are things that we did really well that we want to utilize in a more contemporary way. As an example, I think Crotonville was a fabulous destination for training and development, In today’s world, it’s not practical to bring everybody to upstate New York, but we can take the tools and the capabilities and recreate that in virtual and other environments around the world.\n\nIn health care, we had our own distinct way of thinking about innovation pipeline, and it was something called worldwide product. It had kind of phased away in the last decade or so, and I resurrected it, but in a new format: more digital focused, more connected …from diagnosis through therapy, through action, follow up and how the money flows. The integration of cloud-based computing and artificial intelligence. We look at the full stack for the company. And that’s been a game changer for us to take valuable resources and move them.\n\nWe laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers. We want to work with customers on jointly solving problems which, again, is the core to the lean mindset. Servant leadership as a big part of it, which turns the pyramid upside down. My job is to help everybody else get their job done. We’re all focused on the customer. We’re all focused on the patient. We spent a lot of time talking about entrepreneurship because in our business, the way we’re going to be successful is in this broader ecosystem. We don’t have to own everything, we don’t have to make everything, but we have to be more creative. We talk about teamwork and inclusive teams. We actually drive and reward and recognize people on how well they live up to those values.\n\nThe landscape has shifted for global companies. Where do you see the biggest challenges and opportunities right now?\n\nIf I think about med tech as an industry, it’s an American gem. Still, 70%-plus of the products are made the United States, the majority of the IP, the technology is here. And so having that protected or enhanced by our government policy is important.\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of time trying to make that case clear and I think, for the most part, it’s been heard. Having global footprints and manufacturing and R&D is super critical because you can’t make everything in the United States to be competitive. You can’t, in a world post-COVID, have an integrated single point of control for all supply chains. Many of us used to say, here’s the least expensive place to buy this, or the best quality, then we would do it one place and ship it all over the world. We found during COVID that’s just not the model that works.\n\nWe’re bringing more and more U.S. products and their subcomponents back to North America. In China, we used to ship in 75% of the products from different parts around the world. Now we make 85%, almost 90% of the products in China, for China.\n\nWhy do you want to be in China?\n\nLook,it’s 1.4 billion people, where 400 million have reasonable. We often forget that. You know, we’re a nation of 375 million people, and you can judge how good our care is. There’s still a billion people in China that don’t have adequate care, and so at some point, it will be the largest health care market. I’m a big believer that, with China and the U.S., the more we work together in harmony, it’s only going to help the world. And honestly, for companies like us, it’s really a necessity for being able to kind of reach our full potential.\n\nYou’ve been at companies that are known as training grounds for leaders. I’d just love to hear your reflections on being in a CEO role the last three years.\n\nI think authenticity is super important. I can be an extrovert when needed, but I tend to be a little bit more introverted. In today’s world, with our younger employee base, being out front and being vocal as the senior leader—not necessarily the charismatic leader, but the communicator directly to individuals—is super important. Social media gets more reads from your employees than even some internal communications. It’s a reality.\n\nI think this ability to reach people in many different ways is critical for running a company. Leaning in on what the mission of the company is, and the why and helping people understand the why, is also critical. And then there’s the classic age-old factor of bringing customers into the story, talking about how you’ve changed the life of a patient. This could be your mother, your father on that table. The more I can empower people to live those values, that’s how we get excellence.",

You can’t snap opponents like Vinnie Jones did, but this long-throw obsession is wild.\n\nAnka: Twelve months of “Absolute Cinema” as the top level of the sport further transforms it into a content delivery machine, overshadowing everything else.\n\nO’Neill: Let it all work out. Let it all work out. Ousmane Ballon d’Or. \n\nFeringa: Blissfully chaotic at its best, pining for something lost at its worst. Also trigger alert: long throws.\n\nMiller: I don’t think I’ll remember much actual football, but I do remember being quite tired and my brain being hammered for most of the year.\n\nMiller: This choice is significantly influenced by the fact that I was there to see it happen, but Cape Verde qualifying for the World Cup. At the time, only Iceland had done it with a smaller population (Curacao have superseded them), but the unfiltered and uncomplicated joy in the stadium that day is something I’ll never forget.\n\nO’Neill: Sunderland making it back to the Premier League through the play-offs in the most majestic, last-gasp way. And then actually being a really good top-tier side. It was a long eight years out of the top flight, which included four weary seasons in League One. But Sunderland have bounced all the way back and then some.\n\nFeringa: All of us making it through the 2026 World Cup draw in one piece and with most of our sanity intact.\n\nJames: Crystal Palace beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup (the first major trophy in their 164-year history) was pretty special — huge credit to their manager Oliver Glasner and the players. But the most magical thing about that day by far was the reaction of the Palace supporters at the final whistle. People, young and old, sobbing in a mixture of disbelief and joy. It was genuinely heart-warming — football touching the soul.\n\nAnka: The Lionesses winning their second European Championship title. England entered the tournament in a transitional state, battled through tricky turbulence in three of their five matches, but still emerged victorious. In the 21st century, the tournament has been won either by Germany or a team managed by Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman is a brilliant manager who is constantly asking us to reassess what we mean by “Good leadership”. She has excellent taste in music, too.\n\nMiller: Scott McTominay. One of football’s great glow-ups — from being a solid, arguably slightly boring, taken for granted 7/10 Manchester United midfielder, to title-winning, hard-partying, cigar-smoking, Pope-meeting, bicycle-kick-scoring, Serie A MVP.\n\nO’Neill: It is always Marta. This year, next year, forever. Oh, and Troy Parrott.\n\nFeringa: Any hero on the pitch is someone else’s villain. But Michelle Agyemang really wore that cape in Switzerland: 138 minutes, two goals, twice seizing England from the clutches of “reigning champions dumped out” headlines. To accomplish it while being just 19 years old and at her first major tournament with England was sensational, not to mention against a backdrop of racist abuse aimed at her team-mate Jess Carter.\n\nJames: Stephen Crean, the 61-year-old Nottingham Forest fan who courageously intervened during a mass stabbing on a train from Doncaster to London last month. Crean had been making his way home from Forest’s 2-2 draw against Manchester United at the City Ground when he was caught up in the train attack in Huntingdon, which led to a man being charged with 11 counts of attempted murder.\n\nForest fans gave Crean a rapturous ovation when he returned to the City Ground for their home game against Leeds United. “It meant the world to me. I could see people clapping, applauding and I just thank them so much,” he said. “I would have been happy with a few quid to go down the pub. I didn’t expect anything.”\n\nAnka: The two biggest games of McTominay’s 2025 saw him score bicycle kicks — one to help Napoli win a league title, the other to help secure Scotland’s qualification for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nI undervalued his talent at Manchester United, and I have spent the year happily eating humble pie while applauding his success.\n\nAlso, a quick word on Calvin Bassey — because I don’t think there’s a centre-back on the planet who is having more fun in the men’s game. The Fulham and Nigeria defender had good moments in 2025 as well as bad ones, but he’s always found a way to crack a smile, cheer up his team-mates and remind us all that football is meant to be a laugh.\n\n“That ball has gone to AFCON before us!” 🤣 pic.twitter.com/emg89MR4nz\n\n— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) December 15, 2025\n\nMiller: It won’t do to overcomplicate these things, so it’s a toss-up between two.\n\nEither Gianni Infantino, who has seemingly spent the year sleeping in a little bed in the Oval Office, like a particularly dutiful dog, hopping up now and then to hand Donald Trump something shiny.\n\nOr Jim Ratcliffe, for… well, claiming to understand the needs of the fans while jacking up ticket prices, making hundreds redundant while squandering millions himself, his undisguised contempt for Manchester United Women — take your pick really.\n\nFeringa: A toss-up between whoever signed off on Sky Sports’ Halo and Joey Barton.\n\nJames: Infantino. Where to start? The farce of the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. Where to end? The absolute scandal of ticket prices at the 2026 World Cup. And there’s plenty in between, too.\n\nAnka: If a series of ghosts had visited Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the cold Christmas nights, it would do us all the world of good.\n\nMiller: Troy Parrott’s miracle hat-trick against Hungary. For not one minute did I think that the Republic of Ireland were going to come back and win that game, but when they did, my word: I can’t remember the last time I so enjoyed a moment for a team with whom I have no emotional connection.\n\nO’Neill: The fallout after Mary Earps released her book or Arsenal Women winning the Champions League. And not forgetting Burna Boy and Sarina Wiegman linking up on stage at England’s Euro 2025 victory parade. That was iconic.\n\nFeringa: Gotham’s victory in the NWSL Championship. Winning it two seasons ago as the No 6 seed — a league-record low — was one thing. But lifting the trophy again two years on? This time as the No 8 seed? That’s silly script stuff that no one believes in until it happens.\n\nJames: Well, I certainly didn’t expect Chelsea to turn over Paris-Saint Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final in New Jersey in July. The way Liverpool’s 2025-26 season has unravelled, including Mohamed Salah’s outburst, was another big surprise. And who could have predicted that Sunderland would not just return to the Premier League but make a real splash. From a personal perspective, Snoop Dogg coming on board at Swansea City as a minority owner was a surreal moment. If only he could play right-back.\n\nAnka: Ajax letting the 2024-25 Dutch league title slip through their fingers. They were nine points clear of PSV in mid-April before a four-game winless run allowed their rivals to snatch the Eredivisie trophy on the last day of the season.\n\nMiller: Chloe Kelly scoring the winning penalty for England at Euro 2025. Even though she had missed a penalty a few days earlier (before tucking in the rebound), there was absolutely no chance she was missing that one. She seems to enjoy those moments of crushing pressure: she is, in the nicest possible way, a freak.\n\nO’Neill: Robbie Williams singing a duet with Nicole Scherzinger at the World Cup draw. Pretty sure I predicted that a year ago…\n\nFeringa: England winning Euro 2025. I really don’t know why everyone kept panicking. You don’t come back from the dead that many times and not win the whole lot. Also, Chloe Kelly is kind of inevitable at this point.\n\nJames: Ange Postecoglou and Nottingham Forest being a brief and unhappy marriage. It was, quite simply, never going to work at the City Ground, which makes you wonder why on earth Evangelos Marinakis, Forest’s owner, and Postecoglou signed up for the 39-day eight-game farce that followed.\n\nAnka: Chelsea winning the Conference League, and I mean that as a compliment. Chelsea are at their most compelling when they turn up and snatch the footballing dreams away from others (ask Bayern Munich fans about 2012), and they did so brilliantly in 2025.\n\nMiller:  Cristiano Ronaldo being let off his three-game suspension for a red card, thus opening the door for him to play in the first two games of the World Cup.\n\nO’Neill: Not letting Robbie Williams sing Angels at the World Cup draw.\n\nFeringa: The decision to simultaneously broadcast most of the Women’s Super League matches for the 2025-26 season at 12pm local time (and then 11.55am).\n\nJames: Steve Parish would like to answer this question. Back in July, the Crystal Palace chairman said that UEFA’s decision to remove his Premier League team from the Europa League, for breaching multi-club ownership rules, is “the biggest injustice in the history of football”.\n\nUEFA’s judgement was harsh but I wouldn’t go that far.\n\nAnyway, with my football pyramid hat on, I’ll always struggle with the idea that being runners-up in the National League, which is the gateway to the Football League, gets you nothing other than a play-off spot. Last season, York City finished 23 points above Oldham after 46 matches. But it was Oldham who won promotion.\n\nYeah, I know — everyone knows the rules at the start of the season. But still.\n\nAnka: The Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final in July saw Nigeria battle from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Morocco 3-2. However, they scored their first goal after the VAR decided Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina handled the ball inside the box, and before the VAR later overturned a penalty that was awarded to Morocco after they believed a possible handball from Nigeria’s Oluwatosin Demehin was accidental. The Confederation of African Football would later receive a formal complaint from Morocco’s federation, calling the match decisions “refereeing injustices”.\n\nMiller: Not the best from a technical point of view, but by a distance my moment of the year was James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser in the final men’s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, followed as it was by some fabulously undignified scenes from the Liverpool contingent and then a glorious, life-affirming singalong to I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues by the Everton fans that simply did not want to leave.\n\nThe latest in a long line of Goodison Park heroes, James Tarkowski 🎬 pic.twitter.com/31v3dCZfQH\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) February 15, 2025\n\nO’Neill: I wasn’t there to watch it live but it has to be the final Liverpool goal from the late, great and dearly missed Diogo Jota.\n\nIt came against Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield in April and proved to be the winner. It was so Jota. Off the bench and on to come up with the goods for Liverpool just when they needed him to. A weaving move and a wonderful finish at the Kop end.\n\nFeringa: I was in the Spanish end for their Euro 2025 semi-final against Germany when Aitana Bonmati scored the winning goal in the dying moments of extra time. The celebrations were visceral.\n\nAitana's turn for the goal 🥵 #WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/WbwTRCbyfJ\n\n— UEFA Women's EURO (@WEURO2025) July 23, 2025\n\nClose second: Jack Grealish’s first for Everton against Crystal Palace. It was pretty grubby. But the limbs. I was convinced I’d be tumbling down the Hill Dickinson Stadium stands and taking at least four with me.\n\nJames: Paris Saint-Germain’s third goal in the Champions League final against Inter was glorious and felt almost symbolic in terms of how it represented their team, their way of playing, and their coach, Luis Enrique. Vitinha was effortlessly weaving beautiful patterns inside his own half before driving forward with the ball, Ousmane Dembele’s backheel was exquisite and then Desire Doue applied the coup de grace. Magnificent.\n\nThe results are in for the best play of the year!\n\nThe winner is… @PSG_inside, with a stunning goal by Désiré Doué in the @UEFA @ChampionsLeague final!\n\nThank you for voting, the fun doesn’t stop here — more games and surprises are coming soon on https://t.co/HPYRKgym8v. Stay… pic.twitter.com/4SVAEDoPZg\n\n— Ballon d'Or (@ballondor) September 26, 2025\n\nJosh Tymon’s volley, for Snoop’s Swansea against Oxford United, deserves a mention too. Postage stamp.\n\nAnka: I prefer my Goal of the Month contenders to be long-range pingers rather than well-coordinated team goals so…\n\nIn real life? Amad’s edge-of-the-box volley to rescue a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest at the start of November. Bonus points for how Matthijs de Ligt dips his neck as it flies past him, as he rightfully understands the strike would have taken his head off.\n\nOutrageous technique from Amad 😱 pic.twitter.com/gmZaBTkG37\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) November 1, 2025\n\nWatching live on the telly? Declan Rice’s perfect free kick against Real Madrid. His continual growth and improvement since the 2019-20 season are remarkable.\n\nMiller: “To be really honest, every time we have a defeat like that, I’m going to be like that. I’m going to say sometimes I hate my players and sometimes I love my players. Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years.”\n\nIt’s hard not to love Ruben Amorim, speaking here after Manchester United lost to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup… while at the same time desperately wanting to give him a hug and tell him to just stop being so honest.\n\nO’Neill: I joined Goal Diggers FC on their march to Wembley in May after the Football Association announced a ban on transgender women from women’s football. One of the people I met was Sammy Rees.\n\n“I spent some time playing men’s football. But it really wasn’t my bag. I felt very uncomfortable and it was not the nicest environment. Then I joined Goal Diggers and I’ve never looked back. It’s changed my life completely. These people have such open hearts. Since coming out, football has been my escape. We (trans people) wake up every day to more disgusting news about us: people vilifying us, people questioning our identity and our existence.\n\n“Football means that for two or three hours a week, I can switch my brain off. I can have a moment where I don’t care about the news. It’s my escape, and the fact that it’s trying to be taken away from us is not fair.”\n\nFeringa: “Sometimes they kill off the main character.”\n\nAnge Postecoglou doled out some dimes during his Tottenham Hotspur tenure, but this, after overseeing the Europa League final triumph against Manchester United, was very prescient.\n\nJames: “It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus.”\n\nSurely Salah’s post-match bombshell at Leeds has to go straight in at No 1 in this category? Elite players just don’t say things like that.\n\nAs for No 2, I’ll go for Amorim’s assessment of his Manchester United team back in January.\n\n“We are the worst team, maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you (reporters) want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and change that. Here you go: your headlines.”\n\nIf only more managers showed that level of consideration to journalists.\n\nAnka: Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy had a bumpy start to life in Scotland.\n\n“People might think I’m an idealist as a person but not at all. I know exactly who I am and exactly where I want to go. And I know at this moment, yeah, my a** is burning! But stay strong and do what you need to do to be better.”\n\nMiller: Manchester United are going to be actively good — not just “good in comparison to the dreck they’ve served up before”. Actively good. I can feel it.\n\nO’Neill: Liverpool do not reclaim their Premier League title but win the Champions League instead. The Republic of Ireland qualify for the World Cup and win their opening match. Tranmere Rovers somehow make the League Two play-offs and are promoted to League One. What do you mean, ‘It’s just me and John Aldridge manifesting all this’?\n\nFeringa: Craig Bellamy will get Wales to the World Cup. Less prediction, more a burning prayer.\n\nJames: Donald Trump will lift the World Cup before the winning captain/Harry Kane* has the chance to do the same at MetLife Stadium on July 19.\n\nAnka: Noni Madueke will finally receive his Club World Cup winners’ medal.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Everton, Nottingham Forest, England, Scotland, Republic of Ireland, SSC Napoli, Premier League, Champions League, International Football, Serie A, Championship, Women's Soccer, FIFA Men's World Cup, League One, League Two, National League\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "title": "'We made 25 jars at a time with six pans on the go - now our business boasts a world's best marmalade'",
    "description": "Nicola Elliott is founder of Single Variety Co, an award-winning premium preserves brand that’s challenging the way food businesses grow.",
    "fullText": "There couldn’t have been any better validation for Nicola Elliott to launch her food business in 2016 than winning a gold award just one month after producing her first ever batch of Seville marmalade. “It gave me the confidence to go forward if the marmalade was that good,” recalls Elliott, founder of Single Variety Co.\n\nShe went one better this year. At the same World Marmalade Awards, her Amalfi lemon marmalade went to the final round of tasting and then scooped double gold and top accolade in an emotional moment for the British entrepreneur. “To do it at the scale that we are making it says we are doing everything right,” says Elliott.\n\nIn the early throes of her single-fruit preserves startup, Elliott was making 25 jars at a time with six pans going simultaneously and two part-time staff, as well as family and friends helping out.\n\nFrom selling her jams on a Balham market stall to owning her production facility, having shunned mass supermarket listings to retain independent quality, Single Variety Co now produces 5,000 jars per week and is set for latest annual revenues of £1.7m.\n\nIt is all a far cry from seven years ago when Elliott received her first export order to Germany for 8,000 jars of raspberry preserve. “I said ‘yes’ thinking I would be making 25 jars at a time. Somehow we did it over six weeks. We didn’t make any money on the order but it was the turning point for us.”\n\nThe business lesson led to Elliott reluctantly outsourcing production for a few years until her husband — a “people person”, former personal trainer and tennis coach — joined the business and the couple moved to Bristol and a £200,000 outlay to set up their jam factory five years ago.\n\nIn her former career as a fresh foods product developer at the likes of Sainsbury’s, Elliott cut a frustrated figure in a role she admits was cost-focussed and in which quality wasn’t a priority. She left her supermarket career to set her sights on a short shelf-life product.\n\n“When you mass-produce, quality has to give way. I was determined to make the quality what we aimed for,” she admits.\n\nAt the time, Elliott noticed that premium jams had champagne added to the strawberries or bay leaves to blackberries and “no one was making just great-tasting strawberry jam.”\n\nIt hasn’t all gone according to plan. Elliott once purchased the wrong second-hand jam kettle, at £12,000, instead of an electric kettle, which her husband still reminds the working mother of today.\n\nNow with a staff of 12, she works directly with UK fruit farmers for her products. These include seasonal limited edition jams such as traditional rhubarb from Yorkshire, which grows in the dark and is picked by candlelight.",

    "fullText": "Just 89 seconds separated Liverpool's two goals in their win over Wolves - but the difference in noise inside the stadium after each was clear.\n\nJust moments after Ryan Gravenberch's opener, Florian Wirtz slotted past Jose Sa to put the Reds 2-0 up.\n\nAs the Germany midfielder wheeled away to celebrate his first Liverpool goal, Anfield did not just celebrate - it roared.\n\nFinally, Wirtz had broken his duck.\n\nIt is 190 days since he joined Liverpool in a deal worth £116m, but this felt a real moment of arrival. The roar was one of both relief and joy for a player who is finally settling into life on Merseyside.\n\nHis assist for Alexander Isak at Tottenham last week did wonders for his confidence and, at Anfield on Saturday, his goal came towards the end of a half where Wirtz was a class above the rest. The creativity on display was clear.\n\n\"The best player [Wirtz] on the pitch by a country mile - the most inventive and the one who is willing to take risks,\" said ex-Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock on Final Score.\n\nFormer England forward Ellen White added: \"There's no doubting the quality that Florian Wirtz has.

There, it will capture waste heat from steel production and directly convert it into electricity.\n\nThe company expects the generator to be 50% more efficient than currently available technologies. Therefore, it also serves as a model for other power plants and industrial applications worldwide.\n\nThis energy development is encouraging because it contributes to the clean energy mix and is a substantial step forward for advanced nuclear technology. It offers high power in a small footprint, making it suitable for spacecrafts, ships, and other confined spaces.\n\n\"The Chinese are moving very, very fast. They are very keen to show the world that their program is unstoppable,\" Mark Hibbs, an expert on the nuclear sector, told The New York Times.\n\nNuclear energy is often misunderstood and controversial, yet it's an important part of the sustainable energy transition away from more polluting energy sources and toward cheaper, clear forms of energy, like wind and solar.\n\nNuclear plants are also known for radioactive leaks and producing hazardous waste. Safety and environmental concerns are valid. However, they still offer a promising shift away from pollution-heavy coal, oil, and gas.\n\nYet, recent developments from the CNNC and partner Jigang International Engineering and Technology Co. are paving the way for nuclear expansion in the country and beyond.\n\nChina is now seeking to scale up its new power-generation systems to deploy them in nuclear, steel, and solar plants.\n\nShould America invest \n\nOnly if it helps us compete with China\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "With Donald Trump expanding the travel ban inspired by his first term in the White House to 20 more countries, as well as the Palestinian Authority, on Dec. 16, a total of 39 countries from different corners of the world now face either a total ban or restrictions on entering the United States.\n\nMali, South Sudan, Niger, Burkina Faso, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority have been added to the list of nations whose citizens cannot enter the U.S. at all, first introduced in June.\n\nAngola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were meanwhile added to a list of countries facing a block on student and business visas; the list that Trump put in place in June 2025 previously included Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.\n\nImmediately after their nations were added to the ban, multiple diplomats and heads of state responded with condemnation. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a statement saying that the Caribbean country's government was \"deeply disappointed\" given that the justification accusing it of loose rules for granting citizenship by investment \"does not reflect the present reality of our laws.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the expansion of the ban, the West African nation of Niger has taken the most drastic step of permanently banning any granting of new visas to U.S. visas in a reciprocal measure until the situation changes.\n\n\"Niger is completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States,\" a governmental representative said to the Associated Press.\n\nA landlocked country bordered by Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger is a Muslim-majority nation with a population of just over 25 million people. In the document announcing the travel ban, the White House said the country has a visa overstay rate of 13.41% for business visas and 16.46% for student ones as well as \"terrorists and their supporters [that] are active in planning kidnappings.\"\n\nWhile a history of war and political instability and coups d'états means that travel into Niger from Western countries remains very low (the State Department has kept it at the \"do not travel\" advisory level for years), the latest move from its government is a major escalation in relations.",

    "description": "I moved across the world for my husband and ended up a single mom. Years later, I met the love of my life when I least expected it.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-one years ago, I faced the difficult decision to move from Spain to the United States with my 3-year-old daughter and 4-month-old baby to follow my then-husband, who had lost his job, in pursuit of a new position in Florida.\n\nI was being asked to leave behind my family, friends, and an established writing career. I was to start over at 41, with no connections, no guarantees, and an already shaky marriage.\n\nMy family thought it was a terrible idea, yet my husband's family felt it was a great opportunity. So, after some soul-searching and many promises of a better life in Florida, I decided to uproot my kids and take the chance.\n\nAs I boarded the plane to meet my children's father (he had come to the US ahead of us), I had mixed feelings: I could feel the excitement of my eldest to see her dad again, but I also feared the unknown. I kept asking myself whether it was really possible that we could fix our marriage and thrive in a different country.\n\nGoing from living in a penthouse in the old part of Sevilla, where I could walk to just about everywhere, to being cooped up in a tiny apartment in a gated community in suburban Florida, where I needed a car to go anywhere, was brutal to my nervous system.\n\nI felt trapped in suburbia without my own car. And with a history of major depressive disorder, I started having panic attacks and depressive episodes. One day, while driving my children to find a preschool for my eldest, I had to pull over to sob.\n\nA few months later, my husband lost the job we had moved to Florida for. And so began one of the most difficult periods of our lives.\n\nIn four years, we moved several times within Florida, always because of his new jobs. I found work freelancing for newspapers and magazines and wrote more books for publishers in Spain. But our relationship was always floundering.\n\nAs our marriage crumbled, we took a time-out under the same roof. We went to marriage counseling, enrolled in self-improvement seminars, and so on. Trust, respect, and admiration had been completely lost, and in 2008, when the Great Recession hit, we had no money, no savings, and no jobs.\n\nI walked away from my husband with my laptop, my books, joint custody of our children, and the huge regret of having moved so far away from my family and friends. But I stayed in Florida, because I didn't want my children to be far from their father. From one day to the next, I found myself a single mother on food stamps.\n\nNearly a year after separating, 16 years ago, I met the love of my life. We had many similarities: we were both newly single, bilingual and bicultural, and had children of a similar age. We were writers focused on creating a better life for our kids and ourselves. The best part was that neither of us had given up on love despite the tough times we'd lived through.\n\nFor nearly two years, we dated long-distance, spending only weekends and holidays together. One of us would drive two hours to meet the other, sometimes with the children, and when the kids were with our respective former spouses, we met alone.\n\nWe were both trying to rebuild ourselves personally and professionally, and together we made a great team. I once again moved for love, but this time with no regrets. Four years later, we married at sunset on the beach, surrounded by our children and close family.\n\nOur kids are all in their 20s now, and we've been through the highest highs as well as some pretty rough times. But our relationship was never in question. We've cheered each other on and thrived together.\n\nWhenever I think of past regrets and how I shouldn't have moved to the US 21 years ago with my ex, I realize I would have missed out on finding true love. And I would never have built the stable and dependable family I always wanted.",

    "fullText": "Merlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 bird species around the world\n\nWhen Natasha Walter first became curious about the birds around her, she recorded their songs on her phone and arduously tried to match each song with online recordings. After a friend recommended Merlin Bird ID, a free app, she tried it in her London garden and was delighted to discover the birds she assumed were female blackbirds – “this is how bad a birder I was” – were actually song thrushes and mistle thrushes.\n\n“I’m obsessed with Merlin – it’s wonderful and it’s been a joy to me,” says Walter, a writer and human rights activist. “This is what AI and machine-learning have been invented for. It’s the one good thing!”\n\nMerlin is having a moment. The app, developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York, which listens for birdsong and identifies the species singing, has been downloaded 33m times, in 240 countries and territories around the world. Britain has the second highest total number of users – more than 1.5 million in 2024, an 88% increase from 2023. Every month, there has been a 30% increase in new users of the app, whose sound identification function was launched in 2021.\n\nMerlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 species around the world, with more birds added twice a year. Different songs make distinct patterns on spectrograms and Merlin is trained to recognise these different shapes and attribute them to a species.\n\nFor latecomers to birding, or those lacking a knowledgeable friend, the app has become their teacher. “My fear at first was I wouldn’t actually learn because I’m outsourcing my understanding of birds to this app,” says Walter. “But that hasn’t come to pass. It’s helped me continue my journey of learning.” Nowadays, she guesses, and uses Merlin to confirm her hunches. “It’s wonderful if you’re coming to bird-watching late and don’t really have a mentor,” she says.\n\nAngela Townsend from Bedfordshire began using Merlin after going on a nightingale walk one spring and being overwhelmed by the range of bird-voices in the evening chorus. She has found it has steadily built up her bird knowledge. “Warblers were just little brown jobbies but I can now recognise Cetti’s warblers and willow warblers when I’m out without having to put the app on,” she says.\n\nMary Novakovich, author of My Family and Other Enemies, is another recent adopter. She has found it particularly useful when travelling across Croatia, where her parents are from. “I love putting a name to a face and a name to the sound,” she says. “It really brings you closer to the natural world, rather than it being disconnected from your life. It’s part of what makes life a joy.”\n\nMerlin is not flawless, however. The first time Kasper Wall, 12, tried it in his Norfolk garden, it detected a northern cardinal and a brown-headed cowbird – North American species not found in Britain.\n\n“I think it was figuring out where we live,” says Wall, who enjoys using it even though he is now an extremely knowledgeable birder. “A couple of weeks ago we were looking at a large group of goldcrest and it came up with a firecrest. I thought, ‘Oh, there must be a firecrest in here too’ and 30 seconds later we saw one, which was the first I’d ever seen. I like it and it’s very good but I wouldn’t say that it’s better than the best people at identifying bird-calls like [the naturalist] Nick Acheson. It can definitely be fooled.”\n\nWall enjoys fooling Merlin with his uncanny impressions of a curlew, barn owl and greenshank.\n\nAcheson doesn’t use Merlin. He welcomes it, but points out it can replace learning. “Anything that gets people out, thinking about and reacting to nature is a great thing,” he says. “But there’s certainly a risk that people don’t learn and just abdicate responsibility for learning to Merlin.”\n\nHe has noticed a glitch where Merlin interprets a certain type of chaffinch call as a redstart, leading to people being absolutely adamant that there is a rare bird in their garden. “There’s no substitute for a real person explaining to you how a birdsong feels and encouraging someone to engage with it emotionally,” he says.\n\nJohn Williamson, who works as a guide for Norfolk Wildlife Trust, has found Merlin repeatedly identifying high-pitched calls as a spotted flycatcher, a bird that is very unlikely to be found in the middle of Hickling Broad nature reserve’s large reedbeds. “Merlin can’t do habitat,” he says.\n\nMerlin has also excited visitors by identifying a golden oriole, a very occasional rare migrant, in Hickling woods, but no one has actually seen the species. Williamson is convinced it is misinterpreting a fairly unusual “catcall” of a female jay, a common woodland bird.\n\nThat said, Williamson finds it a “good tool” and welcomes how it is encouraging new people to enjoy birdsong, and particularly its mental health benefits. He knows one person who suffers from acute anxiety but Merlin has got him out into the world again and into nature, providing a focus for calming trips outdoors. “I find it impressive that an app can empower people to go out into nature,” he says.\n\nResearch has found that birdsong is particularly beneficial to mental health, and has a lasting positive impact on wellbeing. For millions around the globe, that’s exactly what Merlin is doing.\n\n“It reminds you that there are birds knitted into your daily life,” says Walter. “It’s not about, ‘now I’m going to do a bit of birdwatching’, you may simply be walking through the park and you hear something and it gives you a sense that these birds are singing away all the time, even in London.”",

    "fullText": "Captain Ben Stokes says people would raise \"hell\" if the Melbourne pitch on which his England team beat Australia inside two days had been produced in another part of the world.\n\nThe 10mm of grass left on the surface resulted in 36 wickets falling in six sessions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and the highest score by a batter on either side was Travis Head's 46.\n\nWhen asked what feedback on the pitch he would provide to match referee Jeff Crowe, Stokes said: \"Not the best.\"\n\nHe told Test Match Special: \"With 36 wickets in less than two days and no total over 200, I think you can read into that a lot.\n\n\"If that was another condition somewhere else and that happened, you probably would get a pasting.\"\n\nThe all-rounder was perhaps hinting towards the criticism of pitches in Asia that can turn excessively and create short Tests.\n\nWhen it was put to Stokes he was making that inference, he replied: \"Those are your words, not mine.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm pretty sure if that was somewhere else in the world there'd be hell on.\n\n\"It is not the best thing for games that should be played over five days but we played a type of cricket that ended up getting the job done.\"\n\nEngland's victory was a second two-day Test of this Ashes after the series opener in Perth was also done inside 48 hours. This is the first Test series between any opponents to include two two-day Tests since 1896.\n\nIn chasing 175 to win by four wickets, England ended a run of 18 Tests without a victory in Australia.\n\nAustralia had already retained the Ashes by winning the first three Tests, though this defeat denies them the opportunity of a 5-0 clean sweep.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHad Marcell Ozuna not had the season he did in 2025, he likely would be the most sought-after DH in this free agency cycle. However, that isn’t the case, and teams currently view him as a potential risk to sign. The Atlanta Braves attempted to trade him several times last season, but he refused every offer.\n\n“It’s possible that while Anthopoulos was discussing trades, he couldn’t agree on a deal that Ozuna’s agent could also sign off on. Just because Ozuna is leaving the deadline out of his hands doesn’t mean the 10-5 rights go out the window. He could have simply handed over those rights to his agent for the discussions,” SI’s Harrison Smajovits wrote.\n\nWith Ozuna aging and other factors at play, he isn’t an especially appealing free agent candidate so far this offseason.\n\n“The problem Ozuna faces now is that he has only gotten older, his performance last season was subpar at best, and the teams that were previously considered to be landing spots for him feel unlikely to pursue him this offseason especially with how more and more organizations are treating the DH position,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote.\n\nFanSided’s Christopher Kline believes the Cleveland Guardians could sign Ozuna to a low-risk deal, adding protection in the lineup alongside José Ramírez.\n\n“This Cleveland Guardians team desperately needs more pop in the heart of the lineup. Kyle Manzardo made a strong first impression as a rookie. Chase DeLauter and Travis Bazzana are coming behind him as top prospects who can rip it. But even if it's a one-year deal, Ozuna has the goods to protect José Ramírez in the heart of the order and pop a few more dingers than Cleveland fans are used to,” Kline wrote.\n\nThe Guardians won the AL Central last year after a late-season comeback against the Detroit Tigers. Ozuna, meanwhile, just wants to finish his career on a strong note after a difficult 2025 season.\n\nCleveland is a playoff-caliber team that could benefit from Ozuna’s bat and veteran presence in the clubhouse. This type of one-year deal could pay major dividends for the Guardians.",

    "description": "Brian Cox once toured as a keyboardist in major rock and pop bands. Now he’s a particle physicist on a new world tour with a dazzling show he designed in an era of science disinformation and denial.",
    "fullText": "Stefano Montali traveled to Redditch, England, in November to attend a warm-up show for Prof. Brian Cox’s coming world tour.\n\nProf. Brian Cox flashed a wide smile toward the crowd, picked up an iPad, looked up at the enormous screen behind him and started to write out a complex equation. “This is what I call a live math solo,” he said.\n\nThe audience chuckled. Many in the packed theater that night last month in the small English town of Redditch seemed to be in on the joke.\n\nBecause before he became Brian Cox, the particle physicist renowned for his adroitness in explaining the intricacies and magnificence of space, he was Brian Cox the rock star.\n\nHis first professional gig, in fact, was playing keyboards in the opening band on a tour with Jimmy Page, the lead guitarist of Led Zeppelin. His second band, D:Ream, had a song that hit No. 1 on the British pop charts in 1994.\n\nNow, Professor Cox is the star of his own show, albeit one about science.\n\nHe has sold out venues often reserved for sports and pop stars, like Wembley Arena (not the stadium) and the O2 in London. His coming tour, “Emergence,” will take him to places like Singapore, Serbia and Australia, before arriving in the United States in late 2026.\n\n“If you believe, as I do, that science is one of the necessary foundations of society, alongside the arts and politics,” Professor Cox said in an interview, “it has to be there with them on an equal footing.”\n\nWith his geniality, Beatles-esque haircut and a dazzling show that explores black holes, galaxies and the significance — and insignificance — of human beings in the universe, Professor Cox, 57, has reached mainstream audiences, when many scientists cannot.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and popular science communicator, said in an interview that Professor Cox, whom he has known for years, “has a force of rationality, and a force of reason, and a force of science.” He added, “Society needs all three, lest we regress back to the caves whence we came.”\n\nIn an era when science denial and disinformation are common, Professor Cox, who teaches particle physics at the University of Manchester, has sought to make science accessible through Peabody Award-winning BBC documentaries and podcasts, books and appearances on other media, like “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nThis year, the United Nations named Professor Cox its Champion for Space, a role in which he will work with the organization to promote space as a “force for progress.”\n\nAs a child, Professor Cox spent many Saturday mornings at the Manchester Airport, near his hometown, Oldham, England, spotting planes with his father. “I liked the engineering, the big machines,” he said. “The Apollo moon landings, astronomy, science fiction — I wanted to see ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Star Trek,’ ‘Alien,’ all of it.”\n\nEventually, Professor Cox’s interests expanded to include music.\n\nAt 18, he deferred going to university for a year to join the band Dare, founded by a member of Thin Lizzy who lived nearby. The band recorded its debut album with A&M Records in Joni Mitchell’s private studio.\n\nAfter one London show where Dare opened for Jimmy Page, Professor Cox said he found himself having a drink backstage with George Harrison.\n\nEven while touring, Professor Cox read popular science books.\n\nHe left Dare at 23 — after a bar fight with his bandmates in Berlin, he said — to study physics and astronomy at the University of Manchester. He soon joined D:Ream, whose No. 1 pop anthem “Things Can Only Get Better” was later appropriated by the Labour Party.\n\nEventually, he left that band to shift his focus to science. Stints at particle accelerators in Hamburg, Chicago and Geneva followed.\n\nIn 2001, Professor Cox met Gia Milinovich, a TV presenter and writer, whom he married two years later at her mother’s house in Duluth, Minn. The pair started writing documentary ideas “with the sole aim of ‘making science part of popular culture,’” she told The Guardian in 2010. Today, they live in London with their 16-year-old son, George.\n\nStill, the draw to the stage never truly left Professor Cox, who eventually found his way back to it.\n\nThe show in Redditch, about 45 minutes south of Birmingham, was the beginning of a slate of warm-up performances. For Professor Cox, they are a chance to work out new material. The show changes night to night.\n\nProfessor Cox’s enthusiasm is as much a character in the show as the planets and the stars. He kept the audience captivated, even on topics that might seem out of reach, like the origin of space and time or quantum entanglement.\n\nDavid Attenborough, whose nature documentaries on the BBC helped carve out a place for science presenters on television, said in 2013, “If I had a torch, I would hand it to Brian Cox.”\n\nBut the worlds in which Mr. Attenborough first rose to fame and in which Professor Cox works now couldn’t be more different. Disinformation on social media has contributed to a growing skepticism of experts.\n\n“Our instinct, which is a good instinct,” Professor Cox said, “is to say, ‘I want to listen to as many voices as possible.’” Still, he stressed that there needed to be a weighting to people who have expertise.\n\nBut his expertise has been poached by hyper-realistic deepfakes. Days before the Redditch show, several appeared online depicting him falsely claiming that the 3I/ATLAS comet, which was passing through the solar system, was an alien spacecraft.\n\nThe mother of a friend of his was so convinced by the deepfake that she was “starting to hoard things,” Professor Cox said the friend told him.\n\nWith the deepfakes multiplying and looking increasingly realistic, the effort to take them down can feel like full-time job, he said.\n\nEarlier in his career, Professor Cox made light of conspiracies.\n\nWhile he was working in Geneva at CERN on the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, several doomsday theories circulated online claiming the accelerator could cause the end of the universe by creating microscopic black holes.\n\n“My first instinct was to laugh it off,” Professor Cox said. He told the The Daily Telegraph that “anyone who thinks the LHC will destroy the world” is a fool, though he used a word that many find offensive.\n\nIt caused an uproar. “It’s probably my most famous quote,” Professor Cox said.\n\nBut he says he came to understand of conspiracy theories that it’s important to be sensitive that even if people believe in something that isn’t true, the strong emotion that belief can evoke — panic or fear, in the case of the collider — is real.\n\n“If people are getting information that’s saying that there’s a chance that the world will be destroyed,” he said, “it’s not silly to be worried about that.”\n\nHe has appeared three times in the past decade on Joe Rogan’s podcast. While he acknowledges that Mr. Rogan and his guests have indulged in conspiracy theories or denial about climate change and other accepted science, Professor Cox regards the appearances as an opportunity to reach an important new audience.\n\nAt the start of his show in Redditch, Professor Cox appeared in front of a projection of the Charles Bridge in Prague on a snowy night, and he told the story of how the astronomer Johannes Kepler pondered the physical makeup of a six-pointed snowflake. Eventually, the visual zoomed deeper and deeper into one of the falling snowflakes, revealing its intricacy.\n\nAs he stood to the side of the stage in the dark, Professor Cox described how Kepler’s bridge walk, along with Galileo’s discovery of Jupiter’s four largest moons, contributed to a revolution in science — a refocusing away from the reliance on ancient knowledge and toward the modern method of observation and questioning.\n\nThat drive for discovery, Professor Cox said, lies at the center of his show and at the heart of his questions. How do we acquire reliable knowledge? How do we remove our opinion and biases?\n\n“Certainty is kind of a brutish thing,” he said, “it doesn’t really get you anywhere.”\n\nAs for the music world, Professor Cox still has a toe in. He reunited with D:Ream, onstage at the Glastonbury Festival in 2024. And at another event, he said, he was approached by a fan who expressed his awe at a show Professor Cox had done about Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons.",

    "title": "Patience, Sabres Fans – World Junior Success Doesn't Guarantee Buffalo's Prospects A Successful NHL Future",
    "description": "The Buffalo Sabres will have four players at the 2026 IIHF World Junior Championship. But success at the World Junior tournament offers little guarantee prospects of NHL success. While World Junior glory would be great, the Sabres' youngsters need more time and patience to develop.",
    "fullText": "In more recent seasons, the Buffalo Sabres had more players at the annual IIHF World Junior Championship tournament. But it’s a measure of how things have changed for the Sabres that, in the 2026 World Juniors, only four Buffalo youngsters are involved. The leading teams in terms of involvement at the World Juniors are the Nashville Predators and Utah Mammoth, who each have seven players playing. And given where those teams stand in their development, they should have that many players involved.\n\nBut while the Sabres will have less of a footprint on this year’s World Junior tournament, there’s still reason for Buffalo fans to tune in. Whether it’s watching Team U.S.A. players and Sabres prospects Brodie Ziemer, Adam Kleber and Luke Osburn, or Team Czechia's Radim Mrtka, the Sabres will still have plenty of players taking part in this best-on-best tourney.\n\nThe reality of where the Sabres are in competitive cycle means that they should be expecting to have fewer players at the World Juniors down the road. There’s no direct correlation between where a team is competitively speaking and the number of World Junior players they have in any one season, but for a team like Buffalo, the organization needs to be more focused on the present than on the future.\n\nThus, even if the Americans do win gold at this year’s World Juniors and put Ziemer, Osburn and Kleber in the spotlight, when the holiday break is over, none of those players (nor Mrtka) will be immediate difference-makers at the NHL level. And that will be true of the quartet regardless of how things turn out in the next week-and-a-half. The World Juniors has a long history of players who were World Junior standouts, yet who couldn’t make that translate into NHL success.\n\nIdeally, it’s true you want all of your prospects to be needle-movers at whatever level they’re at in any point of their history. But that’s not realistic, and it’s probably unfair to prospects who are still learning what type of player they can be.\n\nFor A Christmas Present, Sabres Fans Need This More Than Anything Else Fans of the Buffalo Sabres could use more than a few presents this holiday season. But there's one thing Sabres fans crave more than run-of-the-mill holiday cheer – they're seeking genuine hope.\n\nRegardless of the hype around them, young players need the time, space and understanding to evolve and grow into the best version of themselves, and that may mean arriving at a level that some observers see as a disappointment. The prospect game is hit-and-miss, and even if the Sabres have some hits when it comes to players representing their homeland, that doesn’t mean those same players won’t be misses in hockey’s best league.\n\nSo when Sabres fans tune in to see how this year’s World Juniors plays out, they have to temper their expectations. This year’s tournament will be on home ice for the Americans, but that could increase the pressure on Buffalo’s three American players. But the best way to test those players is to put their feet into the fire and see how they respond.\n\nThe Time For New Sabres GM Kekalainen To Make A Trade Or Firing Happen In Buffalo Has Already Arrived New Buffalo Sabres' GM Jarmo Kekalainen can't be preaching patience with this Sabres group. Whether it's trading a star player or firing coach Lindy Ruff, Kekalainen must shake up the organization if Buffalo is to salvage their season.\n\nIt’s going to take more patience to see how these Sabres prospects deal with expectations, but it’s their progress once the spotlight of the World Juniors ends that will ultimately reveal more about where Buffalo’s up-and-comers are going to land as professional hockey players.\n\nGlory at the World Juniors would be great, but it isn’t the be-all and end-all. And the Sabres’ growth as a team will mean more to Buffalo fans than even a gold-medal result for the U.S. would be to them.",

    "description": "Hyundai Motorsports co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe just made co-driver round the world proud with his performance at the 2025 Rallye du Pays Vençois in France.",
    "fullText": "It takes a special kind of person to willingly strap oneself into a hatchback aimed at flying through the woods at high speeds. Rally drivers are madmen full-stop, but their shotgun-riding co-drivers are a whole different breed. Don’t discount the amount of driving know-how tucked away in those high-flying passenger seats, however. Hyundai Motorsports co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe recently took the wheel of a Hyundai i20 N Rally2 at the 2025 Rallye du Pays Vençois in France, making fellow co-drivers round the world beam with pride.\n\nWhile you might not be familiar with Martijn Wydaeghe, you have likely heard of his teammate Thierry Neuville. The two have been driving together since the 2021 season, with Wydaeghe co-driving during Neuville’s 2024 WRC Driver’s Championship effort. This year wasn’t as successful for last year’s champs, with Neuville finishing 5th overall in the standings. The results were largely tempered by two consecutive retirements at the Central Europe and Japan rallies towards the end of the season. The pair came back to win the final event of the year at Rally Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile the automaker didn’t put Wydaeghe out in the proper Rally1 machine he’s used to riding in, the Belgian driver made his driving debut in the production-based Rally2 machine. He did previously get a go in the Rally1 car at the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed, however. I’m sure the co-driver-turned-wheelman wasn’t too upset about the more approachable platform for his first go either.\n\nWith co-driver Florian Haut-Labourdette alongside, Wydaeghe pushed the IXO-sponsored Hyundai through the 25-mile rally. His pace was undeniable, with Wydaeghe managing to take home a stage win on his very first attempt. The pair only managed to muster sixth place overall, but fans were more than happy to see Wydaeghe give it a shot. That said, I don’t think Neuville needs to be too worried about job security for the time being. Perhaps the WRC should look at a co-driver shootout event moving forward, though.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

He works in IT and earns about $90,000 a year, while she earns roughly $55,000. He wrote that growing up lower middle class shaped his careful approach to money.\n\nUntil recently, he wrote, their everyday spending had felt manageable.

He created a rough budget covering flights, hotels, trains, food, and tours, estimating the total at about $4,500 for both of them — excluding shopping.\n\nHe suggested that if they started saving immediately, each could set aside about $400 to $450 per month over several months and split the cost evenly.\n\nAfter reviewing the spreadsheet, she laughed and questioned why he was treating the trip \"like a business contract,\" pointing out that he earns significantly more.

During that discussion, she compared him to an ex who never asked her to pay for vacations.\n\nSince then, he said, the tension continued. She made sarcastic comments about money during meals, and later compromise proposals were dismissed.\n\nHe suggested splitting costs based on income, such as a 60-40 arrangement or covering flights while she handled her spending money.

    "description": "My guide dog helps me travel the world as a fully blind person. I don't take it for granted, but the hardest part is dealing with people's ignorance.",
    "fullText": "My life changed when I met Indio, a black Labrador, three years ago.\n\nI am completely blind, and until I got my guide dog, I wasn't able to travel often. Getting around was tiring enough in familiar places.\n\nI used a cane, and encountered tons of obstacles and problems — like crossing paths with people who were looking at their phones. The idea of navigating this in a completely new country sounded like a horror-movie plot.\n\nNow, my dog and I have been to 16 countries together — he's been an important constant in my life as I've eaten crickets in Mexico and visited museums in Germany.\n\nI wouldn't change our journey for anything, but it hasn't always been easy — mainly because of the judgment we face from others.\n\nWhen I travel with Indio, there are so many things I just don't have to think about.\n\nHe'll learn my hotel room as soon as we set foot inside, and help direct me to places we already know if I get lost after a day of exploring. I no longer have to depend on fellow travelers when I'm on a city tour, because my dog can follow a guide independently if I ask him to.\n\nCrucially, I feel like I can now walk around an unfamiliar city without having to worry nonstop. I can simply enjoy the feeling of being in a new place, listening to people speaking different languages around me, knowing that Indio is by my side to keep me safe.\n\nHaving this security has helped me go on adventures I'd never expected. Without thinking twice, I took a four-hour bus ride from Prague and woke up in Vienna with no plan except to explore.\n\nWithout Indio, this wouldn't be possible — and the ability to travel freely is not something I take for granted. Sometimes, though, having him with me brings problems that I wish I could avoid.\n\nWhen I decided to get a guide dog, the first thing many people told me was that I had to give up my dreams of traveling, especially abroad.\n\nSome dogs struggle with changes in environments, and most countries also require multiple types of documentation for traveling with service animals. Plus, I often have to fill out lots of extra airline forms whenever I fly with him.\n\nIn many cases, I also prepare myself for how people — especially those who haven't encountered a guide dog in public — might react when they see us exploring the streets of their city.\n\nSadly, my worries aren't unfounded. Once, I had to miss a museum tour because I struggled to find a taxi driver who would allow my dog in the car. Other times, I've been stopped from entering supermarkets.\n\nPractically everywhere we go, we have to deal with people who don't know how to act around a guide dog — whether they try to pet him at times when it's dangerous for him to get distracted, or they react with fear or surprise at his presence.\n\nDespite the issues we've faced, being able to travel with Indio is one of the most rewarding things I've ever done in my life.\n\nEven when there are snags or setbacks, there are kind, positive moments that restore my faith and joy in traveling, too. I've encountered strangers who were willing to help support Indio and me, even though there was no incentive beyond kindness to do so.\n\nAt the end of the day, I just wish certain people we've encountered would recognize that, for me, traveling with Indio isn't a choice. He gives me freedom and a gateway to a world I never thought I would know.\n\nNo matter what, I'll continue traveling and occupying space — because, despite my limitations, I believe that the world is too big to wait for someone to tell me about it at home.",

    "fullText": "A French report claims that Lazio are one of four clubs interested in FC Metz winger Giorgi Tsitaishvili, who will become a free agent in the summer.\n\nThe Georgian international is a youth product of Dynamo Kyiv, who remains on the Ukrainian club’s books. However, the 25-year-old spent the last six seasons on loan. This includes temporary experiences in Poland with Wisla Kraków and Lech Poznan. He also played in Spain with Granada last season, before joining FC Metz in the summer.\n\nInterestingly, Tsitaishvili’s contract with Dynamo Kyiv will expire in June, so he will be free to sign for a new club following his Ligue 1 experience. The winger has thus far contributed with two goals and one assist in 17 appearances across all competitions.\n\nAccording to Foot Mercato, Tsitaishvili’s situation has attracted at least four suitors, including Lazio, who have already enquired about his availability. Moreover, Olympique Lyonnais and LOSC Lille will be looking to keep him in France, while his international teammate Georges Mikautadze is trying to convince him to join Villarreal, having already played an integral role in his transfer to Metz.\n\nWith Lazio operating on limited resources, a free agent like Tsitaishvili could represent an enticing prospect for Claudio Lotito and Angelo Fabiani. However, the Biancocelesti already have two left-footed wingers vying for a spot on the right flank. So, unless either Gustav Isaksen or Matteo Cancellieri ends up leaving the club, the management will likely focus on bolstering other playing roles next summer.",

    "description": "Top AI researchers like Fei-Fei Li and Yann LeCun are developing world models, which don't rely solely on language.",
    "fullText": "As OpenAI, Anthropic, and Big Tech invest billions in developing state-of-the-art large language models, a small group of elite AI researchers is working on what they say is the next big thing.\n\nComputer scientists like Fei-Fei Li, the Stanford professor famous for inventing ImageNet, and Yann LeCun, Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist, are building what they call \"world models.\"\n\nUnlike large language models, which determine outputs based on statistical relationships between words and phrases, world models anticipate outcomes by mimicking the mental constructs that humans make of the world around them.\n\n\"Humans,\" Li said on an episode of Andreessen Horowitz's A16z podcast in June, \"not only do we survive, live, and work, but we build civilization beyond language.\"\n\nPut simply, world models are AI systems that anticipate what will happen next, much like humans use intuition based on their experience to predict the consequences of their actions. Think of a child who, with no language skills, will learn to understand that if they push a toy car, it will roll.\n\nComputer scientist and MIT professor, Jay Wright Forrester, in his 1971 paper \"Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems,\" explained why mental models are crucial to human behavior:\n\nIf AI is to meet or surpass human intelligence, then the researchers behind it believe it should be able to make mental models, too.\n\nLi has been working on this through World Labs, which she cofounded in 2024 with an initial backing of $230 million from venture firms like Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associates, and Radical Ventures. \"We aim to lift AI models from the 2D plane of pixels to full 3D worlds — both virtual and real — endowing them with spatial intelligence as rich as our own,\" World Labs says on its website.\n\nLi said on the \"No Priors\" podcast in June that spatial intelligence is \"the ability to understand, reason, interact, and generate 3D worlds,\" given that the world is fundamentally three-dimensional.\n\nLi said she sees applications for world models in creative fields, robotics, or any area that warrants infinite universes.\n\nThe challenge of building world models is the paucity of sufficient data. In contrast to language, which humans have refined and documented over centuries, spatial intelligence is less developed.\n\n\"If I ask you to close your eyes right now and draw out or build a 3D model of the environment around you, it's not that easy,\" she said on the \"No Priors\" podcast. \"We don't have that much capability to generate extremely complicated models till we get trained.\"\n\nTo gather the data necessary for these models, \"we require more and more sophisticated data engineering, data acquisition, data processing, and data synthesis,\" she said.\n\nThat makes the challenge of building a believable world even greater.\n\nLeCun, who is leaving his post as the chief AI scientist at Meta at the end of the year to launch his own startup called Advanced Machine Intelligence, has long been fixated on world models, which he says are more competent than large language models because they have common sense, the capacity to reason and plan, and persistent memory.\n\nIn a November LinkedIn post announcing his new venture, LeCun said the company's goal is to \"bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.\"\n\nOn December 19, LeCun said on LinkedIn that he was recruiting Alex LeBrun, the cofounder and CEO of Nabla, an AI assistant for clinicians, as CEO of AMI Labs.\n\nIn a Nabla press release announcing the transition, LeBrun said, \"Healthcare AI is entering a new era, one where reliability, determinism, and simulation matter as much as linguistic intelligence.\"\n\n\"This partnership builds on that shared vision and gives Nabla privileged access to world model technology that will complement today's LLMs and help unlock the safe, autonomous systems clinicians need,\" he added.\n\nPrior to the launch of AMI Labs, LeCun and a small team of researchers were working on a similar project at Meta, using video data to train models and run simulations that abstract the videos at different levels.\n\n\"The basic idea is that you don't predict at the pixel level. You train a system to run an abstract representation of the video so that you can make predictions in that abstract representation, and hopefully this representation will eliminate all the details that cannot be predicted,\" he said at the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year.\n\n\"We're thinking about world models and visual multimodal intelligence. We want to move beyond purely visual systems into something broader — models that understand not just what they see, but how the world works,\" Moonvalley's chief scientific officer, Mateusz Malinowski, told Business Insider.\n\nApplications for world models include humanoid robotics and real-world planning, he said. The company says it is already training robots on its world models.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Malinowski explained the differences between these newer world models and existing vision models, which are used for tasks from facial recognition to object tracking.\n\n\"I'd start with saying that vision model is a very broad term,\" Malinowski wrote. \"If we're referring to text-to-video generation models, from my vantage point, these models can be seen as the first steps for world models. World models emphasize world simulation, adherence to physical reality, long-term consistency of the environment, and action-conditioned generation.\"\n\nThat said, Malinowski notes key differences between the world models being built by Moonvalley and those under development at World Labs.\n\n\"I believe that long-term goals are the same, but we are approaching the problem of world modelling differently,\" he wrote. \"We focus on using video models as first-class citizens, where spatial intelligence is more implicit. In the short term, our approach seems more suited for filmmaking and robotics due to motion and soft bodies modelling.\"",

    "description": "There’s never been just one way to buy software. In ye olden times, if you liked some shareware, you’d mail off a cheque, or call up a hot-line, to get the full version. Later on, you could walk into a store and walk out with a shiny box, manuals, and disks.",
    "fullText": "There’s never been just one way to buy software. In ye olden times, if you liked some shareware, you’d mail off a cheque, or call up a hot-line, to get the full version. Later on, you could walk into a store and walk out with a shiny box, manuals, and disks.\n\nThese were some expensive boxes:\n\nNo one technically had to upgrade, but in a year or so, everybody did, because we wanted those sweet quality-of-life improvements, nicer design, and exciting new features. But eventually every product being continually developed will become good enough for its target market.\n\nWhen that happens, companies (especially the VC-backed kind) now need to contrive new and increasingly stick-like reasons for customers to pay again. From made-for-marketing ‘features’ that suck to use IRL, to breaking compatibility with older versions, to spamming you with marketing notifications and embedded ads. Their relationship with customers goes from symbiotic to parasitic.\n\nOn the other hand, the pursuit of completeness should be an ideal fit for subscription software because, theoretically, steady monthly payments from long-time customers incentivizes stability, polish, and helpful improvements.\n\nSubscriptions are particularly helpful for businesses:\n\nEspecially for solo creators, just knowing that you have ~$3000/mo coming in every month is way less anxiety-inducing than making $6,000 in a good month – but knowing that next month you could just as likely make $1000, or maybe even $0. It’s like being a farmer, surviving at the mercy of good weather.\n\nThere’s also a third reason: Tier or usage-based pricing prevents customers costing more money than they contribute. But unless you’re burning unlimited money generating LLM tokens, the risk of losing money on a web app customer is either basically zero, or very easy to predict otherwise (even over the long-term).\n\nOn paper, subscriptions could be a win-win. But some people, including many readers of this blog, have good reasons to be wary of them.\n\nKinopio subscriptions can be easily cancelled, pricing is grandfathered, receipts are emailed, accidental renewals can be refunded, and there are no cancellation fees or deceptive dark patterns. Many indie subscription apps also offer subscriptions in good faith.\n\nBut a business model that’s regularly exploited by well-known corporations, like the New York Times and Adobe, poisons the well for everyone else. Every time someone gets tricked into signing up for a non-refundable yearly subscription instead of a monthly one, or has to call to cancel a subscription they created online, those bad feelings become associated with all subscriptions.\n\nIt’s hard to have good long-lasting relationships with customers if they’re expecting the worst.\n\nThat being said, I still think subscriptions make sense to offer.\n\nFor most people, subscriptions are as normal as the old boxed software model used to be. And the much lower-cost to entry can be very helpful – especially in competitive markets where customers have a lot of options.\n\nThe onus is on companies selling subscriptions to earn trust by being transparent about who they are, what they believe, and how they’re funded (i.e. what their long-term incentives are). A public roadmap and changelog also go a long-way towards proving they practice what they preach.\n\nEven to non-technical people, paying for subscriptions makes intuitive sense when the product requires a server for helpful things like file uploads, public URLs, and real-time collaboration. But the per-user-cost of running a production CRUD server is basically zero. Counter-intuitively, what you’re really paying for is the considerable effort and expertise that it takes to keep full-featured software running reliably and continuously-improving.\n\nThat’s part of the reason why I increased prices over the years as the app grew in capability and complexity.\n\nFor context, here’s Kinopio’s pricing history:\n\nWhen I introduced paid upgrades to Kinopio in 2020, I did it as a monthly subscription because that seemed like the safe, default model for an app that needed a server.\n\nIn all my previous jobs, there was always a dedicated back-end or sysadmin team that abstracted the server hosting details from the rest of the company. They used complicated sounding terms like load balancing, replica shards, containers, observability, were woken up by pagerDuty, and were eternally worried about scaling.\n\nBut when I dived into that world, I learned that most of the jargon really didn’t matter. The kinopio-server is a simple node.js app with a pretty straightforward MVC architecture. My insecurity about keeping servers up is a big reason behind why the app works offline, or if the server is down. What developers would call local-first today.\n\nIn 2019, I wrote about my early Plans for Kinopio. Where I mentioned that,\n\n“Kinopio consists of two codebases, the client-app that runs when in the browser and the server-app which enables sharing and collaboration. The client is like a cockroach, its tiny, basically free to host, and doesn’t depend on a connection to the server. So if I can’t afford to run the Kinopio server anymore, I can just switch it off and you can continue to use Kinopio as you do now – with all your data intact.”\n\nTwo years later, I introduced the lifetime plan mainly because people kept asking me for a subscription alternative. I’m sure many of them would have still have paid for a subscription, but how long would a rueful customer stay? Would they always be looking for alternatives? Would they still enthusiastically share spaces and recommend the app to their friends and teams?\n\nMy business ‘strategy’ is that a happy customer is better than an unhappy one, and that I’d rather have some money from a user than none. (Relatedly, that’s also why Kinopio offers student/financial needs discounts).\n\nThe lifetime plan is priced at ~3× the yearly price because that was the average churn length at the time. But I think that in general, 3-4 years is a good starting point if you get a nice sounding number that is high enough so that only <10% of new customers choose it, while stilling feeling anchored to the subscription prices.\n\nSoftware designers and engineers regularly build products with original ideas, and choose to make their own jobs harder by increasing code complexity, so that their users can have an inviting, easier-to-use, and lower-friction, time using it.\n\nBut on the financial-side, web-based software companies tend to be really conservative with their business models and choose subscription-only models by default. It’s never even questioned, but I think it should be. Just like with dev work, pricing models can also take on behind-the-scenes complexity to give users a better experience.\n\nLow-variability/high-tail income (subscription MRR) is easiest to plan for, but high-variability/short-tail income (lifetime purchases) is peaky and harder to plan for – but they can work together. If you position and price it right, the ideal customers for lifetime pricing will be very different than the ideal subscription customers.\n\nIt may sound counter-intuitive to give your most passionate users a pathway to never have to pay you again, but especially early on, evangelism is worth more than money. There are plenty of fish in the sea: people who have yet to find, or be recommended, Kinopio and become future customers.",

    "fullText": "Norway is becoming a global leader in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, achieving a remarkable growth in sales of these vehicles. EV sales in the country have increased from just 1% of total sales in 2010 to 88.9% of vehicles sold in 2024. In the first weeks of 2025, this figure has reached 96%, an impressive achievement for a country that has set a clear goal: to become the first in the world to use only electric vehicles.\n\nSwitching to electric vehicles is one of the biggest changes we can make to improve the health of our planet and combat climate change. Electric vehicles are cleaner, with low or no greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the reduction of air pollution and carbon emissions, which are one of the main causes of global warming.\n\nIn Norway, this transition is happening not through punitive measures against internal combustion engine vehicles, but through active support and strong incentives for electric vehicle users. Government policies have included VAT exemptions, lower parking and road taxes, and privileged access to bus lanes. This has led a large number of Norwegians to choose electric vehicles as their first option.\n\nIn addition to financial incentives, the Norwegian government has been investing heavily in charging infrastructure. Many homes and businesses in Norway can now charge their electric vehicles under convenient conditions, removing one of the main barriers to mass adoption of EVs. This has made electric vehicles easier to use and have a longer lifespan for users, contributing to increased sales and adoption.\n\nAnother factor that has helped Norway achieve this is the country's wealth and energy resources. Norway is a major exporter of oil and gas, but it is using these revenues to finance the costs of subsidies and investments in the clean energy sector. Cheap energy from renewable sources such as hydropower and wind power is enabling Norwegians to drive electric vehicles without paying much for energy.\n\nRico Luman, an economist and auto industry expert, has called Norway a “global pioneer” in this area. He says Norway has created a successful model that can help many other countries address the challenges of pollution and climate change by using electric vehicles as part of a broader strategy for sustainable transportation.\n\nIn conclusion, Norway is a shining example for the world. With a phenomenal growth in electric vehicle sales and an advanced supporting infrastructure, this country has made great strides towards a clean and sustainable future. And while many other countries are still far from reaching such a level, Norway has shown that with the right policies and a commitment to change, a cleaner, greener world can be created for future generations.",

The family had planned a vacation to Serbia to visit family and friends, the lawsuit stated.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Delta said that \"the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines.\" The airline added that it will \"review the complaint and respond accordingly in due course.\"\n\nThe filing states the flights were round-trip and business class, purchased through Delta's SkyMiles program, and operated by KLM. The four tickets were worth $8,800 at the time, according to the suit.\n\nRoughly two hours into the flight to Amsterdam, one of the plaintiffs started to feel like she was being bitten by bugs crawling on her, according to the filing. She then realized that bugs were \"crawling on her light-colored sweater,\" the filing stated.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the couple \"immediately\" notified the flight staff and were told to keep their voices down to avoid causing \"panic\" on the plane. The couple took photos and videos of the bugs crawling on the sweater and in the creases of their seats, which were included in the lawsuit.\n\nPrior to landing, the flight attendants urged the couple again not to tell anyone about the infestation because they would miss their connecting flight to Serbia if they did, the filing stated.\n\nA little over a week after the incident, the couple took their children to doctors in Roanoke, Virginia, where it was confirmed that the bites were caused by bed bugs, the lawsuit said. The family was recommended to employ \"bug bombs\" in their home and car, and wash their clothing in hot water, the filing said.\n\nWhile bed bugs are an unusual complaint, this isn't the first time passengers have turned to the courts after a bad flight experience. In September, 16 passengers sued American Airlines after their flight caught fire. Last year, a passenger sued Delta for $1 million, alleging a faulty armrest broke his rib.\n\nKLM did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — On a Christmas Day when the war in Ukraine casts a shadow over Europe, concerns over immigration divide societies, and some politicians fan anger and resentment, Britain’s King Charles III called on people to focus on kindness instead of conflict.\n\nDelivering his annual holiday address from Westminster Abbey, Charles said Thursday the Christmas story of wise men and shepherds traveling through the night to find their savior shows how we can find strength in the “companionship and kindness of others.”\n\n“To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope, of resilience in the face of adversity,” Charles said. “Peace through forgiveness, simply getting to know our neighbors and by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships.”\n\n“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he added.\n\nThe speech, which concluded with a Christmas carol sung by a Ukrainian choir, comes as European leaders rally support for Ukraine amid signs that U.S. President Donald Trump is losing patience with America’s traditional European allies. At home, British politics have become increasingly bitter as Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government struggles to control unauthorized migration and bolster creaking public services.\n\nCharles, the titular head of the Church of England, chose Westminster Abbey as the site of his Christmas Day broadcast to underscore the theme of pilgrimage that ran through the speech. The abbey, known as the site of coronations and royal weddings, is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage honoring Edward the Confessor, an early king of England who was canonized as a saint in 1161.\n\n“Pilgrimage is a word less used today, but it is of particular significance for our modern world, and especially at Christmas,’’ he said. “This is about journeying forward into the future, while also journeying back to remember the past and learn from its lessons.”\n\nCharles and his family made their own pilgrimage on foot earlier in the day to St. Mary Magdalene Church on the king’s private Sandringham Estate, about 100 miles north of London.\n\nCharles and Queen Camilla, along with Prince William and his wife, Kate, and their children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, and extended family walked to the church and greeted the crowds of people after the service.\n\nEvents earlier this year marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II underscored the need to learn from the past, Charles said. While there are fewer and fewer living veterans of that conflict, we must remember the courage and sacrifice of those who fought the war and the way communities came together “in the face of such great challenge,” he said.\n\n“These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth,” he said. “As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.’’\n\nThe monarch’s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The pre-recorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m. London time, when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.\n\nThe speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn’t seek guidance from the government.\n\nThis year’s address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said “good news” from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.\n\nThe king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a “precautionary phase” and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.\n\nThe speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, from the king to his grandchildren, George and Louis and Charlotte, meeting with the public and carrying out their royal duties.\n\nThat included scenes from the king’s historic trip to the Vatican as he works to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe event was the first time since King Henry VIII severed ties with Rome that the leaders of the two Christian churches, divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests in the Church of England, have prayed together.\n\nThe king’s message was clear. Even if some years had passed, there’s always hope to start over. Peace is possible.",

    "fullText": "Northwestern assistant head coach Harlon Barnett has a long list of nicknames ready to use whenever he addresses or talks about safety Robert Fitzgerald.\n\nThe Terminator. The World’s Greatest Tackler. The Face of the Big Ten. The Eraser. The General. The Example. Mr. Consistent.\n\n“He’s going to start forgetting his own name,” Barnett said.\n\nFitzgerald has given Barnett a lot of reason to talk about him in a breakout season that continues at noon Friday in Northwestern’s game against Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on ESPN.\n\nThe redshirt junior goes into the game at Detroit’s Ford Field as the Big Ten leader with 68 solo tackles for a Wildcats defense that fueled their 6-6 regular season. He ranked fourth in the conference with 109 tackles and also had 6½ tackles for a loss, three passes defended, an interception and a fumble recovery.\n\n“He’s maximizing his gifts, talents and abilities that the Lord has given him,” Barnett said. “And he takes no days off.”\n\nFitzgerald’s season, for which he was named second-team All-Big Ten by coaches, comes after three years of working his way into bigger roles with Northwestern. He began with the Wildcats scout team and then played primarily on special teams in his first two seasons before earning more time on defense last year.\n\nThroughout the climb, he focused on the process, determined that when the Wildcats needed him, he would be prepared.\n\n“You’ve got to put the work in, day in, day out, no matter how long it takes,” Fitzgerald said. “But eventually your opportunity is going to come. And when that opportunity came, I knew that I was going to be ready based on all the work that I’ve been putting in for the past three years, on and off the field, in the weight room, in the training room, getting my body right, learning the playbook, studying film.”\n\nFitzgerald’s approach — and his understanding of the value of each day — was developed in part before his time at Northwestern. During his senior year of high school in Dallas, he watched his father, Matthew, fight ALS, and his memories of his dad have shaped how he lives now.\n\nThe Fitzgerald family would have Italian beef and Lou Malnati’s shipped to Dallas for Chicago Bears-Green Bay Packers games. Fitzgerald and his sister, Olivia, were Packers fans because of their mom, Amy, who is from Wisconsin. Matt, who grew up in the Wildwood/Edgebrook area of Chicago, cheered for the Bears.\n\n“He always said that my mom brainwashed me and my sister to be Packers fans,” Fitzgerald said.\n\nFitzgerald said his father was passionate about the work he did as a marketing executive. Midway through his career, he met Mark Cuban at the gym, became friends with him and became the Mavericks senior vice president for marketing and communications, a job that allowed Fitzgerald to be a Mavs ball boy and meet Dirk Nowitzki as a kid.\n\nMatt could light up a room and was passionate about his family and friends, a trait Fitzgerald carries with him to his relationships.\n\nAnd the former Loyola Academy safety loved football, a passion he passed on to his son. Fitzgerald remembers spending countless hours on the couch watching NFL Sunday Ticket with his dad. They would play in the backyard, reenacting Super Bowl-winning drives, making sideline grabs or playing goal-line tackle, the latter game one his mother didn’t love.\n\nFitzgerald said his dad was the biggest influence on his football career, giving him everything he needed to be successful. And he kept cheering on his son even after he was diagnosed with ALS the summer before Fitzgerald’s senior year at Jesuit College Prep. Fitzgerald, an All-State safety and running back that season, would look up into the stands to see his dad.\n\n“I’d be like, ‘Whatever I’m going through — I’m tired out here; I’m exhausted — whatever I’m going through is minuscule compared to what he’s going through,’” Fitzgerald said. “So that kind of drove me in high school my senior year, and I’ve kind of been able to use that as fuel going forward.”\n\nFitzgerald, who is no relation to former Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald, chose Northwestern in part because of his father’s connection to the Chicago area. His grandmother still lived at the time in the same home Matt grew up in. Fitzgerald’s aunt lives in Naperville. His dad’s friends are around and come to games.\n\nIllinois and Northwestern are headed to bowl games: Here’s what to know\n\nBut Matt didn’t get to see him play for the Wildcats. Matt died on July 22, 2022, just as Fitzgerald was beginning fall camp with Northwestern.\n\n“The whole thing changed my perspective on life for sure,” Fitzgerald said. “I don’t take a single day for granted anymore. Just watching the way he handled it and the way he attacked it just really was amazing to see. And it was amazing to see how strong my mom was throughout the entire disease. And it was also amazing how many people showed up for my family. The community really showed up for us.”\n\nWhen Fitzgerald thinks about how he got through that time in his life — getting acclimated at a new school in the midst of losing his father — he said his family helped, especially his mom, who was “the rock throughout the whole thing.”\n\nAnd his Northwestern teammates and coaches helped too. It wasn’t just letting him know they were sorry or there for him. Sometimes it was just acting normally, because he needed that too.\n\n“My teammates just really rallied around me, and they kind of became like 110 brothers that I never had,” he said.\n\nFitzgerald’s freshman season wasn’t easy on the field either as he realized he would be playing behind guys with several years of experience.\n\nHe played scout team for a 1-11 squad before getting a few reps on special teams at the end of the year, which became a redshirt season. But he believed that if he kept working, he could increase his opportunities.\n\nIn his second season, he started on three special teams units and played in a third-down subpackage. By his third year, he made the defensive rotation and started some at nickel for the Wildcats.\n\nBarnett, who joined Braun’s staff before the 2024 season, saw a player who was intentional and diligent with his work. He told Fitzgerald at the end of that season that he probably should have played more at safety, and he saw that message take hold to build Fitzgerald’s confidence in the offseason.\n\n“I saw toughness,” Barnett said. “I saw a willingness to get better. I saw a guy that takes coaching. He’s one of those guys who’s going to do exactly what you tell him. He’s going to take it to heart, he’s going to listen to you and he’s going to apply it. And that’s what you like to see as a coach.”\n\nBarnett, who played defensive back at Michigan State and in the NFL, always tells his players that they need to believe that they are the best player on the field.\n\nRecapping an eventful 2025 for Chicago sports on — and off — the field\n\nFitzgerald said he knew he was meant to be in the starting-safety role after the opener against Tulane, when he had 13 tackles. But his confidence was really in place by the fourth game of the season against UCLA, a 17-14 Northwestern win in which Fitzgerald had nine tackles, including a tackle for a loss. He wouldn’t freak out if he missed a tackle. He told himself he was the best player on the field.\n\n“Then he started playing like that — ‘I’m the baddest dude out here. I’m the baddest guy on the field,’” Barnett said.\n\nFitzgerald had numerous big plays in Northwestern’s near-upset of Michigan at Wrigley Field on Nov. 15. He had a career-high 15 tackles, including a tackle for a loss, and picked off quarterback Bryce Underwood in the fourth quarter, but Barnett got excited about a hit on a Wolverines running back late in the fourth.\n\n“He came in and smacked one of the running backs,” Barnett said. “I am vicariously playing through the players. And so, oh, man, I was so fired up. … And I don’t like Michigan, so that also adds to it.”\n\nRecapping an eventful 2025 for Chicago sports on — and off — the field\n\nChicago basketball report: WNBA players authorize a strike — and ‘Ain’t no Christmas’ for Notre Dame men\n\nKeaton Wagler powers No. 20 Illinois past Missouri 91-48 for the biggest blowout in Braggin’ Rights rivalry\n\nNotre Dame — with 96-game rivalry series vs. USC now on pause — announces home-and-home with BYU\n\nHannah Hildago posts triple-double in No. 20 Notre Dame women’s 110-38 win over Bellarmine\n\nFitzgerald will have one more chance this season to show up Friday against Central Michigan. He said the Wildcats want to finish with a winning record, send their seniors out on a high note and build some momentum heading into next season.\n\nBarnett said in the offseason Fitzgerald will continue to work on his speed and change of direction, on honing his already solid ball skills and tackling and improving his “vision and break” to where the quarterback is sending the ball.\n\nHe expects him to continue to develop his leadership too. Fitzgerald delivered a speech to the team before the Tulane game to rally his teammates and said he is working on being a more vocal leader, which comes naturally after he feels like he has earned it.\n\nThat merit has come this season. Earlier this year, Northwestern coach David Braun said Fitzgerald should be proud of the demeanor and the consistency with which he has played, adding “there’s no one in this program that reflects our values more than that young man.”\n\nFitzgerald has thought about how his dad would view this breakout season, and he knows he would revel in it.\n\n“He would eat this season up,” Fitzgerald said. “He would love to see me. I know he’s watching, but he would love to be in those stands and see me out there, just like I was playing in high school.”",

    "description": "It’s the premiere teenager tournament, this time located in Minnesota!",
    "fullText": "What is it?: Teenager hockey at the highest level being played in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada!\n\nWhen is it?: The games start December 26th, and the medal round begins just after New Year’s Day on the 2nd.\n\nWhere can I watch it?: TSN in Canada, NHLN in the states, apparently TUBI will also have it if you stream your hockey.\n\nWho’s the defending champs?: The United States, who is going for a threepeat this year!\n\nWhy should I care?: Why, you get to see the NHL stars of tomorrow face off for World Juniors glory! Gavin McKenna gets to wow you before he even gets the chance to play for an NHL team! Also it’s pretty inoffensive hockey that people get super wound up over while you’re puttering around the house during the holidays, so there aught to be some good yucks at certain fanbases (read: Canada’s) expense. Also, the relegation round is always a fun treat for those who want to see imperfect, desperate hockey, a personal favorite of mine.\n\nTeam USA: James Hagens, Will Zellers\n\nOne must imagine Sweden happy, because once again they should be set up to be a powerhouse…and it might shock you to learn that nobody is concerned because they have to get past the US and then will have to beat Canada or Finland in order to get the Gold Medal they so desperately crave. There’s just no winning for them unless they win it all, and that will be tough. In the round robin they usually do pretty well, and their roster this year is once again damn good; Sascha Boumedienne, Loke Krantz, Ivar Stenburg, Anton Frondell, with decent netminders in Goos and Härenstam suggests they will be just as good as they usually are. Problem is, we know that. We know they will likely cruise to another Group top or close to it. Then they have to play in the elimination round. Tre Kronor’s biggest issue remains that elimination round play, and who knows if this version of Sweden can survive it. I’m pretty sure they can…they just have to, you know…do it.\n\nSlovakia remains interested in proving they are A) Not Mad about Juraj Slafkovsky’s comments that suggest the federation is indolent, and B) You can ignore their considerable interest in buddying up to the Russian Federation because they’re A-Okay, baby. Slovakia unfortunately does have some issues facing them coming into the tourney: their 2023 class has aged out entirely, and a vast majority of their team is so, so young. In some cases that may benefit them, as there’s less tape on these kids and the ones who they do have tape on are pretty good. For most however…well, they don’t have the same caliber of player they used to in a division where Sweden and the US are, and they usually had a good chance to beat the US up ‘till now. They’re going to have to hope Michal Pradel can hold the fort long enough for guys like Michal Capos, Jan Chovan, and Michal Svrcek can get these youngsters moving like they can. I don’t think they’re necessarily worse than the rest of their division, but I certainly wouldn’t put them any higher than 3rd unless Pradel starts doing 3rd eye goaltending.\n\nHere’s the thing: by all accounts, Germany should be in trouble. Their defense is kind of awkward and not especially noteworthy, and they’re banking on a WHL goalie to be their rock in net. That is a rock I think they could trust in spurts here or there, but maybe not all the way. Why I think they escape relegation this year is that Die Eismannschaft is more offensively gifted than Switzerland; especially up front. Max Penkin, Max Schafer, and David Lewandowski have all found great success this year in Canadian Junior/DEL play, and zee Germans might have something in brothers Timo and Fabio Kose, who play different positions but have shown great flashes of talent against grown-ass men in the DEL. Against players their own age? They may yet shine. Veillard, while I don’t necessarily trust an .890 SV% goalie, is a vet for this squad, and I imagine they will rally around him.\n\nIt breaks my heart to suggest Switzerland may end up on the relegation block this year, I have loved their fundamentals only, no funny business kind of hockey for years, but ultimately the level of talent at the WJC is improving, and so far the Swiss have failed to meet the moment. It stinks especially because they do have interesting talent! They have\n\nAfter Canada publicly embarrassed themselves last year and the year before, The True North appear to have taken a much more humble approach to the World Juniors of casually bringing everyone who is good and available to the World Juniors. Even better, the omissions this year were largely because the Pacific teams that they were signed to still want them to be on the roster, and thus can’t justify assigning them. Even better than that, Group B is about as easy a division as you could ask for if Canada really is as built up as they say they are…which is what I would say, had Gavin McKenna not made it clear that he’s prone to error as much as anyone else, and Sweden doesn’t even have to play Canada until a hypothetical medal round. In general, a lot rides on Canada right now. They’ve been slipping badly over the past few tourneys and have turned “underdog gets first win over Canada” into an almost yearly spectacle. Regardless of how you feel about their place in the sport, Canada in the tourneys that count does not have the luxury of expecting to be good anymore. In short, they need to run away with this one and quickly, or we are once again going to start a dialogue about the decision-making corps for the Red and White (and sometimes black).\n\nFinland’s effort in the early parts of this tournament have always been a bit slow; especially with their proclivity for penalties, so don’t be surprised if they look like they’re in trouble to start out. What they are however, is in a very weird place. They’re without Konsta Helenius; their current premiere prospect of World Juniors age, and as such are going to need to adjust to life without him. They’re not screwed by a long shot, but now they need to focus down on other talents to help them out. In net, as per usual, they will have a murderer’s row of good goalies to choose from; Kim Saarinen and Petteri Rimpinen will once again be their rock in net, allowing talents like Julius Miettinen, Emil Hemming, Matias Vanhanen, and Max Westergard to do what they usually do best; cause a ruckus on the boards, rip off a solid pass, and score goals. Losing Helenius however means they lose a level of dynamism that would have otherwise given them an edge against the Group leader once we get to that point on the calendar. Still, the Finns always find a way to drag teams down to their level, so while Canada might get the edge on them to start, they always find a way to crawl back in and make you regret it. Also, Rimpinen has the coolest pads in this tournament. Bar none.\n\nCzechia has traditionally been an offense or bust kind of team; one that’s free-wheeling and fun if a little chaotic. That chaos allowed them to be Bronze Medalists at last year’s tourney. Is that gonna change? Maybe! Granted, they still have plenty of impressive and fun forwards they can call on to make their brand of frantic and fun hockey work, but now they’ll have an extra hand from the backend; they’ve decided to bring Radim Mrtka, Jakub Fibigr, Vashek Blanar, and Adam Jiricek to the dance, and from the skaters alone it seems like Czechia plans to survive this tourney through blistering offense.\n\nLatvia has the benefit of their upset win over Canada to allow them to survive through this tournament. That’s probably what’s going to get them through this tournament entirely because otherwise Latvia has lost a lot of the talent that made them so special last year. They will have to rely on the work of players who’ve spent a lot of time abroad: Roberts Naudins has been tearing it up for Shattuck St. Marys Prep, Daniels Serkins has been doing great for SC Bern in Switzerland, and of course; the Latvians have their wunderkind; Alberts Smits, who is projected to be a first round pick this year. They do have a team attitude and game plan that usually makes them a lot tougher to play than you might expect, but they also tend to need their goalies to be lights out. Of the three they brought; Nils Roberts Maurins would likely have to play way above his paygrade to keep them in games. Otherwise, their tournament will be as per usual; passionate fans, painful results.\n\nThere are going to be players on Denmark with more middle names than goals this year. Have fun playing Switzerland in the knockout round!\n\nIt looks like this! The games begin on December 26th, and the Elimination round begins on January 2nd.",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Penguins will have two players participating in this year’s World Junior Championships, the U-20 tournament that takes place starting tomorrow, Friday December 26th and lasting through Monday January 5th over in Minnesota. What the Pens lack in quantity will be made up for in quantity with Canada’s Harrison Brunicke and the US’s Will Horcoff both expected to fill key roles for the two powerhouse teams.\n\nHorcoff finished the tune-up games on the first line for the Americans, playing left wing for high draft pick James Hagens. Center depth has been a question mark and potential question mark for the US, it shows where Horcoff is that he’s being used for the national team on the wing, just as where he normally plays for the University of Michigan these days.\n\nSteven Ellis from the Daily Faceoff listed Horcoff among his handful of top performers in that tune-up game against Finland:\n\n#24 Will Horcoff, LW (Pittsburgh Penguins): After scoring twice against Germany, Horcoff looked great again today with a good first-period goal. He does an excellent job of rushing to the net and using his big frame to bully opponents. He also has quick hands, something that very few players his size manage to replicate. Horcoff likely has played his way onto the top line with James Hagens and Brodie Ziemer for good.\n\nThe good news there is that description is perfectly in-line with what Horcoff has been doing all fall so far at Michigan, where he’s emerged as a goal-scoring machine and one of the top prospects in NCAA hockey this season. Horcoff could be on the verge of an even bigger coming out party on the international stage if he can prove himself against the best players in his 18-19 year old age bracket.\n\nThe US plays Germany on Friday at 6:00pm eastern (NHL Network) as they look to repeat on last year’s championship and add a fourth ‘chip within the last six years. The US follows that up with round robin games against Switzerland (Dec 27th), Slovakia (Dec 29th) and Sweden (Dec 31st) before the single-elimination quarterfinals start on January 2nd.\n\nHarrison Brunicke and the Canadians are over in the other group, they will play the Czechs on the 26th to open things up, followed by Latvia on the 27th, Denmark on the 29th and Finland on New Year’s Eve.\n\nEllis did a nice writeup on the experienced Brunicke heading into this tournament as well:\n\nIn total, Brunicke has played 26 pro games between the NHL and AHL over two years. For a player his age, that’s a lot of quality competition and increased speed he has had to deal with.\n\n“Coaches love that at this level,” one scout said. “They know they can count on the guys who’ve played against the best of the best. They’re coachable.”\n\nBrunicke has played a lot of meaningful hockey early in his career. He played in the Memorial Cup in 2023 prior to his draft year and then helped Canada win gold at the U-18 World Championship the following spring. Brunicke even skated in a pair of games with the senior national team ahead of the 2025 World Championship – showing a high level of trust from the Hockey Canada brass. That, plus his NHL experience, has allowed Brunicke to handle every challenge thrown his way so far.\n\n“When you’re in more high-pressure situations, you get more comfortable with it,” Brunicke said. “I’m hoping to bring that here.”\n\nMany believe Brunicke will be loaned back to Kamloops for the team’s WHL playoff push after the tournament. Others think the 6-foot-3 defender would benefit more from playing against men in the NHL. Regardless, he needs playing time – and he’s set to get a lot of it for Canada.\n\n“I’m still trying to build that pro style of game, where it’s strictly hard defense, where you’re moving the puck and moving your feet, less risks,” Brunicke said. “That’s what I’m trying to bring here.”\n\nParekh is projected to be Canada’s No. 1 right-handed defender. That’ll leave Brunicke on the second pair, where he’ll still be able to eat heavy minutes as he did in Kamloops. Canada has a strong contender this year, and Brunicke is expected to be a leader, especially with his NHL experience.\n\nBrunicke has played just five games over the past month, all coming in the AHL. The native of Johannesburg, South Africa had four points in that span, showing a high level of puck proficiency. On the surface, going from playing against men and adjusting to junior hockey sounds easy. But there’s a real adjustment, especially from a tempo perspective.\n\nBrunicke is ready for the challenge.\n\n“Whatever position I’m put in, whatever role, I’m ready to execute it,” Brunicke said. “I’m a two-way defenseman, playing hard defensively and getting to show my offense as well. I want to be a reliable defenseman who can eat minutes.”\n\nAfter a fall mostly spent watching or practicing, Brunicke should certainly get all the chances he can handle in this venue where he is one of the most experienced players. Team Canada looks stacked with talent, they’ll need a veteran like Brunicke to help guide them along.\n\nThe fun for the Pens will be what looks like the annual, inevitable collision between the US and the Canadians, which will just so happen to feature Pittsburgh having one of the top American forwards and Canadian defenders. That won’t happen until early in the new year with the group format, but one that would be very closely monitored in Western PA.",

    "description": "Peter Thiel has been described variously as ‘America’s leading public intellectual’, the ‘architect of Silicon Valley’s contemporary ethos’ or as an ‘incoherent and alarmingly super-nationalistic’ malevolent force.

    "fullText": "Peter Thiel has been described variously as ‘America’s leading public intellectual’, the ‘architect of Silicon Valley’s contemporary ethos’ or as an ‘incoherent and alarmingly super-nationalistic’ malevolent force. The PayPal and Palantir founder, a prominent early supporter of Donald Trump, is one of the world’s richest and most influential men. Throughout his career, his principal concern has always been the future, so when The Spectator asked to interview him, he wanted to talk to young people. To that effect, three young members of the editorial team were sent to Los Angeles to meet him. What follows is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nWILLIAM ATKINSON: Following Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York, an email that you sent five years ago has gone viral. You argued that with accumulating student debt and housing costs, it was no surprise that young people were turning to socialism. How do you explain that there are Gen Zs, like us, who aren’t on the left?\n\n‘The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing. America is no longer a great country’\n\nPETER THIEL: My sense is that in the US, Britain, Germany and France, the Gen Z voters are less centrist. I wouldn’t say they’re more drawn to the extremes, but they do not believe there are solutions within the Overton window straitjacket, the narrow space that’s been defined between New Labour and the Tories [in the UK] for the past three decades. And then there’s Reform, a party that repudiates that spectrum. For the first time in 200 years, there’s a real party to the right of the Tories. It’s not just a Gen Z phenomenon, but there’s a Gen Z part that is very important.\n\nWE: You first argued in the late 2000s that the backlash from globalisation would upend politics. Do you often feel that the world is catching up with Peter Thiel?\n\nPT: These things were coming for a long time. Student debt was $300 billion in 2000, around $2 trillion today. The GFC [global financial crisis] in 2008 was a big watershed. Entry-level jobs became less well paid. For students graduating after 2008, it became much, much harder to get out of the debt. Student debt slows you down from buying a house, getting started with forming a family, becoming an actual adult. You end up with a completely different society. It takes a long time to figure this out. But I started talking about this a lot in 2010… Why did house prices go up so much faster than incomes? Not enough was built. A big part was built as a retirement vehicle for older people. They were happy with the prices going up. The Tory party in the UK is probably completely past the point of no return. The suggestion that I have had was that you must start by throwing everybody out of the party who comes from real estate. You must be willing to purge all the people that are part of this dysfunctional system.\n\nJOHN POWER: What would your advice be to someone in their twenties about how they can have an impact in politics? Should they join Reform?\n\nPT: I think about politics a fair bit, but if I spent all my life on it, I would go out of my mind. I would like people to be more involved in right-wing politics, but I’m not sure that’s the best thing for most. You certainly should work for Reform rather than Labour or the Tories. You can criticise Nigel Farage as too much of a Boomer but he’s less structurally hateful to the young people. But maybe this is not the right way to frame the questions. We’re gonna have a revolution from Gen Z – all these crazy things that they are going to be doing. Is this good or bad? I’ve often said, in the early 20th century you think of both communism and fascism as youth movements that went very, very haywire. In the early 21st century, the reality is we have inverted demographic pyramids. There are not enough young people. We’re not going to get youthful communism or youthful fascism. We have this unbelievably oppressive, powerful gerontocracy. Maybe you can get communism or fascism of old people, but it’s very low-energy. It will avoid some of the defects of the early 20th century.But it’ll have many other kinds of problems. The general challenge for Gen Z is that there are big constraints.\n\nMy hope is that there always are some technological fixes, defining technology as doing more with less. If the debate is more with more spending or less with less spending, you end up with runaway deficits or extremely cruel rationing. I have critiques of the three biggest European countries – Germany, France and Britain. France is way too socialist. That doesn’t work. Germany is just insane. People have got caught up in crazed ideological fixations. There’s almost nothing like the Green party anywhere outside of Germany. Britain is neither too insane nor too socialist, but it’s extremely unpragmatic. It is extraordinary how lacking in common sense it is. The optimistic case for the UK is that there are extraordinary efficiencies one could wring out of the state. It has the greatest room for improvement of any European country. But why haven’t these things been done in the past 60 or 70 years?… Maybe the entire population is just too docile.\n\nLARA BROWN: You’ve talked before about Europe’s choice between ‘Greta on a bicycle’ environmentalism, Chinese surveillance and radical Islam. Would you say Europe has chosen one path?\n\nPT: The bad doors for Europe, the three doors of the future. For the future to have power as a cultural or political idea, you want it to be different. You can’t stay in this Groundhog Day, this Tory/Labour thing where we’re never doing anything new. The problem is the three actual pictures of the future. Behind door number one is Islamic sharia law. Behind door number two is the totalitarian CCP surveillance state, a hi-tech dystopia. Behind door number three is Greta with a bicycle, and then there’s no fourth door. This is why Greta’s been winning.\n\nJP: A lot of people on the American right talk incessantly about how terrible Britain and Europe are in general. But I think there’s selective blindness and chauvinism from some people on the American right about the condition of their own country. There is nowhere in Europe as bad as Skid Row in Los Angeles. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I would defend the Trump version of the Republican party vs the zombie Reagan-Bush era. I don’t think President Trump or J.D. Vance are absurdly optimistic or panglossian about things. Make America Great Again was the most pessimistic slogan any president had in a century, and certainly that any Republican president ever had. The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing, because the red pill is that America is no longer a great country. But you have to make sure it doesn’t become a gateway drug to a black pill, where you become nihilistic and give up and you’re destined to eat too many doughnuts in a trailer park. I don’t think that the right are overly optimistic in America. I don’t think there’s a problem where people describe things as even worse in other places. People in the US don’t pay attention to the world at all. We are a semi-autistic country. Maybe not quite as autistic as China, but we do not think about anything going on outside this country that much.\n\nLB: You mentioned the UK has undergone 70 years of stagnation. Many on the British right would agree, but may think that the period from 1979 to 1990 under Margaret Thatcher offered a respite from decline – she pursued unpopular but necessary policies such as anti-inflationary measures despite employment implications and her approach to the Unions. Would you question this narrative?\n\nPT: Reagan was very formative for me. I was in eighth grade in 1980 when Reagan got elected and felt at the time he was an incredibly great president and had solved all these problems once and for all. I think if I lived in the UK under Thatcher, I would have felt similarly. But they weren’t durable. We got Clinton and Blair after. The size of government didn’t shrink that much. The government sectors didn’t get weakened.\n\n‘Capitalism didn’t increase inequality but globalisation did’\n\nThere’s been a slowdown in tech since the 1970s. There was progress in the world of computers, internet, mobile, crypto, maybe now AI, but in a lot of other areas there was a much slower kind of progress. The question is, why did we not notice this faster? I think it’s because Reagan and Thatcher created a big lift. They made societies more capitalist by lowering marginal tax rates and deregulating. Lots of people got fired but the economy grew so most people ended up better off.\n\nReagan and Thatcher were exactly right for their time. But it wouldn’t work for all time. And to the extent that this distracts us from these science and technology questions, then it was somewhat problematic.\n\nThen there was the Clinton-Blair one-time fix, which was that you could somehow grow the economy and increase productivity through globalisation. That also probably gave you a big one-time lift. It came with very big long-term problems. It led to far more inequality. The Gini coefficient in the US went up more under Clinton than any other president post-1945. So capitalism did not increase inequality, but globalisation did.\n\nMy telling of the 50-year economic history is that we tried more capitalism with Reagan and Thatcher and it was the right thing to do. More globalism with Clinton and Blair was sort of the right thing to do, though it had more negative externalities that people were very dishonest about. We now need to do something very different.\n\nLB: Helen Andrews recently posited that feminism and gender-balance initiatives in the early Noughties led to a ‘Great Feminisation’. She claims this caused the prioritisation of safety over risk, a workplace culture dominated by consensus and appeals to emotion rather than logic in decision–making. How much do you buy into this as a theory of stagnation?\n\nPT: I think it’s very courageous of her to tackle something that is relatively taboo… Yes, I think there was a shift towards a risk-averse society. Feminisation was part of that. Things also went wrong with educational institutions or too much regulation. The deeper cause is that there was something dangerous and scary about where a lot of science and technology had gone.\n\nLB: Are you saying that diversity and inclusion efforts were an attempt to derail technological progress?\n\nPT: I think at some point people got very scared of where this stuff was going. Absolutely. It wasn’t just the nuclear thing. I would say that environmentalism as a movement was very focused on the dangers of limitless progress, even though in theory, you could have a lot of forms of environmentalism that would be pro-tech, right? If you’re concerned about climate change, we could build lots of new nuclear reactors that don’t emit carbon. But if we’re worried that nuclear reactors could be dual use and used to make nuclear weapons then you can’t do that. In some sense the energy shifted into this very anti-tech, anti-science direction for the past 50 years or so.\n\nLB: And you think DEI was a good way to achieve anti-tech goals?\n\n‘We’re going to end up with this really lame world where nothing happens but it’s maybe harder to blow up’\n\nPT: It’s always hard to know how intentional these things were. Diversity can function in an anti-tech way. If diversity really means homogenisation, let’s apply that to scientists. There’s no heterodoxy allowed, no heterodoxy on climate science, no heterodoxy on evolution, no heterodoxy on vaccines, on masks, on the origin of Covid. Everyone looks different but has to think alike. So diversity means conformity. And conformity is not compatible with science. And if diversity is a shibboleth, which I think is its important meaning, then we’re worshipping this god called diversity. It’s an unknown god. It’s a hypnotic magic trick that redirects our attention. And so we don’t care about science any more.\n\nJP: You seem to have a wider picture of American history, particularly in regard to wokeness. Many MAGA-adjacent people seem to think wokeness, or ‘cultural Marxism’, came from nowhere in the early 2010s, while you have identified before that it is a postwar phenomenon.\n\nPT: The culture wars are important. And there are ways in which there’s a side that’s right and there’s a side that’s wrong. But the big problem is that’s distracting us from things like housing or the economy generally, or science and tech or maybe even the CCP takeover of the world. This is where I push back against using the term ‘cultural Marxism’. I always think Marxism was at least about the economy. The focus on identity politics, multiculturalism, affirmative action, starts in the 1970s. That’s when inequality starts to go up. These things were at least correlated with us getting distracted from what I consider to be more important problems.\n\nJP: There are parts of the American right who now look at the changes of the 1960s, such the Civil Rights Act, and think it’s time to re-evaluate the postwar social consensus. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I don’t think you can ever strictly go back. There are three questions about the history going back to the Helen Andrews piece or my stagnation thesis. First, there’s a question of what happened. Second is a question of why it happened. Then there is a very different question of what should be done now. That’s in some ways very different from the first two. Even if we can agree there’s been stagnation, even if we say the society became too feminised or too risk-averse, we don’t want to just get blackpilled from that. And then the question is: where are the places that you have some agency to get out of this straitjacket?\n\nWA: Are you optimistic that that’s happening? And do you think you’ve contributed towards it?\n\nPT: Somewhat, and very much yes.\n\nLB: Earlier you alluded to three doors we can go through: radical environmentalism, sharia law, or Chinese-style authoritarianism. If none of us wants to go through them then what’s the way out?\n\nPT: It’s a challenge on a political level because when you’re trying to win elections it ends up being about broader narratives. For people in Silicon Valley, in a way it’s more local. You can build a company and solve particular problems in that context. Silicon Valley turned out to be a big place where there was a moderate amount of freedom of action in the past few decades, although it wasn’t a panacea. There’s a part of me that thinks that for some problems you have to go through politics. If we’re going to come up with new cures and new types of nuclear power you have to somewhat deregulate the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] and the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission]. Some of these things are entangled with politics. But a lot of progress has happened that is decoupled from politics. One of the things that’s still healthy about the United States, unlike Britain and France, is that the political capital, the financial capital, the technological capital are all in different places, so it is very decentred. There are places where these things overlap, but there’s some way where people are able to do things that are independent.\n\nJP: Is tech going to come to the rescue like the Eagles [in Lord of the Rings], deus ex machina, providing abundance that can kind of smooth over some of the economic challenges? And as a rejoinder to that, do you think the AI bubble is about to pop?\n\nPT: There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution. It seems to be very concentrated on bigger companies, so it’s possible a lot of the returns are captured by a few companies, possibly leading to very uneven growth. While it may be a complement to human labour, it is probably more of a substitute than a complement. It will have a zero sum feel to a lot of people. At the same time if there is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it. I don’t think it’s big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\n\n‘There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution’\n\nOn the question of whether or not it is a bubble, I get asked this a lot by Europeans and that is how you know that they’re not going to build a lot of AI in Europe. If it’s a bubble, then people are spending too much money on AI, and they’re building too many data centres and buying too many chips, and you’re eventually going to get seriously diminishing returns on that. During the 1990s bubble, it was mainly the telecom fibre-optic infrastructure stuff where people really spent way too much and that had to get dialled back. But maybe it’s the other way around where there are high returns to AI, enabling the automation of certain workflows and enhanced productivity.\n\nIf the AI bubble does not burst, it’s possible that it ends up being quite inflationary because you have to use more power for these data centres. The atoms part of our economy is regulated and it’s hard to ramp up the power. But if the returns on power going to AI chips are really high, it will absorb a lot of energy. Interest rates could be higher because there’s more demand for capital. My macroeconomic placeholder is that it’s going to keep going.\n\nI’ve been allergic to AI for a long time because it can be a horrible buzzword. There was a 2016 report during the Obama administration on AI by the National Science and Technology council. If you did a search and replace, and replaced every use of the word AI with computers, it would have read the same way.\n\nAI also meant all these really different things over time. In 2014, [Nick] Bostrom defined it as machines being way smarter than humans. Kai-fu Lee wrote the CCP counterpoint AI Superpowers in 2017, where he defined it as this sort of low-tech, big data machine learning. Then in 2022 it turns out the AI revolution is LLMs [large language models] which can pass the Turing test. People had thought this would be what AI was for 70 years. So in the decade before we were about to pass the Turing test we had forgotten about it.\n\nThe dynamic when one has to think through a lot \n\nIf you look at the ratio of how many businesses there are per 100,000 people: what part of the US has the lowest number of businesses? Silicon Valley. That’s because the costs of business are higher, so these subscale businesses that are too small to go anywhere are even harder to get started. In a third-world country where there are no good businesses and everyone is an umbrella salesman, they are very entrepreneurial, but not in a scalable way. So you need to differentiate entrepreneurship from scalable businesses.\n\n‘If you’re too focused on history, you don’t pay enough attention to the future’\n\nThere’s this economist called Thomas Gür who has researched the idea that immigrants are more entrepreneurial. While that is correct, you have to adjust for the quality of the businesses and the immigrants start businesses by starting a taco truck because there’s nothing else you can do. It’s better than going on welfare. But that’s what you do when you’re not really part of a society. It’s better than nothing, but what you really want to do is scale.\n\nJP: Is there a cutting-edge domain that you would focus your energies on?\n\nPT: One of the lines we had in Zero to One [Thiel’s 2014 book about startups co-written with Blake Masters] is from Anna Karenina. It’s the opening line: ‘Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’ The opposite is true of business. All failed businesses are more or less alike because they fail to escape from this problem of homogeneous competition. They didn’t do anything special. All successful businesses are special in their own way. That’s the closest I can give you to a formula and it’s incredibly hard to figure out what that is, or how to do it. I have some feel for it, I know it when I see it.\n\nTo wrap things up, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the past. That’s because it’s important. It’s how we got here. It’s what shaped a lot of these debates. At the same time, there’s also some limit to history. If you’re too focused on it, you don’t pay enough attention to the future. The point is not just to reflect on the past.\n\nThere was a medieval play on the Antichrist from 1160 or so, Ludus de Antichristo. It’s not a very good literary production, but there are these three kings, the Antichrist conquerors who focus on things like nationalism or their countries or their history. They lose because they’re too fixated on the past whilst the Antichrist is thinking about the future, and about what can be done. They don’t see Antichrist coming. So while it’s very important for those on the right to think about the past, to think about the history and what happened – they still should not lose sight of the future.",

    "title": "Researchers sound alarm on Chinese EV batteries after studying them in 'real-world practice': 'Extremely high failure rates'",
    "description": "\"They know exactly what they're ordering.\"",
    "fullText": "A European electric vehicle battery repair shop is warning that certain Chinese packs in popular Tesla models do not hold up to the rigors of use.\n\nEV Clinic reported that Model 3 and Y vehicles with LG NCM811 batteries from the LGES Nanjing factory \"show extremely high failure rates.\" It noted that while cells made in China are often touted as \"the best,\" this assertion \"has never been confirmed in real-world practice.\"\n\nIt compared the batteries to American Panasonic NCA packs, which last noticeably longer and even start their lifespans on a better footing. EV Clinic said that most of the LG models it tested had multiple cell failures that were not repairable. This happens at around 250,000 kilometers (155,343 miles) of use. The Panasonic models featured repairable single-cell failures after 400,000 km (248,548 mi).\n\n\"For reference, a healthy Panasonic cell typically shows ~10 megaohms, while a new LG Nanjing cell starts around 28 mΩ. A failing Panasonic cell reaches ~28 mΩ, which is what LG cells measure when brand new,\" EV Clinic stated.\n\nIn a conversation on the social platform X about the news, users wondered whether the \"bad\" batteries were in their EVs and how many makes and models were affected. The part number in question is 17000012-00-B.\n\nThe company added that it had tested more than 40 units across three shops and that because Tesla's first produced pack was such a \"disaster,\" the \"failure rate will be even more present\" over the next two years.\n\nThis is, of course, unwelcome information for people who have EVs with LG batteries. It may also give potential buyers pause, even though EVs save drivers money by eliminating the cost of gas and reducing maintenance requirements. While EVs feature battery warranties, no one wants to go through the hassle of replacing such an important component relatively soon after buying a vehicle.\n\nLG, which is based in South Korea, has a history of similar problems, too. In 2021, it had to pay General Motors $1.9 billion for defective batteries in the Chevrolet Bolt. This year, it recalled half a million stoves, also because of fire risk.\n\nIn its report, the Croatia-based EV Clinic said the best lithium-ion cells are made in the United States and Europe, naming Panasonic, LG Chem, and Samsung SDI. It noted that customers could get a repair check for 1,200 euros ($1,412), while a repair would cost 5,500 euros ($6,473). It recommended swapping in a used Panasonic battery as the optimal solution for a faulty pack, which costs 8,000 euros ($9,415).\n\nOn X, plenty of folks implored the institute for details, with one asking: \"How can you drop a bomb like this and don't explain with extreme precision which cars are concerned (model, version, year and factory)? Every 3/Y long range and perf owners are now worried and don't even know which battery pack they have.

Whether you’re surviving harsh environments, building sprawling systems, or just chilling and catching fish, the online co-op games on this list will keep you and all your friends hooked and coming back for more. If you're looking for a cozier setup, check out our best couch co-op games list.\n\nPlayed online with friends, Divinity: Original Sin 2 becomes less about obsessively optimizing builds and more about reacting together to a world that’s constantly responding to your choices. It sounds cheesy, but if you want a game where you can create actual shared stories and feel like your actions impact an entire world, get your mates downloading Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\nThe game’s strength lies in how much freedom it gives you all. Quests rarely have a single solution, and disagreements about what to do next are only a sign that you're properly invested. Whatever you do, the game adapts, and the group adapts with it. Combat is turn-based, which gives everyone time to think and discuss/argue over the best plan. Outside of combat, exploration also feels pretty communal if you lean into it, with players splitting up to investigate different areas and then regrouping with new ideas. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a long game, but one that rewards groups willing to commit to a shared adventure--one of you can even be the Game Master if you'd like. There's a new Divinity game coming out at some point, too, so keep your eyes peeled and dig deep into the lore so you don't get left behind.\n\nValheim is one of those games that is almost always better in co-op than played alone. Fans make a lot of noise about the deep exploration and survival mechanics (rightly so), but its base building is another example of where online co-op really shines. Building a settlement together turns the game into a long-term group project, where everyone contributes in their own way. Watching a base slowly grow from a rough shelter into a functioning village is deeply satisfying, and who doesn't want to build a massive Viking longhouse?\n\nThere’s also a comforting rhythm to games like Valheim. Log in, check what needs fixing, expand a wall, add a roof, and then head out together for the next goal. The game supports both focused teamwork and casual hanging out, making it ideal for groups that want something flexible but meaningful. Why not grab some Valheim mods while you're at it?\n\nPhasmophobia is half co-op, half creepy chaos, and by far one of the best horror games on Xbox. It’s a game where communication isn’t just helpful, it might just save your life. Playing with friends transforms what could be a terrifying solo experience into a tense but often hilarious group effort. Just seeing how your nearest and dearest react to jumpscares in real-time is always a treat.\n\nThe aim of the game is to investigate paranormal activity using a selection of tools and finding evidence. Each investigation in Phasmophobia becomes a shared puzzle between four minds, as you split tasks, compare evidence, and constantly relay information over voice chat. Successes and failures feel communal, and the stakes only get higher as the hauntings get more intense. On the up side, shared responsibility makes it easier to laugh about afterward, even if you were shrieking with very real fear in the moment.\n\nGreen Hell is the survival game you recommend to both your novice and veteran friends. Accessible and challenging all at once, the more support you have, the more manageable the challenges become. Green Hell's online co-op turns the jungle from an overwhelming threat into a shared challenge.\n\nSure, you can go out with weapons and stake a claim to the ground, focusing on combat and conquest, or you can raise animals in wooden holding pens, nurture crops, and build--dare we say, cozy--shelters for you and your comrades. Despite including a number of real-world survival techniques and some genuinely challenging hostile encounters, Green Hell isn't too punishing when you've got a group around you to scout, scavenge, defend, and farm your new home.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWebfishing is a little different than most games on this list, but a worthy addition nonetheless. It's a low-key, low-stakes, low-poly chill out zone, where you and your friends can customize animal avatars, go fishing, chat about life, and explore. It's a space for conversation and de-stressing, a great alternative to a group chat, especially if you don't mind periods of silence and relaxation.\n\nOver time you acquire better equipment, new threads, and the ability to catch better fish. Show off your catches, sell them, or merely explore. There are a few secrets hidden in the game that might cause a spark of excitement, but we'll not spoil too much here.\n\nDon’t Starve Together is the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, a game full of harsh wildernesses, strange creatures, and deep mysteries. The game’s uncompromising world is much easier to navigate when mistakes are made--and learned from--together, either with friends in a private server, or with strangers online.\n\nThis one should be an easy sell to friends who aren't sure about survival horror, as Don't Starve is also a game like Minecraft in that you can mine, craft, explore, and gather resources to make a communal base. Just don't mention what happens in the dark.\n\nFactorio is co-op at its most collaborative. It’s a game about building systems, and playing online turns those systems into group efforts that constantly evolve--it's like getting a job in a factory, except you don't get paid and it's actually fun.\n\nEach player can take ownership of part of the factory, but nothing exists in isolation. Changes ripple outward, encouraging constant communication and coordination. Planning becomes a shared activity, often involving diagrams, discussions, and occasional redesigns. Only enlist your smartest, most strategic friends.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic is a great gateway horror game for when you don't want something too scary, easing you and your friends into a slightly spooky experience that requires focus and commitment to survive. Missions are designed so that players naturally rely on each other’s strengths, making co-op feel purposeful and fun, despite the horrors that persist.\n\nEach class contributes something unique, encouraging loose communication without forcing strict coordination. Deep Rock Galactic strikes a balance between structure and flexibility, letting groups play casually or strategically, and employs its light-hearted tone to keep things flowing even when the going gets tough.\n\nTerraria in co-op feels like a shared sandbox adventure, a story only you and your friends could have written. Online play turns simple exploration and building into group projects that evolve organically, battles that require backup, and bases worthy of Terraria's most elaborate decor.\n\nYou'll naturally split tasks--some of you can explore, some can build, some can fight--and then regroup to share the spoils with everyone. The procedurally generated world feels more alive the more people live in it, reflecting the collective efforts of everyone involved and growing at a pace alongside you. Depending on your ability and playstyle, you can choose to go the offensive route, battling your way through the wilds, or become a homebody, creating a comforting environment for everyone to come back to once they're done fighting. There's a role for everyone. If you're needing some inspiration, check out our extensive Terraria guidesto get you started.\n\nAstroneer turns the realities of brutal and isolated space exploration into a cooperative, rewarding process, which is why it's one of the best survival games you can play online. Online co-op encourages players to plan, experiment, and adapt together as they reshape alien worlds and make it through another night. The tactile feel of the game's crafting system and potential for laid-back exploration and terraforming means you can (as long as you're willing to carry some of the survival responsibility) play it with just about anyone.\n\nWhen your oxygen level is on the line, tasks feel lighter when shared. It's not a punishing survival game, but it expects you to keep an eye on many moving parts at once for your colonization efforts to be effective. For creative groups who enjoy a bit of focus and tranquility, Astroneer might just hit the spot\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a light-hearted and silly online co-op game where every action requires coordination, and success depends on players communicating constantly, despite being in stitches.\n\nRunning a spaceship together (especially when you're just lil' guys) means juggling roles on the fly. Shields, weapons, navigation--it all requires cooperation, often under pressure and with heavy doses of chaos. It's an easy game to pick up and a fun party game for breaking the ice, we've even rated it one of the best couch co-op games to play together.",
