    "fullText": "A high-stakes World Title clash is set for ONE Friday Fights 147. Former long-time bantamweight Muay Thai king Nong-O Hama takes on undefeated Russian standout Asadula Imangazaliev for the vacant ONE Flyweight Muay Thai World Title inside Bangkok’s iconic Lumpinee Stadium.\n\nThe explosive showdown takes place on March 20, live in Asia primetime, pitting a living legend and a young superstar against each other.\n\nNong-O spent years establishing himself as one of the most dominant World Champions in ONE Championship history.\n\nAfter winning the inaugural ONE Bantamweight Muay Thai World Title in 2019, he defended it a record seven times against top-flight opposition, blending sharp counters, clean combinations, and devastating finishing power.\n\nHis reign came to an end in a first-round knockout loss to Jonathan “The General” Haggerty in April 2023, and although he picked up another win at bantamweight a year later, the 39-year-old began reassessing his long-term path as the division grew bigger and more physical.\n\nThat’s when he decided to move to flyweight, which presented a fresh opportunity.\n\nAt 135 pounds, Nong-O could lean more heavily on his speed, balance, and timing. His debut in the division came at ONE Fight Night 28 against Kongthoranee Sor Sommai in a closely contested bout. Despite that fight ending in a split decision loss, his performance showed he could immediately compete with the division’s elite.\n\nThree months later at ONE Fight Night 31, the Evolve MMA representative returned with clear adjustments and defeated Kongthoranee by unanimous decision, controlling the tempo and displaying sharper movement across three fast-paced rounds in their rematch.\n\nThat victory carried significance. It confirmed Nong-O was not simply testing himself in a new weight class. He had recalibrated, and he had earned his place among the top contenders.\n\nThe Thai icon was initially scheduled to challenge for the flyweight Muay Thai crown at ONE 173 in November last year. However, after his opponent was not medically cleared to compete following the weigh-in and hydration test, the bout was shelved.\n\nNow, Nong-O finds himself standing opposite a young contender on a seemingly flawless trajectory.\n\nImangazaliev’s path has been fueled by momentum. After making waves with five wins – including four knockouts – on ONE Championship’s weekly Asia primetime spectacle, he secured a main roster contract at ONE Friday Fights 122 with a first-round head-kick knockout of seven-time Muay Thai World Champion “The Angel Warrior” Panpayak Jitmuangnon.\n\nThe finish instantly elevated the Team Mehdi Zatout product into serious contention.\n\nHe reinforced that status by stopping Kongthoranee in the second round at ONE Fight Night 39 this past January, extending his pristine record to 11-0, earning a US$50,000 performance bonus, and strengthening his claim for a World Title opportunity.\n\nWhile Nong-O brings World Championship composure and years of elite experience, Imangazaliev arrives in this matchup with explosiveness, confidence, and an unblemished record.\n\nWith the flyweight Muay Thai belt vacant, ONE Friday Fights 147 will determine who gets to claim the division’s throne. Inside the hallowed ground of Lumpinee Stadium, a new king will be crowned.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Few figure skaters at the Winter Olympics have seen Adeliia Petrosian compete in real life.\n\nShe might leave with the gold medal.\n\nRussia's exclusion from international sports events during its war with Ukraine means that the 18-year-old Petrosian has only skated one senior competition outside of her homeland, the qualifier that earned her place as a neutral athlete in Milan.\n\nAs she readies to skate to Michael Jackson's music in the short program Tuesday, no one besides Petrosian and her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, can be sure of her form, or whether she's injury-free.\n\nBut if Petrosian can get past skaters like the U.S. “Blade Angels” trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito, and Japanese stars Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai, she'll shoot to sudden fame as the fourth consecutive Olympic champion from Russia.\n\nPetrosian is the latest star produced by Tutberidze, who revolutionized women's skating a decade ago by getting young girls barely in their teens to perform bigger and bigger jumps, only to have many of them struggle with repeated injuries.\n\nShe coached 2018 gold medalist Alina Zagitova, and a trio of standouts in 2022, when Anna Shcherbakova won the gold medal.\n\nBut the Beijing Games have been remembered less for Shcherbakova's triumph and more for the positive doping test turned in by another Tutberidze talent, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva. The case ended ultimately in a doping ban for Valieva that only recently ended, and an investigation into Tutberidze, though it found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Russian coach.\n\nTutberidze also was criticized for her harsh words toward her students in Beijing, while World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Bańka said last week that he didn't “feel comfortable with her presence” at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nAs part of the fallout from the Valieva case, the International Skating Union increased the minimum age from 15 to 17 for senior-level athletes. That means Petrosian is one of the oldest women's skaters that Tutberidze has coached at a major championship.\n\nPetrosian has landed quadruple jumps in Russian national events, much like her compatriots were able to do in previous Olympics, and none of the other skaters at the Milan Cortina Games are able to match those high-scoring elements.\n\nThe big question is whether she's fit enough to do it in Milan.\n\n“I can't turn properly,” Petrosian complained in a Russian documentary following Tutberidze released last week. Tutberidze said Petrosian had been making progress in a difficult program around the new year, but suddenly “everything hurt.”\n\nThere's been no indication of how Petrosian's condition may have changed in the last month as she readied for the Olympics.\n\nFitness has been a factor for months. Tutberidze previously told Russian media that Petrosian wanted to give up her place in September's Olympic qualifier for lower-ranked skaters after an injury but ended up competing because the Russian alternate's fitness was worse.\n\n“Let's imagine it's just Chelyabinsk.” That was the advice Russian skater Petr Gumennik got from his coach ahead of skating in the men’s event, to pretend that the Olympics were happening in that provincial Russian city.\n\nFor a few seconds, it felt as if the competition might indeed be happening in Russia.\n\n“When I went out there I got so much applause, there was such noise, you can't compare it to anything,” Gumennik said after skating in the short program, where he was 12th. “That's Olympic support. It was unexpected and it gave me strength and confidence.”\n\nGumennik was greeted by fans waving personalized banners with his face, calling out “well done” in Russian.\n\nThere also was a Russian flag in the stands, even though Olympic organizers have barred it from the Games, where athletes such as Gumennik and Petrosian were vetted for any support of the war before they were allowed to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nAs the Russian with the best chance of a gold medal at these Olympics, there may be even more support when Petrosian skates. ___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "title": "Too old or too good to ignore: The Mohammed Shami conundrum",
    "description": "Mohammed Shami's consistent domestic form and World Cup pedigree raise questions about his continued omission from the Indian team. Despite his impressive wicket-taking record, selectors appear hesitant, possibly due to age and injury concerns, while his coach insists performance and fire are paramount. His return remains a strong possibility.",
    "fullText": "These questions swirl every time Shami’s name is omitted from the Indian team. Everyone knows about him: the rasping seam, the wobble that refuses to settle and the habit of arriving at big tournaments and leaving with bigger hauls. Yet, for all that familiarity, his absence from the Indian team has now become a recurring theme.\n\nIndia are understandably wary of pinning their World Cup hopes on two high-class but injury-prone fast bowlers in their thirties: Shami and Jasprit Bumrah. With the domestic pace cupboard thin, the instinct is to invest early in younger bodies. What is harder to justify is ignoring pedigree. \n\nShami is India’s highest wicket-taker in ODI World Cups: 55 wickets at an average of 13.5 in 18 games. The recent numbers only strengthen his case. In four Ranji Trophy matches for Bengal, Shami bowled an average of 20 overs an innings and claimed 20 scalps at 18.6. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he picked up 16 wickets in seven games. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he prised out 11 at 22.5 in five games. \n\nShami played a crucial role in India’s 2025 Champions Trophy, claiming 9 scalps from 5 games. Yet, he was omitted from 2025-26 central contracts.\n\nBadruddin Siddiqui, Shami’s long-time coach, does not mask his frustration. “There’s fire in him,” he says. “He is serious about playing for India. I always tell him --- perform karte raho: India will need you,” he says. For Siddiqui, the equation is simple. A cricketer’s job is to perform; the selectors’ job is to decide. “Age should never be a consideration. Fitness, performance and fire: that’s what matters.” \n\nDomestic cricket, Siddiqui argues, is too easily dismissed. “Bowling 25 overs in a day is not easy,” he says. “There is no bowler who can replace him. There is a lot left in him.” \n\nFormer Delhi pacer Sanjeev Sharma offers a more nuanced perspective. “There’s a lot of difference between domestic and international cricket,” he says. “Even a T20 international takes a lot out of you: in terms of fielding, bending and chasing. There is no place to hide in international cricket.” \n\n“Perhaps, Shami is not yet at the exact match-fitness level the selectors want him to be,” Sharma notes. \n\nPerhaps, communication has faltered, he says. But Sharma is unequivocal about Shami’s ability. \n\n“Skill-wise, he is your second-best fast bowler after Bumrah. There’s no doubt in my mind that Shami will return.” Around Shami, competition has intensified—Arshdeep Singh’s left-arm angles, Siraj’s stamina, Harshit Rana’s development. But competition does not erase class. “Performs speaks for itself,” Siddiqui says. “Bilkul wapas aayega: he will be back,” he adds.",

    "description": "From Costco to Toyota, global companies are filing lawsuits to secure tariff refunds should the Supreme Court decide to strike down Trump's duties.",
    "fullText": "Top global companies want their money back from the Trump administration.\n\nThe Supreme Court is in the process of deciding whether Trump's tariffs enacted under an emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are legal. To companies that may have already paid billions in duties over the past year, a ruling against tariffs may not be enough to recoup funds.\n\nSmall businesses mainly spearheaded the initial wave of lawsuits against tariffs, but some of the largest global corporations are now filing lawsuits in fear that they may not be refunded should the Supreme Court overturn the duties.\n\nTypically, duties paid to the Customs and Border Protection undergo a process called liquidation within a year of the entry of the goods in question. Once liquidation occurs, the chances of getting any money back become slim — and for many companies, their time is running out.\n\nFrom Costco to Toyota, here are some of the largest global companies that want their tariffs refunded.\n\nCostco is seeking a \"full refund\" of tariffs it paid under the IEEPA, arguing the levies were imposed illegally and could soon become unrecoverable.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed with the Court of International Trade in December 2025, Costco's lawyers argued that the law, first enacted in 1977, has never authorized tariffs.\n\n\"The text of IEEPA does not use the word 'tariff' or any term of equivalent meaning,\" the company wrote.\n\nThe company also said in the complaint that it filed its own suit because even if the Supreme Court ultimately rules the tariffs unlawful, importers are not guaranteed refunds without separate court judgments. Costco said that its imports could begin entering \"liquidation\" as early as mid-December, which is a customs process that could permanently close the door on refunds. Customs has already declined to extend that timeline, Costco said in the suit.\n\nCostco did not disclose how much it has paid in duties.\n\nSubsidiaries of the Toyota Group, Toyota Tsusho America, Toyota Tsusho Canada, and Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics America filed a lawsuit in November 2025 to secure refunds.\n\n\"And this action is necessary now because the entries for which Plaintiffs paid tariffs imposed under authority of IEEPA will begin to become liquidated and final as a matter of law by January 31, 2026,\" the companies wrote in the complaint.\n\n\"Plaintiffs seek relief from the impending final liquidations to ensure that their right to a complete refund is not jeopardized,\" they added.\n\nThe auto sector has been among the industries most exposed to Trump's tariffs, which added duties on vehicles as well as on steel and aluminum. In May 2025, Toyota said that the higher import and export rates could cost the company about $1.3 billion over a two-month period.\n\nBYD's lawsuit marks the first from a Chinese carmaker against Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe EV giant filed the suit on February 9 and detailed nine executive orders related to trade that affected the company, including tariffs on cars, auto parts, aluminum, steel, and exports from China.\n\nIn the complaint, BYD wrote that it is seeking a refund of \"all IEEPA tariffs paid to date\" and \"all IEEPA tariffs that may be paid in the future.\"\n\nThe company also said that aside from China, its imports into the US from Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Poland were also affected.\n\nThe Chinese carmaker does not sell passenger cars in the US, but its business here includes buses, commercial vehicles, batteries, energy storage systems, and solar panels. According to its website, the company's truck plant in Lancaster, California, employs 750 workers.\n\nOn December 10, 2025, Goodyear Tire & Rubber filed its complaint and request for relief, and detailed how tariffs, especially the ones imposed on China, which changed nearly a dozen times, affected the company.\n\n\"Where CBP acts in a ministerial capacity (i.e., without discretion) in imposing a duty, the entry's liquidation cannot be protested,\" wrote Goodyear in its complaint as to why the company is asking the court to block liquidation.\n\nGoodyear sources a significant portion of its raw materials from Southeast Asia, where the rubber plant is widely commercially grown. According to Goodyear's website, the company's manufacturing facilities are located across 23 countries, including China, the US, Germany, Poland, and Thailand.\n\nAlcoa Corp, one of the world's top producers of aluminum, bauxite, and alumina, filed a complaint for tariff refunds on November 26, 2025.\n\nThis case is one of several dozen that were consolidated with AGS Company Automotive Solutions v. United States Customs and Border Protection, which became the lead case regarding IEEPA duty liquidation as of December 2025.\n\nAs of June 2025, tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports increased to 50%.",

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses the potential long-term impact of England's defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield, and the challenge of facing Ireland at Allianz Stadium on Saturday.\n\nI can easily reel off the losses that stuck with me in the Six Nations, as they can take you to a really dark place at times.\n\nScotland 2000, Ireland 2001 and France 2002 - they all still hurt.\n\nI was involved in all those campaigns and came up short of a Grand Slam by one victory three consecutive times.\n\nIt is important now to take stock and remember that defeat will happen again at some point before the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\n\nEngland will lick their wounds after yet another crushing defeat by Scotland, but even if a potential Grand Slam has gone, they still have a championship to play for.\n\nThe chance to win a Grand Slam does not come around very often, and that is the reality.\n\nLast week I said it would be foolish to draw a straight line from the opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider in Paris.\n\nThis tournament is magical for exactly that reason.\n\nTwo wins and England will be in a position to go to Paris and perhaps try to win the championship.\n\nThere is plenty to focus on and be excited about, and that Murrayfield pain will make England a better team.\n\nBig away wins are not easy in the Six Nations, and Saturday is another one that eluded Steve Borthwick.\n\nIt is not just about winning on another pitch as the World Cup is on neutral soil in Australia.\n\nIt is about the different feeling outside the Twickenham environment and home comforts.\n\nAs impressive as the 12-game winning run was, England still need that South African mentality - wherever you go in the world, you are expected to win and be globally successful.\n\nBorthwick is still yet to travel to Scotland, Ireland or France in the Six Nations and win.\n\nMost adversity comes from playing away from home, and Saturday gave the England players more of those scenarios.\n\nIt is very unlikely they will win a World Cup without a statement away victory beforehand.\n\nThere is a lot happening in these high-pressure games, and for high-paced players it is happening more quickly both physically and mentally.\n\nUnfortunately for Henry Arundell, who was being ultra-competitive, you have to read situations like the one when he took out Kyle Steyn in the air.\n\nEngland found themselves in a position where they were not playing well and were losing the scraps.\n\nIn those situations, you need clarity as well as competitiveness, and a red card obviously does not help to swing the momentum back.\n\nThat decision has cost England dearly and, given how competitive that wing slot is, I am sure Borthwick is going to have to manage that scenario.\n\nHenry is a 23-year-old and will, of course, bounce back, but it was reckless and a poor decision.\n\nWhat if that had been a championship decider or a World Cup knockout game?\n\nYou have to make good decisions under pressure. Being in those situations more often will help players learn.\n\nSix Nations: Scotland regain the Calcutta Cup\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\nEngland will be licking their lips at the opportunity to bounce back against Ireland on Saturday.\n\nWe know England can perform with the comfort of home support, so it is not about putting things right - that will come in games in Rome and Paris.\n\nIt is about building on what they did prior to the Scotland game. Sometimes you have to park a game, write it off and move on.\n\nI thought I had seen England drift away from the kick-heavy style and strategy.\n\nScotland put on an attacking masterclass, whereas when England did attack it felt like they were punching for their lives but not actually landing anything.\n\nThey lacked shape, going left and right without making any progress - like a boxer on the ropes punching for their life but not actually hitting anything.\n\nGeorge Ford's failed drop-goal felt like a last-ditch option, which then resulted in what Borthwick described as a 10-point swing.\n\nI do not think you can blame Ford, the sequence was not set up properly and it felt like tired minds all over the place.\n\nDealing with a fast and furious game is, once again, a learning curve to take forward.\n\nTwo years ago there was plenty of talk that Ireland were going to beat England by 30 points at Twickenham.\n\nIt was such a mismatch in terms of where both sides were in their development.\n\nMarcus Smith's late drop-goal denied Ireland a potential Grand Slam, and that was a huge moment in Borthwick's tenure.\n\nNow England come in as favourites - it is amazing how quickly the landscape changes.\n\nHaving lost badly against France and nearly drawn against Italy, Ireland will be annoyed that everyone is writing them off.\n\nThey are a well-motivated team under Andy Farrell and are very well drilled.\n\nIreland will come out and probably play their best game of the campaign.\n\nScotland, in the space of a week, turned their disappointing loss in Rome into a convincing display against England.\n\nThat is how quickly things can change.\n\nDefeat next weekend and the pressure builds on England, with two difficult away fixtures to finish.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win",

    "fullText": "What is the hardest coaching job in world sport?\n\nWe are talking about the ‘poisoned chalice’ roles — mostly big teams where standards are high, fans’ expectations are higher and where coaches also have to contend with the weight of a glorious history.\n\nWe asked our writers across all sports for their nominations for the title, from Manchester United to the USWNT via Ferrari team principal (among others). In each case, reporters were asked to focus on those teams’ wider historical context rather than simply this current season.\n\nAt the end of the article, you can vote for the job you think is the hardest in world sport. This list is far from definitive, so please do make your own suggestions in the comments below if you feel we have missed any roles out.\n\nCoaching the England men’s team is such a peculiar role that it even has a name attached: ‘An Impossible Job’. Former manager Graham Taylor was the subject of a documentary of the same name, which laid bare the team’s unsuccessful bid to qualify for the 1994 World Cup.\n\nPart of this is just the natural effect of assuming this country cares more about its national team than others. Many other nations have a lot of public pressure on this role and a lot of expectation, too. Yes, in the past, the media glare in that job has been ferocious — but that is not the case in quite the same way now. And it is certainly not distinctive to England either.\n\nPerhaps the hardest element is to bridge the gap between resources and record. The England men’s team have won one major tournament: the World Cup hosted by the country in 1966. But they now have the richest, most popular football league in the world in the Premier League on their doorstep. And yet, turning that to the advantage of the England team is a challenge that has yet to be resolved.\n\nCan Thomas Tuchel, the current coach who this week signed a new deal until the European Championship in 2028, be the man to do that at last?\n\nThere are many layers to why coaching the New York Jets feels like an impossible job. Let’s start with the simple statement: they are the New York Jets.\n\nThere is not an NFL team that has been referred to mockingly, or derisively, or served as the butt of a joke in television shows, movies or sketch comedies quite like this team. That reputation is part of what makes it hard to work here: the “Same Old Jets” of it all, a feeling that, eventually, things will go terribly, even when it feels like there is hope.\n\nThat ties to the franchise’s history. This is a team that has not won a Super Bowl since 1969 and has not found any sort of stability at quarterback since then, either. Coaching the Jets means answering to a fanbase that has grown increasingly angry the longer their playoff-less streak (15 years and counting) goes on. Current head coach Aaron Glenn is a beloved former Jets player and he was not granted much of a grace period — after one losing season, fans are already calling for his head.\n\nThe other challenge: ownership. Woody Johnson is known to be meddlesome, impatient and easily influenced by headlines.\n\nBut really, it all falls under the “Same Old Jets” umbrella, which coaches have failed to overcome going on for a few decades now.\n\nManaging Real Madrid is a uniquely difficult challenge. Florentino Perez, long-serving president of the record 15-time European Cup/Champions League winners, has little patience for long-term projects or planning, and no time for excuses or mitigating factors such as injuries or misfortune.\n\nPerez fills the dressing-room with big-name players who do not always fit together well, rarely enjoy detailed tactical instruction and seldom take responsibility when the team is not doing well.\n\nMadrid are actually owned by 80,000 members who demand the highest standards — and are surrounded by a voracious local media who mercilessly criticise anyone who even temporarily falls short.\n\nTo enjoy success in the Spanish capital, Madrid’s coach must be able to motivate and organise star players, while showing humility and intelligence in dealing with Perez, and accepting the only thing that really counts is regularly winning the biggest trophies.\n\nSince 2000, Madrid have had 18 different coaches — and just three have won a Champions League: Vicente del Bosque in 2000 and 2002, Carlo Ancelotti in 2014, 2022 and 2024, and Zinedine Zidane in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nOther coaches with big reputations and personalities who have tried but failed include Jose Mourinho, Fabio Capello, Rafa Benitez, and, most recently, former playing icon Xabi Alonso. It is no surprise that the current incumbent, another former player, Alvaro Arbeloa, is feeling the pressure after just eight games.\n\nAll Formula 1 team principal jobs (the closest to a head coach’s role in other sports) come with pressure. But none compares to that of Ferrari, the sport’s most historic and trophy-laden team, who demand nothing but success. All of Italy is watching.\n\nIt is something Fred Vasseur, Ferrari’s team principal since 2023, felt last year. The team narrowly missed out on the title in 2024, only to then slide backwards and endure a winless season, despite the blockbuster signing of Lewis Hamilton. By mid-season, Vasseur was facing deep scrutiny in the press. Even with a new contract signed last June, that spotlight will only dim once success arrives.\n\nVasseur is Ferrari’s fifth team principal since 2014, with each of the past four changes coming abruptly in response to a lack of success. Simply fighting for wins is not enough to satisfy Ferrari’s board, the Italian press, or its fans watching around the world. Championships are the only currency they want to deal in.\n\nVasseur is acutely aware of that, his goal being to finally be the person to end Ferrari’s title drought (they last won the drivers’ title in 2007 and the constructors’ crown in 2008) and succeed in F1’s toughest job. But he needs to break the trend of his predecessors to make that happen.\n\nManchester United's 20 top-flight league titles, dating back to 1908, have been won by only three men: Ernest Mangnall, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson. That is the same number of league-winning managers that Liverpool have had since 1990, Chelsea have had since 2010 and Manchester City have had since 2012.\n\nIt took United five attempts to land on Busby's true successor. That was long enough, but their next permanent manager will be the seventh since Ferguson's retirement after winning 38 trophies in his 26 years in charge.\n\nThat success made United one of the biggest clubs in the world — almost certainly the biggest in the English-speaking world — but also set an almost impossible standard to meet.\n\nWhoever eventually puts United back on their perch, in Ferguson's parlance, will have to work with an unpopular ownership, an insatiable media and a long list of ex-players who have been there, won it and started a podcast.\n\nBut most of all, they will need to match the expectation that United should be the dominant force in English football, even more than a decade on from the last of those league titles.\n\nTottenham are, in theory, one of the world’s most promising football clubs.\n\nBased in London, an international financial and sporting capital, they can attract talent over competition from most teams in the Premier League and beyond, and their world-class stadium and training ground are, or at least should be, a dream to operate in. They also have wealthy owners.\n\nAll of this leads to high expectations, but Spurs, irrespective of the manager, have consistently fallen short.\n\nNow-USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino is considered the club’s most successful manager in the 21st century, taking Tottenham to a Champions League final and their highest finish in Premier League history (second). It felt like a golden age in waiting, but Spurs lost that final to Liverpool in 2019 and did not become English champions under Pochettino, failing to capitalise on the moment.\n\nSince then, Spurs have been on a steady decline — and no one has got particularly close to rescuing them over a sustained period.\n\nNo matter who has stood in the dugout, whether it has been Premier League winners Jose Mourinho or Antonio Conte, or Ange Postecoglou (who delivered the club's first trophy in 17 years last season at the expense of the club's worst league finish since 1976-77), Nuno Espirito Santo or Thomas Frank — the latter was sacked on Wednesday after only joining in June while Spurs have appointed the Croatian Igor Tudor until the end of the season — the product has never consistently matched the near-league-leading ticket prices. And the coaches are the ones who regularly take the blame.\n\nTottenham currently sit 16th in the Premier League, which led to the board moving on from Frank this week.\n\nThe potential of the young squad and the opportunity for investment should make them an exciting proposition for many top-class head coaches. But almost every type of manager has tried to establish Spurs as league and Champions League contenders post-Pochettino — and all have failed.\n\nThe average tenure of a permanent Chelsea manager this century is 532 days, or 17 and a half months. Across almost two decades of ownership under Roman Abramovich, the club ruthlessly chewed through many of the world’s most famous and successful coaches, banking a steady flow of trophies and pressing the ‘eject’ button at the first sign of failure.\n\nIt says something, then, that the Stamford Bridge dugout has become an even less forgiving environment since Abramovich, a Russian oligarch, sold up in 2022, following UK government sanctions imposed on him after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLiam Rosenior is BlueCo’s fourth permanent head coach appointment in four years, and those numbers do not even account for Thomas Tuchel — the Champions League winner they inherited and quickly sacked, now in charge of England — or Frank Lampard, who returned for a second miserable stint as caretaker boss in 2023.\n\nTo win at the highest level with one of Europe’s youngest squads and satisfy a demanding and increasingly disillusioned fanbase is challenging enough. Then there is Chelsea’s unique executive structure, with co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart heading up an increasingly sprawling brain trust overseeing everything from recruitment to injury prevention and management.\n\nIt is a structure that can only accommodate a head coach, not a manager, and both Mauricio Pochettino (in charge from 2023-2024) and Enzo Maresca grew weary of working within it. Rosenior, promoted with startling speed from BlueCo sister club Strasbourg, has been handed an incredible opportunity so early in his coaching career — but also a frighteningly difficult path to walk.\n\nPicture this: the biggest media market in the country. The franchise with by far the most World Series championships. The most intense fans in the game.\n\nThose are just a few things breathing down the neck of the manager of the New York Yankees.\n\nCalling it a tough job would be a major understatement. It even appears to take a physical toll — just look at the before and after photos of Joe Torre and Joe Girardi, who held the position before Aaron Boone took over in 2018.\n\nPressure like this exists nowhere else in baseball. Other teams tank for higher draft picks or trade their best players to retool, giving up today for a better tomorrow. In the Bronx, there is no such luxury. The Yankees must win every year — the fans demand it.\n\nTo the credit of owner Hal Steinbrenner, he does spend money bringing in some of the sport’s biggest names. But with great talent on the field also comes great expectations in the dugout — all while the manager is forced to explain his decisions to reporters twice a day while maintaining harmony between the clubhouse and the decision-makers in the front office.\n\nIn the biggest city in the U.S., being Yankees manager is a job nobody else can relate to.\n\nYou only need to look at the furore that followed recent defeats by Arsenal and Manchester City — and read The Athletic’s in-depth piece on the crisis happening behind the scenes — to understand the pressure that comes with managing Chelsea women. Sonia Bompastor has only lost three of her 37 Women’s Super League matches in charge of Chelsea since she was appointed in 2024, but there are still fans unhappy with the French manager.\n\nBompastor is a victim of her own success. Last season, she led Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic treble, and the expectations set by her predecessor and now-USWNT coach Emma Hayes, who won 16 trophies in her 12 years at the club. The standard at the club is unforgiving, and entertaining the idea of anything but total dominance is seen as a failure.\n\nThe only women’s club team with comparable expectations are Barcelona, where squad cohesion is helped by the fact that so many of the players are also longtime Spain team-mates. Bompastor has to integrate big-name signings from across the globe. Having such an array of talent is a blessing, but it leaves her with nowhere to hide.\n\nThe rest of the WSL are also narrowing the gap on Chelsea, whereas the only real threat to Barcelona’s dominance in Spain are Real Madrid, and even they have only beaten Barca once in 24 meetings.\n\nThe U.S. women’s national team’s win at the 1999 World Cup set a new bar and served as a catalyst not only for the women’s game domestically but around the world.\n\nThe head that wears the crown has always been heavy: until recently, the expectation of the USWNT was to not only win, but to annihilate opponents (think that 13-0 drubbing of Thailand at the start of their 2019 World Cup campaign). Head coach Emma Hayes will doubtless have found that out for herself since being appointed in 2023.\n\nIf anything, the job has become harder as the talent gap between the U.S. and every other nation has narrowed; they are No 2 in FIFA’s world rankings, trailing World Cup winners Spain.\n\nBalancing sustainable player development while still achieving results — yes, even in international friendlies — is a delicate balance to strike under the spotlight, and there may be no stage more daunting in women’s football than the USWNT.\n\nIt is beyond a joke, really. Just think of the Grampa Simpson meme showing him walking in and out, and that is Watford.\n\nThe second-tier side go through head coaches — it is ironic that they give them such a lofty title in the first place — quicker than you can say, \"another one bites the dust”.\n\nSince the Italian businessman Gino Pozzo bought the club in 2012, he has micro-managed his way through 23 incumbents of football's hottest seat. For context, there had been 34 in the club's 109-year history before then.\n\nOnly five coaches have lasted a whole campaign. Five seasons — including this one — have seen three different men in the dugout. In 2014-15 and 2019-20, there were four.\n\nIt appeared the hire-and-fire culture worked, as Watford spent six of seven seasons in the Premier League from 2015 to 2022. But they are not even a yo-yo club anymore. The string has snapped, the parachute payments from Premier League relegation have stopped, and that revolving door keeps on turning. Next!\n\nIt is a mistake to think of the Bayern Munich job as a coaching role — it is much more than that.\n\nThe starting point for the record 34-time German champions is that anything less than a domestic double of trophies each season is seen as performing below par, with every unconvincing performance — even in victory — subject to inquest.\n\nBut then there is the rapacious Bavarian and national media, for whom negativity about Bayern is big business, and a dressing room always loaded with forthright personalities and egos.\n\nThe club’s elders, Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, present a separate challenge. Hoeness, the honorary president who played for Bayern from 1970 to 1979, rarely has an unspoken thought, especially about the standard of the team or the quality of coaching, meaning that plenty of scrutiny comes from inside the club, from seemingly unimpeachable figures.\n\nA Bayern coach needs tremendous presence, but also the humility to know their place at certain times and when to be deferential. That is a balance few have found in the club’s modern history.\n\nThe hardest coaching job is one where expectations are high, patience is low and, sometimes, the view is irrational. In the NBA, that means the jobs at two high-profile teams on each coast.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers head coach lives under constant strain. Pressure is intensely high for a fanbase (and ownership) used to winning. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles, the second-most in league history. They are not used to losing. Even winning the NBA Cup (a feat with a nebulous value) is not enough. Darvin Ham was fired in 2024, the year after making the conference finals and hanging a Cup banner.\n\nThe Lakers have had 11 coaches in the last 25 years but only one has lasted more than three seasons in the job: Phil Jackson (from 1999-2004 and 2005-2011). Even Frank Vogel was fired in 2022, two years after winning a title.\n\nThe New York Knicks head coach feels the pressure, too. There have been 15 of them since 2000. But that franchise has not won an NBA championship in 53 years. The owner is demanding and impatient, and success is only success on the right terms.\n\nAfter two decades of ineptitude, Tom Thibodeau was fired last spring, despite leading the Knicks to their best finish in a quarter-century. Good luck to the new coach, and the one who replaces him.\n\nThere is an old cliche about the difficulty of coaching national teams in football. Clubs have big fanbases, sure, but they are splintered and spread around. When you manage a country, the number of people who think they can do a better job than you is roughly equal to the entire population.\n\nIn Brazil, that number is about 210million. Nearly all of them are obsessed with football. The older generations remember a time when the national team were the dominant force in the international game. The rest grew up hearing the tales and watching the videos — and many will still have seen one or two of the more recent World Cup wins (Brazil have lifted the game's most prestigious title a record five times). It is understandable that expectation often curdles into entitlement.\n\nWhat complicates things is a knot of competing dynamics. There are the zigzagging inferiority/superiority complexes when it comes to how Brazilian football compares to that played in Europe. There is the deathless debate around the compatibility — or otherwise — of winning and entertaining. There is also the fact that Brazil’s national self-image is so bound up with football.\n\nThe Brazil coach is not just picking 11 players and planning corner routines. He has to plot a course through all of that other stuff, all while loaded down by the weight of history. It is no great wonder most fail.\n\nNo NHL coaching job is quite like it.\n\nA longest-in-league-history championship drought means bringing the Stanley Cup to Toronto would all but guarantee instant legendary status and a statue outside the arena. The problem? That same historic drought — and all the failures along the way — have added to the pressure and noise in hockey’s largest market.\n\nCanada’s most populated city counts a fanbase that has only grown in the face of annual disappointment. The Maple Leafs, the NHL’s most valuable team, last won the Stanley Cup in 1967. There were just six teams in the league at the time. Today, there are 32.\n\nSince Punch Imlach led the Leafs to that last championship, 21 other coaches have tried — and ultimately failed — to satisfy a starved fanbase. Despite the billions of dollars invested over the years into the team’s expensive roster, facilities, resources and staff, the Leafs have never won more than two playoff rounds in a single season in that time.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2012, the Leafs did not even make the playoffs, adding to their sense of perennial heartbreak. Four coaches failed during that time. Two of them won the Stanley Cup elsewhere — giving weight to the notion that the Leafs might be cursed.\n\nWith 25 games remaining this season, the Leafs are in danger of missing the playoffs altogether for the first time in a decade. Craig Berube, a former Stanley Cup-winning coach who has been leading Toronto since 2024, is the latest person in the hot seat.\n\nPutting this season aside, the job of coaching one of Scotland’s big two could be naively regarded as a cakewalk. Historically, and certainly since the turn of the century, their budgets have dwarfed those of every other Scottish team. Your job, therefore, is to finish in front of the club over the road. Simple.\n\nBut in that respect, there is nowhere to hide. If you are Rangers and you wind up behind Celtic, you might as well have finished bottom. The same is true in reverse. To attend an Old Firm fixture, as the rivalry is known, is to understand the frenetic, vitriolic, passionate and sometimes poisonous world of football in Glasgow. It looks like easy street when it goes well. It is an untold nightmare if it goes badly.\n\nAnd, very often, the fate of a coach is wholly dictated by the structure around them and above them. Strain at boardroom level filters down onto the pitch, affecting resources and the quality of performances.\n\nYou have seen that at Rangers for more than a decade. You are seeing it at Celtic now. Yes, Wilfried Nancy was a disaster of an appointment, sacked after 33 days in charge last month — but when were Celtic last set up to fail as they seem to be at present? It made Nancy’s job a hospital pass, regardless of whether the former Columbus Crew coach was ever the right fit.\n\nWith regards to Glasgow, Vince Lombardi was bang on: there is no room for second place. It is sink or swim from a manager’s first morning in post — and rather them than me.\n\nThere is a phrase in Turkish football which roughly translates as “titles are won at the airport” — a reference to the big-name signings who are often greeted with frantic scenes when they get off the plane to finalise their deals.\n\nThe idea that new arrivals will inevitably mean success is an attitude shared by club presidents, too. The message to their coaches is “we’ve given you the stars, now win something”.\n\nWhich is part of the reason that coaching any of Istanbul’s big three clubs — Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas — is almost an impossible job. Plenty of cultures think of football as a form of religion, but there are not many cities that do so with such chaotic intensity as Istanbul.\n\nGood luck to anyone in charge of any of them, but right now the biggest pressure is on Fenerbahce. Historically the most successful club in Turkey (they have won 28 Turkish titles to Galatasaray’s 26), they have not been champions since 2014, their longest-ever drought, and have had to watch Galatasaray demolish them for the last three seasons.\n\nThey are on their 11th different manager since that last success, and things are getting desperate: Jose Mourinho was sacked earlier this season and the man now in the hot seat is former Belgium manager Domenico Tedesco.\n\nKalen DeBoer took on maybe the greatest challenge in college football history two years ago by signing up to be the coach who replaced Nick Saban. Saban produced an unprecedented run of six national titles in 17 seasons at Alabama from 2007 to 2023.\n\nAlabama fans became accustomed to ruling the sport under Saban. But it has historically set the standard at national championship for its football program, long predating Saban. Before him, coach Bear Bryant won six national championships with the football team during the 1960s and 1970s and their excellence stretches back almost a century — with their 30 Southeastern Conference football championships by far the most in the history of the storied league.\n\nIn the early to mid-1900s, a time in the United States when elite Northeast universities and large institutions in the Midwest often ruled the sport, Alabama was a Southern powerhouse and source of pride for much of the state, though in-state rival Auburn also commands similar support. That Iron Bowl rivalry is yet another aspect that makes the Alabama job so difficult. An otherwise successful season can be severely damaged or even ruined by a loss to Auburn in the regular-season finale.\n\nThere is a saying that college football is like a religion in the Deep South, as much a part of a fan's identity as their faith. Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, capacity 100,077, is among college football's largest and most hallowed cathedrals. Successful coaches at Alabama become legends. Coaches who fail to meet the lofty expectations, even respected alumni such as Ray Perkins, Mike DuBose and Mike Shula, are forever remembered for their shortcomings.\n\nIndia are international cricket’s sole powerhouse. Even if Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand can compete in terms of the talent of their first team, India have a much deeper overall pool. The country has a total population of more than 1.4billion.\n\nGiven the perceived player advantage they possess, the coach faces immense scrutiny from all corners in a country that views the sport as a religion and its stars as gods. No sport rivals cricket’s status and no celebrities rival cricketers’ popularity in India.\n\nIndia wield immense financial firepower as a result and a considerable influence over cricket’s global body, the International Cricket Council. Jay Shah, the son of the nation’s home minister, is the council’s chairman.\n\nThose elements also make the coach’s job a fairly thankless one as India are expected to — and arguably should — beat every team they face.\n\nWhat do you think the hardest coaching job in world sport is?

    "fullText": "In this article, we’ll start with a basic example using std::mutex, look at its limitations, and then introduce std::shared_mutex, a reader-writer mutex added in C++17. Even in 2026, with many new concurrency features available, std::shared_mutex is still a valuable and practical tool.\n\nWe’ll begin with a small example (a standard “hello world” for this type of mutexes): a counter object that multiple threads can access:\n\nNothing scary so far, and this implementation is correct, thread-safe, and easy to understand.\n\nHowever, there’s a significant limitation: All access is exclusive.\n\nOnly one thread can call get() or increment() at any given time, even though get() does not modify the state.\n\nIn many real-world programs, shared data is read frequently and might be rarely updated/overriden.\n\nWith std::mutex, even multiple read-only operations block each other. This limits scalability and wastes available parallelism.\n\nHave a look at the following example:\n\nOn Compiler Explorer - see here https://godbolt.org/z/cdjrj8hGd - I’m getting the following output:\n\nNotice that some lines repeat the same value. That’s expected. The writer increments the counter every ~15 ms, but readers sample it every ~10 ms, so they can observe the same value more than once. Also, thread scheduling is not deterministic, so each reader may see a slightly different sequence.\n\nIn the demo code, there are many more reads than writes, so is the mutex the best solution here?\n\nstd::shared_mutex is a reader-writer mutex. It supports two locking modes:\n\nThis makes std::shared_mutex a good fit for read-mostly data structures.\n\nLet’s update the counter example:\n\nWith this change, many threads can call get() concurrently, writes remain fully protected, and read scalability improves with almost no extra complexity/\n\nOn Compiler Explorer - https://godbolt.org/z/W1es4qM8x - I’m getting:\n\nThe output is still nondeterministic, and it may look similar between std::mutex and std::shared_mutex. The key difference is not the values printed, but the fact that with std::shared_mutex multiple readers can hold the lock at the same time. This matters when the protected read section is non-trivial (parsing, lookups, copying data, etc.) and when the program is under real contention.\n\nOk, but let’s try to measure the gains to see the difference. I’ll add some extra sleep code to simulate a real “workload”, and then we can compare times.\n\nSee at Compiler Explorer. The output:\n\nOn this machine, std::thread::hardware_concurrency() reports 2 hardware threads. In this setup, the workload is intentionally read-heavy and each read holds the lock for a short but non-trivial amount of time. With std::mutex, all reads and writes use exclusive locking, so reader threads are effectively serialized and must wait for each other. As a result, the total runtime is about 285 ms.\n\nWith std::shared_mutex, read operations acquire a shared lock and can therefore run concurrently. On a system with two hardware threads, this allows two readers to make progress at the same time, significantly reducing contention. Under the same workload and timing parameters, the total runtime drops to about 102 ms. The exact numbers will vary between runs and platforms. Still, the difference clearly illustrates the main advantage of std::shared_mutex for read-mostly workloads: improved throughput when multiple readers can proceed in parallel.\n\nThe “counter” example is small, but the pattern becomes more useful with real data structures. A typical example is a cache.\n\nThis pattern appears often in real systems:\n\nUsing std::shared_mutex allows reads to scale while still keeping writes safe.\n\nA thread must not lock the same std::shared_mutex recursively:\n\nThis applies to both shared and exclusive ownership.\n\nIf upgrading is required, the locking strategy usually needs to change.\n\nstd::shared_mutex has overhead. If:\n\nthen std::mutex may be just as fast or even faster. Measuring is important.\n\nYou can read this recent article about some detailed measurements: When std::shared_mutex Outperforms std::mutex: A Google Benchmark Study – Tech For Talk\n\nSince C++17, the concurrency library has expanded significantly. We now have:\n\nThese tools focus mostly on thread lifetime, coordination, cancellation or lock-free programming.\n\nstd::shared_mutex fills a different role.\n\nIt is still a mutual-exclusion primitive, explicitly designed to protect a shared state with many readers and few writers. It does not compete with atomics, condition variables, or RCU.\n\nIn this article, we explored std::shared_mutex, a synchronization primitive designed for protecting read-mostly shared data. Unlike std::mutex, it allows multiple threads to read the same resource concurrently, while still ensuring exclusive access for writers.\n\nStarting from a simple counter example, we showed how a plain mutex serializes all access and how switching to std::shared_mutex enables concurrent reads with only small changes to the code. A simple benchmark experiment demonstrated that, under a read-heavy workload, this can significantly reduce contention and improve throughput.\n\nEven with newer concurrency features added in C++20 and later, std::shared_mutex remains a useful and practical tool when reads dominate writes and simplicity is preferred over more complex synchronization techniques.\n\nI've prepared a valuable bonus for you!\n\nLearn all major features of recent C++ Standards on my Reference Cards!\n\nCheck it out here:",

    "fullText": "MUNICH (AP) — About 250,000 people demonstrated on Saturday against Iran's government on the sidelines of a gathering of world leaders in Germany, police said, answering a call from Iran ’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi for cranked-up international pressure on Tehran.\n\nBanging drums and chanting for regime change, the giant and boisterous rally in Munich was part of what Pahlavi described as a “global day of action\" to support Iranians in the wake of deadly nationwide protests. He also called for demonstrations in Los Angeles and Toronto. Police said in a post on X that the number of protesters reached some 250,000, more than the organizers had expected.\n\n“Change, change, regime change” the huge crowd chanted, waving green-white-and-red flags with lion and sun emblems. Iran used that flag before its 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Pahlavi dynasty.\n\nAt a news conference, Pahlavi warned of more deaths in Iran if “democracies stand by and watch\" following Iran’s deadly crackdown on protesters last month.\n\n“We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?” he asked. He added that the survival of Iran's government “sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power.”\n\nAn estimated 350,000 people marched on the streets of Toronto as part of the Global Day of Action Rally, Toronto Police spokesperson Laura Brabant said.\n\nAt the Munich rally, demonstrators sported “Make Iran Great Again\" red caps, mimicking the MAGA caps worn by U.S. President Donald Trump 's supporters. Among those sporting the caps was U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who gave a speech to the crowd during which he was photographed holding up the headwear.\n\nMany at the rally waved placards showing Pahlavi, some that called him a king. The son of Iran’s deposed shah has been in exile for nearly 50 years but is trying to position himself as a player in Iran’s future.\n\nThe crowd chanted “Pahlavi for Iran,” and “democracy for Iran\" as drums and cymbals sounded.\n\n“We have huge hopes and (are) looking forward that the regime is going to change hopefully,” said Daniyal Mohtashamian, a demonstrator who traveled from Zurich, in Switzerland, to speak for protesters inside Iran who faced repression.\n\n“There is an internet blackout, and their voices are not going outside of Iran,” he said.\n\nAbout 500 protesters also rallied outside the presidential palace in Nicosia, Cyprus, with many holding up banners with slogans against Iran's government and in favor of Pahlavi.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says at least 7,005 people were killed in last month's protests, including 214 government forces. It has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists inside Iran to verify deaths.\n\nIran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.\n\nThe Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.\n\nIranian leaders are facing renewed pressure from Trump, who has threatened U.S. military action. Trump wants Iran to further scale back its nuclear program. He suggested Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.\"\n\nIran was also the focus of protests in Munich on Friday, the opening day of an annual security conference in the city gathering European leaders and global security figures. Supporters of the Iranian opposition group People’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, also known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, demonstrated.",

They proved more popular than expected in the official Olympics merchandise stores.\n\nCondoms are traditionally popular for Olympic athletes to take home from as “a kind of gift” to friends, Alpine skier Mialitiana Clerc said Saturday.\n\n“I’m not so shocked. I saw it in Beijing already,” said Clerc, who also competed for Madagascar four years ago at the Winter Games in China. “There were some boxes with a lot of condoms at the entrance of every building where we were staying at the village.\"\n\n\"Every day, everything was (gone),” she recalled about Beijing at an IOC news conference Saturday to promote its scholarship program that helps hundreds of athletes to train and qualify for the Olympics.\n\n“I already know that a lot of people are using some condoms or just taking them to give to their friends outside of the Olympics because it’s a kind of gift for them,” Clerc said.\n\nThere should be no further shortage in Italy until the Winter Games closing ceremony Feb. 22.\n\n“They will be continuously replenished until the end of the games to ensure continued availability,” the local organizing committee said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "After living abroad as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ecuador, Kat Smith knew she needed to live around the world. Her life would never be the same.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kat Smith, 35, who has lived abroad since 2015. Smith, the founder of Away Abroad, a website for female travelers, currently lives in Trieste, Italy, with her husband. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI think people don't always believe me when I say it, but living abroad has always felt more fun to me. I love the cultural challenges, the language barrier, the different food, and the process of figuring out the day-to-day.\n\nI'm originally from Conyers, a small town just outside Atlanta. In high school, I moved to Athens, Georgia. It was a typical small, suburban place — there weren't many people traveling internationally. Certainly, no one was moving abroad the way I eventually did.\n\nWhen I was 18, between graduating from high school and starting at the University of Georgia, my parents basically forced a gap semester on me. They came home from a dinner party one night and were like, \"Instead of going to college, you're going to Guatemala.\"\n\nI did not want to go, but hindsight is 20/20.\n\nGoing to Guatemala was the best thing that could have happened to me. While I was there, I met a Peace Corps volunteer. Spending time with them and being in the country changed my perception of the world and opened my eyes to what was even possible.\n\nWhen I got back and started university, I met with an advisor who had also served in the Peace Corps. After talking with him more, it just felt like the right path for me.\n\nIn 2013, almost exactly a month after I graduated from university, I joined the Peace Corps and left the US for Ecuador.\n\nAt the time I applied, you didn't really have much say in where you went. I basically said, \"Send me anywhere in the world,\" and they sent me to Ecuador. During training, they placed me in a community based on my skill set and the community's needs.\n\nI ended up in Tumbaco for 3 months for training and then in Arenillas, a really small town in the southwestern province of El Oro, where I lived for about two years.\n\nWhen my service ended, a friend of mine and I hitchhiked through the Peruvian Amazon and ended up working at an eco-lodge in the middle of the rainforest for a few months.\n\nAround that time, in 2015, my dad was like, \"Okay, you haven't been home in almost three years. I'm buying you a ticket—you're coming to visit.\" So, begrudgingly, I went back to the US.\n\nI remember feeling reverse culture shock more intensely than I ever felt culture shock. It completely caught me off guard. All of a sudden, the US didn't feel like home anymore. I felt like I didn't fit in.\n\nI also knew I wasn't the same person I'd been when I'd left, which created an internal conflict. I don't want to be that dramatic, but I had a different mindset, and trying to be the old me was hard.\n\nOver the years, I've lived in Panama City, been to Colombia, worked on a yacht in the South of France, and backpacked through Eastern Europe for a couple of months. I also backpacked between Vietnam and Thailand, and taught English in South Korea.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of all of that, I fell in love and got married in Colombia in 2018. Not long after, my husband and I moved to Vietnam, where we stayed for three years while I was teaching English, before leaving in 2021 because of COVID restrictions.\n\nAfter Vietnam, we went back to the US for a while. We bought a van, converted it, and traveled up and down the West Coast. I loved nature, but after a few months, I was ready to leave again.\n\nSo we tried Albania next. We stayed for a couple of months, but it didn't feel like the right long-term fit. Instead, we kept moving and spent time around the Balkans — traveling through Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia.\n\nLooking back, I've made a few mistakes along the way.\n\nOne of the things I cringe about most is how I treated my friends and family back home. I was pretty insensitive about their choices — friends who just wanted to graduate, buy a house 10 minutes from where they grew up, and settle into a typical, structured, no-surprises kind of life. I think I judged that because I felt like what I was doing was so extravagant.\n\nBut honestly, I was a bit of a brat about accepting other people's paths.\n\nI did something similar with my family, too. I didn't really consider what it meant for them when I left. I was so focused on what it meant for me, and not necessarily on how it was affecting everyone around me.\n\nIn 2023, we moved to Italy for a job opportunity for my husband. He has an EU Blue Card — basically a work permit for skilled workers — and I'm on a family reunification visa linked to his.\n\nWe've been living in Trieste for the past 2.5 years. Trieste is fantastic, but it's also an up-and-coming city that's gotten really expensive, fast. Even in the short time we've been here, we've seen a big jump in costs. Our rent, for example, increased by $308 a month, which still feels crazy.\n\nOur apartment is really nice: one bedroom, one bath, open floor plan, and close to everything. I'm really into nature, and we have a beautiful view of the sea and the hills. We were paying $1,423 a month, and now it's $1,732.\n\nThat rising cost of living is one of the reasons we started looking at other places — just to get more for our money.\n\nWe ended up buying an apartment in Belluno for $260,955, and we'll move in April. Belluno is a much smaller town, kind of a gateway to the Dolomites, and it sits north of Venice. We're big mountain people, and the Dolomites are genuinely my happy place. Being closer to them means we can hike and snowboard more regularly without a long drive, which was a huge perk for us.\n\nAlthough we didn't choose Italy initially and only moved here for my husband's job, there are a lot of reasons we've chosen to stay rather than move on like we typically do after a few years.\n\nItaly has a strategic geographic position. I love living smack dab in the middle of the world. Not only is this exciting adventure-wise, but it's also meant more people have been able to visit us, including our parents, who aren't as keen on the long-haul flights.\n\nOn top of that, the culture clicks for both of us. As an intercultural couple, we have different triggers, things we look for, and things we want to avoid. Northern Italy has provided the perfect balance for us.\n\nI really hope Italy can be our home base, at least for the foreseeable future. But I also know myself: If, two years from now, it doesn't feel right, we'll pivot. I'm not setting a deadline; it's more about whether it still feels like home. And right now, it does.",

    "description": "Esther Perel, a renowned couples therapist, author, and podcast host structures her work day to include socializing as much as possible.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Esther Perel, a renowned couples therapist, bestselling author, and podcast host. Perel lives in New York City and travels the world for speaking engagements. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have been interested in psychology since I was about 14. I wanted to understand myself, my family, and my surroundings. So, becoming a therapist was quite an obvious choice for me.\n\nI started working with large groups, then moved to families, then couples. In particular, I was interested in interracial, intercultural, inter-religious couples and families — families in cultural transition. What is sexuality in the culture, and how does it enter into the family culture and the couple's relationship?\n\nI spent 35 years in my therapy office, alone. At one point, I started to feel that the office was getting small. Therapy is not democratic; it's not accessible to many people who need it.\n\nI wrote \"Mating in Captivity\" (2006) and \"The State of Affairs\" (2017). Then, I started bringing people into the sessions, and that's the podcast. \"Where Should We Begin?\" was doing live anonymous couples therapy sessions at scale, all over the world, for free.\n\nIt's not therapy, but a way to bring the insights that happen in the office into the public square. Then I decided to step out of the office myself and go onstage to recreate the experience at scale with thousands of people.\n\nI created a card game during the pandemic because I wanted to give people something playful that helps them connect. I recorded courses on conflict and desire because for every book I wrote, people would then say, \"And then what do I do?\"\n\nRight now, I am working on a new tour and a few other projects that I'm keeping to myself until they happen. Although I live primarily in New York and spend a few months a year in Europe, I travel in bursts, and always with either a family member or friend. I mix pleasure and purpose, work and personal. I'm going on an adventure with someone.\n\nI still have a therapy practice, one or two days a week. I've never stopped because I think it's very important to keep close to the craft, and not just to become a storyteller.\n\nI get up around 7 to 7:30 a.m. As soon as I wake up, I need to move to feel calm. It's a bit of a paradox.\n\nI do yoga four times a week. I'm part of a group of friends who started practicing together during the pandemic. For six years, we've never missed a class. We do it in person and on Zoom, so wherever one is, one can join. It's very grounding and strengthening.\n\nA bunch of us in the group happen to be teachers. I became one by default — I've never been trained as one, but I know how to repeat what my teachers have said to me.\n\nOn other days, I exercise, also with a friend. It motivates me and makes me accountable. Alone, I would be a lazy bum. I'd be getting ready, then spend the day futzing around and never get there.\n\nI very rarely get a coffee outside. I like to make it, sit down, and look at who texted me in the middle of the night, since people in my life are in different time zones. Who am I waking up to this morning?\n\nFor breakfast, I eat grapefruit, yogurt, and berries, and on occasion, eggs.\n\nI don't start work before 10 a.m. so that I have time to do what I like to do in the morning. I work partly at home and partly at Magnificent Noise's podcast studio.\n\nMy work days are nicely segmented:\n\nI try to create a focus for the day so that I don't have to see patients and go to meetings when I'm in clinical mode. Still, I sometimes have to switch modes in such drastic ways that it's a bit jarring.\n\nIt's a lot to juggle. I have an amazing team of people that I work with, who are very knowledgeable about the different things that I do. I cannot do any of this alone.\n\nWhen I was exclusively working as a clinician, I often would say, \"I miss working with others.\" Now, I'm never just doing one thing. It's a very rich day, which I really missed back then.\n\nMuch changed after the pandemic. I don't have a practice office anymore. I practice from my home or go to other people's offices.\n\nSometimes, we meet outside, and we walk.\n\nIt's fantastic. When you're in motion, you experience your thoughts differently, and you respond differently to the person talking to you. You're not face-to-face; you're side-by-side, so the parallel position gives you a whole other interaction.\n\nSometimes, we stop, we sit down. We continue the session by the river. There's water floating by. That too is very calming. There's this intersection between beauty and calmness and motion and the depth of what you are reflecting upon at the same time.\n\nWhat I like about clinical work is that every human being is a whole universe opening up to you. It's an endless exploration. The psyche, the mind, the body, the painful and the joyful, the breaches and the connection, the people who suffered from too much attention, and the people who suffered from too little. I can't think of a subject that would be more diverse in its interests.\n\nI don't always take a lunch break. In general, I prefer to end the day earlier.\n\nI have very few routines when it comes to food. Most of my meals are home-cooked. I eat lots of nuts and fruit. I'm a major bread-and-cheese person, and sometimes a slice of both is a good lunch, too.\n\nToday, I cooked up a bunch of different vegetables. I made some chicken so it would last for two or three days. I am a big soup maker in the winter, and I like salads in the summer.\n\nI usually stop working around 5 p.m.\n\nI love movies. I love theater. I go with friends into the world to see art — paintings and performances. Probably, I'm at a theater two or three times a week. I saw the Broadway production of \"Oedipus\" twice. I just thought it was pertinent, current, exquisitely well-acted, beautifully written.\n\nI socialize, too. Meeting people for dinner, inviting them over. When I spend so much time on a screen, I like to see people in real life.\n\nI'm in a movie and book club as well.\n\nWe recently read \"Train Dreams\" by Denis Johnson. We've read Roberto Bolaño, Rachel Cusk. We're reading Muriel Spark for next month.\n\nFor the movie club, we just discussed \"The Worst Person in the World\" — I had just seen \"Sentimental Value\" by the same director, Joachim Trier. We've done the movie club every three weeks for the past six years — that's a lot of movies with a great group of people who have a lot to say.\n\nPlus, you have your homework, and you're not just going to read articles and social stuff. These little structured pieces of my life that actually invite real exploration and connection.\n\nAt night, I talk to my husband. I also go to look at the messages that I didn't catch for the day. I often spend the last half hour or hour on my phone. It's not the best. I sit on the couch, and I look at my calendar for tomorrow and who I'm meant to connect with.\n\nI rarely scroll through social media. I'm in a few different WhatsApp groups, so I see what's happening in my social world. That's how I unwind.\n\nI'm quite relational. Fundamentally, if I want to do something, I instantly think, \"Who do I want to do this with?\" Then, I organize the activity with that sociability. They are completely intertwined.",

    "fullText": "FRANKFURT, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank unveiled plans on Saturday to widen access to its euro liquidity backstop, making it globally available and permanent in a bid to bolster the international role of the single currency.\n\nAccess to such repo lines, a crucial source of funding during times of market stress, has been limited to just a handful of mostly Eastern European countries but ECB President Christine Lagarde has long seen the facility as a tool to boost the euro’s global reach.\n\n\"The ECB needs to be prepared for a more volatile environment,\" Lagarde said at the Munich Security Conference, the first time an ECB chief spoke at the event.\n\n\"We must avoid a situation where that stress triggers fire sales of euro-denominated securities in global funding markets, which could hamper the transmission of our monetary policy,\" she said in announcing the new facility.\n\nThe facility, to be available from the third quarter of 2026, will be open to all central banks around the world, provided they are not excluded for reputational reasons, such as money laundering, terrorist financing or international sanctions, the ECB said.\n\n\"This facility also reinforces the role of the euro,\" Lagarde said. \"The availability of a lender of last resort for central banks worldwide boosts confidence to invest, borrow and trade in euros, knowing that access will be there during market disruptions.\"\n\nUsed when banks are unable to obtain funding on the market, the repo line allows lenders to borrow euros from the ECB against high-quality collateral, to be repaid at maturity along with interest.\n\nUnlike previous lines, which had to be extended from time to time, the new facility will provide standing access for up to 50 billion euros.\n\nWith investors reassessing the dollar’s status due to the unpredictable nature of U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic policy, Lagarde has argued this was the time for the euro to gain market share, but this required a revamped financial and economic architecture.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve maintains a similar tool, called the FIMA Repo Facility, which essentially protects the Treasury market since stress might otherwise force lenders to sell government bonds below market value.\n\n\"These changes aim to make the facility more flexible, broader in terms of its geographical reach and more relevant for global holders of euro securities,\" the ECB said in a statement.\n\nSuch a guaranteed access to euros could naturally increase demand for euro-denominated assets and encourage banks outside the 21-nation euro zone to buy assets from the bloc.\n\nFor a factbox on the details of the new repo facility, click here.",

    "fullText": "The cancellation of the official House delegation to the annual Munich Security Conference has drawn pushback from Democrats who still plan to attend, even as it’s upended a decades-long tradition of robust bipartisan participation in the high-profile global policy forum.\n\nA House leadership aide told The Hill that cancelling congressional delegations (CODEL) is standard operating procedure during the shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nBut House Democrats have sharply criticized Republicans for the cancellation, arguing that attending the conference is critical to restoring the United States’ standing with allies amid the Trump administration’s aggressive foreign policy approach.\n\n“Because of the Republican shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, because Republicans refuse to make any compromises or any changes to ICE after the deadly murders of Alex Pretti and Renee Good, we have a shutdown, and therefore, we cannot go on official CODELS. I’ve decided, along with a number of my Democratic colleagues, to go anyway,” Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) said in a video statement on Thursday.\n\nAnsari said she wants to make clear that Trump “does not define the United States, that we are committed to our allies, to NATO, to U.S. credibility and leadership around the world.”\n\nRep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), who also attended the conference, told NBC News on Friday that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had ordered the hotel reservations, military flights and credentials lawmakers had for the conference to be cancelled.\n\nCrow called it the “wrong move,” NBC reported, saying that U.S. officials other than Secretary of State Marco Rubio need to be present at the event.\n\nWhile lawmakers aren’t prohibited from going and House Democrats are still widely planning to attend the conference on their own dime, it is unclear whether any House Republicans will be present. Unlike Johnson’s move to cancel the delegation, several bipartisan Senate delegations will still be attending the conference.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will be attending in her “personal capacity” as a member of the Munich Security Conference Advisory Council, her spokesperson Ian Krager told The Hill in a statement.\n\n“Her presence reflects decades of leadership on transatlantic collaboration and underscores the importance of sustained U.S. partners at a moment of profound geopolitical uncertainty,” Krager said. “Speaker Pelosi remains committed to strengthening partnerships that advance collective security, economic prosperity and democratic governance.”\n\nSome of the other House Democrats present at the conference include Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and Sarah McBride (D-Del.).\n\n“Some of us are going over anyway on our own dime to reassure and thank our allies,” Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, had posted on X.\n\nOcasio-Cortez used a panel discussion at the conference on Friday to prop up the working class and accuse Trump of tearing “apart the transatlantic partnership.”\n\n“One of the reasons why not just myself, but … many Democrats that are here as well, is because we want to tell a larger story, that what is happening is indeed very grave, and we are in a new era, domestically and globally,” Ocasio-Cortez said on the panel, when asked about the significance of her representing the U.S. at the conference.\n\nRep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), a senior member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Politico that it’s a “shame” lawmakers could miss the key conference.\n\nHowever, he added that: “It’s a very responsible position by the Speaker which matches the irresponsibility of the Senate Democrats to shut down the government. And so the responsible act is to be ever available to end the shutdown.”\n\nThe White House and Democrats have been at an impasse over a deal to fund DHS. A stopgap measure that temporarily funds the department for two weeks expired on Feb. 13.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have been demanding sweeping reforms to the White House’s immigration tactics, including an overhaul of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, after agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minnesota. While the White House sent a counterproposal to Democrats on their DHS demands, the minority leaders have argued that the offer falls short.\n\nThe Senate left Washington on Thursday without reaching a deal and DHS shut down at midnight.",

It's one of the bigger events on the LET and it's kind of a like a home event for me.\"\n\nHull started the day three shots off the lead and made the turn in two under for the day.\n\nShe dropped a second shot of the round on the 10th, but picked up four in the next three holes, with her charge including a 60-foot eagle putt on the par-five 12th.\n\nFurther birdies followed at the par-five 15th and 18th, putting the onus on her rivals to match her.\n\nIwai, who had moved into a share of the lead with a golden touch on the greens, bogeyed the 17th with a damaging three-putt that left her two shots back.\n\nAnd, after Alexander also bogeyed the penultimate hole, Hull was finally able to celebrate, even after Iwai birdied the last for a 67.\n\nMeanwhile, 24-year-old Rhodes kicked off her campaign to make September's Solheim Cup team with a superb final round that included six birdies and just one dropped shot.",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group C, Kolkata\n\nScotland 152 (19.4 overs): Berrington 49 (32); Rashid 3-36, Archer 2-23\n\nEngland 155-5 (18.2 overs): Banton 63 (41), Bethell 32 (28); Davidson 1-12\n\nEngland had another wobble but got their T20 World Cup campaign back on track with a five-wicket victory over Scotland in Kolkata - a result that leaves the Scots on the brink of a group-stage exit.\n\nAfter dismissing Scotland for 152 on a good batting pitch, England lost Phil Salt and Jos Buttler in the first two overs and were 86-4 when Harry Brook was caught for four.\n\nDefeat would have had England facing a humiliating early exit but Tom Banton fought his way through the tension to play the most important innings of his international career to date and secure victory with 10 balls to spare.\n\nHe broke the shackles by hitting spinner Mark Watt for consecutive sixes and finished 63 not out around contributions of 32 from Jacob Bethell and 28 by Sam Curran.\n\nScotland's application with the ball and in the field was admirable. They were ultimately punished for not taking advantage of the platform set by captain Richie Berrington's 49, which had his side 113-3 in the 13th over.\n\nAdil Rashid overcame an expensive start to finish with 3-36 for England, while an improved Jofra Archer took two wickets in the powerplay and finished with 2-23.\n\nIt means England will confirm their place in the Super 8s by beating Italy on Monday.\n\nScotland play Nepal in their final group match on Tuesday but may have been eliminated by other results by then.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\n\nHaving been lucky to escape against Nepal and been convincingly beaten by West Indies, England are still searching for a complete performance at this World Cup.\n\nThey have won World Cups before despite group-stage defeats but improvement is needed if they are to threaten the best in this tournament.\n\nScotland's opening bowling consisted of Brandon McMullen and Brad Currie's medium pace. They found far more movement than England's bowlers and Salt and Buttler sliced catches to the off-side ring for two and three respectively.\n\nThere were no boundaries off the bat in the first four overs.\n\nBethell brought some calm with his patient knock but England were ultimately grateful to Banton who had not lived up to his talents in his previous 36 internationals.\n\nUnlike Bethell, who was caught trying to help a scoop over short fine leg, and Brook - dismissed in the same fashion - Banton played straight and as a result looked more comfortable than any other batter.\n\nHe took only six from his first 10 deliveries and did not hit a boundary until his 11th.\n\nCurran hit two sixes to accelerate England towards the finish line and Will Jacks hit the winning runs, but it was Banton who delivered when England needed him most.\n\nThough Scotland's score always looked 20 runs below par, England were troubled at one stage.\n\nThey took three wickets in the powerplay, including Archer having the dangerous George Munsey and number three Brandon McMullen miscuing pulls in a lively opening spell of three overs, but Berrington countered impressively.\n\nBerrington, a good player of slow bowling, was particularly aggressive against England's spinners. He hit Rashid for two fours and a six in his second over and was the aggressor in a partnership of 71 with Tom Bruce.\n\nAt 113-3 in the 13th over, 190 was Scotland's target. Instead, the wicket of Bruce resulted in the innings sliding away.\n\nHe slog-swept Liam Dawson to deep square leg for 24 - one of six batters to wastefully pick out fielders in the deep.\n\nIn the next over Rashid pinned the sweeping Berrington in front as England's leg-spinner, having gone wicketless for 26 runs in his first two overs, took 3-10 in his second spell.\n\nDawson, who took 2-34, added the wicket of Michael Leask, also caught in the deep.\n\nScotland's collapse 5-14 in 3.3 overs ultimately denied them the 30 runs that could have kept them alive in this tournament.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have recovered the services of Harry Maguire, who resumed training following a brief injury scare.\n\nThe England international has been a mainstay at the back since recovering from the thigh issue that kept him on the sidelines for more than a month.\n\nHis return to action coincided with the appointment of Michael Carrick, who immediately fielded him as a regular starter alongside Lisandro Martinez.\n\nThe duo started at the back in the 44-year-old first five games in charge, producing brilliant displays on most occasions. Maguire, in particular, has been hailed for his ‘colossal’ outing in the 3-2 victory over Arsenal last month.\n\nHowever, fans feared that the Sheffield native’s momentum may have been interrupted by a new physical problem, as he was forced to leave the pitch in the 68th minute against West Ham United.\n\nAfter the midweek contest at the London Stadium, Maguire provided a positive update on his condition, telling members of the media that he’s feeling ‘alright’.\n\nThis initial relief has now been confirmed, as the big centre half was spotted training alongside his teammates on Saturday.\n\nThe official Man Utd X account posted videos of the morning session at Carrington, and Maguire could be clearly seen joining training from the get-go, putting all injury fears to bed.\n\nDue to their premature FA Cup exit, United will have an idle weekend, while the majority of other Premier League clubs will take part in the 4th round.\n\nCarrick’s men won’t play until February 23, when they host Everton for a Premier League contest at Old Trafford.\n\nHarry Maguire smiles while warming up for Man United at Old Trafford before kick-off. (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nTherefore, this extended break will allow Maguire and others to fully recover their powers before the next one.\n\nCarrick had also revealed that Mason Mount is expected to be back for the clash against the Toffees. Matthijs de Ligt remains slightly behind the English midfielder in his rehabilitation process, but he’s also hoping to be fit enough for a call-up.",

    "description": "Sri Lanka braced itself for massive losses after Pakistan’s boycott calls, but now awaits a thrilling clash on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Colombo, Sri Lanka — Almost 30 years ago today, India and Pakistan formed a combined cricket team to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in an unprecedented moment of unity in the sport’s history.\n\nThe two age-old rivals put aside their differences and came together in an act of solidarity to support a fellow South Asian team, who faced the threat of match boycotts in a tournament they had battled hard to host.\n\nIndia versus Pakistan is the most highly marketed fixture at every multination tournament – the World Cup, Asia Cup or Asian Games – whether it’s a men’s, women’s or Under-19 event.\n\nFew sporting events globally carry the weight and anticipation of an India-Pakistan cricket match. So, when Pakistan’s government ordered its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.\n\nIt also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.\n\nA week of negotiations led to a dramatic late U-turn by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.\n\nBut what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.\n\nWith the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.\n\nFor a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2022, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.\n\nThe tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.\n\nHotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.\n\n“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.\n\n“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”\n\nIt’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.\n\nThese short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.\n\nAnother relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.\n\nAsanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.\n\n“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.\n\n“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”\n\nThe lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.\n\nSo while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.\n\nPakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.\n\nThe reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.\n\nSri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.\n\nSri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.\n\nSri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.\n\nWhen Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.\n\n“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.\n\n“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”\n\nA little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.\n\nCome Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Colombo\n\nIreland 235-5 (20 overs): Tucker 94* (51); Ahmed 3-33\n\nOman 139 all out (18 overs): Kaleem 50 (29); Little 3-16\n\nStand-in captain Lorcan Tucker hit an unbeaten 94 to lead Ireland to a 96-run win over Oman at the T20 World Cup.\n\nHaving lost their opening games against Sri Lanka and Australia, Ireland needed both victory and a boost to their net run-rate to have any hopes of progression.\n\nWhat was to be a first win at the tournament since beating England in 2022 looked in doubt when Tucker came to the crease with his side 25-2, but the wicketkeeper equalled his highest score in the format to power Ireland to 235-5 by the end of their innings.\n\nDespite Aamir Kaleem providing a half-century, Oman wickets fell quickly with Josh Little leading the way for Ireland's bowlers with three wickets for 16 runs.\n\nIreland play Zimbabwe on Tuesday (09:30 GMT) still needing a win and other results to go their way if they are to make the Super 8s.\n\nBrilliant Muzarabani helps Zimbabwe stun Australia\n\nWhile Tucker filled in for the injured Paul Stirling as captain, it was Tim Tector who opened the batting in place of the Belfast man.\n\nIreland's struggles for a top-order partnership, however, continued with Shakeel Ahmed doing the damage.\n\nThe 38-year-old, celebrating wickets in the style of Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, accounted for Tim Tector (5), Ross Adair (14) and Harry Tector (14) during the powerplay with Ireland reeling somewhat on 47-3 after six overs.\n\nWith Curtis Campher, who provided 12 off seven balls, not sticking around either, it was up to all-rounder Gareth Delany to team up with Tucker and give Ireland's innings some much needed momentum.\n\nThe pair's 101-run partnership off 56 balls took Ireland from what was a shaky start to a position that would lead to their highest ever T20 international total.\n\nWhile there were seven boundaries among Delany's 56 off 30 balls, it was Tucker's efforts that were to provide the headline act.\n\nAn inventive knock that featured 10 fours and four sixes, the only scare came when, with Ireland 67-4, Vinayak Shukla appeared to have him stumped only for the third umpire to judge that Oman's wicketkeeper had dislodged the bails without the ball in his hand.\n\nTucker certainly made the most of the reprieve, pressing on for what is the best knock of the tournament so far, eclipsing Tim Seifert's 89 against UAE for New Zealand.\n\nHe would end the innings frustratingly stranded at the non-striker's end, denied the chance for what would have been a first T20 century as George Dockrell, who plundered 35 from nine balls, faced the final three deliveries.\n\nIf 93 runs in the final five overs of Ireland's innings had appeared to leave the result a formality, Heinrich Malan's side will have had improving their net run-rate on the mind too.\n\nOman were 63-2 after the powerplay, and brought up their 100 in the 11th over, both ahead of the pace set by Ireland, but wickets feel too cheaply to ever bring such a target into realistic focus.\n\nAamir Kaleem led the way with the 44-year-old becoming the oldest player in T20 World Cup history to make a half-century, reaching his fifty in 28 deliveries to break the record set by team-mate Muhammad Nadeem against Sri Lanka only on Thursday.\n\nMost encouraging for Ireland's bowlers was the performance of Josh Little.\n\nThe seamer, who had been without a wicket in his past four T20 internationals, finished with figures of 3-16.\n\nThe 26-year-old, whose 4-23 against Sri Lanka at this tournament in 2021 built his reputation as Ireland's most dangerous quick, had been left out of the side for the opening two games this time around.\n\nBowling with a menacing pace throughout, the left-armer was denied a wicket with his fifth delivery when Ireland's struggles in the field at this tournament continued as Delany dropped Aamir in the deep.\n\nHe came back, however, to claim the wickets of Muhammad Nadeem, Jiten Ramanandi, Nadeem Khan to take away any remote hopes of an Oman victory.",

Homan, for whom Olympic gold has proved elusive throughout a stellar career, was floundering. One in the ninth left them needing a miracle but GB were not of a mind to let this one go.\n\n\"Becca played absolutely fantastically - we all did - but it's great to see Becca when she's like that and I'm sure she'll be on a roll now,\" Jackson added.\n\nThe women will look to continue their unlikely revival on Sunday against another fancied rink, Sweden (13:05 GMT).\n\nThey have six more round-robin matches to play, with a total of five or six wins potentially enough to clinch a semi-final place.\n\nAnd GB's men are next on the ice, playing their fourth match of nine against Czech Republic at 13:05 GMT on Saturday.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "SURPRISE—Arizona began last season with three consecutive losses but ended up making it to the College World Series. Something to consider when evaluating the first result of the season.\n\nThe Wildcats dropped their 2026 opener on Friday night, losing 10-7 to Stanford at Surprise Stadium. It snapped a 6-game win streak against their former Pac-12 rivals.\n\nArizona pitchers combined to issue seven walks, something they only did four times all of last season. Three of those were by starter Owen Kramkowski, a career high for the junior right-hander, who didn’t make it out of the 4th inning.\n\nStanford also stole six bases, part of an inauspicious UA debut behind the plate for catcher Roman Meyers, who also was charged with catcher’s interference that led to the Cardinal’s first run.\n\n“Those are things we’ve got to take care of,” said UA coach Chip Hale, who laid equal blame on UA pitchers not being quick enough to the plate. “We’ve got to be more accountable. Teams last year I think were a little leery to run on us with (Adonys Guzman) behind the plate, he had a good reputation. And Roman throws as well as anybody in the country, we just have to give him a chance.”\n\nArizona had 11 hits, its most in a season opener since 2019, but also struck out 15 times. The Wildcats had won 28 consecutive games when scoring at least seven runs including 24-0 in 2025.\n\nKramkowski, who is a projected high draft pick, allowed five runs (four earned) in 3.1 innings. He gave up six hits but three were not well hit.\n\n“He threw way too many pitches in the first couple innings,” Hale said. “I think there was probably what, four balls that literally were squibbers, bloopers. It just adds up on his pitch count, and the first time out, we’re not gonna let him go past the 80-pitch mark. He was not at all as effective as he was last year.”\n\nBut Kramkowski was off the hook after Arizona scored three in the bottom of the 4th to tie it at 5. Oregon State transfer Carson McEntire had an RBI single and Milwaukee transfer Tyler Bickers followed with a 2-run single.\n\nStanford broke it open with a 5-run 6th against a pair of transfer relievers. Nolan Straniero walked three and allowed a 2-run triple, leaving down 8-5, then lefty Patrick Morris gave up a 2-run homer.\n\nThe UA got two back in the bottom of the 6th on back-to-back homers by Meyers and McEntire, though Meyers’ shot was almost erased. Stanford appealed to second base saying Meyers missed the bag, with the 2B umpire calling him out, but Hale challenged and the call was overturned.\n\nThe UA couldn’t do anything else at the plate after that, despite three scoreless innings of relief from senior Matthew Martinez with seven strikeouts. The Wildcats got the leadoff man on in the 7th and 9th, doing so in all but two innings, but also struck out seven times in the last three frames.\n\n“I think we battled, we gave ourselves a chance,” Hale said. “They threw a couple freshmen that we didn’t have any info on, and they did terrific. They outplayed us tonight.”\n\nBickers, McEntire, Meyers and Andrew Cain each had two hits, with Bickers and McEntire driving in two runs each. McEntire, a Peoria native, was playing on the same field where he made his collegiate debut last season with Oregon State.\n\n“I thought it was a good game overall,” McEntire said. “There’s some stuff that we work on as a team, and me personally, that I will go down and talk to some coaches about and see what we can do better tomorrow.”\n\nMcEntire and his new team will be facing his old team on Saturday, as the Wildcats get the Beavers at 2 p.m. MT. OSU, which lost 5-3 to Michigan on Friday, regularly begins its season at Surprise Stadium and the vast majority of the 5,683 in attendance for the day were wearing orange.\n\n“The Beavs come out and show this place out every year,” McEntire said. “This is a thing for them, and it’s awesome to see their fans.”\n\nSophomore righty Smith Bailey will start for Arizona against OSU lefty Ethan Kleinschmit.",

    "fullText": "Fabio Wardley will make the first defence of his world heavyweight title against Daniel Dubois in all-British affair on Saturday, 9 May in Manchester.\n\nThe 31-year-old was crowned WBO champion in November when Oleksandr Usyk relinquished the belt instead of making a mandatory defence against the Ipswich fighter.\n\nDubois has previously held the IBF title and his meeting with Wardley at the Co-Op Live Arena pits two rivals who are known for their devastating punching power.\n\nWardley, who has won 20 of his 21 professional fights, including 19 by way of knockout, said: \"I've never been in this game to play around. I'm committed to big fights only.\n\n\"I'm the champion, this is a voluntary defence, and I chose this.

    "description": "Matt Weston cements his status as the best skeleton racer in the world, making history by winning Olympic gold in emphatic fashion in Cortina and securing Team GB’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Games.",
    "fullText": "Standing at the top of the winding Cortina sliding track with Olympic gold in his sights, Matt Weston knew what he had to do.\n\nHaving laid the foundations for skeleton gold on Thursday - tidying up errors from his first run to produce a statement second, each time setting the track record - the Briton merely needed more of the same on Friday.\n\nWhat he produced was not only a masterclass in sliding but also a remarkable display of composure and focus to clinch gold - Team GB's first medal of the Games - and cement his place at the top of the sport.\n\n\"It means everything. It means a hell of a lot to me personally, I've worked so hard for this,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But everyone back home - my fiancee, my family, my friends, everyone who has sacrificed everything for this. I've missed funerals, birthdays, everything for this moment. It feels amazing. Hopefully I made you proud.\"\n\nWeston set a track record on all four of his runs and could have eased off in his final attempt having already built a significant margin of 0.39 seconds, but ramped things up on what was ultimately a victory lap lasting 55.61secs, finishing with a sensational overall time of 3:43.33.\n\nIt left an almost impossible task for the chasing pack and Germany's Axel Jungk finished 0.88secs behind to take silver, while compatriot and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer secured bronze, 1.07secs behind Weston.\n\nThe pressure to deliver was there. The 28-year-old from Redhill was the heavy favourite to top the podium in Italy having dominated the sport in the past four-year cycle, but no British man had won an Olympic skeleton gold medal before.\n\nHe also carried the weight of Team GB teetering on the edge of overall disappointment at the Games, having been tipped for a record medal haul at Milan-Cortina but watching those ambitions begin to slip away.\n\nWeston blocked out the noise of 'helmet-gate', of seeing his peer Vladyslav Heraskevych disqualified from the competition just moments before the first heat, and of the disaster that was Beijing 2022, where GB failed to win a skeleton medal for the first time since 2002.\n\nHe put it all aside to add the Olympic crown to his two World Championship titles and three Crystal Globes - the overall World Cup trophies.\n\nFour years ago, it was a different story.\n\nHis overwhelming disappointment at missing out on the Olympic podium almost led to him quitting the sport and he told BBC Sport earlier this year he has had to teach himself to \"love the pressure and expectation\".\n\nFrom speaking to friends and family to knowing when to rest and eating lots of pasta, Weston has figured out the secret to his own success, and now he's reaping the rewards.\n\nThe new champion knows what it feels like to walk away from an Olympics empty-handed, having finished 15th at his maiden Games in Beijing.\n\nKnowing he did not want to feel that again, he has worked on switching his mentality and says that has paved the way for his success.\n\nIn 2023 he became Britain's first men's world champion in 15 years, taking silver the following year but reclaiming his title in 2025.\n\nHis first World Cup title came in 2024 and he has been unrivalled since, earlier this year becoming the first man to defend the trophy twice - winning five of the seven races this season and finishing second in the other two.\n\nArriving at this Games as reigning world, European and World Cup champion, the pressure was on to deliver.\n\n\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston told BBC Sport after run two on Thursday.\n\n\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"\n\nHe represented England at taekwondo as a teenager, winning various medals at national level, but a back injury brought that particular sporting career to an end.\n\nHe was also a gifted rugby player but, like many skeleton racers, it was through a talent identification programme that Weston discovered his love and aptitude for the winter sport nine years ago.\n\nQuickly rising up the sport came with its own issues and, following that disappointing result four years ago, Weston had to learn to embrace the pressure and, once winning became the norm, carry the weight of being the favourite.\n\nThat attitude has served him well in Italy as he has been able to block out the noise, pointing to enjoyment as the key to his success.\n\nIt has not just been on the track where Weston has blocked out the noise.\n\nThe build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by discussion around the British team's desire to a wear a new helmet design in Italy.\n\nThey ultimately lost an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), banning them from wearing their new helmet.\n\nWeston and team-mate Marcus Wyatt, who was also tipped for success but finished ninth, were confident it would not make a difference, pointing to the triumphs they have enjoyed all season.\n\nThat came before Weston saw Ukrainian Heraskevych disqualified moments before the men's competition started on Thursday.\n\nAnd after a week of no medals for the British team in Italy, pressure on Weston gradually increased.\n\nBut he knew what he needed to do to win gold, stating he would settle for nothing less in Cortina.\n\nThat doesn't always mean being the first to arrive at the track and the last to leave.\n\nHe sat out Wednesday's final training runs in favour of a rest, opting for some light stretching and mental respite by speaking to his fiance about anything other than sliding.\n\nPlus, eating a lot of pasta, abiding by his motto \"pasta makes you faster\".\n\nUltimately, skeleton training is tricky, particularly for a British athlete.\n\nWith no ice tracks in Britain - only a push-start track at the University of Bath - a lot of time is spent in the gym working on speed and explosiveness to improve that all-important start.\n\nWith one run down the icy track taking less than a minute, it means the British sliders spend around two and a half hours per year actually completing runs and a lot of time visualising the track, understanding the twists and turns to make for a seamless run.\n\nBut Weston has got his rituals down to a tee and not only is he the first British man to win winter gold since Christopher Dean topped the ice dancing podium alongside Jayne Torvill in 1984, but also the first British man to win skeleton gold.\n\nHis success may not end there, as he partners Amelia Coltman in the mixed team event, newly introduced for Milan-Cortina, on Sunday.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian Vladyslav Heraskevych remain banned from 2026 Winter Olympics skeleton competition after his appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday.\n\nThe slider was banned by ruling body IBSF based on International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules over a dispute concerning a helmet he wanted to wear in the event to honour athletes killed in the war with Russia.\n\nThe court said in a statement following an emergency ruling that the sole arbitrator appointed for this matter \"whilst fully sympathetic to Mr Heraskevyc's commemoration, is bound by rules in the IOC Athlete Expression Guidelines.\"\n\nThe arbitrator considers that these guidelines \"provide a reasonable balance between athletes' interests to express their views, and athletes' interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play.\"\n\nHeraskevych had argued that \"the exclusion is disproportionate, unsupported by any technical or safety violation and causes irreparable sporting harm to him.\"\n\nThe CAS arbitrator said that she was sympathetic with Heraskevych's attempt to \"raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nBut she added that the limitations imposed by the IOC to express views during competitions on the field of play are \"reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness (in mixed zones, in press conferences, on social networks, or in Mr Heraskevych’s case, wearing the helmet during four training runs).\"\n\nHeraskevych had already ruled out racing\n\nEarlier, Heraskevych appeared to have ruled out racing at the Olympics even if he won his appeal against the exclusion.\n\n\"It looks like this train has left,\" the 27-year-old, draped in the Ukrainan flag, told reporters after emerging from a two-and-a-half-hour hearing. \"I cannot do another race so it is done.\"\n\nHis CAS hearing began at a hotel in Milan on Friday and he said he was \"positive\" that his appeal would be upheld.\n\nThe court has set up an ad hoc division to deal with Olympic appeals quickly.\n\nThe first two runs of the Olympic skeleton competition in Cortina took place without Heraskevych, despite him finishing among the top six in all five training runs. The medal runs are scheduled for later on Friday.\n\nA reinstatement would be complicated and the athlete said racing in a symbolic one run was unlikely given the sport is dangerous.\n\n\"From a competitive perspective this makes no sense,\" he said, as he slammed the IOC's \"mockery\" for removing his Games accreditation and then giving it him back despite his racing ban.\n\nHeraskevych had refused repeated warnings from the IOC to give up wearing his helmet.\n\nThe IOC does not allow any kind of political statements in competition. He says this is different as it is a commemoration and not political, something he believes other athletes have been allowed to do.\n\nBut IOC president Kirsty Coventry told a news conference: \"The rules are the rules and I believe in the rules.\n\n\"We have to allow for athletes to express themselves but also to keep athletes safe.\"\n\nShe said political messaging is permitted away from actual competition, in press conferences for example, but that athletes themselves had agreed that the actual events should be neutral.\n\n\"I think he in some ways understood (the rules), but was very committed to his beliefs, but sadly it doesn't change the rules,\" Coventry said.\n\nHeraskevych was excluded shortly before the start of the first run in Cortina d'Ampezzo on Thursday.\n\nIn his appeal, he requested the annulment of the decision and \"that CAS reinstates him in the 2026 [Olympic Winter Games] with immediate effect, or in the alternative, that the athlete performs a CAS supervised official run pending the final decision.\"\n\nAround 40 members of the European Parliament have backed the slider and have written to the IOC, calling the ban wrong.\n\nPress reaction in Europe has also been largely against the IOC, while some Russian media in contrast have said the body has been too soft in giving his accreditation back.\n\nRussia as a nation is not allowed at the Games because of the war, but some individual Russian athletes are competing as neutrals after proving they have not actively supported the conflict.",

    "title": "Putin Didn't Know How Good He Had It",
    "description": "The Russian leader has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.",
    "fullText": "For decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin railed against the world that the United States built after the Cold War. In his account, an international order run by a single power would hinder Russia and produce needless conflict, especially when that power was as self-serving and duplicitous as America.\n\nNow Donald Trump is dismantling the order that Putin had so long abhorred, and a new multipolar world is emerging in its place. Putin had thought he could rise to the top of such a system, in which raw economic and military might outweigh diplomacy and alliances. But he was mistaken: The norms and institutions of the postwar order actually masked Russia’s vulnerabilities. Putin has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.\n\nMoscow had assumed that its immense nuclear arsenal, unparalleled natural resources, and extensive territory in the heart of Eurasia would keep Russia competitive with China and the United States. But these assets have been unable to slow its rapid decline. Russia’s economy is at best one-quarter the size of China’s and America’s, and the gap is growing. Meanwhile, it risks becoming an afterthought in the race for technological supremacy in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing. The country’s economy and technology base are even slowly losing ground to India’s.\n\nTo make the case that his power is still secure, Putin has touted a wide-ranging strategic partnership with China, which Russia has tried to strengthen particularly since 2022. But the relationship has fallen short of his expectations. Bilateral trade increased at first, but it now appears to have plateaued. China has invested little in Russia’s economy, and nowhere near the amount that the West withdrew after Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Because Russia has few other major trading partners, China seems empowered to drive hard bargains: Negotiations on energy deals—one, called Power of Siberia 2, would bring Russian natural gas to China—have stalled because Moscow hasn’t been able to get Beijing to cover enough of the costs.\n\nRead: Putin and Xi are holding the West together\n\nThe war in Ukraine has only deepened Russia’s disadvantages. Before February 2022, some observers thought Russia was one of the world’s premier military powers—an assessment that Ukraine quickly upended. The conflict has now dragged on longer than the Soviet Union’s campaign against Nazi Germany, and it has resulted in more than 1 million Russian casualties, exacerbating the country’s chronic demographic crisis. Even if Putin is able to seize additional territory, most of it will be shelled-out cities and deserted land. Reconstructing it would require billions of dollars that Russia does not have and is unlikely to receive from others.\n\nAs Putin continues to pour resources into the war, he is hemorrhaging international support and influence. Russia’s long-standing partners in Syria and Venezuela have been swept out of power. Meanwhile, former Soviet states have reoriented away from Moscow and toward Western countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan turned to Trump to resolve a simmering dispute over a transportation corridor. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are strengthening their ties with Washington. Moldova has accelerated its political shift toward Europe. Putin believed that the end of the U.S.-led order would help him consolidate power in the former Soviet space. But Russia has been too weak and ineffective to take advantage.\n\nPutin also assumed that a multipolar world would free him from American interference. And indeed, Trump has accommodated Moscow in some ways. His conciliation does not, however, extend to Russia’s energy sector, the foundation of its economy: Last fall, Trump levied wide-ranging sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, the country’s two largest oil producers. The U.S. has also ramped up enforcement against shadow tankers, threatening a primary channel that Russia has used to sidestep sanctions on its oil sales. Trump’s plans to revive Venezuela’s petroleum sector might likewise hurt Russia. Executing those plans may prove more complicated than Trump anticipates, but they could drive Russia’s oil prices below what its federal budget can sustain.\n\nRead: A high-seas gambit humiliates Putin\n\nMoscow is at the mercy of an American president who circumvents traditional channels of power and obliterates the constraints that once regulated their use. For example, Trump could attempt to use his recently constituted Board of Peace to bypass the United Nations Security Council—and Russia’s veto—and muscle through his preferred policy in the Middle East, eroding Moscow’s influence in the region. Thanks to decisions by both Trump and Putin, moreover, the two powers no longer have any functional arms-control agreements. Without these, Trump could choose to accelerate his “Golden Dome” missile-defense program, which Russia fears could undermine its own nuclear deterrence.\n\nTrump’s disdain for international alliances and norms has also begun to reshape Europe in a way that may exacerbate Russia’s weakness. As U.S. security assurances wane, European countries are developing their hard-power capabilities. Germany has committed 100 billion euros to modernize its military, and Poland is building up its armed forces with a goal of amassing 300,000 troops. Putin has long wanted to split the U.S. and Europe. But he might soon find that the continent—which collectively dwarfs Russia in population and wealth—poses a significant challenge even if it doesn’t belong to a U.S.-dominated alliance.\n\nShortly before becoming president in 2000, Putin issued a manifesto explaining how Russia could keep from falling into the second or third rank of world powers. He insisted that America’s global leadership was holding Moscow back. In reality, he didn’t know how good he had it.",

    "description": "NBC Sports' exclusive stylist Amy Acton explains what it takes to dress more than 200 on-air personalities for Olympic coverage around the world.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Acton, the founder and CEO of Acton Styling Group. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the exclusive stylist for NBC Sports, which means I style NBC talent for the Olympics and other shows like Sunday Night Football, the Kentucky Derby, and more.\n\nI've always been interested in fashion. When I was younger, I went to college for all of two weeks because I ran out of outfits — I thought there was no point. It just wasn't for me. After working at health clubs, I became a personal shopper for an upscale clothing boutique, and then moved into television styling.\n\nI began my styling career on television for \"The Montel Williams Show\" in the 90s. I was styling mostly men then. At a photo shoot, a woman asked me to style NBC anchor Hannah Storm. I did closet edits for her and then her wardrobe for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Then I became a stylist for the Sydney Games. Sports changed my life.\n\nI style over 200 people for NBC during its Olympics coverage. It's not just on-air talent, although we style 20 to 25 on-air talent, like Mike Tirico and Rebecca Lowe. We also create the \"venue talent wardrobe package,\" which is what all the reporters and commentators who call the games on-site wear.\n\nWe start two years before the broadcast. As soon as one Olympics ends, we begin preparing for the next one. We have to make sure we are doing everything — from choosing the right colors to selecting clothing that will protect everyone from the environment — Milan's temperature is very different from the 2018 Winter Olympics site, PyeongChang, for example.\n\nA post shared by Trenni (Kusnierek) Casey (@trenninbcs)\n\nTo prepare, we bring all the talent to New York to do a fitting with the looks I pre-pull. Ralph Lauren, the exclusive brand NBC talent wears, has a team on hand to assist the in-studio team with alterations. The venue talent also comes to the studio; we have to make sure they look good and cohesive, and we don't want everyone wearing the same sweater at the same time. We alter the clothes, and then we ship everything where it needs to go. We shipped the clothes to Milan about a month prior to the games.\n\nMy company, Acton Group, doesn't have anything to do with what Team USA athletes wear.\n\nI'm always working in two different time zones. We have studios in the US plus talent in the host country. In the US, the talent is at the NBC Sports Group headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and sometimes at 30 Rock in New York City. The day never really ends. My phone is always on. For example, I went straight from dressing Super Bowl commentators Jason Garrett, Devin McCourty, and Maria Taylor to Milan for the Olympics.\n\nA post shared by Rebecca Lowe (@rebeccalowetv)\n\nIt's highly hands-on and fast-paced — I'm managing fittings, daily dressing, wardrobe organization, and last-minute changes. For studio talent alone, it's 420 looks over two weeks. There are 10 people in Milan, and 10 people in the US on my team. We are a machine, a 24-hour operation in both countries. Between Stamford and Milan, Acton Style Group manages the movement of more than 7,500 Ralph Lauren pieces across all venues.\n\nAs much as I love fashion, it's about making people feel good about themselves. We want talent — who are in front of the biggest audiences in the world — to feel good about themselves.\n\nYou can't put a price tag on that, and you can't always do it for yourself. You need someone else to pump you up and tell you that it looks good.",

    "description": "A practical comparison of Spegel and Harbor for Kubernetes image caching. Learn how to evaluate these solutions based on operational complexity, architecture, and real-world deployment experience.",
    "fullText": "If you’re running Kubernetes clusters and hitting DockerHub rate limits, you need a pull-through image cache, a solution where images pulled by one node are automatically shared with other nodes in the cluster instead of each node pulling them individually from the internet. But which one? In this post, I’ll walk through my decision process comparing Harbor and Spegel for multi-node bare-metal clusters, share real deployment experiences with both solutions, and help you choose the right tool based on your operational constraints.\n\nThis post is for: DevOps engineers and platform teams evaluating pull-through cache solutions for Kubernetes clusters with 10+ nodes, particularly those who manage multiple clusters with limited operational capacity.\n\nProblem solved: Eliminated DockerHub rate limit failures during cluster provisioning for two 10-15 node bare-metal Kubernetes clusters behind NAT.\n\nSolution chosen: Spegel (distributed P2P cache) over Harbor (centralized registry platform).\n\nWhy Spegel won: Zero operational overhead after initial setup, inherently distributed architecture matching our existing cluster design, and minimal infrastructure dependencies. It reuses containerd’s existing storage without requiring databases, certificates, or persistent volumes.\n\n🔗 Spegel on GitHub | Harbor on GitHub\n\nI’ve been running two bare-metal Kubernetes clusters for a university project (one for development, one for production) each spanning 10-15 nodes for a while now. I’ve automated the cluster setup with Ansible, and the infrastructure works well, but we have a recurring pain point: DockerHub rate limits.\n\nThe problem became acute when provisioning new nodes or spinning up fresh clusters. DockerHub’s anonymous rate limit with 200 pulls per 6 hours per IP sounds reasonable but was not sufficient because:\n\nI could authenticate with a DockerHub API key to increase the limit, but that felt like a band-aid: managing credentials across clusters, and still being subject to limits when growing the cluster sizes. So instead, I looked for a different solution.\n\nThe specific issues driving this decision:\n\nAfter some research, I narrowed the field to two fundamentally different solutions.\n\nHarbor is a feature-rich container registry platform that happens to support pull-through caching. It’s a CNCF graduated project with features including vulnerability scanning, image signing, replication, RBAC, multi-tenancy, and proxy caching for upstream registries.\n\nMy first impression: feature-rich and comprehensive. Harbor packs a lot of capabilities, which raises an immediate question: do I run this inside my clusters or as a shared service outside them? For multiple teams or applications, you might run Harbor as centralized infrastructure. For my use case (two isolated clusters) I could run one per cluster.\n\nSpegel is purpose-built for one thing: distributed image mirroring within a Kubernetes cluster. It runs as a DaemonSet, so one pod per node, turning each node into both a consumer and provider of container images. The architecture is stateless and peer-to-peer.\n\nMy first impression: lightweight and focused. Spegel does exactly what I needed, nothing more. The deployment model is obvious: it lives in-cluster, period. No architectural decisions to make about topology or multi-cluster sharing.\n\nFirst impression summary: Harbor is a Swiss Army knife; Spegel is a scalpel.\n\nEvery project differs, and so should the tools that are used.\nIn my project, I followed the following decision criteria:\n\nI’m already running Kubernetes with all its operational complexity: three-node control-plane HA setup, monitoring with Prometheus, logging aggregation, and so on. Adding a solution that integrates naturally with this existing infrastructure means I don’t have to context-switch to a separate system.\n\nKubernetes-native also means using the primitives I already understand: DaemonSets, Services, ConfigMaps. I can reuse my existing monitoring and alerting setup rather than learning a new system’s operational model.\n\nI’m a solo operator on this project, so keep it simple is the philosophy. Every additional system I run is something else that can break, need upgrading, require monitoring, or demand my attention.\n\nThe ideal solution would have low operational complexity: simple to understand, few moving parts, and graceful degradation if something breaks. The caching layer should be optional infrastructure that makes things better, not critical path that can cause outages.\n\nWe’ve invested effort into an automated Kubernetes setup with three control-plane nodes with self-healing capabilities. Caching container images is prone to become a single-point of failure if not done right, so the solution should be fault tolerant. If I’m going to run distributed infrastructure, the caching layer should be distributed too. The architecture should align: distributed container orchestration deserves distributed image distribution.\n\nHarbor comes with many features that, while useful in other contexts, were overkill for my needs:\n\nI needed a pull-through cache, not a full container registry platform.\n\nI installed Harbor on our dev cluster via helm to see what running it actually involves.\n\nHarbor deploys multiple components:\n\nHow pull-through caching works:\n\nThis architecture made sense to me, but configuration was tedious.\n\nDeploying Harbor via Helm was straightforward: the chart is mature and well-documented. Within minutes, I had Harbor running with its database, Redis, and core services (though not in high-availability setup).\n\nConfiguration (the tedious part):\n\nCreating proxy projects requires using the Harbor UI or API. I wanted this automated for reproducibility, so I wrote a post-install Helm hook script using harbor-cli to create the proxy project automatically. Even though it worked in the end, it felt weird that such a fundamental configuration, I had to write the following:\n\nThis felt complex for such a basic use case. I looked into the Harbor Operator project, which seemed promising, but it’s abandoned now. The lack of a maintained declarative config option made Harbor feel less Kubernetes-friendly than I expected.\n\nHere’s where Harbor’s architecture clashed with my requirements. Containerd doesn’t allow pulling from HTTP registries, it requires HTTPS (unless configured otherwise, opening up potential attack vectors). That means Harbor needs TLS certificates.\n\nBut I wanted to keep Harbor cluster-internal to reduce the attack surface. Why expose a caching layer to the internet? This meant\n\nThe complexity kept growing. For a caching layer that’s supposed to make things easier, this was too much complexity.\n\nHigh availability implications:\n\nRunning Harbor properly would need:\n\nWhile doable (we already run cnpg Postgres clusters and Longhorn for replicated volumes), each component adds operational burden. I’d be running a distributed database cluster, a Redis cluster, and coordinating stateful services just to cache some images. It felt overkill.\n\nHarbor runs on Kubernetes but doesn’t feel native to it. It’s a traditional stateful app ported to K8s. You manage databases, configure external services, and work around mismatches between Harbor’s design and Kubernetes patterns (like having to script proxy project creation).\n\nThere’s a Harbor operator, but it’s abandoned. I hope that’ll change in the future and a successor will make the adoption in kubernetes easier.\n\nFor me, this felt overkill for what I needed.\n\nHarbor is centralized by design. All nodes pull through a single Harbor instance (or load-balanced cluster). If Harbor goes down, image pulls fail. Making Harbor HA means running multiple complex stateful services in HA mode, which takes significant effort.\n\nThe architectural question also nagged at me: should I run one Harbor per cluster, or one shared Harbor for both dev and prod? One per cluster duplicates operational overhead. One shared instance couples my environments and requires external networking.\n\nIf you need Harbor’s features, they’re well-executed:\n\nFor teams with dedicated ops capacity, Harbor’s capabilities justify the overhead. For a solo operator who just needs caching, it’s too much.\n\nAfter Harbor’s complexity, Spegel felt like a breath of fresh air.\n\nSpegel takes a radically different approach: each Kubernetes node is both a consumer and provider of container images. There’s no central registry, instead nodes share images peer-to-peer.\n\nDiscovery: Each Spegel instance advertises which image layers (by digest) it has locally to the DHT, refreshing every 9 minutes and updating reactively when containerd creates, updates, or deletes images. When a node needs a layer, it queries the DHT to find which peers have it.\n\nServing: When containerd on Node A requests an image, it’s configured to check Spegel first (via containerd’s registry mirror config). Spegel on Node A queries the DHT, finds that Node B has the layer, fetches it via HTTP from Node B’s Spegel instance (retrying with alternative peers if Node B fails), and returns it to containerd.\n\nFallback: If no peer has the layer (or peers are unreachable), Spegel returns HTTP 404. Containerd then falls back to pulling from the upstream registry (DockerHub, etc.) as normal.\n\nSpegel doesn’t try to be a registry, it’s a distributed mirror of what’s already on your nodes. By reusing containerd’s storage and implementing a peer-to-peer layer on top, Spegel avoids the complexity of traditional registries. Images are served directly from containerd’s existing content store, which eliminates the operational burden of managing separate state, coordinating cross-node consistency, or implementing backup strategies for cached content.\n\nMake sure those sections are configured in the /etc/containerd/config.toml file on every node and restart containerd after:\n\nDeploying Spegel via Helm is trivial:\n\nDefault configuration worked fine for my experimentation, including the DaemonSet deployment.\n\nGetting Spegel working took about 3 hours, not because of Spegel itself, but because of containerd configuration complexity.\n\nSpegel requires containerd to be configured to use it as a registry mirror. This means modifying /etc/containerd/certs.d/ (or equivalent) on each node. Since I use Ansible for cluster provisioning, I needed to automate this. On the one hand, dealing with toml files was surprisingly annoying with Ansible, but the real issue was containerd.\n\nThe containerd config nightmare:\n\nIn my case , containerd has conflicting registry configuration sections due to plugin architecture evolution:\n\nLegacy CRI v1 section (deprecated):\n\nModern gRPC CRI section (correct):\n\nI had both sections in my config file. The empty config_path in the legacy section was silently overriding the correct modern section, so containerd never picked up Spegel’s mirror configuration.\n\nSince containerd 2.0, there’s no way to query containerd for its loaded configuration to validate what’s actually active. I had to debug by trial and error: restarting containerd, checking logs, manually testing image pulls. Compounding the issue, images were already present on nodes from prior pulls, so my initial verification steps falsely succeeded (containerd just used the locally cached image, never trying to go through Spegel).\n\nThe solution: Configure both sections, the outdated and the current one, accordingly. Once this was sorted, Spegel worked flawlessly.\n\nSince deployment, Spegel has required zero maintenance interventions. The absence of external dependencies (databases, certificate infrastructure, persistent volumes) means there are no routine operational tasks beyond standard Kubernetes workload monitoring.\n\nThe failure consequences are minimal since Spegel is designed as purely an optimization layer. If it fails, the cluster continues working normally, just pulling from upstream registries.\n\nMonitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:\n\nSpegel comes with built-in Prometheus metrics and can automatically provision a Grafana dashboard. Here’s the configuration I used in my Helm values:\n\nThis automatically creates a ServiceMonitor for Prometheus to scrape Spegel metrics, and provisions a Grafana dashboard that shows key operational metrics like the container images and image layers that are advertised.\n\nSpegel is genuinely Kubernetes-native:\n\nAfter initial containerd configuration, Spegel requires minimal ongoing operations:\n\nSpegel is architecturally distributed. Every node is both client and server. If three nodes have an image layer and one goes down, the other two continue serving it. There’s no central registry to fail.\n\nThe DHT provides peer discovery with minimal coordination overhead. While leader election occurs for some operations, the short 10-second lease times ensure rapid failover when nodes become unavailable.\n\nSpegel is deliberately focused on distributed image mirroring. Features outside this scope include:\n\nFor my use case (pure pull-through caching) these omissions don’t matter.\n\nAgainst my three criteria (Kubernetes-native integration, minimal operational complexity, and no single point of failure) Spegel was the clear winner.\n\nHarbor’s feature set is impressive, but my use case didn’t need vulnerability scanning, multi-tenancy, image signing, or a full registry platform. What I needed was simple: stop hitting DockerHub rate limits when provisioning nodes.\n\nSpegel solves exactly that problem with minimal complexity: a DaemonSet that reuses containerd’s storage, peer-to-peer image distribution, and graceful fallback to upstream registries. The architecture eliminates the need for databases, certificate infrastructure, and architectural decisions about in-cluster vs. shared infrastructure placement.\n\nFor projects with limited operational capacity, the reduction in operational complexity outweighs the value of unused features.\n\nYour context is different from mine. Here’s how to decide:\n\n1. Kubernetes-Native means more than “runs on Kubernetes”\n\nHarbor deploys on K8s but feels like traditional infrastructure ported over: databases, certificates, centralized state. Particularly, the configuration-as-code functionality is missing. Spegel embraces Kubernetes primitives: DaemonSets, Services, containerd integration. For operational complexity, this distinction matters.\n\n2. Unused features incur operational costs\n\nEvery feature in a system has operational costs: infrastructure to maintain, failure modes to understand, upgrade paths to test. When evaluating tools, consider not just what they can do, but what maintaining those capabilities will cost your team in ongoing operational overhead.\n\n3. Evaluate by deploying, not just reading\n\nDocumentation made Harbor seem reasonable. Deployment revealed friction: certificate management, proxy project configuration, HA complexity. The containerd config issues with Spegel similarly only surfaced hands-on. Test in practice before committing.\n\nThe choice isn’t about “which is better” but which better fits your constraints.\n\nFor my project (two bare-metal clusters, solo operator, DockerHub rate limits) Spegel’s simplicity won. Harbor’s features would have been overhead without corresponding value.\n\nChoose the simplest solution that solves your problem. Upgrade only when complexity is justified by real necessity.\n\nThe lack of required maintenance interventions since deployment validates the choice. Infrastructure requiring minimal operational attention is infrastructure designed appropriately for its context.\n\nThis article documents a real infrastructure decision made while building a Kubernetes-based platform, analyzing the architectural and operational trade-offs between centralized and distributed approaches to container image distribution.",

    "fullText": "McKinsey CEO Bob Sternfels said last month that the firm added 25,000 AI agents to its staff in less than two years.\n\n\"I don't think the number of agents translates directly to value,\" EY's global engineering chief, Steve Newman, told Business Insider. \"In fact, some of the best value that we have is returned by just a handful of agents that are doing the heavy lifting.\"\n\nNewman said EY is more focused on measuring efficiency. He said EY tracks agent value through key performance indicators for productivity, quality, and cost.\n\n\"We chart those month to month, quarter to quarter, and that's what my lens is as to the effectiveness of AI,\" he said.\n\nPwC's chief AI officer, Dan Priest, also recently told Business Insider that he's unmoved by McKinsey's army of AI agents.\n\n\"I think that's probably the wrong measure,\" he said. The value of AI deployment is better measured by the quality — not the quantity — of agents, he said.\n\nSternfels first talked about his firm's onboarding of tens of thousands of agents in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He mentioned it again on an episode of Harvard Business Review's IdeaCast. A McKinsey spokesperson later confirmed to Business Insider that the number was accurate.\n\nSternfels said the firm plans to add more, too. In the next year and a half, every one of its 40,000 human employees will be \"enabled by at least one or more agents,\" he said.\n\nAI has rapidly reshaped the consulting industry in recent years. McKinsey, EY, PwC, and other consulting firms are all racing to both adopt AI internally and position themselves as the go-to for other companies seeking advice on how to do the same.\n\nEY said during an October earnings call that it invests more than $1 billion each year to develop AI-first platforms and products, including building 1,000 AI agents and deploying more than 100 internal AI applications.",

    "description": "When I studied abroad in college, I attended the school that just unseated Harvard as one of the best in the world: Zhejiang University in China",
    "fullText": "In the spring of 2013, I was a sophomore at Tufts University in Massachusetts, soon to declare a dual major in international relations and Mandarin Chinese.\n\nDespite my lofty aspirations to travel the world as a diplomat, my academic career so far had taken me a whopping 25 miles north of my hometown. That's why my university's study abroad program in China appealed to me.\n\nOnce I heard the tales of adventure from the 2012 program's freshly minted graduates, I eagerly applied. That summer, with an acceptance letter in hand, I set off to enroll at Zhejiang University.\n\nUpon landing in Shanghai, my American classmates and I were piled into a minibus for the two-hour drive south to the garden city of Hangzhou — capital of Zhejiang Province and home to Zhejiang University (affectionately referred to by locals as ZheDa).\n\nAfter settling into the dorm, which was a single room with a private bathroom, we were welcomed by our professors with a banquet at the college's canteen — an establishment which was far better than the standardized cafeteria fare that I'd come to know back in New England.\n\nIn our dormitory building, for the equivalent of $2 at the time, one could acquire a filling meal any time of the day — from rice porridge and steamed buns in the morning to stir-fried vegetables and sweet and sour pork tenderloin in the evening, all cooked fresh to order.\n\nZhejiang University was massive and spread across multiple campuses throughout the city. Fortunately for us newcomers, our group at the University's International College was tucked into a leafy hillside on the historic Yuquan campus, offering a slice of Chinese university life at an approachable scale.\n\nAs the sweltering days of summer transitioned into an osmanthus flower-scented autumn, I settled into a new school year. Each morning consisted of four hours of intensive language instruction, followed by at least a few more hours of homework and self-study in the afternoon.\n\nIn addition, each week we'd attend one three-hour lecture on Chinese Peasant History with our advisor, who drew heavily from his own experiences as an academic sent to the countryside during Mao's Cultural Revolution.\n\nI also had a three-hour lecture on the Chinese Legal System with a professor who'd argued many cases within China's rapidly evolving court system.\n\nWhile my application to enroll in Zhejiang University was relatively quick and painless, the road to admission for most of ZheDa's domestic student population was comparatively long and grueling.\n\nFrom an early age, they'd studied for hours at school, followed by hours at buxiban (cram schools), preparing to ace China's notoriously difficult standardized exams, such as the Gaokao. Of the millions who sit for the Gaokao each year, only the highest scorers earn spots in China's most prestigious schools, such as Peking, Tsinghua, and Zhejiang universities.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the academic work ethic that carried students to Zhejiang University did not fall off after admission. While most of my international classmates would study long hours during the week, we would take Friday nights and weekends off to travel within China. But many local students, however, rarely engaged in such frivolous pursuits and were more likely to be studying in the library on a Friday or Saturday evening.\n\nAs exams marked the end of my semester at ZheDa in December 2013, I personally experienced the exacting academic standards that my Chinese classmates were intimately familiar with. While I did pass all of my classes, a minor error in pronunciation or a stroke askew in a written character, mistakes that my Chinese professors back at Tufts may have overlooked, were marked down harshly by my professors at Zhejiang University.\n\nWhen scrolling Instagram in January 2025, I saw a familiar sight in a post from The New York Times — a statue of Mao Zedong standing before Laohe Hill and a familiar library, waving to the students on a verdant Yuquan Campus. Reading on, I was proud to learn that my study abroad alma mater had been named the most productive research university in the world by Leiden Rankings, outpacing even my hometown juggernaut, Harvard.\n\nI cannot say that I am shocked by this development. My semester at ZheDa showed me a culture of academic rigor on a scale few American universities can match, drawing from an academic talent pool far larger than in the US.\n\nMy time at ZheDa forced me out of my comfort zone and exposed me to an academic world significantly different from that in which I'd been educated, and I believe I am a more open-minded learner for it.",

My Twitter is nothing other than football and even my TikTok.\n\n\"My girlfriend absolutely hates it.\"\n\nLeask & Munsey star as Scotland beat debutants Italy\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nThe Office, Willy Wonka & Denmark at Euro 92 - Scotland's chaotic WC prep\n\nCurrie, 27, was once ranked 30th in the world in a game now played by almost 13 million people.\n\nPlaying a World Cup in India comes with one obvious problem - the five-and-a-half-hour time difference to the UK.\n\nThis week's Premier League matches kicked off in the early hours and the deadlines to make transfers were late at night.\n\n\"I can't figure out a way to get the games on and I am even struggling to see highlights.\n\n\"It has been absolute torture, but thankfully it is the FA Cup this weekend.\"\n\nThough the secret has started to come out, the professional cricket world was initially unaware of Currie's alter ego.\n\nThese days he gets messages from team-mates and opponents asking for advice.\n\n\"[Sussex bowler] Sean Hunt is one,\" Currie says.\n\n\"He messaged me a screenshot before our West Indies game and said: 'I know you have bigger things at play, but what do you think of my team?'\n\n\"The other day he said: 'What do you think of my team? Oh and well bowled.'\"\n\nSo what about a tip for the rest of the FPL season?\n\n\"Chip strategy,\" Currie replies quickly. \"Dead-end into Gameweek 31. Wildcard in 32. Bench boost 33.\n\n\"Triple captain whenever you want.\"\n\nCurrie is the brother of Scott - the Scotland bowler who was called up by England last year.\n\nThey both qualify for Scotland via their Scottish dad, having grown up on England's south coast. Left-armer Brad studied sports psychology at Bournemouth University.\n\nA lifelong fan, Brad was at the Cherries' 3-2 win over Liverpool at the Vitality Stadium - when Amine Adli scored a 95th-minute winner against the Premier League champions - the day he got the call from coach Owen Dawkins to tell him he had made Scotland's World Cup squad.\n\n\"I said to my mate: 'I know exactly what this is, but I can't pick this up because I won't get any signal,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I got to the phone later and Dawks said: 'That was a good result, wasn't it?'\n\n\"I said: 'Yeah, and I hope you're not going to ruin my mood now.'\"\n\nHaving been pipped at qualifying by the Netherlands and Italy, Scotland got a place at this World Cup when Bangladesh opted to boycott the tournament.\n\nThe preceding weeks were uncertain, filled with claims and counterclaims about whether the Tigers would take part and what it would mean for Scotland if they did not. Even the players were not immune.\n\n\"I was at Sussex training in the indoor school and was asking all of the powers that be and the coaching staff,\" Currie says.\n\n\"It was crazy to have people saying we were going. I just thought, 'you know more than me and I am one of the players in the official Scotland group chat'.\"\n\nAs a county pro at Sussex, Currie was fortunate he had been training through the winter.\n\nBowlers' workloads are notoriously important to manage, however, and Scotland's focus switched from the Cricket World Cup League 2 at the end of March to a T20 World Cup in India at the start of February.\n\n\"I don't know what date it officially got announced but the two days after were the weekend and I just did nothing,\" he says.\n\n\"My girlfriend's family were like: 'Should you not be training? Should you not be doing something?'\n\n\"You can't cram in. You just will get injured. It is not like a school test where you can cram in revision.\"\n\nUncertainty also surrounded the availability of the younger Currie brother.\n\nDespite being picked by England for the tour of Ireland last year, he did not make his debut, leaving some to wonder if he could switch back to the Scots.\n\nAs it turned out, one spell as a substitute fielder made him ineligible.\n\n\"I had to text him and ask,\" Brad says.\n\n\"My heart sank because there are loads of brothers out here playing.\n\n\"We have just played the Manentis and the Moscas [against Italy]. There's the Sheikh brothers [Nepal] as well.\n\n\"It probably would have forced Mum and Dad to remortgage the house and get some flights out but there's only one son out here so it's not needed.\n\n\"He is going to try and please Mum and play for England, but I am going to keep Dad sweet and stick to my Scottish genes.\"\n\nEngland's defeat by West Indies effectively means Saturday's encounter is a must-win for both sides.\n\nThey last met at the 2024 T20 World Cup when an impressive Scotland batting performance meant England were faced with a tricky 110 in 10 overs before rain prevented what could have been an intriguing situation.\n\n\"It is something we will never have the answer to,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I have learned to fear no one and go into games expecting to win.\n\n\"I have a fair background in sports psychology and that is the best way to approach these games.\n\n\"They have Adil Rashid [batting] at 11 with 10 first-class hundreds and I haven't got a first-class double-digit score. I am not naive.\n\n\"[But] They have got to play and travel. We have played two games at Eden Gardens.\n\n\"I am just looking forward to it.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "It’s a familiar movie, with the same script, a different director and different subject matter, yet the same core theme — a Sunderland player becoming a lightning rod for the team’s failure to perform on any given day.\n\nFor years, the starring role was played by Luke O’Nien, ludicriously branded a “liability” (a word I’d gladly see cast out of all Sunderland-related discourse — there are no liabilities in this team) and viewed in some circles as a weak link and someone who couldn’t trap a football, let alone play a key role in our eventual rise to the Premier League.\n\nIt was untrue then; it’s still untrue now, and although we might’ve hoped that singling out certain players for often disproportionate criticism is a habit we’d try to break, it’s nonetheless disheartening that as Sunderland’s form has hit choppier waters, a wholehearted, committed and high-quality footballer in Trai Hume has found himself under the microscope.\n\nLet’s nail something down: pound for pound, Hume is one of the best, most effective and successful signings made by Sunderland during Kristjaan Speakman’s time at the club.\n\nWhen he arrived from Linfield in 2022, he had the feel of a low-risk, “one for the future”-type signing but during four years in red and white, his ferocious will to win and refusal to take a backwards step have been a key component of Sunderland’s rise from League One to the Premier League.\n\nHe’s also far more technically accomplished than we often highlight and his low-key attitude is a perfect fit for the times: no nonsense and no razzle-dazzle — just a rugged approach to the game that Régis Le Bris and his teammates clearly appreciate.\n\nWhy, therefore, has Hume suddenly become such a polarising figure among pockets of the fanbase?\n\nYes, recent results have been average and our performance levels aren’t currently hitting the heights that they did earlier in the campaign, but as Le Bris is often at pains to point out, collectivism is the name of the game at the Stadium of Light and it was good to hear him offer some staunch backing for Hume earlier this week.\n\nOK, the absence of Bertrand Traoré and the spectre of Lutsharel Geertruida (a superb and extremely versatile player in his own right) may be factors here, but the idea that the Northern Ireland international has suddenly become a weak link just doesn’t stack up.\n\nPerhaps Le Bris is asking Hume — a hard-tackling right back by trade — to push his versatility a shade too far at times, but that’s not on Hume himself and after a challenging afternoon against West Ham, has he not handled himself well as captain during the subsequent clashes with Burnley, Arsenal and Liverpool on Wednesday night?\n\nLet’s be frank: Granit Xhaka’s absence has forced the head coach to adapt and the results have been mixed, but hanging a player out to dry because he’s perhaps not living up to your expectations in a role he’s still learning is hardly sound reasoning.\n\nCollectively, Sunderland weren’t anywhere near their best against Liverpool.\n\nOn reflection, it seemed as though we showed the visitors too much respect, and there was a timidity to our play that I found slightly puzzling at times, with safe passes being chosen too often for my liking and Alisson not really being troubled for the majority of the game.\n\nThis isn’t entirely attributable to Hume, however, and if we’re going to analyse where things aren’t quite clicking for Sunderland, it’s grossly unfair to turn on a player who’s demonstrated throughout the season that he does have Premier League quality and for whom the step up from the Championship has not proven impossible to make.\n\nHe’s doing what’s being asked of him; he’s doing it to the best of his ability and if Le Bris opts to bring Geertruida into the fold for Sunday’s FA Cup tie at Oxford or next Sunday’s league meeting with Fulham, I’m sure Hume, as a double promotion winner and one of our longest-serving players, will respond as professionally as possible.\n\nOn a final note, it should be highlighted that legitimate and constructive criticism of players’ performances is fine.\n\nThat’s part of the deal, but I really do wish we’d take a moment before tossing words such as ‘liability” around so flippantly and laying into players with unnecessary venom. It adds nothing the discussion and potentially does more harm than good — not least given the scrutiny these lads are already under as they compete in such a tough and demanding league.",

But, the lines have been jumped over more often in recent years and I think Van Dijk is right about that.\n\n\"Because of the clickbait, it is so much easier to get more likes, views and work if you're a little bit more extreme. Ex-players aren't stupid and they know that. If you are too sensible and sit on the fence you won't get the big gigs.\n\n\"You have a dichotomy. Most ex-players would like to be balanced but they know if they are too balanced and sensible they won't be there next week.\n\n\"My criticism would always be constructive criticism which is explained. One-dimensional labeling of players should never happen. Sometimes if a big name says something enough it becomes accepted wisdom.\"\n\nVan der Kraan added: \"There are two different kinds of pundits; those who need to be on every week and those who are genuinely focused on what is right and what players should do.\n\n\"For Van Dijk, after so many years enough is enough.\n\n\"It all started after he came into the Netherlands team and became a big player at Liverpool. The first ex-player to really criticise him was Marco van Basten, saying he was not a leader. Van Dijk was biting his lip after every match because it became a bit of a stigma.\n\n\"Eventually it filtered to England and every time he had a bad game it became an open nerve.\"\n\nListen to the full episode on BBC Sounds",

Remember, each of the last seven MVP awards have been won by players born outside the USA — and they are coming to compete.\n\n\"I'm never stepping onto the court to lose, you know, or not caring,\" said the Spurs Victor Wembanyama, who was voted a World starter by the fans. \"Just like at home, I'm never stepping into a board game, not caring or thinking I'm gonna lose, or I'm thinking it's okay to lose.\n\n\"So I'll be out there, might as well win.\"\n\nHere's all you need to know about the 2026 NBA All-Star Game and how not to miss a moment of the action/\n\nWhere: Intuit Dome, Inglewood, CA\n\nThis year, the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock — and it falls right in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. That was a perfect setup for the first-of-its-kind All-Star Game format, a USA vs. World showdown that fans and players have been asking for.\n\nThe 24 All-Star players have been divided into three teams, two USA teams — USA Stripes and USA Stars — and one World Team. Those three teams will compete in a round-robin tournament of four 12-minute games, each team playing at least two games.\n\nAt the end of the round-robin, the two top teams will play a championship game (the fourth 12-minute game of the day) for the title. (If there is a tie, it comes down to point differential.)\n\nThe 75th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, at 5 p.m. Eastern, an earlier time than in previous years, leading into more coverage of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nThere are two USA teams — Stars and Stripes — and one World team. Fans voted for five starters from each of the Western and Eastern Conferences, and the NBA coaches voted in the 14 reserve players (plus NBA Commissioner Adam Silver added one more USA player to balance the rosters, and also picked the injury replacements). The league divided up the teams.\n\n• Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee/Greece)\n• Luka Doncic (Los Angeles Lakers/Slovenia)\n• Nikola Jokic (Denver/Serbia)\n• Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio/France)\n• Karl-Anthony Towns (New York/Dominican Rep.)\n• Pascal Siakam (Indiana/Cameroon)\n• Deni Avdija (Portland/Israel)\n• Jamal Murray (Denver/Canada)\n• Alperen Sengun (Houston/Turkiye)\nCoach: Toronto's Darko Rajakovic (Serbia)\n\n• Cade Cunningham (Detroit)\n• Tyrese Maxey (Philadelphia)\n• Anthony Edwards (Minnesota)\n• Chet Holmgren (Oklahoma City)\n• Jalen Duren (Detroit)\n• Devin Booker (Phoenix)\n• Scottie Barnes (Toronto)\n• Jalen Johnson (Atlanta)\nCoach: Detroit's J.B. Bickerstaff\n\n• Jalen Brunson (New York)\n• Jaylen Brown (Boston)\n• LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers)\n• Kevin Durant (Houston)\n• Donovan Mitchell (Cleveland)\n• Kawhi Leonard (LA Clippers)\n• Norman Powell (Miami)\n• Brandon Ingram (Toronto)\nCoach: San Antonio's Mitch Johnson\n\n• Stephen Curry (Golden State)\n• Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City/Canada)\n• Both Luka Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo have missed games this week with injuries, but neither has been officially ruled out yet. The World team currently has nine players; if one drops out, there will be no need for Adam Silver to name a replacement.\n\nRising Stars G1: Team Melo vs. Team Austin - 9:00 PM ET\n\nRising Stars G2: Team Vince vs. Team T-Mac - 9:55 PM ET\n\nCastrol Rising Stars Championship - 10:35 PM ET\n\nNBA HBCU Classic Presented by AT&T - 11:00 PM ET\n\nState Farm 3-Point Contest - First Event - 5:00 PM ET\n\nEvery moment of All-Star Weekend — the Rising Stars challenge on Friday.

    "fullText": "The bitter cold Arctic air of last week has created a lot of ice on Lake Superior. Here’s a look at the ice situation on the largest freshwater lake in the world, by surface area.\n\nYes, Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world if we use surface area as the criterion for size. Lake Superior’s surface area is 31,000 square miles.\n\nLake Superior takes up just slightly less area than the state of Indiana, which is around 35,000 square miles.\n\nIn the past week, Lake Superior’s ice cover grew from 34 percent coverage to 52 percent covered with ice.\n\nThe high resolution satellite image shows our massive Great Lake with a much smaller area without ice. Unfortunately, we very rarely get an entirely clear sky at this time of year for a great look at the ice.\n\nOne visual we definitely get, aside from growing ice, is the reduced lake-effect clouds. In the image above, you can see that the ice-covered west and east ends of Lake Superior don’t have lake-effect clouds forming over them.\n\nThe growth of ice in the past week added 6,000 square miles of ice to Lake Superior. That’s about the size of Connecticut.\n\nWhile satellites are an okay way to look at ice cover, a more accurate map is the human/digital combination of an ice map.\n\nThe entire Great Lakes system is now 52 percent covered with ice.\n\nLake Huron is 71 percent ice covered, and Lake Erie is 94 percent ice covered.\n\nWith the warm pattern developing this weekend into next week, the Great Lakes may have reached peak ice coverage for the winter. Peak ice typically occurs in the last week of February or first few days of March.",

    "description": "A Purdue faculty group calls for Provost Patrick Wolfe's resignation, citing over a dozen issues including alleged bans on international students, DEI program cuts, and hiring freezes.",
    "fullText": "WEST LAFAYETTE, IN — A group of Purdue faculty is calling for the resignation of the university’s provost, pointing to more than a dozen issues they say have caused students and staff to “suffer.”\n\nThe Purdue chapter of American Association of University Professors, an advocacy group that represents the faculty and has been at the forefront of criticizing the university’s administration, wrote in an open letter in January that Provost Patrick Wolfe has undertaken “unilateral decision-making” since his appointment in 2023.\n\nWolfe’s policies, the faculty said, have “negatively impacted” Purdue.\n\n“Boilermakers across campus have lost confidence in Provost Wolfe’s leadership and have been unable to get Provost Wolfe to course-correct through internal channels,” they wrote in the letter, which was first obtained by Based in Lafayette on Tuesday. “Our ethical and professional obligations to Purdue and to the state of Indiana require us to speak up in order to protect the community we hold dear.”\n\nThe letter points to a number of issues that the faculty say warrant Wolfe’s resignation, including reports that Purdue administrators have effectively banned graduate students from China and other countries.\n\nIn December, a host of faculty told the Journal & Courier that departmental admissions committees were quietly pressured by university leadership to end admission for students of certain nationalities. The de facto policy change, they said, was passed off as an “unwritten” policy disseminated through in-person meetings and private conversations.\n\n“The Purdue administration attempted to do this quietly through in-person meetings, private conversations, and pressure on graduate admissions committees following a March inquiry from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party,” the AAUP said in its January letter. “Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 establishes country of origin as a protected class.”\n\nWolfe has denied that such a ban exists.\n\nThe group also alleges that Wolfe, along with other Purdue administrators, has pressured faculty into “self-censorship,” scaring them out of researching or teaching controversial topics for fear of “being fired.”\n\nThe elimination of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives at Purdue last year, the faculty say, has also resulted in the firing of 60 student staff members and many full-time employees.\n\n“Provost Wolfe did not adequately justify these firings, which were made over the summer in an apparent attempt to evade notice,” the letter reads. “These actions, which have sent shockwaves across campus, are at odds with Purdue’s ‘people first’ mantra.”\n\nOther apparent issues the AAUP pointed to include:\n\nHalts on the hiring of new faculty, with Wolfe reportedly refusing to sign employment offers for new professors. The group says this has resulted in high turnover and teaching shortages in several departments.\n\nA “non-transparent” restructuring of Purdue’s Honors College late last year that resulted in as many as 17 professors losing employment.\n\nAn unfilled dean position in the College of Education, which has sat without leadership for three years, as well as in Purdue Libraries.\n\n“Broad overreach during tenure & promotion processes,” with the faculty saying new tenure requirements have left tenure virtually unattainable for many professors. The group also points to supposed pressure from university administrators on faculty to withdraw themselves from tenure consideration.\n\nA supposed lack of pushback from Purdue administrators against the U.S. Department of Education after the agency cancelled a $34.9 million grant to the university last year.\n\n“A lack of leadership on social and political issues that directly impact Purdue’s ability to meet its teaching, research, and service mission,” including a policy of institutional neutrality during “attacks on higher education.”\n\n“Provost Wolfe’s conduct has negatively impacted the careers of faculty and staff who are here to serve the student population, with devastating consequences for student learning and campus governance,” the faculty said in their letter. “His resignation is urgently needed in order to restore faith that the Purdue administration will treat its community with appropriate fairness and transparency and demonstrate a sense of duty to its alumni, faculty, staff and students.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lafayette Journal & Courier: Purdue faculty group demands provost's resignation",

    "fullText": "Many social media posts by Tesla CEO on his platform are indiscernible from those of white supremacists, say experts\n\nElon Musk’s longtime fixation on a white racial majority is intensifying. The richest man in the world posted about how the white race was under threat, made allusions to race science or promoted anti-immigrant conspiracy content on 26 out of 31 days in January, according to the Guardian’s analysis of his social media output. The posts, made on his platform X, reflect a renewed embrace of what extremism experts describe as white supremacist material.\n\n“Whites are a rapidly dying minority,” Musk said on 22 January, a short time before taking the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, while reposting an Irish anti-immigrant influencer’s video about demographic change.\n\nMusk’s posts included him repeatedly claiming white people face systemic discrimination, endorsing the conspiracy that there is an ongoing genocide against white people in countries around the world and promoting a claim that white people would be “slaughtered” by non-whites if they become a demographic minority.\n\n“If you stripped Elon Musk’s name off of these things and showed them to me, I would think that this was a white supremacist,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Extremism, who reviewed a selection of the posts.\n\nMusk has for years promoted anti-immigrant and far-right content in his posts, as well as endorsed rightwing activists and political parties around the globe. The Tesla CEO’s most recent output displays a more consistent and explicit engagement with white supremacist content and nativist activists than in the past, however, lending them the imprimatur of the world’s richest person and spreading their ideas to his audience of over 200 million followers. Beirich said he appeared “deep into the world of white nationalism”.\n\n“The White ‘liberal’ standard for behavior is extremely strict, but is only applied to Whites,” Musk said on 26 January, commenting on a post that claimed there was discrimination against white conservatives.\n\nMusk’s posts repeatedly echoed prominent white supremacist narratives and ideologies, said William Braniff, the former director of the Department of Homeland Security’s office for prevention of terrorism and extremism. Several of Musk’s posts included what Braniff described as “textbook examples” of white supremacist conspiracy theories such as “the great replacement” – a belief that liberal elites or Jewish people are conspiring to use immigration to replace white populations.\n\nThe danger of Musk’s obsession lies in mainstreaming ideas that are deeply tied to violence and discrimination, according to Braniff, who is now executive director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (Peril) at American University. “The great replacement has been an especially important mobilizing narrative for highly lethal white supremacist attacks in the United States and elsewhere,” he said.\n\nMusk has repeatedly denied he is racist or antisemitic, stated that he condemns terrorism and said he does not advocate for violence. He asserted in a 2024 interview with Don Lemon that he does not He also told Joe Rogan in March last year that he is not a Nazi, weeks after facing condemnations from Jewish groups and the chairman of the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel over his speech to Germany’s far-right AfD party in which he told Germans to move beyond their “past guilt”.\n\nAlthough Musk wrote a number of posts on race and immigration himself last month, much of his output involved reposting far-right activist accounts or replying to them with brief endorsements such as a bullseye emoji, implying agreement. On 10 January, Musk replied “yes” in reply to a post from a white nationalist account that claimed “race communism that destroyed Rhodesia and South Africa are the same things they are bringing to America and the rest of the Occident to turn us into the Global Favela”. The author of the post previously published a blog titled How To Build An American Orania – a reference to the privately owned, whites-only town of Orania in South Africa.\n\nSimilar interactions took place throughout the month. After a far-right influencer posted “they just want to eradicate White people it’s that simple” in reference to the New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration speech, Musk replied on 7 January “some people really do”. On 9 January, he wrote “true” in a quote-tweet of a post that claimed white people would be “slaughtered” as a minority and that “White solidarity is the only way to survive”. On 16 January, Musk reposted a rightwing influencer’s post claiming “white genocide is the official Democrat party platform”. The same day, he promoted another rightwing influencer’s anti-diversity post that used an AI-generated image of tattooed black women on Yale’s rowing team.\n\nWhile some of the accounts Musk interacted with are fringe social media influencers, several others are prominent far-right activists whose extremist views have been well-documented. On 17 January, Musk reposted a screed against “ethno-cultural upheaval” in Europe from Martin Sellner, far-right Austrian activist, who is the founder of the ethno-nationalist Identitarian Movement. Musk, who reinstated Sellner’s banned X account in 2024, replied to the anti-immigration post that “this is simply a statement of fact”.\n\n“Martin Sellner is probably the most significant global white supremacist right now,” Beirich said. “He’s the one who pushed the great replacement, and has now pushed the idea of remigration – ethnically cleansing western countries of non-whites.”\n\nSellner gave a presentation in 2024 at an event in Germany on the logistics of carrying out mass deportations that was attended by neo-Nazis and other extremists. The event sparked immense backlash and protests against the far-right across the northern European nation. Lawmakers attempted to ban him from the country. The Austrian activist also received a €1,500 donation from and communicated with white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, who would later go on to commit a terrorist attack in 2019 that killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\n Sellner rejected being described as a white supremacist and said he respects “the dignity of all others” in a statement to the Guardian, while taking credit for politically mainstreaming the concepts of the great replacement and remigration. “Now, from Trump to Musk, everyone is talking about replacement migration, the ethnic vote and remigration,” Sellner said. He additionally claimed that the Potsdam event was “misrepresented” by media and that he rejected any form of terrorism. Sellner described his interactions with Tarrant, which included offering to get a drink with Tarrant if he ever visited Austria, as limited to standard thank-you emails to a donor.\n\nExtremism experts said the ideas Musk has publicized are deeply tied to some of the most notorious, violent extremist attacks of the past decade, including the 2018 antisemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the 2022 racist mass killing of 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket. The shooter in Buffalo left a 180-page manifesto filled with mentions of white supremacist replacement theory.\n\nMusk’s posts also reflect an increasing embrace of white supremacist figures and talking points among prominent Republicans and government agencies in the past year. Some of that shift has played out on X, where Musk reinstated a number of formerly banned accounts such as prominent antisemite Nick Fuentes. Federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security have meanwhile posted content that aligns with white supremacist propaganda. Earlier this month, Donald Trump also drew widespread backlash after posting a racist video to his Truth Social platform that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nMusk has repeatedly mocked those who have criticized his comments as far-right or racist, framing his views as common sense or simply reiterating facts and statistics. His rhetoric reflects a widespread tactic among people on the far-right, experts say, when extremists attempt to defend their worldview of an in-group of white people against everyone else.\n\n“That reductionist worldview breaks down when people in your in-group say you’re full of it, that what you’re saying is wrong,” Braniff said. “So now the main requirement is to attack the dissenting in-group, to delegitimize them as race traitors and as woke.”\n\nAs February began, Musk was still posting about race and immigration on a consistent basis. He replied to an anti-immigrant activist this week who claimed that Ireland’s civilization would end “because Irish men are afraid of being called racist and upsetting people from the 3rd world”.\n\n“Such men are pathetic traitors,” Musk responded.",

    "fullText": "We explore the cosy world-building spin-off with Game Freak’s Shigeru Ohmori and his fellow developers – and learn how it began with a Pokémon-hunting dream\n\nPokémon is celebrating its 30th anniversary this month, and everybody knows what to expect from these games by now. The concept is simple: head into a cartoonish paradise full of whimsical creatures, capture them in red-and-white balls and assemble a team of warriors from them, before battling other aspiring Pokémon masters. But the latest entry in the series is different – a game that’s more about building than battling.\n\nIn Pokopia, a refreshingly pacific twist on the series, players are dropped into a virtual world where Pokémon are freed from their spherical prisons and happily roam their natural habitats. There’s one minor caveat – you have to create those habitats by hand, building them from what you can find.\n\nTaking its cues from Nintendo’s all-conquering Animal Crossing, this Switch 2 game sees you rebuilding decaying habitats in order to attract new Pokémon to move into your sanctuary. (Players of the Xbox classic Viva Piñata, rejoice.) It’s a welcome departure from the main series’ long-running training and battling loop. Veteran Pokémon developer Shigeru Ohmori, who started thinking about Pokopia’s concept while working on 2022’s Pokémon games Scarlet and Violet, says that the idea for Pokopia arose after spending many years dreaming about finding Pokémon in tall grass.\n\n“The first Pokémon game I worked on was [2003’s] Ruby and Sapphire,” recalls Ohmori with a smile. “My first project for that game was to create the map – and whenever I put grass on to the map, Pokémon appeared on screen. That feeling of Pokémon appearing when creating the habitat, and then meeting those Pokémon, was something that I really cherished.” He created a basic prototype for Pokopia in his spare time, and then Pokémon’s developers Game Freak brought on Dragon Quest Builders 2 studio Omega Force to help.\n\nThis feeling is lovingly recreated for players in Pokopia. As you create tufts of grass, a Bulbasaur suddenly appears, shuffling his way towards you to say hello. There are no humans to be found anywhere in this virtual utopia. In the strange and initially desolate patch in which you create your Pokémon paradise, you control the adorably wobbling mass of everyone’s favourite shape-shifting jelly, Ditto. Haunted by memories of its former trainer, Ditto decides to take a humanoid shape that you determine in a character creation screen. This is your uncanny-looking avatar, doing its best to approximate a faded memory of a human being.\n\nAfter you’ve customised your Ditto/human-hybrid, you are greeted by a sentient shrub, Professor Tangrowth, complete with a data disc attached to his curly tendrils and a pair of glasses strapped to his chin. The prof informs you that it’s your job to restore this barren land. Where do you begin? In exactly the same way that Ohmori did, all those years ago – by making lush, green grass.\n\nIn order to create new habitats, Ditto borrows moves from each new creature you meet, mimicking their abilities so that you can till the land. Bulbasaur’s ability transforms Ditto’s appendages into floppy, leaf-producing vines. Squirtle’s water gun sees Ditto puke water like a derpy Roman fountain, and Scyther’s cut blesses Ditto with comically oversized razor-sharp blades for arms. In a nice touch, whenever Ditto learns a new move you’re treated to the classic Pokémon level-up music.\n\nFor an hour I wander the barren wasteland, working to turn sand into grass and hacking trees for wood. Everything feels effortlessly charming, with a level of care and polish that elevates Pokopia’s opening 60 minutes above the series’ many middling spin-offs. Like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokopia also allows you to visit friends’ islands and meet their Poké pals, surfing between lands as a Ditto-Lapras or soaring through the skies in the form of a Dragonite.\n\nMarina Ayano, the game’s art director, tells me that she grew up with the franchise – making this something of a dream project. During development, Ayano and the sound director landed on two key words to steer the game’s cutesy and laid-back vibe: “chill and pop”. “Chill is slow and cosy, and pop ensures that everything is colourful … [we wanted] a very universal cuteness,” she says. As I make friends with a Pidgey, build a straw bed for a sleepy Charmander and field a request from an amusingly emo Umbreon who desires a black-painted home, it’s certainly very cute. For Ayano, Pokopia offered a chance to let the cutest Pokémon shine: creatures that are usually cast aside in the mainline games in favour of stronger battlers.\n\nPlaying as a Pokémon rather than the games’ usual human protagonists, you can fully understand – and converse with – every species of Pokémon, and given that Pokémon’s writing is normally pretty bland, the dialogue has unexpected personality. “Because there are no trainers in the game, we really thought about how the Pokémon communicate with each other,” says Takuto Edagawa, Pokopia’s director. “What are they thinking? How are they feeling? We made sure that if you put one piece of furniture anywhere in the world, Pokémon will react based on their personalities. I really liked how it came out.”\n\nPokopia is the first spin-off game that Game Freak has worked on directly, and Ohmori suggests that it may have influenced the direction of future mainline Pokémon games. “Battles have always been the focus, but there are so many [other elements] to these games, and I believe that fans have enjoyed these components as well,” he says. “I would like to show this more and scale the Pokémon games up, outside of battling. And I would like the Pokémon franchise to seek new possibilities to grow the Pokémon world.”\n\nPokopia is released on 5 March; £58.99/$69.99",

    "description": "Bitcoin's struggles are rooted in the wild world of meme coins, with investors fatigued by constant celebrity-backed tokens that quickly plunge, Gerber said.",
    "fullText": "One year into Donald Trump's presidency, bitcoin is worth less than it was before he was elected, and the entire market is in the throes of a crypto winter. According to famed investor Ross Gerber, blame the meme coin ecosystem for the broader decline.\n\nThe CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management thinks the launch of the Trump and Melania coins around the time of the inauguration, followed by a subsequent boom in meme tokens, has left investors fatigued and wary of digital assets.\n\nIn his view, meme coins either endorsed or launched by celebrities are either rug pulls or end up looking like one. In either case, normal investors are left holding the bag while celebrity boosters get rich.\n\nHe pointed to World Liberty Financial Coin and the Melania token, which have both plummeted in price, while the Trump meme coin has also shed about 80% of its value in the last year.\n\n\"People dive in and buy this stuff because they buy into the fraud, basically, and then they get burned, and that money doesn't come back. It's stolen from them.\"\n\nThis is only part of the problem that Gerber sees. When people lose money betting on meme coins, he added, they typically turn their back on crypto and don't come back. He also thinks the Trump administration's looser approach to crypto regulation is making the market less appealing to everyday investors.\n\nHe said it is extremely difficult for bitcoin to rally when investors are being scared away from crypto, as demand rises only when new participants enter the market.\n\nGerber also cited other celebrity-launched cryptos, such as the token launched by former NYC mayor Eric Adams and the $HAWK coin launched by internet personality Haliey Welch, as examples of celebrities meme coins that plummeted shortly after they debuted, while leaving investors holding the bag.\n\nGerber isn't the only one arguing that a growing lack of faith in crypto is compromising bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Economist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, recently argued that it will be hard for bitcoin to rise again until institutional investors increase their participation.",

    "fullText": "The International Cricket Council has been urged to review the rules concerning 12th man duties which denied Scott Currie the chance to play for Scotland at the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nPoole-born Currie, 24, has played three one-day internationals for Scotland having qualified for the Saltires through his Scottish father.\n\nPotentially he could have been lining up to play for Scotland against England in Kolkata on Saturday, alongside brother Brad, only to be deemed ineligible for the tournament because of ICC red tape.\n\nThe Hampshire all-rounder was called up by England for a three-match T20 international series against Ireland last September as a replacement for the injured Saqib Mahmood.\n\nCurrie was not picked in England's playing XI for any of the matches which took place in Malahide, but because he undertook 12th man duties he is now ineligible for Scotland for three years.\n\nSection 2.2 of the ICC's player eligibility regulations state that Currie \"participated\" as a \"non-playing official substitute\".\n\nCricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade said the ICC ruling seems \"quite strange\" compared to other sports.\n\nUnder the rules governing football and rugby union, Currie would have been eligible to play for Scotland having not won an official cap.\n\n\"I don't know when that rule was last looked at, so maybe it is time to have a re-look at that and confirm that what is in place is correct or whether alterations are needed,\" Lindblade told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Is that rule still relevant today in that evolution of our sport where players do move around a lot more from that perspective?\"\n\nUnder ICC regulations players can switch allegiances from associate countries like Scotland to full members like England immediately provided they meet all the other qualification requirements, but they must wait three years the other way.\n\nCurrie declined to comment but has previously spoken of his \"immense pride\" at playing international cricket for Scotland.\n\n\"Taking the field with my brother [Brad], knowing what is means to my old man and his side of the family, is something that always puts a smile on face,\" he said last year.\n\nAn ICC spokesperson told BBC Sport that should a member \"wish to revisit this clause\" then it can be \"raised and discussed, in the first instance, at a men's cricket committee meeting later this month\".\n\nListen to the full interview with Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade broadcast on 31 January on BBC Stumped.\n\nEngland too 'careful' in defeat by Windies - Brook\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Four-time world champion Max Verstappen says the new cars in Formula 1 this year are \"not a lot of fun\" and \"like Formula E on steroids\".\n\nThe Red Bull driver says the increased demands for energy management with new hybrid engines are \"just not Formula 1\".\n\nThe new engines are energy starved because of the way the rules have been structured and require several kinds of recovery to ensure the battery has sufficient levels of charge for optimum lap times.\n\nThis is leading to unusual forms of driving, such as not accelerating out of the final corner before a qualifying lap, lifting and coasting to save energy when trying for ultimate performance, and changing down to lower gears in corners for optimum energy harvesting.\n\nAston Martin 'look four seconds off top teams'\n\nVerstappen, whose team have built their own engine for the first time this season, said: \"The right word is management. But on the other hand, I also know how much work has been going on in the background. Also from the engine side, for the guys. So it's not always the nicest thing to say.\n\n\"But I also want to be realistic. As a driver, the feeling is not very Formula 1-like. It feels a bit more like Formula E on steroids.\n\n\"As a pure driver, I enjoy driving flat out. And at the moment, you cannot drive like that. There's a lot going on.\n\n\"A lot of what you do as a driver, in terms of inputs, has a massive effect on the energy side of things.\n\n\"For me, that's just not Formula 1. Maybe it's better to drive Formula E, right? Because that's all about energy efficiency and management. That's what they stand for. Driving-wise, it's not so fun.\"\n\nHe added: \"All the good drivers will be able to adapt to it. That's not the problem, but it's just the whole way of racing is changing, and I would say less pure.\n\n\"I just want normal driving, just how it should be, without having to, 'oh, if I brake a bit longer or less or more, or one gear up or down', you know, stuff like that, that it so heavily impacts the performance on the straights.\"\n\nThe all-electric Formula E series has become known for featuring heavy energy management to ensure cars can get to the end of the races without running out of charge.\n\nF1 is not in the same situation. Rather than a single amount of charge that depletes from maximum to empty from the beginning of the race to the end as in Formula E, the batteries in F1 will go from full charge to very low and back again several times a lap.\n\nBut Verstappen's point is that a lack of energy to run flat out all the time is taking the sport away from its traditional form of driving.\n\nSenior figures in F1 have cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the new rules at such an early stage when everything about the cars is new.\n\nThe biggest regulation change in F1 history has this year seen new rules for chassis, engines, tyres and the introduction of sustainable fuels.\n\nThe engines have a near 50-50 split between the internal combustion and electrical parts and have three times as much electrical power as last year with a battery of more or less the same size.\n\nThere are ways the rules could have been constructed to ensure energy management was not such a feature, for example by slightly reducing the power of the hybrid element and allowing the engines to use more fuel, or even by allowing recovery of energy from the front axle as well as the rear. But none of those have so far been allowed.\n\nOn the chassis side, a straight-line mode has been introduced which reduces drag from the front and rear wings specifically to aid energy recovery. The tyres have been made narrower for the same reasons. And the cars are smaller and lighter and have less grip and downforce.\n\nThe cars recover energy in four ways:\n\nRunning the engine at high revs in corners\n\nLifting off early and coasting at the end of straights\n\nRunning the electrical motor against the engine at 100% throttle\n\nVerstappen is considering competing in the Nurburgring 24 Hours at the famous 14-mile long Nordschleife circuit this year in a GT car - a modified road car.\n\nVerstappen said: \"Looking at it now, at least maybe I can drive flat out there, without looking after my battery. I mean, I want to do it, we are working on it to make it happen, but I cannot confirm it yet.\"\n\nF1 2026 cars in pictures at Bahrain testing\n\nActive aero and overtake mode - F1's new terminology\n\nCadillac unveil split livery in Super Bowl advert\n\nRussell 'wants to go head-to-head' with Verstappen\n\nBarcelona 'shakedown' offers first hints of F1 2026\n\nBiggest rule change ever and Brit teen - what's new in F1 in 2026?",

    "fullText": "Marc Cucurella has been an absolute soldier for Chelsea in the last two years, playing a crazy number of games in a really demanding position.\n\nThe addition of Jorrel Hato this summer was supposed to help him out, but the Dutchman has not proved himself reliable yet, and time again Chelsea have to turn to Cucurella.\n\nThe pressure on his body finally told against Leeds on Tuesday night, when he was taken off with a hamstring problem. In an update in his press conference yesterday, Liam Rosenior said that the club were still awaiting scans to see how bad the damage was.\n\nMarc Cucurella looks sad. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\nSigns from Spain aren’t good. Joaquin Marota reports for AS that the Spanish football federation are “worried” about a potential muscular problem, with the World Cup closing in.\n\nThey say that the full back will have an MRI today to discover the full extent of the damage. The Spaniard has already been ruled out of tomorrow’s FA Cup game, and even in the best case it feels likely that he misses the league game a week after that too. That gives him two and a half weeks to try and recover to face Arsenal on March 1st.\n\nAtletico Madrid have been linked with a summer move for Pedro Neto, but at the moment the main transfer sources are saying that’s unlikely. We certainly don’t see the reported £80m price as realistic – although if it was, Chelsea would have a hard time saying no to such a profit.\n\nOne player taking a fair bit of flak recently has been Alejandro Garnacho. Fans want to see more, and Liam Rosenior has even been forced to defender him pretty openly in recent press conferences.",

    "fullText": "In the normal WNBA calendar, February is generally a good time to check in on the state of the draft. The college season is about three-fourths complete, allowing for ample scouting of the domestic prospects. The European and Australian seasons are in full swing as well for international prospects.\n\nOf course, this isn’t a normal WNBA offseason. The college and international seasons have proceeded according to plan, but without a new CBA, there has been no free agency and not a single trade since the Nov. 23 draft lottery, when The Athletic published its first mock draft of this season. As a result, the draft order is the same as it was in November — it actually remains undecided, as we still don’t know where in the 15-team order expansion teams will select.\n\nNevertheless, enough time has passed and enough has changed in the evaluation of this year’s class to warrant another mock draft. Expect a lot more movement once the WNBA’s offseason begins in earnest.\n\nDallas should be the biggest winner of 2026 free agency. With the league’s newest superstar Paige Bueckers under contract and a practice facility scheduled to open in April, the Wings have two enormous carrots to dangle in front of the league’s best players, and as has been repeated ad nauseam, almost every veteran in the WNBA is available to change teams. If all goes according to plan, this is the last time Dallas will be drafting in the lottery in the foreseeable future. As a result, the Wings should take a big swing, and that swing is Awa Fam.\n\nThe 19-year-old is a fantastic athlete and already shows veteran instincts on the defensive end. Her upside as a rim protector and play finisher is the highest in the class. It’s worth noting her offense hasn’t exactly popped in EuroLeague, as she’s averaging seven points and less than six rebounds this season. But Fam is still playing more than 20 minutes per game against the highest level of European competition and holding her own as a teenager. That usually bodes well for WNBA prospects.\n\nThe length of Awa Fam has been evident in some brief 1Q moments vs Estepona, but there’s this one:\n\n– able to block Sika Kone (W-level player) after a slip & finish attempt https://t.co/UpvqFv15st pic.twitter.com/TkbeCnprrV\n\n— Alford Corriette (@alfcorriette) February 7, 2026\n\nWNBA talent evaluators have been waiting five years to see Azzi Fudd healthy and playing consistently. The UConn guard has finally delivered in her super senior season. She has played every game and is averaging career-bests in points (17.4), assists (3.0) and steals (2.4). She is also shooting the absolute leather off the ball. Even after a relative slump during January, Fudd is making 53 percent of her 2s and 45 percent of her 3s. She doesn’t get to the line much but is near automatic when she does, missing only two free throws all season.\n\nFudd still doesn’t project as a No. 1 scoring option. Her handle is a little limited, and she has used only eight percent of her possessions in isolation or as a pick-and-roll ballhandler, per Synergy. But she is particularly valuable as a spot-up threat in the half court and in transition with her high, steady release, and she is equally excellent coming off screens and handoffs. Fudd has also been a high-impact defender. She is an easy fit on any roster, especially a franchise that has historically valued Huskies products.\n\nMiles’ drop from my last mock draft has little to do with her own production and more to do with Fudd’s ascent. In her first season at TCU, Miles has been as dominant as ever running the show, even with an entirely new set of teammates. She can make every read and every pass in the halfcourt and in transition, and when defenses play her as a scorer, Miles gets to the rim and scores efficiently. The swing skill with Miles was her 3-point shooting, and though she hasn’t been as productive as she was in 2024-25 at Notre Dame, she is still making 35.2 percent of her triples and 39 percent of her catch-and-shoot attempts. Considering Miles has also improved her free-throw percentage to 85.2 percent, her jumper should be plenty good enough for the pro level and force defenders to stay honest with her on the perimeter.\n\nThe main drawback with Miles is her lack of defensive playmaking, but that’s less important at point guard than at any other position. Her turnover rate is also a smidge high; however, that’s the creativity tax for her audacious passing.\n\nThe Mystics hope to have their center of the future in Shakira Austin. In his most recent public comments, Washington president Michael Winger said as much while acknowledging the uncertainty of her future as a restricted free agent. “I love Kira, I foresee her being a part of this team for a long time,” he said. “She’ll have the opportunity to explore her options. I hope that we are an attractive option for her.”\n\nIf Austin chooses to move on, what a great opportunity to reunite what should have been the latest in a long line of dominant Stanford frontcourt duos. Betts and Kiki Iriafen only played one season together in Palo Alto — and Betts barely saw the floor as a freshman — but their games have grown to complement each other. Iriafen has a smooth face-up game, and Betts thrives without the ball in her hands as a screener and on put-backs. While Iriafen can cover more mobile forwards and even perimeter players, Betts is a dominant paint defender, arguably the best rim protector in college basketball; opponents shoot 13 percent worse at the rim when Betts is in the game, per CBB Analytics.\n\nSydney Johnson developed the Mystics’ identity as a defensive team in his first season in Washington. With cornerstones already on the wing (Sonia Citron) and at power forward, Betts is another strong defensive piece to add to the young core.\n\nThe goal of this exercise wasn’t to recreate great college teams of recent memory, but it is a happy accident. Flau’jae Johnson could pair with not one, but two former LSU teammates in Chicago: Angel Reese and Hailey Van Lith. More importantly, the Sky need a perimeter shot creator.\n\nJohnson’s usage has decreased with the Tigers’ increased depth this season, but her efficiency is as good as ever. She gets such good lift on her jumper and excels off screens and as a spot-up shooter. Johnson is a force on the offensive glass, especially for her position. It’s a little concerning that she still isn’t LSU’s No. 1 option as a senior, but her Tigers keep winning, and she finds a way to help them find success no matter the surrounding context. Seeing Johnson under a coach who prioritizes offensive initiation from the wings would be interesting.\n\nThis is probably too high for a role player, even one as highly regarded as Jaquez. At some point, I might have to course correct. But everyone I’ve spoken to in the WNBA loves Jaquez. She can play multiple positions. She shoots well (62.9 percent on 2s, 43.8 percent on 3s and 87.5 percent on free throws), moves off the ball — UCLA scores a ridiculous 1.47 points per possession off of her cuts, per Synergy — and defends.\n\nEvery time Jaquez takes the floor, she seems to get a little better. If you’re building a culture from the ground up, you couldn’t do better than opting for the life Jaquez breathes into a program.\n\nThis is another pick that hasn’t changed since November. After winning the EuroLeague’s young player of the year award last season, Martín is averaging 12.5 points and 5.2 assists in EuroCup games in 2025-26. That would have been a top 10 assist mark among qualified players in the WNBA last season. Her team is 9-1 in those contests with a 20-year-old running point. Martín’s 3-point percentage has dropped 10 percent since last season, but her free-throw percentage has gone up by a similar margin to 82.8.\n\nThe French wave is inevitable. After the rapid success of Dominique Malonga and Leïla Lacan, there’s much less skepticism about French prospects and how they perceive the WNBA. France is developing an incredible generation of talent, and if those players want to come to the U.S., the WNBA is more than happy to have them.\n\nIt should come as little surprise that a foreign player is mocked to Golden State after the Valkyries rostered 10 internationals over the course of their debut season. Angloma is on the come-up thanks to a prolific scoring season in France’s top league. Opponents can’t stop Angloma from getting to the basket, even though she doesn’t have much of a jump shot. She’s averaging 16.2 points per game and earning 6.1 free-throw attempts per contest. At 19, she already has the physicality to survive in the league, though her jumper will have to improve to make her a viable shooting guard or small forward.\n\nKneepkens led the Big 12 in effective field-goal percentage and free-throw percentage last season, making 57 percent of her 2s, 45 percent of her 3s and 89 percent of her foul shots. Since transferring to UCLA, she has become even more efficient from every area. Kneepkens is simply one of the best shooters college basketball has seen in recent years, no matter her usage. The Bruins improve their effective field-goal percentage by 7.6 percent when Kneepkens is on the floor.\n\nShe uses an unorthodox form on her jump shot, but after five seasons in three conferences, there is enough of a track record to believe it will translate to the professional level. The Mystics took and made the fewest 3s in the WNBA in 2025. Bringing in an ace shooter like Kneepkens is a quick way to fix that.\n\nLeger-Walker is the second-best pure point guard in this class behind Miles, though her age (she turns 25 in September) limits her upside relative to Martín. Nevertheless, she knows how to run an offense and makes a mean skip pass. She’s also a bully on drives and has become a surprisingly good screen navigator on defense at UCLA after being a more inattentive defender during her Washington State days.\n\nAll of those attributes make her a useful complement to Caitlin Clark. Leger-Walker can give Clark opportunities to play off the ball, letting the Fever star come off screens and function as a movement shooter instead of having to bring the ball up and do all of the shot creation. Leger-Walker’s passing craft rivals Clark’s, allowing her to mimic some of Clark’s sets as a backup point guard.\n\nIndiana is trying to win now, and Leger-Walker has as much experience as possible for a rookie. In addition to her six years of college basketball, she has been playing for the New Zealand national team since age 16.\n\nKiki Rice has been the starting point guard for UCLA for four seasons, and I’m still uncertain if she can be a point guard in the pros. But the WNBA is trending more positionless; not every team needs a classic floor general if they have playmaking at other positions. And regardless of Rice’s position, she has enough certainties in her game. She defends the point of attack (she has the second-best defensive on-off differential for the Bruins behind Betts), she puts pressure on the rim, and she holds herself accountable. Rice shot 21.7 from 3-point range and 79.1 percent from the foul line as a freshman; those figures are 40 percent and 89.5 percent as a senior. Bring Rice home to D.C. and let her continue to improve through Washington’s rebuild.\n\nAnother balanced attack last night, 4️⃣ Bruins finished in double figures! #GoBruins pic.twitter.com/iF2e6k6fxk\n\n— UCLA Women’s Basketball (@UCLAWBB) February 10, 2026\n\nThe Sun have a ton of defensive talent on the perimeter with Lacan and Saniya Rivers. They don’t have much offensive pop. Let Latson change that. The adjustment to South Carolina has been a bit more uneven than Latson or the Gamecocks might have hoped, but she is still a fearsome scorer and dynamic downhill attacker; 47.4 percent of her shot attempts come within 4.5 feet of the rim, and she earns 5.8 free-throw attempts per game. Connecticut will have to find some stretch bigs to accommodate spacing challenges at other positions, but Latson will insist her way to the basket no matter who else is on the floor. The Sun could desperately use that type of player.\n\nThe Dream are building around Rhyne Howard, Allisha Gray and Naz Hillmon, and that trio needs an organizing force at point guard. That’s Raven Johnson. She controls pace, knows how to get all of her teammates involved and is loath to hijack possessions when a better option presents itself. She also has consistently helmed great defenses and makes dribbling difficult for opposing guards for 94 feet. If there were any consistency on her jump shot, she’d be a better prospect. Perhaps playing for Karl Smesko and being forced to launch from 3 will improve her confidence in her jumper.\n\nJackson looks like a 3-and-D player — she has a pro body and takes a high volume of 3-pointers, and she does so confidently. The stats don’t totally support that hypothesis, neither the shooting nor the defense, though her 3-pointer was much better in the two seasons before this one. Yet, Jackson has been heavily relied upon by some excellent Duke teams. She makes her foul shots, a rarity for the Blue Devils in the Kara Lawson era. She’s emerged as a valuable playmaker. She holds up well in one-on-one defense and has improved as a screen-and-roll defender as she learns how to navigate those offensive possessions. She has a lot of tools to like, even if the whole package hasn’t quite come together at Duke.\n\nThis pick could go in many directions. In addition to the three players listed below, Grace VanSlooten, Dariana Littlepage-Buggs and Janiah Barker were all considered here. VanSlooten is a personal favorite, but it’s hard to justify picking her when the Sun already have two young power forwards in Aneesah Morrow and Aaliyah Edwards. Ultimately, the spot goes to Okot. She does exactly what you want from a center: seals her defender, protects the paint and boxes out. Okot has shown massive improvement in just two years of college basketball, and she’s young for this class since she won’t turn 22 until August. There is so much room to grow.\n\nAlso considered: Maggie Doogan (Richmond), Tonie Morgan (Kentucky), Laila Phelia (Syracuse)\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nMinnesota Lynx, New York Liberty, Seattle Storm, Los Angeles Sparks, Washington Mystics, Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Indiana Fever, Dallas Wings, Las Vegas Aces, Phoenix Mercury, Duke Blue Devils, UCLA Bruins, South Carolina Gamecocks, TCU Horned Frogs, Connecticut Huskies, LSU Lady Tigers, Golden State Valkyries, Portland Fire, Toronto Tempo, WNBA, Women's College Basketball\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "According to a report from The Athletic, Liverpool remain hopeful of Ibrahima Konaté (26) signing a new contract with the club. The French international defender’s current deal at Anfield is set to expire at the end of the season, and there is no agreement between the two parties on a new contract.\n\nThe Premier League champions are currently enduring a difficult season domestically, which has seen the form of several key players drop, including the Frenchman at times. However, in recent weeks, the 26-year-old has returned to form. He was key in the Reds’ ending Sunderland’s unbeaten run at the Stadium of Light on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Merseyside outfit believes that the former RB Leipzig defender could follow the same pattern of his teammates in Mohamed Salah and Virgil Van Dijk by signing a new contract at the end of the season. Extending his contract at Anfield is not Konaté’s only option. Real Madrid are also interested in signing him on a free transfer.",

    "description": "The shift to gold looks to be fueled by trade tensions between the US other nations, and concerns about the growing deficit, David Einhorn said.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire David Einhorn thinks gold is well on its way to becoming the world's ultimate reserve asset.\n\nThe Green Light Capital founder said he believed the metal had already begun to replace US Treasurys as the top reserve asset among the world's central banks, attesting to its safe-haven status and shakier confidence in the US macro and fiscal outlook.\n\nEinhorn pointed to reports that China has told its banks to scale back its holdings of US Treasurys.\n\nMeanwhile, central banks' appetite for gold has been rising in recent years, he added. Central banks around the world purchased around 863 metric tons of the metal in 2025, according to data from the World Gold Council.\n\n\"The Chinese have decided they want to sort of want to compete on a currency basis. The central banks around the world are buying gold. Gold is becoming the reserve asset as opposed to Treasurys, or it's kind of mostly even at this point,\" Einhorn said.\n\nEinhorn, who said his firm had been investing in gold for more than a decade, pointed to two issues in particular he believed were making gold more attractive as a long-term investment compared to Treasurys:\n\n\"Our thesis on gold over the longer term is that our fiscal policies and our monetary policies don't make any sense,\" Einhorn said, adding that the US's growing deficit is unsustainable.\n\nThe demand for US Treasurys has been solid at recent auctions, but investors have been preoccupied with the idea that the US is losing its dominance in financial markets for the past several years.\n\nWorries about de-dollarization — the idea that the US dollar is losing its status as the world's reserve currency — began to pick up steam in 2022, when Russia and other BRICS nations shifted away from the greenback after being targeted by sanctions.\n\nFears of a broader shift away from the US intensified when President Donald Trump introduced tariffs last year, triggering a \"Sell America\" episode among foreign investors that has continued to flare up periodically since. The sentiment has also popularized the debasement trade, with investors scooping up hard assets out of fear that the US dollar and other fiat currencies will lose their value.",

    "fullText": "Today, Windows 11 powers over a billion devices and supports millions of apps across business, creativity, education, gaming and productivity. For decades, our commitment to openness and compatibility, in partnership with our global community of developers, has enabled a rich and enduring ecosystem. However, users are increasingly seeing apps override their settings, install additional software or alter core Windows experiences without their awareness or consent. And your feedback is clear: Windows must both remain an open platform and be secure by default — protecting the integrity of your experience regardless of the apps installed. Our developers and ecosystem partners echo this need. They have called for stronger, more consistent security foundations in the operating system. Windows is evolving to take more accountability to place you firmly in a consent‑first model by making app and AI agent behavior transparent, decisions reversible and access limited to clearly approved capabilities. At the same time, we remain committed to app compatibility and will provide developers with the tools and guidance needed to adapt to this strengthened security model.\n\nMicrosoft has made security a top priority, investing deeply through company‑wide efforts like the Secure Future Initiative to make Windows more secure by default and focused on helping organizations prevent, manage and recover from incidents through the Windows Resiliency Initiative along with our ecosystem partners. We’ve strengthened Windows with security controls designed to meet customer needs, delivered through capabilities like Smart App Control and Administrator protection. Building on this, we are starting new SFI efforts for Windows Baseline Security Mode and User Transparency and Consent in Windows. This establishes a more robust security model that advances app transparency and user consent, with features that make app behavior more visible and app permissions easier to understand and manage.\n\nWith Windows Baseline Security Mode, Windows will move toward operating with runtime integrity safeguards enabled by default. These safeguards ensure that only properly signed apps, services and drivers are allowed to run, helping to protect the system from tampering or unauthorized changes. Users and IT administrators will still have the flexibility to override these safeguards for specific apps when needed. Developers can also check whether these protections are active and whether any exceptions have been granted — giving them insight and control over the conditions under which their apps run.\n\nWith User Transparency and Consent, we are bringing a more consistent and intuitive approach to how Windows communicates security decisions. Just like on your smartphone, Windows will now prompt you when apps try to access sensitive resources — like your files, camera or microphone — or when they attempt to install other unintended software. These prompts are designed to be clear and actionable, and you’ll always have the ability to review and change your choices later. Apps and AI agents will also be expected to meet higher transparency standards, giving both users and IT administrators better visibility into their behaviors. These updates raise the bar for security and privacy on Windows, while giving you more control and confidence in how your system and data are accessed.\n\nWindows has a long-standing tradition as an open platform. We will continue to preserve what has made it successful: freedom to install any app and openness to every developer. Building on that foundation, Windows Baseline Security Mode and User Transparency and Consent are grounded in a set of principles that put users clearly at the center.\n\nWe recognize that change takes time. That’s why this will roll out through a phased approach guided by clear principles – developed in close partnership with developers, enterprises and ecosystem partners to ensure a smooth and thoughtful transition. We’ve already begun this work alongside some of them to shape the early direction. We’re learning and adjusting from their feedback and perspectives as we refine our approach to stronger security, user transparency and consent, and how this evolution of Windows supports their needs.\n\nJacob DePriest, CISO and CIO at 1Password, says, “We’re excited to see Microsoft’s commitment to hardening desktop app security by making app behavior more transparent and strengthening security by default. As more people continue to rely on SaaS apps, agents and AI-driven tools, clarity and consent at the operating system level are critical to protecting sensitive data without adding friction. The focus on user transparency and choice for security is something we deeply value at 1Password.”\n\nMichael Draper, VP of Global Consumer Trust at Adobe, says “Adobe has always taken a proactive approach to security and we are collaborating across the ecosystem to strengthen customer protection. These efforts align with our broader focus on trust and we appreciate the opportunity to work alongside companies that share this commitment to keeping people safe.”\n\nAlex Ionescu, Chief Technology Innovation Officer at CrowdStrike, says, “CrowdStrike is looking forward to being an early partner in the development of a new, more secure and resilient runtime model for Windows applications, which helps raise the bar for user security and privacy. When applications and agentic workloads are well-behaved and respect user consent settings with proper security boundaries, security software can better protect users from attackers with reduced performance overhead.”\n\nElise Murphy, Head of Game Security at Electronic Arts, says, “At EA, delivering great player experiences through fair and competitive play is foundational to how we build games. We support platform initiatives that build stronger foundations for security and integrity, and raise the cost of cheating.”\n\nRaycast is a popular productivity tool used by developers and professionals. Thomas Paul Mann, Co-founder and CEO of Raycast, says, “At Raycast, privacy and security have always been core to how we build. As a tool that works deeply with Windows, we believe users deserve full transparency about what apps can do. This matters even more as AI agents start to act on their behalf. We’re excited to support User Transparency and Consent and shape it together.”\n\nNow, we’re expanding the conversation to our broader community. Through upcoming blogs and dedicated feedback channels, we’ll invite you to engage with us, share your insights and help refine this journey. Together, we can strengthen the Windows ecosystem and build the next 40 years of innovation — grounded in trust, transparency and user consent.",

    "description": "The Nations League does not carry the prestige of other competitions, but Thursday's draw still carries huge importance to Scotland and the Tartan Army.",
    "fullText": "Who needs the Nations League? Now Steve Clarke has ended decades of heartache and taken Scotland to the World Cup, does anything else matter?\n\nUnderstandably, ever since December's gala draw for the summer's finals in North America, every Scotland fan has been consumed with thoughts of facing Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.\n\nThe prospect of partying at the finals for the first time since 1998 has given long-suffering supporters plenty to savour and there's been no need to look beyond, nor anything definite to anticipate.\n\nThat changes the Nations League draw in Belgium on Thursday evening, when Scotland's opponents for matches in the second half of 2026 are confirmed.\n\nCompared to Fifa's festival of football, or even the Euros, it's small potatoes, of course, but these games could hold huge importance for tournaments to come and the development of the national team after their tests in North America.\n\nHow does the Nations League work and when is the draw?\n\nAnother plot twist in Scottish title race for the ages\n\nSince being introduced in 2018 in an attempt to add more structure to the international calendar and phase out meaningless friendlies, the competition has followed a familiar format.\n\nNational teams are split into four tiers based on promotion and relegation from the last edition, theoretically putting sides of the same level together.\n\nEach of these tiers are split into groups of four and there's promotion and relegation through the divisions. The best teams in League A then go on into a knock-out finals tournament the following summer with the champions crowned at the end. Simple.\n\nScotland played in the top flight in the last edition back in 2024 but finished in third place in their group behind eventual champions Portugal and Croatia. That put the national team in a play-off to fight for survival and defeat by Greece meant relegation to League B.\n\nRevenge on the Greeks was served in the successful World Cup qualification last year, of course, but Thursday's draw will put Scotland back in familiar territory in the second tier of the Nations League.\n\nScotland are in Pot 1 of the League B draw, but a quick look at the possible opposition puts paid to any ideas that it means an easy draw.\n\nHungary, Poland and Israel are the only sides Scotland cannot face, but with the likes of Switzerland, Republic of Ireland and Sweden as a potential group of opponents, fans won't be taking success for granted. Though do we ever?\n\nPot 1: Scotland, Hungary, Poland, Israel\n\nPot 2: Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria, Ukraine\n\nPot 3: Slovenia, Georgia, Republic of Ireland, Romania\n\nPot 4: Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Kosovo\n\nScotland will play each opponent home and away, with the fixtures grouped into three double-headers in September, October and November.\n\nGroup winners are promoted automatically, runners-up go into a play-off against a League A side, third faces a relegation play-off and fourth takes a drop straight into League C.\n\nEven eight years after its introduction, the competition does not have the allure of its counterparts, but it is still an important part of the international calendar, especially for Scotland.\n\nHead coach Clarke has spoken repeatedly about how his players need to face strong opposition to keep improving.\n\nThis time around, they will not be playing Europe's elite, but competitive games against sides of a similar level present a good test and strong preparation for the next set of European Championship qualifiers.\n\nPromotion brings prestige, glamour games next time around and prize money, but arguably the real prizes come in how a successful campaign sets Scotland up for the future.\n\nThe seeding for qualification campaigns and finals is always a complicated affair, but there is one simple truth that applies to them all. Winning games pushes a team up the rankings and into a better position - and winning competitive games is more valuable than victory in friendlies.\n\nThere is also the importance of a good Nations League as a lifeline to reach major finals. Four teams who failed to qualify for the World Cup directly have been given a second chance through the play-offs due to their Nations League record.\n\nAnd let us not forget that Scotland's long exodus from a major finals was ended because of a Nations League lifeline – the emotion of the play-off victory in Serbia that sealed a place at Euro 2020 was only possible because of a strong campaign.\n\nIt should not be the case that the national team needs a similar chance to reach Euro 2028, but a horrible set of circumstances could arise that make Nations League success essential.\n\nAs co-hosts of the tournament, the idea of Scotland not making the finals and seeing fans of other nations celebrating at Hampden in unthinkable.\n\nHowever, with four nations hosting the finals, Scotland, England, Wales and Republic of Ireland all have to go through the qualification campaign.\n\nIn an ideal world, the national team succeeds there and books a place, with three group games at Hampden guaranteed.\n\nUefa has set aside two places for host nations who fail to qualify in an attempt to make sure all four are in the tournament proper.\n\nHowever, if more than two of the four fail to qualify automatically, it comes down to qualifying ranking and Scotland could conceivably miss out altogether.\n\nIn that specific case, having a play-off place banked from the Nations League would be heaven sent.\n\nThere is one other intriguing footnote to the draw: it could set up the opposition for the next Scotland head coach's first game in charge.\n\nClarke's contract expires after the World Cup and there is no indication if he will carry on in the job, regardless of what happens at the finals.\n\nIf Clarke does leave in the summer, his successor's first matches will be in the Nations League and a new era for the national team will begin when League B kicks off.\n\nBBC Scotland will have live text coverage of the Nations League draw from 17:00 GMT.",

    "fullText": "When Trent Alexander-Arnold came off the bench in Real Madrid's 2-0 win against Valencia last weekend, there was much anticipation around the former Liverpool right-back's return.\n\nAfter another two months on the sideline, Real supporters had seen very little of the England defender this season.\n\nSince joining the Spanish side in June 2025, he has been limited to just 17 appearances in all competitions.\n\nTwo separate injuries have disrupted his rhythm and denied him the sustained run of games needed to build momentum and a connection with supporters.\n\nThe relationship he built with Xabi Alonso became redundant when the manager was sacked after less than eight months in charge.\n\nNow though, he is fit again and the timing feels significant. The season is entering its decisive stretch and Alexander-Arnold has the opportunity to reassert himself.\n\nWhy are Real Madrid players training in masks?\n\nHasty or a shrewd move? Madrid in shock at swift Arbeloa appointment\n\nAfter a strong Club World Cup, where he started five of Madrid's six matches, Alexander-Arnold began the 2025–26 season sharing right-back duties with Dani Carvajal.\n\nSpanish media praised his early performances, noting he \"showcased his trademark ability to drift inside from full-back\".\n\nBut his campaign was soon disrupted. A hamstring injury in Madrid's opening Champions League game in September put him out for seven weeks and was described by local media as \"a blow to Trent's new chapter\".\n\nHis comeback in November felt particularly poignant as he faced his former club Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nHe subsequently made five more appearances, with Spanish newspaper AS suggesting that \"the initial criticism [of Alexander-Arnold] revealed a lack of understanding of the footballing ability the England international has always possessed\".\n\nMomentum was building and fans were beginning to see the benefits of their star signing, but a thigh injury against Athletic Club in December left him injured and recovering for another two months.\n\nThe 27-year-old admitted he was \"absolutely gutted\".\n\nThat setback kept him out for 14 matches, until his long-awaited return last weekend.\n\nDespite only playing for the final 15 minutes of the match, Alexander-Arnold's return was met with largely positive reaction from supporters.\n\nOn social media, the Madridistas didn't hold back:\n\n\"Trent Alexander-Arnold's minutes against Valencia felt like a prime performance. Our style of play even changed!\"\n\n\"Trent Alexander-Arnold completely changed the game when he came on. Does he deserve to start every match?\"\n\n\"His passes are so satisfying. Football has missed him.\"\n\nThe brief but impressive appearance has raised expectations, especially with the first leg of Real Madrid's Champions League knockout tie against Benfica looming next week.\n\nYet head coach Alvaro Arbeloa was quick to manage the excitement, emphasising that full recovery remains the priority.\n\n\"After being out for a long time, we are taking the same approach with him as with others returning from injury,\" said Arbeloa.\n\n\"We are proceeding cautiously and calmly because what we want is for him to find his rhythm, his best playing form. That's how it will be with Trent.\"\n\nIt was the first time Arbeloa had publicly addressed Alexander-Arnold, and the comments put to rest earlier rumours suggesting he might not feature in his long-term plans - speculation that Real Madrid had carefully shielded the England international from.\n\nThis was a clear signal that Alexander-Arnold remains central to the club's long-term vision. And, as a former Liverpool and Real Madrid right-back himself, Arbeloa may be uniquely placed to help strengthen their relationship off the pitch.\n\nWith Federico Valverde moving back into a central midfield role following Jude Bellingham's recent injury, Real Madrid's right-back picture has shifted, opening the door for Alexander-Arnold to feature more prominently in that position against Benfica and beyond.\n\nArbeloa now has all his options available on that flank: captain Dani Carvajal, Alexander-Arnold (who played ahead of Carvajal against Valencia), Valverde as an emergency option, and academy player David Jimenez, who started in Valencia.\n\nCarvajal's season has been equally frustrating, having battled a series of injuries as well as knee surgery.\n\nDespite now being fit and available, he has barely played any minutes under Arbeloa. In fact, his last start was in September. It's a complex situation given his contract expires in the summer and there appears to have been little progress in renewing it.\n\nThat context places Alexander-Arnold in a strong position to become Madrid's leading option at right-back once fully fit, with Valverde still available as an emergency alternative and Jimenez also impressing when called upon.\n\nWhether Alexander-Arnold will be eased back into the starting XI as he builds fitness, or whether he will leap straight into a key role, given the significance of upcoming fixtures, remains to be seen as Arbeloa manages the reintegration.\n\nIt would be fair to say that, at this stage of the season, Alexander-Arnold's chances of making England's squad for this summer's World Cup appear slim, with his limited minutes at club level the most obvious reason.\n\nInternational selection is usually built on form and fitness, and the England coaching staff are likely to prioritise players who are consistently competing at the highest level.\n\nHe has not had the chance to demonstrate the consistency required to challenge for a place.\n\nHe was omitted from Thomas Tuchel's World Cup qualifying squad in August, with the England coach saying: \"There's no doubt I'm a big fan of Trent, for his talent and his personality. But for this call-up, I've gone with Reece James and Tino Livramento.\n\n\"I know he wanted to be here, which is very important. I just chose others due to competition.\"\n\nEven if Alexander‑Arnold delivers spectacular performances for Real Madrid over the coming weeks, the competition for the England right-back position remains strong.\n\nWith Tuchel preparing to finalise his squad for friendly matches against Uruguay and Japan on 27 and 31 March respectively, selections are likely to prioritise players who have been performing consistently week in, week out.\n\nStill, as Tuchel himself emphasised: \"He's a great player who will always be in contention.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Matt Weston underlined his status as the world's best skeleton pilot by setting the track record on his way to taking a significant halfway lead at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe two-time world champion - Team GB's biggest medal hope in Milan-Cortina -put down a statement second run to open an advantage of 0.30 seconds over the field, with two medal-deciding runs to come on Friday.\n\nWeston was the only slider under 56 seconds as he clocked 55.88secs in heat two, to add to his 56.21secs in run one on the new Cortina sliding track.\n\nAfter a frustrating opening run, which began with a costly bump against the wall near the top of the track, Weston was clearly annoyed with his performance.\n\nBut, under pressure from two German sliders, he tidied up those errors with a slick and highly impressive second run, shaving 0.33secs off his opening effort, to give him an overall time of one minute 52.09secs.\n\n\"I was quite annoyed after the first run. I tried to be a bit too relaxed because I tried to over-compensate for race-day nerves,\" Weston said.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy [to be the overnight leader] but I take every run as run one. I will completely reset myself, switch off for a bit and then re-focus on Friday.\"\n\nGiven skeleton medals are often decided by hundredths of a second, Weston's fist pumps at the end of his second run were not only a sign of his elation at a cleaner run, but also marking the significance of his advantage.\n\nCompatriot Marcus Wyatt sits seventh with a combined time of 1:53.21 - 0.66secs outside of the medal places.\n\nWyatt, 34, was also a strong medal contender coming into the Games but has struggled on the technical Cortina track and a podium-finish already seems like a tough ask.\n\nAxel Jungk, silver medallist in Beijing four years ago, is in second place with a time of 1:52.39 while fellow German and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer is third with 1:52.55.\n\nThe final two heats will take be shown live on the BBC from 18:30 GMT on Friday with all four run times added together to give an overall result.\n\nWeston arrived in Cortina as Team GB's best hope of a gold medal but now has the added pressure that he is likely to be chasing a first medal of these Games for the British team following a series of misses for the nation's other hopefuls.\n\nHe has been the dominant slider of recent seasons on the global stage, claiming five race wins and two further podium finishes this season as he won a third successive World Cup title.\n\n\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston said.\n\n\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"\n\nThe build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by 'helmet-gate' - with the British team hoping to a wear a new design in Italy.\n\nThe helmet was banned by the sport's governing body - the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Foundation (IBSF) - who said it did not comply with rules around shape as the back of the helmet protrudes, giving an aerodynamic advantage.\n\nThe British team lost an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to overturn the decision, meaning they could not wear them at the Games.\n\nThe athletes said they were unphased by the issue and pointed out that all of their success this season has come with the old helmets.\n\nGB have long been a dominant force in skeleton, winning medals at every Games since the sport was reinstated to the programme in 2002.\n\nThat was until 2022, when Team GB failed to win a medal in what was a disappointing Olympic campaign in Beijing.\n\nWeston's 15th-place finish was the highest of the four British athletes competing on the Yanqing track with Wyatt coming 16th.\n\nWeston thought about quitting the sport after that but four years later looks primed to fulfil his promise on the Olympic stage.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Dayot Upamecano and Ousmane Dembélé have a close relationship on and off the pitch. On the pitch, they meet frequently, as PSG and Bayern Munich can’t seem to avoid each other in the UEFA Champions League. Off the pitch, Upa seems glad that his childhood friend has reached the pinnacle of world football.\n\n“We went to the same school, we played on the same pitches, I played against him as kids,” said Upamecano (via @iMiaSanMia). “Honestly, I don’t have the words. We all knew he would become a great player, but still… When I saw him lift the Ballon d’Or, it brought tears to my eyes.”\n\n“I should have been there for the ceremony, but I couldn’t come. Seeing him thank his mother, his family, his friends, Moustapha, everyone who was there… It was a wonderful moment.”\n\nUpamecano and Dembélé could potentially face each other again this season, depending on how far their respective clubs go in the Champions League. When that happens, all bets are off. In the meantime, this little anecdote shows that these players are human, and have a history that stretches beyond the football pitch.",
