    "fullText": "Las Vegas Darts Open: Brandon Claims Open as Hedman defends women's title originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLas Vegas has a habit of exaggerating things. Lights brighter. Nights longer. Legends larger. And on the oche, beneath the neon glare of The Strip, Deta Hedman once again reminded the darts world that class doesn’t age – it sharpens.\n\nNorth America is becoming more a centre of focus for the World Darts Federation with every passing year. A glance at the rankings will confirm the growing influence of USA events and, in turn, dominance of their players. But they would not get it all their own way as the season started again after a festive breather.\n\nThe Open event brought a distinctly American flavour, and the final proved brutally one-sided. Tennessee thrower Jason Brandon turned the dial to demolition mode, whitewashing compatriot Alex Spellman 6-0 with an average nudging just past the 90 mark. Spellman never found his footing. Brandon never loosened his grip. Sometimes, finals end before they begin.\n\nFresh into 2026 and the reigning WDF Women’s World Championship holder picked up exactly where she left off, rolling into Nevada and rolling straight back into the winner’s circle by lifting the Winmau Las Vegas Open crown. At 66 years young, the Queen of Darts remains ruthlessly efficient, brushing aside America’s Cali West 5-2 in the final to add yet another major WDF trophy to an already overflowing cabinet.\n\nDETA STRIKES 10 DART LEG: Watch Vegas highlight from the World Champion\n\nThis wasn’t nostalgia. This wasn’t sentiment. This was elite darts, delivered with the calm authority of someone who has seen every trend come and go – and outlasted them all. In a city built on excess, Hedman’s dominance felt beautifully understated. Just sharp scoring, clinical doubles, and the unmistakable presence of a champion who still belongs at the very top of the World Darts Federation pyramid.\n\nBut Las Vegas is never about just one event. The weekend unfolded like a darts buffet – singles, doubles, cricket, youth tournaments – boards buzzing from morning through to whatever hour Vegas pretends is night. And naturally, Hedman wasn’t done.\n\nMore silverware followed in the doubles, where she paired with Anca Zijlstra to overcome Japan’s Kosuzu Iwao and Shiori Sato. Another medal. Another reminder that Hedman’s influence stretches across formats, continents and generations.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes flew again in the Open Doubles as Brandon Perez and Marko Silva edged out Canada’s Jayson Barlow and David Cameron in a tight North American showdown.\n\nThere are far worse places to spend a weekend throwing darts than Las Vegas. Fewer still where the trophies pile up, the WDF banner flies proudly, and legends like Deta Hedman continue to turn neon-lit stages into personal property.\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "description": "Business leaders and CEOs weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he will not use force to get Greenland, but is \"seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition\" by the US.\n\nTrump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been dominating this year's Davos agenda.\n\nAll eyes were on Trump during his 70-minute-long speech, with billionaire CEOs — including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff — alongside heads of state filling up Congress Hall to hear what he had to say.\n\nHere is how some of the world's biggest business leaders have reacted:\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, Citadel's CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Trump had an \"important message to deliver to a European audience that, bluntly, needs to do better. Europe's economic growth lags far behind America.\"\n\n\"The commitment of the American people to defend our country runs deep. The commitment of the Europeans to defend their countries — if you look at surveys of the population — is not nearly as strong,\" he added.\n\nGriffin said he thought one of Trump's \"important foundational statements he made with respect to the justification why the US needs unfettered access to Greenland\" was whether Europe would be there for the US if there was another war.\n\nHowever, Griffin said that if the US does decide to \"pursue this path\", discussions \"should take time and be thoughtfully laid out.\"\n\n\"Investors around the world do not want to see an escalation of the stress in global trade that has played out over the last 12 months,\" the Citadel CEO added.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said it looked like \"cooler heads prevailed at the White House.\"\n\n\"So if the US can't buy Greenland instead of taking it by military force, Trump will just hold a grudge,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\n\"While that is a major improvement, it also means that if we do succeed in buying Greenland, we'll massively overpay.\"\n\nSchiff also warned on X that a housing \"crash is coming.\"\n\n\"Trump basically admitted there is a housing bubble in the US. He also admitted his main policy goal is to prevent it from popping,\" Schiff wrote.\n\n\"But once you recognize a bubble, the worst thing you can do is try to sustain it. The sooner it bursts, the less damage it will ultimately cause.\"\n\nCloudflare's CEO appears to have commented on Trump's speech style.\n\n\"Last two times Trump spoke at Davos he stuck extremely close to the teleprompter. Not this time,\" Prince wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Money Movers on Wednesday, the founder and executive chair of investment bank Moelis & Company, Ken Moelis, said he thought Trump \"made a very good case\" for a deal over Greenland.\n\n\"There was a real sigh of relief that he took military action off the table with Greenland. With President Trump, it's unusual for him to ever take an option off the table, so that was a big sigh of relief,\" he said.\n\nMoelis described Greenland as \"probably the biggest M&A deal in the history of the world\" and criticized Europe's approach to energy policy.\n\n\"You have to look at Europe and say their choices on energy policy have put them in the position they're in right now which is fairly weak economically and in a global position. And I thought he made a very good case for that,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump used his Davos address to press for US control of Greenland, defend tariffs, and frame global politics as a contest of power.",
    "fullText": "It was a speech that was never going to fly under the radar.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used his Davos address on Wednesday to press his case for US control of Greenland, criticize what he described as Europe's economic decline, and outline a series of domestic and global policy priorities — from tariffs and credit card rates to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe speech came after Trump's flight to Davos was delayed following a midair turnaround of Air Force One due to a \"minor electrical issue\" and a transatlantic flight on a backup jet.\n\nIt also came amid mounting backlash from European leaders, rattled markets, and warnings of retaliation that could hit America's biggest economic advantages.\n\nHere are the four biggest takeaways from Trump's remarks:\n\nTrump devoted a significant portion of his speech to Greenland, saying that the US does not plan to use military force and adding that no other country can secure the territory.\n\n\"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force, Trump said.\"\n\nAt the same time, he framed US control of Greenland as essential to global security and openly criticized America's allies.\n\n\"All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,\" Trump said.\n\n\"No nation or a group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.\"\n\nTrump said US ownership would benefit NATO, even as he questioned the alliance's reliability.\n\n\"This would greatly enhance the security of the entire NATO alliance,\" he said, adding: \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly returned to tariffs as a central tool of leverage, describing them as a way to get other countries to change behavior.\n\n\"Instead of raising taxes on domestic producers, we're lowering them and raising tariffs on foreign nations,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that tariffs have enabled him to secure concessions that would not have been possible otherwise.\n\n\"Without tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to get it done,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, he described his negotiating style in blunt terms, telling the audience that when tariffs are on the table, the message to other countries is simple: \"You're going to do it fast.\"\n\nTrump used some of his most emotive language when discussing energy policy, particularly renewable power.\n\nHe dismissed green policies as \"the Green New Scam\" in reference to the EU's Green New Deal and called it \"perhaps the greatest hoax in history,\" adding that wind turbines ruin landscapes while losing money.\n\n\"Windmills all over the place destroy your land,\" Trump said.\"Stupid people buy them.\"\n\nHe also accused China of profiting from renewable energy by manufacturing windmills for export while relying on other energy sources at home, suggesting Beijing sells green technology it does not fully embrace itself.\n\nTrump said that parts of Europe have declined economically and politically — without naming specific cities or countries.\n\n\"Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable anymore,\" he said, adding that the changes were \"not in a positive way.\"\n\nHe blamed European governments for weakening themselves through energy and economic policy.\n\n\"They're destroying themselves,\" Trump said of European countries.\n\nAt the same time, he positioned the US as the central force in the global economy and security.\n\n\"The USA is the economic engine on the planet,\" he said. \"When America booms, the entire world booms.\"\n\n\"I'm working every day to ensure our military is very powerful. Our borders are very strong. And above all, our economy is strong because national security requires economic security and economic prosperity,\" he added.",

    "description": "Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, weighed in on how Trump's economic and geopolitical policies have impacted the US during the World Economic Forum.",
    "fullText": "Hours before President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum, Ken Griffin, the outspoken billionaire CEO of Citadel, gave his rundown of the US leader's key economic policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs have been \"a negative\" and have left the US economy in a \"pretty unfortunate position,\" said Griffin at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.\n\nThe president's policy to raise tariffs on imports to the US has \"disrupted long-standing trading relationships\" and led to \"higher inflation,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"We've obviously increased the amount of cronyism in America as corporate CEOs have lined up in Washington trying to argue why their business should be exempted from tariffs, and many have prevailed,\" he added.\n\nCentral to Trump's tariff agenda is the promise that manufacturing will return to America, reducing US dependency on foreign nations for critical items.\n\n\"We have yet to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States,\" said Griffin.\n\nThe Citadel CEO highlighted that Trump is clearly following through on the platform he was elected on and said that tariffs have had some of their intended effects, though he did not specify what these were.\n\nBut one of the main problems with US tariffs is that business leaders are uncertain about how long the policy will stay in place.\n\n\"I think people have a very hard time believing that the current tariff regime's going to persist,\" said Griffin. \"Before you spend hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars to build a manufacturing plan, you really want to believe that the policy that is the anchor of that decision will be permanent in nature.\"\n\nGriffin also gave his two cents on Trump's immigration and geopolitical policies.\n\nNo country's borders should be open to mass immigration, but closing down the Southern border has meant losing a large supply of labor, said Griffin.\n\n\"These are people who did a lot of very, very difficult work, very modest wages, which helped to reduce the level of inflation in the United States,\" he said, adding that he expected housing and food prices to rise in the coming years as a result.\n\nThe bigger problem that Trump's immigration policy has caused for the US is that \"we're potentially losing access to the best and brightest minds from around the world,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"The majority of Silicon Valley is either run by immigrants or children of immigrants,\" he said, and their companies have created \"a tremendous number of jobs in the United States.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of Trump's speech at Davos on Wednesday, Griffin said he was uncertain about what the US president was hoping to achieve by clashing with Europe over ownership of Greenland: \"What I can't understand is why are we fighting over a piece of rock covered by ice?\"\n\n\"We have frayed our relationship with our European allies in ways that I don't understand or appreciate, but there is a push here to get Europe to step up,\" said Griffin.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump ruled out using force to acquire Greenland, but said that he wants \"right, title, and ownership\" of the nation.",

There are two guys that can prove it.\"\n\nAmerican players each received $500,000 (£373,000) from organisers the PGA of America to compete in last year's defeat at Bethpage, making it the first time in the Ryder Cup's 98-year history that players on either side had been paid to play.\n\nHowever, some of the players said during the event in New York that they would donate their earnings to charity.\n\nWhile several of the world's top golfers were lured to LIV, Northern Ireland's McIlroy remained loyal to the DP World Tour and US-based PGA Tour.\n\n\"I think any organisation or any members' organisation like this has a right to uphold its rules and regulations,\" added the reigning Masters champion.\n\n\"What the DP World Tour is doing is upholding its rules and regulations. We, as members, sign a document at the start of every year, which has you agree to these rules and regulations.\n\n\"The people that made the option to go to LIV knew what they were.

    "description": "John Abernathy was tackled by federal agents in Minneapolis and threw his Leica to safety.",
    "fullText": "John Abernathy, a photographer from Minneapolis, was flat on the ground. He had the knees of at least one federal officer on his back. He heard someone shouting to put his hands behind his back, but his arms were half pinned beneath him. He was surrounded by dozens of officers deploying something ― tear gas, he thinks ― that made it hard to see or breathe. He felt like he could puke or pass out.\n\nHe feared what might happen if federal agents got hold of his equipment. So when he locked eyes with another photographer, he took his camera ― a Leica M10-R with a 28-millimeter lens ― and threw it, pitching his cellphone away from him shortly after.\n\nPierre Lavie, a fellow photojournalist, snatched the Leica by the strap and brought it close to his body. As he reached for Abernathy’s phone, which had only traveled a couple of feet, a federal officer repeatedly tried to stomp on it.\n\n“I had to Hungry Hippo my hand in and out to avoid my hand getting stepped on, and I managed to finally grab it and get it away,” Lavie told HuffPost.\n\nNews: Ex-Flight Attendant Accused Of Yearslong ‘Catch Me If You Can’-Style Scam\n\nIt’s a familiar scene to both. Abernathy, who previously did photography work for advertisements and magazines, said he set out to document the protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown in Minneapolis and the killing of Renee Good “just to show what’s happening to whoever might see it.” Lavie, a member of the National Press Photographers Association from Dallas, had come from New Orleans, where he was also capturing ICE activity, to cover the unrest.\n\nOn Thursday, Jan. 15, both were outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, which has recently been used to hold people detained by ICE officers.When Abernathy saw what he called “agitators” ― pro-ICE demonstrators ― carrying bear spray, he grabbed a can from someone and tossed it aside so it couldn’t go off near him.\n\nHe speculates that’s why he was targeted by federal agents, who yelled that they saw him spraying the crowd, though he said they didn’t provide evidence to back that up after they handcuffed him and took him inside the Whipple Building. (He received a citation, but has yet to receive a court date.)\n\nAs he struggled underneath the agents, he fought to keep breathing.\n\n“I couldn’t breathe. I screamed my name because I didn’t know what was about to happen, and I also sort of subconsciously screamed ‘I can’t breathe,’ and right when it came out, I thought of George Floyd, and I thought, ‘Oh ****, this is getting real,’” he said.\n\nNews: The Past Year Of Trump Has Shown Us What's At Stake. HuffPost Refuses To Back Down.\n\nLavie, who has traveled around the United States in recent months documenting ICE activity, said officers working in Minneapolis are harsher than those he’s seen elsewhere, doing things like shooting pepper spray into the air intake of vehicles to force people out.\n\n“They’re very threatening right away, instead of de-escalating a situation,” he said.\n\n“Their unprofessionalism worries me as an observer because I just see it as a short distance to travel to having somebody really hurt,” he added. “It’s reckless and dangerous.”\n\nDespite suffering a chemical burn in his eye, wounds from pepper bullets and abrasions from hitting the ground, Abernathy didn’t rush to the hospital after he was released from custody.\n\nInstead, he set out to find his phone and camera, though because of the chemical agent he was doused with, he didn’t have a clear idea of who had scooped them up.\n\n“I found some guy with a bullhorn, and I asked him to walk up and down and ask if anybody has my camera, and nobody had it,” he said.\n\nNews: Trump-Appointed Prosecutor Who Pursued Indictments Against The President's Foes Is Leaving Post\n\nHe enlisted his wife’s help, having her use the Find My iPhone feature. At the same time, Lavie had passed the equipment to another journalist he was traveling with, who tried to find the owner using the contact information on the phone’s Medical ID.\n\nThe two finally reunited at a hotel where they met for the first time.\n\n“He hopped out of the car and gave me a big handshake and a hug and said, ‘thank you so much,’” Lavie said, adding Abernathy “was a little beat up, but he’s obviously a tough dude and quick-thinking, and he seemed good.”\n\nAbernathy went to the hospital after retrieving his camera, where he discovered the last few images he captured before officers took him down.\n\nAbernathy said he’s fine now, but tired and constantly shaky.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s a nervous system response to stress or something with tear gas or what,” he said.\n\nNews: DOJ Says It May Use KKK Act To Prosecute Don Lemon For Reporting On Church ICE Protest\n\nLavie said Abernathy didn’t stay down long, noting he saw him out making more images on Saturday, after being tackled on Thursday.\n\n“We don’t like to stop,” Lavie said.\n\nAbernathy noted that he’s never been tackled, handcuffed or pepper-sprayed until last week, but he will keep documenting what’s happening.\n\n“The world needs to see it, not just people here,” he said, “because the whole world has to come down on this.”\n\nWall Street Sinks As Trump Threatens 8 European Countries With Tariffs Over Greenland\n\nU.S. Bank Stocks Fall As Investors Weigh Credit Card Rate Cap Deadline\n\nVolatility Gauges Jump As Tariff Threats Spook Investors",

Last year, I threw a new year’s party for my children in the game, but apart from that I have barely touched my island since the depths of lockdown, when sunny Alba was my preferred escape from the monotonous misery of the real world. Back then, I spent more than 200 hours on this island. Stepping out of her (now massive) house, my avatar’s hair is all ruffled and her eyes sleepy after a long, long time aslumber.\n\nI half-expected Alba to be practically in ruins, but it’s not that bad. Aside from a few cockroaches in the basement and a bunch of weeds poking up from the snow, everything is as it was. The paths that I had laid out around the island still lead me to the shop, the tailors, the museum; I stop by to visit Blathers the curatorial owl, and he gives me a new mission to find a pigeon called Brewster so that we can open a museum cafe. “It’s been four years and eight months!” exclaims one of my longtime residents, a penguin called Aurora. That can’t be right, can it? Have I really been ignoring her since summer 2021? Thankfully, Animal Crossing characters are very forgiving. I get the impression they’ve been getting along perfectly fine without me.\n\nI take myself on a little tour of Alba, investigating all the things I’d forgotten I made. Atop the highest cliffs on the island I find a half-finished bamboo zen garden. Down by the beach there is a playground; I had a baby and a toddler back in 2020 and I was spending a lot of time in playgrounds. The whole place is testament to the extent of my homesickness during the pandemic, during which I was stuck in a suboptimal basement flat in Brighton: the island flag is a saltire, the island tune is the first couple of bars of Scotland the Brave.\n\nI check my bank account and find over 2 million bells in there. How the hell did I accumulate 2 million bells from selling fish and fossils? With the help of a further 99,000 bells of interest, I pay off the final instalment of my home loan, forgetting that there’s no real point in doing this except personal satisfaction. I am now penniless, but at least I am out from under the thumb of the Tom Nook financial empire. That loan-shark raccoon has got nothing on me now.\n\nThere’s a new building: a hotel perched on the end of the pier, run by a family of pirate kappa. Home decoration was never my favourite part of Animal Crossing so I am not exactly thrilled to be asked to put together new rooms for the guests, but there have been a lot of improvements to this activity since I last played – placing cute little furniture items and paintings on the floor and walls is much easier than it was, especially using the Switch 2 controller as a mouse. I throw together a nautical theme for the first room and discover that the rewards for this work are tiny versions of old Nintendo toys and consoles. I start mentally planning out a games room back at my house.\n\nRather than face all the tidying up, some of my friends have ditched their pandemic-era islands and started again, which involves a level of dedication to the game that I can only respect. There’s a new service – run by Mr Resetti, the angry mole who used to yell at you for turning off the game without saving in the early-00s era of Animal Crossing – that lets you wipe everything off the ground of your island, leaving it clear for terraforming and redecorating. It’s also now easier to make those outdoor transformations, as you can hold L to stick your character to the island’s invisible grid, making it much easier to place things like walls and roads. And crops, I discover. Did you know Animal Crossing has farming now? And food recipes? This was news to me. Now I make my mini-me a smoothie before my morning rounds of Alba.\n\nI am surprised at how quickly I fall back into the rhythm of Animal Crossing. It’s such a soothing game, with so many outlets for creativity. Much of this update’s new stuff is for people with more time than me – for instance, you can decorate entire new Slumber Islands with friends while your avatar sleeps, but what was always great about this game is that it doesn’t require much from you. You can spend a peaceful half hour every day checking in on your small world, or you can spend many hours creating custom fashions for your residents and tourists, and designing every square metre of the island to your specifications.\n\nBack in the 90s, Animal Crossing was a game born from loneliness: Nintendo’s Katsuya Eguchi came up with the original idea for the game because moving to Kyoto had separated him from his friends and family in Chiba, near Tokyo. He envisioned a game that fostered a sense of community, that families could play together. (You can read a lot more about this series’ origins in my book about Nintendo, by the way – it’s out in a couple of weeks.) So it feels very poetic that Animal Crossing ended up saving the whole world from loneliness in 2020. It’s taken me a long while to feel good about returning to Alba, and it’s been a surprise to discover that this game is now better than it’s ever been.\n\nMan was I sleeping on Dispatch. I played all of its eight episodes over the course of a week and I have never laughed aloud so often at a video game. A narrative game in the vein of the old Telltale adventures The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, and made by many of the same people, it tells the story of washed-up superhero, Robert Robertson III, who is sent to work at a call centre and put in charge of a team of mardy former supervillains on a rehabilitation programme. The animation is superb, the characters and acting memorable, and the dialogue quick-witted. It would have made a great animated series, but it makes an even better choice-centric video game. Anything with superheroes is usually an instant “no” from me, but this is clever and funny without the boringly self-referential humour that usually infests the genre.\n\nAvailable on: PS5, PC; Nintendo Switch/2 versions coming 28 January\n\n Estimated playtime: 8-9 hours\n\nAmazon MGM Studios released a first image of Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in the forthcoming Tomb Raider TV series. Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander were the previous two on-screen Crofts; Turner says she has been training eight hours a day, five days a week for the past year for the role.\n\nNewish independent site Design Room has gone deep on the groundbreaking 2008 parkour game Mirror’s Edge, in an in-depth history written by frequent Guardian Games contributor Lewis Gordon.\n\nAnother online multiplayer game was put to bed last week: 2019’s sci-fi mech shooter Anthem, one of the first live-service flops of the current era. It was made by BioWare – a studio better known for its RPGs. Its producer Mark Darrah released a four hour (!) postmortem video on YouTube, summarised here by VGC.\n\nA beginner’s guide to Arc Raiders: what it is and how you start playing\n\n‘It’s a loving mockery, because it’s also who I am’: the making of gaming’s most pathetic character\n\nCommodore 64 Ultimate – it’s like 1982 all over again! | ★★★★★\n\nA few weeks ago I asked for your most-anticipated games of 2026 (mine are here). Reader Ee simply responded with the words Fatal Frame – there’s a remake of the second instalment in this iconic Japanese ghost photography series coming in March. Nora picked out The Mermaid Mask – a “funny and creepy point-and-click mystery” – and TOEM 2, the sequel to a beloved black-and-white photography game. Andrew is looking forward to the interesting mix of characters in Resident Evil 9, which stars relatively defenceless newcomer Grace and seasoned zombie-killer Leon Kennedy.\n\nBrad is hoping for a new 3D Mario on Switch 2, as am I – Nintendo usually announces games late, so I think the odds are good. And I’m sorry, Maks, but the odds aren’t so great on this finally being the year that we see Half-Life 3, so I can’t share in your optimism. I’ve lost so many bets about that game that I’ve given up for good.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "title": "Forget the four-day workweek: Despite what Bill Gates and Elon Musk predict, the CEO of the world’s largest workspace provider says it’s not happening",
    "description": "Billionaire tech CEOs promise shorter weeks thanks to AI—but IWG’s Mark Dixon says automation won’t free time, it’ll just create more work.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nvidia’s boss Jensen Huang and Elon Musk have all made the same prediction in recent years: The workweek is about to shrink. Automation will take over routine tasks, they argue, freeing workers’ time and pushing a four-day week toward becoming standard. Gates has even floated the idea of a two-day workweek.\n\nBut Mark Dixon, CEO and founder of International Workplace Group (IWG) CEO isn’t buying it. From his vantage point, running the world’s largest flexible office provider—with more than 8 million users across 122 countries and 85% of the Fortune 500 among its customers—the math doesn’t add up.\n\n“Everyone is focused on productivity, so no time soon,” Dixon says flatly.\n\n“It’s about the cost of labor,” Dixon explains to Fortune. The U.S. and U.K. are experiencing significant cost-of-living crises. At the same time, he says, businesses are experiencing a “cost of operating crisis.”\n\n“Everyone’s having to control their labor costs because all costs have gone up so much, and you can’t get any more money from customers, so therefore you have to get more out of people.”\n\nEssentially, companies can’t afford to pay the same wages for fewer hours, and they can’t pass the difference on to customers. So any time ‘freed’ by automation is far more likely to be filled with new tasks than handed back to workers.\n\nSilicon Valley’s loudest voices frame AI as a route to more leisure. The world’s richest person and the boss of Space X, Tesla and X, Elon Musk has gone as far as predicting work will be completely “optional” and more like a hobby, in as little as 10 years.\n\nIn reality, Dixon suggests that this scenario would only happen if there’s not enough work to go around, rather than bosses suddenly becoming benevolent. But in his eyes, AI will most likely create more—not less—work.\n\nEvery major technological shift, he argues, has followed a similar arc: fear of displacement, followed by an expansion of opportunity.\n\n“AI will speed up companies development, so there’ll be more work, it’ll just be different work,” he says.\n\nIn 19th-century Britain, Dixon recalls English textile workers protesting against new automated machinery, fearing it threatened their livelihoods, lowered wages, and de-skilled their craft during the Industrial Revolution. They were called Luddites.\n\n“They went around the country smashing up the looms to stop progress. But look, in the end, you’ve heard of the Industrial Revolution. That’s what came from those looms and factory production.” As mass production made goods more available, retail grew; More managers were needed to oversee the machines; The middle-class grew, and so on.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump looked a little worse for wear arriving in Switzerland for what promises to be a highly tense appearance at this year’s World Economic Forum.\n\nCameras at the airstrip Wednesday morning captured the visibly tired, 79-year-old president disembarking before very slowly descending the stairs onto the tarmac.\n\nHe then turned and spoke briefly with reporters, his words all but lost amid the hum of the jet’s engines before setting off toward a nearby helicopter for the final leg of his journey.\n\nFurther footage of him subsequently walking up a red carpet at Davos, posted to X by White House Communications Adviser Margo Martin, shows the president breathing heavily and struggling to tread in a straight line.\n\nTrump’s arrival at the summit had been delayed after Air Force One was forced to make an abrupt return to Washington, D.C. last night following an electrical issue on board.\n\nHis second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nIt also follows after he attended a college football game Monday night, which saw him get home well past 2 a.m., and after he held a 104-minute White House press briefing Tuesday.\n\nThe president’s appearance at the summit comes amid a brewing trade war with European allies over his threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory controlled by NATO ally Denmark, in what critics describe as an assault on the rules-based international order.\n\nIt is not, however, the first time Trump has embarked on government business with an apparent lack of beauty sleep.\n\nThe almost-octogenarian MAGA leader has repeatedly dozed off during high-profile meetings at the White House over the past several weeks.\n\nThose gaffes, coupled with growing memory lapses, verbal slips, confusion and bouts of aggression, have in turn fueled fears Trump may be suffering from the early stages of dementia.\n\nOver the past week, the president has also offered increasingly bizarre justifications for his frenzied push to seize control of Greenland. His shocking admission that the move is linked to a personal gripe over being snubbed for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize has further raised alarm both at home and abroad, with some fearing that at 79 years old, he may simply no longer be up to the job.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story. The president has previously described his cognitive and physical health as “perfect.”",

    "fullText": "Carlos Alcaraz admitted it was tougher than expected to beat world number 102 Yannick Hanfmann at the 2026 Australian Open, despite advancing in straight sets.\n\nThe world No.1 Spaniard’s third-round clash tested his rhythm early, even though he eventually sealed a 7-6(7-4), 6-3, 6-2 victory to reach the third round at Melbourne Park.\n\nAfter the match, Alcaraz spoke honestly about the challenge posed by Hanfmann’s level and pace on the big stage.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz said after his Australian Open second-round win that his opponent pushed him harder than expected.\n\n“I knew he was going to play great. I mean, I know his level, I played him a few times already. To be honest, it was tougher than I thought at the beginning.\n\n“I didn’t feel the ball that good. You know, the ball was coming as a bomb, forehand and backhand,” Alcaraz stated.\n\nAlcaraz’s second-round match saw some early resistance from the German qualifier, ranked 102 in the world, especially in a closely contested first set that went to a tie-break.\n\nBut once the top seed found his groove, he took command to close out the match in straight sets and keep his bid for a maiden Australian Open title alive.\n\nSpeaking further about his performance, Alcaraz acknowledged how he turned things around after a difficult opening frame.\n\n“Really, really happy that I got through a really difficult first set and then I started to feel a little bit better on the court,” he concluded.\n\nWith the win secured in roughly 2 hours and 44 minutes, Alcaraz moves into the third round, where he will look to build momentum and push deeper into the draw at the Australian Open, a title that has eluded him previously despite his status as one of the sport’s brightest stars.",

    "description": "The European Union could roll out a never-before-used tool known as a trade \"bazooka\" should Trump move forward with his proposed tariffs.",
    "fullText": "Europe is weighing retaliation if President Donald Trump imposes more tariffs — and it threatens the US's big global advantage.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pushed to activate what's commonly referred to as a trade \"bazooka\" in response to Trump's recent threat to impose an additional 10% tariff on European countries unless they agree to a deal ceding control of Greenland.\n\n\"The anti-coercion mechanism is a powerful instrument, and we should not hesitate to deploy it in today's tough environment,\" Macron said at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nMacron was referring to a tool passed by the EU in 2023 that would allow it to impose tariffs on imports and restrict services from the US.\n\nThe hit to services such as pharma, tech, and finance would be the new blow to the US economy, as tariffs tend to focus on goods. While the US has a trade deficit for goods, it has a surplus for services.\n\nThe US exported $1.1 trillion in services in 2024, according to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, and has exported more services than it has imported for the last five decades, making it the world's leading services exporter. The St. Louis Fed said in its report that it means \"the U.S. can specialize in services and trade with other countries, which leads to greater efficiency and more benefits for consumers.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis also found that the US exported $489 billion in services to Europe that same year.\n\nAlex Durante, a senior economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told Business Insider that these threats are \"uncharted territory,\" and Trump's push to acquire Greenland could put the US' international standing at risk.\n\n\"America really would lose whatever standing it still has in the world if it were to go forward and do something like that,\" Durante said.\n\nWhite House Spokesman Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"the Trump administration has kept its word\" on its trade deal with the EU earlier this year, adding, \"the EU's time would be better spent delivering on these trade commitments.\"\n\nIn his plan, Trump called out eight European countries that opposed US control of Greenland and sent troops to the country, including Denmark, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, as potential targets for more tariffs.\n\nThose tariffs would be raised to 25% in June if those countries do not agree to the deal, Trump said.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nA Q&A from the EU Commission said that the anti-coercion tool is \"designed to be broad\" to allow for an \"efficient response to an individual case of economic coercion with minimal or no impact on the EU economy.\"\n\nIt could restrict access to European markets for US-based service exporters, such as Big Tech companies and Wall Street firms.\n\nThe trigger for this tool, per the Commission, would be a situation in which a country pressures a member of the EU into making a decision through trade threats.\n\nDurante highlighted the intellectual property issues; the EU could restrict certain IP licenses for US firms. It could similarly limit US banks' access to EU markets, increasing costs domestically.\n\n\"A lot of those sectors, in terms of the tariffs that Trump has imposed, have been insulated from that because of the exemptions,\" Durante said.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his threatened tariffs on EU countries, prices of affected goods would likely increase. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy — a German think tank — found in a recent report that examined over 25 million shipment records that 96% of US tariffs have been paid by US consumers between January 2024 and November 2025.\n\nAnd if the EU rolls out the bazooka, it would take time — the Commission said it would have four months to examine the allegations and up to six months to determine an appropriate response. At the same time, the Trump administration is awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on the legality of many of the president's tariffs, which could limit the tools that Trump has for future trade threats.\n\nAmerican workers could also be affected, Durante said, because the anti-coercion tool would target \"natively American firms\" and reduce their market access and profitability.\n\n\"When you have this kind of tit for tat policy, the US threatens something, the EU responds, and then we threaten something else even beyond that, it could really get out of hand very fast and make citizens of both the EU and the US worse off,\" Durante said.",

Fink said that China's population size and different privacy regime could translate into a major data advantage.\n\nThat dynamic, Fink argued, makes collaboration among the US and its allies essential. \"I would much rather say that we need to spend more money to make sure that we're competing properly against China,\" he said.\n\nStill, Fink warned that the AI boom could disappoint if its benefits remain concentrated among a small group of dominant firms.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" he said.\n\n\"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail,\" he added.\n\nFink's comments came amid a broader debate about whether massive investments in AI are sending the stock markets into a bubble.\n\nSome leaders, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have cautioned about overexcitement in AI — even as they acknowledge the technology's game-changing potential.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said in late October that AI was in a bubble.",

Security guards cleared Congress Hall after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrapped up around noon.\n\nWhile waiting to go back in to hear Trump, attendees, including financier Anthony Scaramucci and University of California chief investment officer, Jagdeep Singh Bachher, could be seen sipping coffee and eating saffron risotto Milanese.\n\nA French journalist approached me to ask whether Trump's threats were real. I told her I didn't know.\n\nAway from hype about Trump's arrival, Davos is still carrying on as normal.\n\nOn a panel this morning, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang described AI as the biggest infrastructure buildout in human history — and one he sees creating a jobs boom for those with the right skillset.\n\nAway from hype about Trump's arrival, Davos is still carrying on as normal.\n\nOn a panel this morning, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang described AI as the biggest infrastructure buildout in human history — and one he sees creating a jobs boom for those with the right skillset.\n\n\"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,\" he said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.\n\nHuang said the US was seeing a \"significant boom\" in this area, with salaries nearly doubling in some cases. \"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" added Huang.\n\n\"Everybody should be able to make a great living.

Now, there's another 75 miles to reach Davos, most likely by helicopter.\n\nCongress Hall is now being cleared ahead of President Donald Trump's speech.\n\nOne security guard told me the speech would be on time despite the electrical problems on AF1, but we still haven't heard official word from WEF.\n\nAs Trump seeks Greenland, insisting that it's key for protection against Russia and China, his allies don't actually disagree with his security concerns. His methods are causing great tension among his allies, but they agree that the Arctic is an area of risk.\n\n\"I think President Trump is right. Other leaders in NATO are right. We need to defend the Arctic,\" as China and Russia increase their presence there, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a Wednesday morning appearance at Davos.\n\nAs Trump seeks Greenland, insisting that it's key for protection against Russia and China, his allies don't actually disagree with his security concerns.

He expects tensions with the US to de-escalate, \"I think at the end of the day, we'll find an off-ramp on this.\"\n\nAfter an electrical issue on Air Force One delayed the president overnight, a replacement plane, a Boeing C-32A, was scrambled into action to bring him to Europe.\n\nAs of around midday Swiss time, the jet, a modified Boeing 757 often used as Air Force Two, was still in the air, flying close to Paris and heading for Zurich airport, where it looks likely to land within the next hour.\n\nIf, like many high-profile World Economic Forum attendees, Trump travels by helicopter from Zurich airport, it would take about another 30 to 40 minutes to reach Davos.\n\nThat could put him in the Swiss Alps just before 1.30 p.m. CET, and he is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m. CET.\n\nHowever, there will likely be further added time due to security and other preparations.\n\nIn short, we don't exactly know.\n\nNo clear indication has been given of what the president plans to discuss in his special address to the Davos crowd.

And that's probably not changing anytime soon,\" Steinbach said. \"The opportunity is a lot needs to be built now, because you've got supply chains that need to get re-looked.

    "fullText": "A PGA Tour veteran has sent a jolt through the golf world with a candid take on LIV Golf’s ripple effect. While many criticize LIV Golf and the professionals who play in it, Tom Hoge doesn’t. The reason – the Saudi-backed league has helped him financially in a unique way.\n\n“Well, I would say personally speaking, I’m probably the player that’s benefited absolutely the most from LIV coming along. I played well in 2022 right before LIV got going, which brought an offer from LIV, so I went down that road for a little bit. But, sticking with the PGA Tour and the changes they made, I’ve played in every signature event since they were established. And I would say nobody’s benefited more financially than I have cuz I’ve played well in some of those events and been in all of them,” Tom Hoge revealed in conversation with Trey Wingo.\n\n“So, it’s been fantastic for me. So, I shouldn’t be the guy here, complaining about any of that coming along. But it is tough for the game of golf that there’s a lot of great players that are on LIV that we’re not competing with against every week like we were.”\n\nThe 36-year-old PGA Tour professional from Statesville, North Carolina, stated that LIV’s inception has brought him financial benefits. However, he is not the only one. Many professionals on the PGA Tour have benefited indirectly from LIV’s inception. As former CEO Greg Norman highlighted, the Saudi-backed league disrupted the market, which was essential to restoring balance.\n\nBefore LIV’s arrival, the prize pools for PGA Tour events weren’t that large. And there weren’t many additional benefits that athletes enjoy today. For instance, the PGA Tour started its for-profit entity and offered equity stakes to golfers. The standard prize pool on the PGA Tour was around $8-$9 million. Then came LIV Golf, offering $20-$25 million per event. This put pressure on the PGA Tour to pay golfers more.\n\nThus, the PGA Tour started elevating events in 2023, which officially became the Signature Events in 2024. These events feature higher prize money of around $20 million or more.\n\nSince Tom Hoge performed well in 2022, he has been eligible to play Signature Events until now. In 2025, too, he was eligible for and played all Signature Events. He posted strong results in many of them, including T8 at The Sentry ($550,000), T3 at THE PLAYERS Championship ($1,325,000), T5 at Valero Texas Open ($304,000), T14 at the Masters ($336,000), and T7 at the Memorial ($603,200). These finishes underscore his claim of major financial gains from post-LIV Tour upgrades.\n\nIn 2024, he also finished strongly at many events. Hoge received $642,500 at the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, $646,000 at the 2024 The Genesis Invitational, $389,666 at the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational, and $1,160,000 at the Travelers Championship. This shows that a large part of his official money came from the Signature events in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhile he enjoys the financial benefits, he also misses playing with some of the best golfers. Playing against strong competitors makes an athlete strong. Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, Joaquin Niemann, and Patrick Reed are some of the many gold golfers playing LIV Golf. Their exclusion from PGA Tour events influences the field’s strength, which also impacts the OWGR points.\n\nAlthough Tom Hoge is happy with almost every change the PGA Tour has gone through after LIV’s inception, he dislikes one thing that may come from 2027.\n\nTiger Woods’s Future Competition Committee (FCC) planned for a redesigned schedule from 2027. The new schedule will likely feature fewer events and may start in February instead of January. Woods and the FCC aim to mitigate viewership competition from the NFL in January. CEO Brian Rolapp supports this view and the redesigned schedule. However, Tom Hoge doesn’t.\n\nHoge told Golf Channel the pre-LIV model worked well. It allowed players to pick events freely with equal stature throughout the season. He praised past flexibility where stars like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson elevated chosen events without a rigid top-heavy structure. If the redesigned schedule reduces the number of events, it will take away this flexibility. Therefore, Hoge opposed a reduced schedule. Instead, he valued the ability to take a month off or play four straight weeks.\n\nTom Hoge’s comments highlight how LIV Golf’s arrival reshaped his financial outlook while also changing the competitive feel of the PGA Tour. As golf moves toward another possible shift, his perspective reflects both gratitude for new opportunities and concern for what may be lost.\n\nThe post Greg Norman Was Right All Along as PGA Tour Champ Owns Up to Benefiting from LIV Golf appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "In a client-server world, identity and authority are anchored in a server that logs people in and enforces\npermissions. When you take the server away, though, it might seem like there’s no solid foundation for\nauthentication or authorization. Is there a principled way to establish trust in a distributed application?",
    "fullText": "When I first started thinking about authentication and authorization in a local-first context I\nfound it super weird and confusing, like I’d stepped through the looking-glass. I found myself\nwrestling with big philosophical questions like “where does authority ultimately come from?” and\n“what does it mean to know someone?“.\n\nI’m going to walk you through my journey, from that initial disorientation to what I believe are\nsolid, principled approaches, in the course of developing the @localfirst/auth library.\n\nIt might not be obvious why this might be disorienting, so I’ll explain.\n\nWithout a server, it’s not clear where authority or identity come from.\n\nTraditional authentication and authorization ultimately “root out” in a physical piece of hardware,\nowned and controlled by a company that you’ve decided to trust. The hardware is a server that has\nyour username and password and rules about what you’re allowed to do. It might be controlled by your\nemployer, or a SaaS provider, or a big tech company.\n\nThe server is like a guard at the castle gates. If the server doesn’t recognize you, it doesn’t let\nyou in. If the server doesn’t think you should be allowed to have something, it doesn’t give it to\nyou.\n\nOf course, the whole point of local-first software is that we don’t love that arrangement.\n\nBut when you take away that central server, you’re losing the thing that all our notions of security\nare anchored to.\n\nIf all you have is clients, who are peers — which means they relate to each other as equals — then\nhow do we know who is who? How do we know who to trust? What do permissions even mean — who exactly\nis “giving permission”?\n\n“Bootstrapping” has become a word that we associate with something as easy and routine as turning\nyour computer on. But the whole point of bootstrapping as a metaphor is that it’s supposed to be\nimpossible: You can’t lift yourself up by pulling on your bootstraps.\n\nIt’s like living in a monarchy and realizing that the king is just another person, and not someone\nappointed by the gods. Just like countries making that transition from monarchy to democracy, we’re\nsuddenly adrift, and have to come up with completely new arrangements to solve problems that were\nalready solved — even if in a suboptimal way.\n\nWithout a server, it feels like we’re having to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps on some\nfundamental questions:\n\nIn 2020, a couple of weeks into the pandemic, I started work on a library that became\nlocalfirst/auth.\n\nI had to learn about modern cryptography starting from zero.\n\nI was immediately fascinated by how empowering public-key cryptography is, in the sense that it\ncan put me on an equal footing with even very powerful adversaries.\n\nThe movies would lead you to believe that defeating encryption is something a dude in a hoodie can\ndo just by typing really hard.\n\nBut in the real world strong cryptography can’t be defeated.* It just\ncan’t.**\n\nHere is legendary cryptologist and mathematician Daniel J. Bernstein writing over a decade\nago:\n\nFor most cryptographic operations, there exist widely accepted primitives that have been\nextensively studied, and breaking them is considered computationally infeasible on any existing\ncomputer cluster.\n\nThe point is you don’t need a lot of money, or computing power, or specialized equipment. Strong\nencryption doesn’t cost any more than weak encryption. It doesn’t cost any more to use a long\nencryption key than a short one. It’s just math. It’s just code.\n\nSo anyway I’m sitting down to work on this, and the first thing that makes my head spin is, how do\nyou know you’re talking to?\n\nWhen we collaborate or communicate online using a traditional cloud-based platform, we can think of\nthe service provider as vouching for us — introducing us to other people and confirming our\nidentity.\n\nIf I’m using Slack to talk to you, you know it’s me because Slack says it’s me, and you trust Slack.\nAnd maybe Slack knows it’s me because I logged in with Google: Google vouched for me, and Slack\ntrusts Google.\n\nIf we don’t want to put our trust in a centralized third party, then who will vouch us?\n\nIn a system where everyone’s a peer, then maybe peers could vouch for peers, in some kind of chain\nof trust.\n\nBut that chain has to be anchored somewhere: Maybe Charlie vouches for Bob to Alice, but who vouches\nfor Charlie?\n\nIgnoring the infinite regress problem for the moment, it seems clear that the solution will be\nsomething something public-key cryptography. But to do public-key cryptography, you need to know\npeople’s public keys.\n\n”Crypto is a tool for turning a whole swathe of problems into key management problems. Key\nmanagement problems are way harder than virtually all cryptographers think.”\n\n— Dr. Lea Kissner\n\nDr. Kissner was the head of information security at Twitter and I don’t think they meant the above\ntweet to be encouraging.\n\nBut I do find it encouraging. Even granting that key management is a hard problem, the idea that you\ncan collapse lots of different problems into this one problem is exciting, because you just have to\nfocus on solving that thing. If you can succeed at the key management thing — it’s is a big if — but\nif you can, then you can solve this “whole swathe of problems.”\n\nSo how do we learn people’s public keys?\n\nHere in Spain, I can obtain a certificate from the treasury department to install in my browser,\nwhich allows me to transparently authenticate to government websites and sign official documents\ndigitally.\n\nThe most obvious solution is to have some trusted party keep a directory of people and their public\nkeys, and of course that’s totally a thing that exists.\n\nThe certificate authorities (CAs) that make secure https connections possible are an example. Some\nbig companies have their own certificate authorities to anchor their employees’ digital identities.\nAnd countries can do the same for residents.\n\nThis is what my public PGP\nkey looks\nlike.\n\nBut we’re trying to do this without depending on centralized services.\n\nIf you want a decentralized solution, the alternative seems to be for people to actively share their\nown keys directly with each other.\n\nThis was the approach taken by PGP (“Pretty Good Privacy”) in the 1990s.\n\nPGP was the first encryption toolset intended for ordinary users. The idea was that people would put\ntheir public keys on their websites and in their email signatures. Apparently there were key signing\nparties where people exchanged and signed each other’s keys.\n\nFrom the looks of it these parties were lit.🥳\n\nIn 2014, Keybase had a better idea: People can just post their public keys in\nmachine-readable form on public sites where they have accounts, like Twitter or GitHub. They called\nthese “social proofs”. Then anyone can look up a person’s public keys by username, and use them to\nverify their identity.\n\nI’ve used Keybase to “verify myself” by posting machine-readable statements on\nTwitter,\nGitHub, and\nReddit\n\nThe first applications to truly bring end-to-end encryption to the masses were messaging apps. The\nSignal protocol came out in 2013, and two years later WhatsApp brought it to their entire customer\nbase, and overnight about a billion people were using encrypted messaging. Since then WhatsApp’s\nuser base grew to two billion and then to three billion, making it one of the most widely used\ncommunication tools in all of human history.\n\nThis succeeded because they made encryption transparent to the user. The key insight is that a\npublic key will never be like an email or a telephone number. It’s not a stable component of our\ndigital identity. Wrangling encryption keys is a job for computers, not for people. Devices should\njust generate keys as needed and we should never see them or have to think about them. Private keys\nshould never leave the device, and public keys should be shared automatically with other devices.\n\nWe’re agreed, then, that device-to-device sharing of keys is better than key signing parties. But\nAlice’s device still needs to know that Bob’s device is really Bob’s device, and not Eve’s device\npretending to be Bob’s device.\n\nTOFU considered squishy. Image: Yoav Aziz\n\nWhatsApp and Signal take an approach called “Trust On First Use”, or TOFU. Here’s how that works:\n\nThere’s a little risk there, they’re both taking a little leap of faith, but it’s a one-time thing,\nit’s probably fine.\n\nThat seems reasonable. The problem, though, is that the “first use” bit is kind of misleading,\nbecause in practice TOFU doesn’t happen just once.\n\nRemember, the keys we care about are device-level keys, not user-level keys. So what happens when\nBob gets a new phone, or Alice reinstalls the software on her laptop?\n\nWhat happens is an “account reset”, and at that point we’re back to TOFU — except that now, the\nattack scenarios are a bit more plausible: an impostor might have engineered the reset, and it would\nbe more feasible to exploit it.\n\nWhen a user has an account reset, the messaging apps suggest to everyone they communicate with that\nthey compare “security codes” or “safety numbers”. Most users don’t do this — I never have, I can’t\nimagine that people less technical than me do this.\n\nAnd anyway this is bad enough for a single pairwise connection; where this all really falls apart is\nin a large group, where the number of pairwise connections scales exponentially with the size of the\ngroup.\n\nWith a balanced PAKE, both parties need to know the password.\n\nSo when you want to connect with someone and don’t know their public key, is there an alternative to\nTOFU for securing that initial connection?\n\nThe most promising approach is to first share a single-use password out of band (in person, or via a\nchannel you already trust). There is whole a family of cryptographic protocols that support this,\ncalled PAKEs (for “password-authenticated key exchange”).\n\nWe’re saying “password” but it’s generally presented as an invitation code.\n\nIn the most common forms, both parties need to know the secret code; this is called a balanced\nPAKE.\n\nThe downside is that the inviter and invitee need to connect directly to validate the invitation.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE, a third party can verify the password without knowing it.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE (asymmetric because the verifier doesn’t need to know the password) a\nthird party can validate an invitation code without knowing it in advance or asking for it.\n\nThis brings us back to Keybase. In 2017 or so, they decided to try to monetize by building a\nSlack-but-encrypted thing for enterprise customers. They quickly realized that even if the global\nnerd population thought the idea of putting your public key on Twitter was really cool, Jim in\nAccounts Payable is probably just not going to do that. Sorry, it’s just not going to happen.\n\nSo they needed a way to bootstrap that initial key exchange, and they proposed something called a\nSeitan Token Exchange (presumably “seitan” because it’s not as\nsoft as tofu).\n\nThis is the approach I stole for localfirst/auth. At the time I didn’t know a PAKE from a hole in\nthe ground, but as it turns out this is essentially an asymmetric PAKE.\n\nWe’ve been talking about “identity”; but the beauty of this approach is that identity doesn’t need\nto mean “who you are in the world”, in the sense of linking to your real name or email or whatever —\nit can just mean “who you are to me“.\n\nRather than linking identity to a name or an email address, we link it to a relationship.\n\nFor example, in Ink & Switch’s Backchannel project one\nof the motivating use cases was connecting an anonymous source to a journalist. With a system like\nthis the source doesn’t have to have a name at all; the only thing that matters is that they’re able\nto interact once.\n\nTrust and identity are ultimately rooted in real-world relationships and interactions between human\nbeings. I know you because we interact, whether that’s face-to-face or online. That’s what it\nmeans to “know” someone. And we can use that interaction to bootstrap cryptographically secure\nconnections going forward. And if you have those secure connections with other people and I trust\nyou, I can benefit from your connections, and so on, forming a network of trust relationships.\n\nThat helps us clear up our thinking about identity:\n\nA. Real-world human interactions and relationships.\n\nThis feels correct to me: It’s natural, human-scale, and rooted in social reality.\n\nThe server-centric model roots our identity in getting distant corporations to vouch for us.\n\nWith this model, instead can we vouch for ourselves:\n\nAnd we can vouch for each other:\n\nIs it possible to have a secure, distributed access control list?\n\nSo now I have a way of knowing it’s you. But how do I know if you’re on my team? How do I know if I\nshould share this document with you, or if you should be able to edit it?\n\nOn a server this information is often recorded in some kind of access control list (ACL). So\nmaybe we need that, but distributed — everybody needs a copy of the same list. How would that work?\n\nMy first thought was that we could just put this information in an Automerge document and replicate\nit across everyone’s devices that way. But we can’t just let anyone edit this document at will. It\nshould be obvious if anyone changes the permissions, and we need to know who changed the\npermissions, and if they … had permission to do so? Do we need an ACL for the ACL?\n\nLet’s ignore that rabbit hole of infinite regress for the moment and focus on the mechanics. We need\na way of replicating a document that is:\n\n✅ tamper-evident: it shouldn’t be possible for someone to surreptitiously modify the list\n\n✅ eventually consistent: everybody should have the same list\n\n✅ authenticated: we need to know who has written changes to the list\n\nSo let’s look at some options for data structures.\n\nWhen we say “tamper-resistant” the first thing you might think of is a hash chain (or\nblockchain), where each link contains a cryptographic hash of the previous link, so it’s\nimpossible to modify one link or change the order without breaking the chain.\n\nThe problem is that this chain needs to be linear. Replicating it while ensuring consistency\nrequires enforcing a strict ordering; and cryptocurrency blockchains are famously … not optimized\nfor efficiency.\n\nTo accomplish this without burning enough fossil fuels to power multiple small countries, we could\nuse a hash graph. A hash graph is a hash chain plus branching. A CRDT like Automerge combines a\nhash graph with automatic conflict resolution logic to support replication with eventual\nconsistency. Git works the same way but with manual conflict resolution.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\nSo far so good. But we still need a way of verifying who made which changes to our distributed\naccess control list.\n\nA signature graph is a hash graph where the individual operations are signed by the author. This\ngives us all three things.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\n✅ authenticated\n\nIf you look at the work of anyone who’s trying to tackle this problem, you’re going to see some kind\nof signature graph: the Matrix protocol,\nDXOS’s HALO, Fission’s\nUCANs, etc. It’s a case of convergent evolution — we’ve all more\nor less independently landed on this data structure.\n\nThe way this works, concretely, is that there’s a series of operations on the group:\n\nThe first link, the root of the chain, marks the creation of the group and by definition adds\nthe founder to the group as an admin. It also includes the founder’s public keys.\n\nEach subsequent link represents an administrative action such as inviting a member, removing a\nmember, promoting a member to admin (or another role), or demoting a member.\n\nEach link contains a cryptographic hash of the preceding link, so the order of the links\ncannot be altered.\n\nEach link contains a digital signature of its content by the member making the change, so that\nits authenticity can be independently verified, and so that the link body cannot be tampered with.\n\nWhen I found a group, I am the only member and the only authority. I can decide to add members, and\nI can decide to delegate authority to them as well. Another member with admin authority could even\nremove me from the group.\n\nThis is a key point that we’ll come back to: In a group, authority is rooted in the act of\ncreating the group.\n\nTo be replicable, this data structure needs to be a CRDT. However, you can’t model group permissions\nusing a JSON CRDT like Automerge. I’ll explain why.\n\nHere we have two concurrent actions, but there’s no conflict, and we can resolve this by picking one\nor the other in an arbitrary but deterministic order. So far, nothing a generic CRDT couldn’t handle.\n\nWhat if someone takes actions while concurrently being removed? For example, what if Bob adds\nCharlie to the group and concurrently, Alice removes Bob from the group? Now we have a conflict.\n\nQ. Is Charlie in the group or not?\n\nIt’s important to resolve this correctly, or else Bob could circumvent his removal by writing a\nconcurrent operation adding proxy-Bob to the group.\n\nA: No. Removals always take precedence. We resolve that conflict by prioritizing removals. A\ngeneric CRDT like Automerge won’t be able to resolve this conflict in a principled way; it won’t\neven see it as a conflict. So this has to be implemented as a custom CRDT engine.\n\nWhat if two admins remove each other concurrently? (Or more generally, what if there’s a cycle of\nconcurrent removals?)\n\nAs a scenario involving two legitimate members of the group, this is far-fetched and unlikely to\nhappen. A more realistic and worrying scenario might be, for example, a compromised and revoked\ndevice trying to undo its revocation.\n\nOption 1: Remove both The logical conclusion of “removals take precedence” is to remove both.\n\nHowever, this seems unlikely to be the correct way of resolving the issue. It leaves Charlie\norphaned in a group without admins and creates an opening for a denial-of-service attack, where a\nrogue device blows up the group rather than allowing itself to be removed.\n\nOption 2: Fork the group Another approach is to “fork the world” into two parallel versions of\nthe same group: one where Alice stays and one where Bob stays. Then each member decides which world\nthey want to live in. This reflects the reality of a decentralized system.\n\nI suspect that in practice it’d be hard to communicate what’s going on to most users, and it would\njust be confusing and upsetting.\n\nI call option 2 the “Papal Schism” approach, in honor of the time when there were two popes and all of\nCatholic Christendom had to decide which one to follow.\n\nOption 3: Keep the senior member The solution I settled on is to let seniority be a proxy for\nwho is more likely to be in the right. In this case, Alice has been in the group longer than Bob, so\nshe stays.\n\nThe key insight for me was that the root node of a signature graph gives you an anchor for\nauthority. If I create a group, by definition I get to decide who’s in it.\n\nAt the moment of creation, Alice is the absolute dictator of a group with no other members: Alice\ndecides who to add to the group. Alice decides if she wants to delegate her authority to other\nmembers. She can make everyone else an admin too.\n\nThis delegates the right to remove anyone, including herself, from the group. But even once she’s\ngone, the authority behind any action — any addition or removal of members, any further delegation\nof authority — can always be traced back to the authority inherent in her act of creation.\n\nWe started with two big questions about how we find our footings in a local-first world.\n\nThe Seitan protocol that I decided to use, like any other flavor of PAKE, is complex and involves\nmany cryptographic subtleties. But any invitation protocol, no matter how involved, has something\nvery simple at its core: An interaction that takes place in the context of some existing\nrelationship.\n\nIn the beginning there was a relationship.\n\nAt first, it felt like cheating, or a cop-out, to rely on a “pre-existing trusted side channel” to\ntransmit this invitation. But it’s not at all. And it’s not a minor thing or an implementation\ndetail either — in fact, it’s the core of this whole thing.\n\nHow does Alice know it’s Bob? Because Alice and Bob had that interaction where Alice communicated\nthe invitation code to him, and Bob is able to prove that he’s the one she had that interaction\nwith.\n\nThe fact that this pre-existing channel exists at all is very significant; it only exists because\nthere is some kind of pre-existing relationship between Alice and Bob in the real world.\n\nSo, that’s our answer: preexisting human interactions and relationships are what anchor\nidentity.\n\nWhen you found a company, you decide who you want to invite to work with you. Depending on how you\nset things up, you might end up being removed from the company later on. But the authority to do\nthat can ultimately be traced back to delegations of authority you made.\n\nWhen you start any kind of project, you decide who you want to go on that journey with you, or if\nyou want to go it alone.\n\nWhen you begin writing a document, you don’t have to share it with anyone - you could keep it to\nyourself forever. If you do share it, the details are up to you: Do you share it with the whole\nworld? Just with your team? Just with one person? Whose input will you pay attention to?\n\nNone of this gives you any power over anyone outside the context of the thing you created: They can\nchoose whether to accept, and they can stop collaborating with you at any time.\n\nIt only recently occurred to me that authority and authorship come from the same root word.\n\nAuthority is rooted in authorship, in the act of creation.\n\nSo. These are the answers I’ve found to our big questions. I think they’re good answers. As it\nturns out, not only you can anchor decentralized security on something solid, but the foundation\nwe’ve found is something more legitimate, more satisfying, more human than a distant company’s\n“because I said so”.\n\nIf you’re looking to secure a local-first application, take a look at my\n@localfirst/auth library, which is a working\nimplementation of these ideas, including an auth provider for integration with\nautomerge-repo.\n\nAt some point in the process of creating localfirst/auth, I realized that I’d made a custom CRDT; so\nI extracted the machinery for creating, validating, and interpreting signature chains into the\nCRDX package. This can be used on\nits own to create an encrypted, authenticated CRDT with bespoke conflict detection and resolution\nlogic.\n\nIf you take any of this out for a spin — or if you have questions about how it works — please get in\ntouch with me — via one of the (pre-existing, trusted) channels listed below!\n\nThis library’s shape emerged from a series of conversations early on with Peter Van\nHardenberg of Ink & Switch. Peter drilled\ninto my head the idea that device keys should be generated locally and never leave the device, and\npointed me towards Keybase’s signature chains.\n\nMartin Kleppmann of Cambridge University has been very generous\nwith his time and expertise. Martin is the creator of\nAutomerge and co-author with Peter of Ink & Switch’s\nlocal-first manifesto. Much of localfirst/auth is an\nexpression in code of his theoretical work. Every time I’ve been stuck on something, Martin has\nco-written a paper that solves that exact thing. These two papers were particularly helpful:",

    "fullText": "When I swapped my iPhone for a Nokia, Walkman, film camera and physical map, I wasn’t sure what to expect. But my life soon started to change\n\nWhen two balaclava-clad men on a motorbike mounted the pavement to rob me, recently, I remained oblivious. My eyes were pinned to a text message on my phone, and my hands were so clawed around it that they didn’t even bother to grab it. It wasn’t until an elderly woman shrieked and I felt the whoosh of air as the bike launched back on to the road that I looked up at all. They might have been unsuccessful but it did make me think: what else am I missing from the real world around me?\n\nBefore I’ve poured my first morning coffee I’ve already watched the lives of strangers unfold on Instagram, checked the headlines, responded to texts, swiped through some matches on a dating app, and refreshed my emails, twice. I check Apple Maps for my quickest route to work. I’ve usually left it too late to get the bus, so I rent a Lime bike using the app. During the day, my brother sends me some memes, I take a picture of a canal boat, and pay for my lunch on Apple Pay. I walk home listening to music on Spotify and a long voice note from a friend, then I watch a nondescript TV drama, while scrolling through Depop and Vinted for clothes.\n\nI’m constantly contactable, I have no personal boundaries, and my attention span disappeared a long time ago. Since the first iPhone in 2007, smartphones have become indispensable to modern life, with the average person in the UK spending four hours and 20 minutes online per day. “Social media provides frictionless access to an infinite universe of mostly free digital drugs,” says Anna Lembke, author of Dopamine Nation. “And the algorithm tailors the experience for each unique brain, making it very reinforcing, while also injecting just enough novelty in the infinite scroll to overcome boredom and tolerance. All these features combined keep us clicking and swiping long after we want to.” Over time we develop tolerance, which means “we need more of it and a more potent form to get the same effect.”\n\nIncreased screen time has been associated with depression, anxiety and poorer sleep. But is it possible to live lo-fi in a hi-tech world? For a month, I tried: swapping my iPhone for a Nokia which I can only use to text, call and play Snake; also, a Walkman and a film camera. I picked up physical copies of books, newspapers and magazines; I used a London A-Z for directions, and hunted down my physical bank cards or tried to use cash. The only screen time exception was for work, where from 9-5 I used my laptop to respond to emails and write.\n\n“You’re going to look like such a performative hipster,” my flatmate Ben says, as I’m setting up my new devices. He’s right. I leave the Walkman behind, but my bag is still heavier than usual with my book, notepad, A-Z and wallet. I haven’t taken the bus into work yet from my new home so I follow a hand-drawn map to the stop and run for a bus. I stupidly didn’t write down the bus number but that one sounds familiar. It’s not the one, two friendly strangers tell me, but I can swap on to another at Angel. “We’ve outsourced our memory to our phones,” says Nicholas Kardaras, author of Digital Madness and a former assistant clinical professor of psychology at Stony Brook University, New York. “And unfortunately the ease and comfort of being lubricated by technology just means our human skills atrophied. It is use it or lose it.”\n\nThe bus is crawling. Normally, I would have looked up a different route. I try to message a friend back but it’s difficult having to click each button multiple times for the letter I want. “Hard work,” I manage. I read for the rest of the journey.\n\nOn my lunch break, my sister and I go for a walk around the park. When she leaves me to do another lap, I have an urge to check Instagram and my emails but I’m only getting the odd SMS. I’m craving the back-and-forth WhatsApps with friends telling me fun facts about their day. I feel a little unsettled, but I try to focus on the changing leaves on the trees. I have thoughts that wouldn’t usually have the time to surface. How stressful.\n\nAfter work, I go to see the saxophone player cktrl at the ICA. I’m a little worried about collecting the tickets without access to the Dice app I bought them on, but I show them my passport instead. I would normally join the throngs of people filming a song or two, so I could upload some blurred clips with poor sound to social media to show that I had a great time. But I can’t, so I watch him play, undistracted. Then a flashlight glares behind me, as someone films an entire track. I vow never to be that annoying person again.\n\nMy digital detox is starting to stress out my friends. Nicole finally gets through to me, saying: “I hate your dumb phone.” She’s been texting, but didn’t realise you had to click twice to make it send as an SMS not an iMessage. Another friend wants to share a dating story and texts: “Omg this is a terrible time not to access voice note.” And, when my landlord messages asking us to send pictures of the new carpet on WhatsApp, which I can’t do, Ben texts: “You’re going to be such a liability this month.”\n\nIn the evening, my date sends me the address of a pub to meet him at “for your A-Z”. I allow lots of time to decipher its tiny font and navigate my way there. He’s running late, so I sit by the fireplace in the pub and read my book. I look like I’m waiting for someone to chat me up. When he arrives, he shows me how to turn on predictive text, which is a relief for my very tired thumbs.\n\nAt lunchtime, I put on the terrestrial TV and watch Escape to the Country, where I learn about the housing market in Herefordshire. I want to cook myself an elaborate meal – for dinner, and also for entertainment, but when I get to the shops, I remember that I can’t look up a recipe on my phone, so I settle for tomato pasta.\n\nMy flatmate picked up a Nina Simone CD for me in a charity shop. I try to play it on my Walkman, but realise it needs batteries. On my lunch break I buy some (who knew there were so many sizes?) and walk home from the office listening to it. Spotify can be overwhelming with its hundred million tracks, so it’s nice to remove the element of choice and focus on the album as it was intended, not scrambled by shuffle mode. Rosanna Irwin, who runs Samsú – a collection of digital detox cabins in Ireland – knows the importance of analogue listening: she leaves her guests with cassette tapes she makes with her father. After reaching a state of burnout, working long hours in tech – first at Meta and later for a climate tech company – she visited the Danish island of Samsø with her husband in 2023, and found peace amid the scrappy phone service and incredible nature.\n\n“My mental health was very poor,” she says. “I was spending a lot of time online and I did an accidental digital detox on this island and came back invigorated from the experience.” She recommends a three-day retreat. “There’s a lot of science to show that it’s around 72 hours in nature where the true magic starts to happen.”\n\nI meet my friend at Vauxhall station, and we walk to a cafe for breakfast, then to Tate Britain. Camilla is pretty offline: she’s a doctor and doesn’t have social media. She rarely responds to texts and is maybe one of the most joyful people I know. But she says she feels so much guilt about not replying sooner and hates the fact that phones are like this ever-present person in the room, distracting you from being totally engaged with the real-life friends around you.The sentiment resonates with me; we both want to be more spontaneous.\n\nInspired by our conversation, I call Aakriti, who doesn’t live too far away. I meet her and two of her friends and we eat empanadas. On the way home, I have to ask the only man on the platform for help. The overground isn’t due for 24 minutes, so I wonder if there is a faster route. There isn’t, so I shiver at the outdoor station wishing I could book an Uber.\n\nIt’s tipping down with rain when I arrive at Canada Water, and I don’t want to ruin my A-Z to search for Rotherhithe Street. I know The Mayflower pub is on the river and ask a man at a convenience store to point me in the right direction. I’m early, so I squint at my book in the candle-lit pub, feeling very Victorian. There’s a hilarious waiter, who is telling dating stories from Grindr, and it’s much better than my book. This no-technology thing is making me nosy. I pay for my roast with cash, which feels almost fake now, like I’m in a game. Then my friend and I go to the cinema – the Picturehouse in central London, because it’s in between where we both live. They charge us £20 for a ticket, which I would never have paid had I known before we made the trip. I’m left fuming, but luckily the movie is good.\n\nI need to call the bank. My flatmate has sent rent money to my Monzo account, which I can only access on the app, and I get a text saying that I’ve gone into an unarranged overdraft. When I get to the tube in the morning, my Oyster card has run out, so I top up the credit and miss my train – I would usually have used a payment card on Apple Pay instead. I have to wait eight minutes for the next one. I’m flustered by the time I get to the office and feel stressed about not being able to check how much money is in my account or transfer money between accounts.\n\nThere’s a group of children on a school trip on my train. The teacher is trying to keep them entertained by getting them to play a word association game. “When I say ‘bread’,” she says. “You could say, ‘sandwich’. Let’s have a go. ‘School,’” the teacher says. “Prison,” a child shouts back. When I arrive in Notting Hill, I study the map at the station to make sure I surface from the correct exit. I memorise key landmarks so I know where to turn – the Gate Cinema is by the road I need to get to Uxbridge Street. I’m late, and don’t have time for mistakes, so I start walking down the street quickly, scouring every restaurant until I find the Palestinian cafe I’m looking for.\n\nThe worries I felt at the start of the experiment about getting lost and not being able to communicate with friends seem to have diminished. I’m calmer, and present when I’m with people. I look around the train on my morning commute and notice that everyone except one person has their eyes glued to their phones. The man opposite me doesn’t have earphones, a phone or a book. I try not to catch his eye, as I’m worried I’ve been staring. Things are less relaxed when I try to meet my friend Navid after work. We can’t pick a place to meet and he is frustrated because he can’t send me links: “Please return to WhatsApp you Neanderthal.” He’s late, so I wait outside the station for 45 minutes. He arrives with a big grin, knowing I’m a bit irritated, but I get my own back by torturing him with two hours of experimental jazz.\n\nAfter work, I go to see my friend Scarlett, who is being held captive by a corgi puppy. It’s dark and damp when I arrive in south-east London but I’ve written out the directions to the house as carefully as I can. I didn’t bring my A-Z because my bag was too heavy, but I’m certain I can’t mess up the 10-minute walk. I call my mum and we natter for 20 minutes before I realise I haven’t spotted the turning. In a panic, I ask her to look up my location on Google Maps, which is obviously cheating, but I’m now late and in the middle of a cemetery. I’ve gone completely the wrong way and she has to narrate the route to my destination.\n\nIt’s been a busy weekend so far and I feel like having a lazy day. I walk to a yoga class and then go for a wander. As I’m walking, and listening to my one CD, I get a call from the guy I’m dating who has just finished work. We try to hunt down a board game to play, but when the local charity shops fail us, we pick up some newspapers and magazines and the ingredients for a roast chicken instead. We then sit on the sofa playing music and reading in the old fashioned way. It feels like we’ve retired.\n\nI finally get around to calling the bank to pay my rent, which is late for the first time. I’ve been putting off the inevitable 20-minute call that includes reading out lots of sort codes and bank numbers and spelling the names of my landlord along with the various friends I owe money to. It’s quite unnerving transferring money without checking the details with my own eyes, and the woman on the phone keeps telling me that it would be much easier to do this online.\n\nFor all the frustrations of the month, I’m sad the experiment is over. I’m left with the feeling that living offline puts other people out: if we’re looking for a place to eat or a pub to go to it’s down to them, they’re on map duty, and I’m not able to book Ubers. But I was happier and calmer – relieved of the endless scrolling, waiting for texts back, and the need to communicate with people all the time. After about a week, I wasn’t reaching for my phone and I had the patience to read. It was nice not to be able to look at my work emails in the evening. I’m determined to delete my main distractions: Depop, Hinge and Instagram. Scouring charity shops for clothes is much more satisfying; dating with no distractions is so much easier; and I can live without reels about botched Botox and AI animals. “Big tech platforms are not addictive accidentally, they’re addictive by design,” says Kardaras. “They’re selling their product by targeting the vulnerable: if the algorithm detects that a young person has a body image issue or is struggling with self-harm or depression, then they bombard them with content on that subject that exacerbates their mental unwellness.” On my last day, I get an email from Scarlett: “Splashed my phone with water whilst listening to the Lily Allen album in the bath, now phoneless and actually want to copy you.” It seems I’m not the only one keen to disconnect.",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

    "fullText": "World Cup 2026 ticket holders can now access priority visa appointments for travel to the United States - but doubt remains whether fans from every country to have qualified will be able to enter.\n\nThe Fifa Prioritised Appointment Scheduling System - or Fifa Pass - announced by US President Donald Trump in November, went live on Tuesday.\n\nIt was introduced in part because citizens of some countries whose teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup may not otherwise receive visa appointments in time for the tournament.\n\nBut the US State Department has stressed that a Fifa Pass appointment does not guarantee a visa will be approved, with all ticket holders having to \"undergo thorough security screening and vetting\".\n\nMost citizens of countries under the US visa waiver programme, which covers much of Europe, including the UK, along with Japan, Australia and others, can ordinarily travel visa-free for up to 90 days, so do not need to use the Fifa Pass. Travellers from those countries would need to apply instead for an Esta - an Electronic System for Travel Authorization.\n\nA senior State Department official said the new Fifa Pass system will cut wait times - with applicants in \"over 80%\" of countries now able to schedule a visa appointment in \"less that 60 days\".\n\nIt added: \"At the visa appointment, the applicant must show they qualify for the visa and plan to follow our laws and leave at the end of the tournament. America's safety and the security of our borders will always come first.\"",

    "fullText": "Nathan Aspinall has opened up about his unusual experience at the Saudi Arabia Darts Masters, admitting the crowd “weren’t all there of their own accord” even as the event made headlines for its record-breaking $200,000 nine-dart prize.\n\nAspinall’s comments highlight the cultural differences faced by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) as it pushes into new global markets.\n\nThe Saudi Arabia Darts Masters, held at Riyadh’s Global Theater, marked the first PDC event in the kingdom, drawing world champion Luke Littler, Luke Humphries, and Michael van Gerwen to a country with strict no-alcohol laws and a developing darts fanbase.\n\nAspinall said the experience was “certainly different” and admitted that the atmosphere felt more restrained than the usual lively darts nights in the UK or Europe.\n\n“I’m not stupid. I feel like they [the crowd] weren’t all there of their own accord, shall we say, and it was quite a small venue,” he said. “Everything needs to start somewhere, but as long as people walk away from the week and are like, ‘You know what, we really enjoyed the darts’, and it gets good coverage.”\n\nThe Englishman said he enjoyed playing despite the muted energy and found humor in the crowd’s unfamiliarity with darts’ scoring quirks, laughing with opponent Lourence Ilagan as spectators clapped at the wrong moments during his opening win.\n\nThe PDC responded by saying all attendees were legitimate ticket-holders or guests and praised the event’s turnout, noting that the atmosphere and crowd make-up can differ from long-established European tournaments.\n\nBeyond the atmosphere, the event made global headlines for offering the biggest nine-darter prize in PDC history: a staggering $200,000 (£149,400). Any player who landed a perfect leg would take home $100,000 (£74,700), doubled to $200,000 if they finished on a bullseye.\n\nThe unprecedented prize pool reflects Saudi Arabia’s growing ambition to establish itself as a hub for elite sport, with similar investments seen in golf, Formula 1, and boxing.\n\nFor the PDC, the record bonus signals an opportunity to grow the sport in new regions, even as it navigates challenges around culture and fan engagement.\n\nAspinall’s candid comments may reflect those early growing pains, but his willingness to engage and the PDC’s record incentives show darts’ global expansion is gaining serious momentum.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool have a golden opportunity to sign the next Sadio Mane.\n\nThe Senegalese international was probably one of the best players to have ever played for the club. At this peak, Mane was the epitome of Jurgen Klopp's greatest era at the club.\n\nWhen he was running at defences, you just had confidence that Liverpool were going to be able to win games consistently.\n\nMane was a special player. Someone who was selfless and who worked hard for the team but who was also capable of individual brilliance.\n\nMost importantly, he was a top professional. This was apparent in the African Cup of Nations final on Sunday night with Mane staying on the pitch during Senegal's boycott after a dubious penalty was awarded against them.\n\nUltimately, Mane convinced his players to continue the game and played a key role in creating Senegal's winner to crown himself a champion for the second time in the tournament's history.\n\nIt's a remarkable time for Senegal right now. Mane is just the leading face of a golden generation and there is so much more to come.\n\nOne of the biggest factors behind Senegal's rise to prominence has been the Generation Foot academy. This is the academy that produced Mane and which has a partnership with FC Metz.\n\nAlongside Mane, they have also developed players like Ismaila Sarr, Pape Matar Sarr, Lamine Camara and many others.\n\nThey are the leading academy in Senegal and they always have exciting gems worth keeping an eye on who are ready to follow in Mane's footsteps.\n\nWe know Liverpool like to scout in Senegal. They've just signed Mor Talla Ndiaye from a Senegalese club and are expected to sign Sidy Barhama Ndiaye from another Senegalese side.\n\nBut they should now direct their attention to Generation Foot, where there is a really exciting young player who might just be the next Mane.\n\nLet us introduce you to Sega Fall Mbodji. He's only 16-years-old but he's already a regular member of Generation Foot's first-team, who play in Senegal's top tier.\n\nMbodji became the youngest ever goal-scorer in the club's history at 15-years-old earlier this season, and he's also the fourth youngest to make an appearance for the club.\n\nAn exciting winger with great technical skills, he can play on either wing and he is a brilliant dribbler.\n\nWhat stands-out about him is his decision making and his intelligent movement, Mbodji always receives the ball facing forward and ready to attack his opponent.\n\nHe makes clever runs behind the defensive lines and has the composure to finish chances.\n\nMaking history at such an impressive club and breaking records at his age is worth taking notice.\n\nRight now he's not made his mark at international level yet so this is a golden chance for Liverpool to strike and agree a deal for him to join the Reds, before the other big clubs start to sniff around for him.",

    "fullText": "Scores of private jets landed near Davos on Monday as the rich and powerful descended on the Alpine town for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near the Alpine town, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. These flight-tracking tools don't participate in privacy systems that many business-jet owners have signed up for to hide their movements from most similar tools.\n\nMore than half of the flights tracked landed at Zurich International Airport. Another 45 came into Friedrichshafen, a German city on the shore of Lake Constance, just over the Swiss border. The rest were spread across other smaller airports in Switzerland.\n\nThey included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, according to data from JetSpy.\n\nJetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThe most popular private jet was the Gulfstream G650, representing 31 of the flights tracked by Business Insider.\n\nBuying one typically costs over $65 million. It can accommodate up to 19 people or be configured with a double bed and a shower.\n\nThe world's newest private jet, the G800, also appeared three times on Monday. Gulfstream only delivered the first one in August.\n\nAt 7,600 miles, the longest trip was made by the Gulfstream G700 that JetSpy says belongs to Benioff. It flew for 14½ hours from Hawaii. Meanwhile, a commercial flight would have taken two stops and over 24 hours.\n\nOther major journeys included airplanes arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, and Uruguay.\n\nPrivate jets flew in from dozens of different countries, including Sierra Leone and Montenegro.\n\nLondon was the most popular departure point, with 19 flights coming from four airports in and around the British capital. However, many of these planes appear to have stopped only briefly on the way toward Davos. For example, a Google private jet spent 13 hours on the ground near London after arriving from San Jose.\n\n10 private jets departed from around New York, seven from the Bay Area metropolitan regions, and six from Dubai.\n\nDozens more are expected to arrive throughout the week.\n\nTuesday also saw the arrival of jets belonging to Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to data from JetSpy.",

    "description": "In his opening remarks at the World Economic Forum, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, warned that AI could heighten wealth inequality.",
    "fullText": "Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, kicked off the World Economic Forum on Tuesday with a critique of capitalism.\n\nMore wealth has been created since the fall of the Berlin Wall than at any other time in human history, but it has not translated into shared prosperity, said Fink, who was appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab.\n\n\"In advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain,\" he said.\n\nFink warned that the pattern of unequal wealth distribution could repeat in the era of AI.\n\n\"Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data, and owners of infrastructure,\" said Fink.\n\n\"The open question, what happens to everyone else? If AI does to white collar workers what globalisation did to blue collar workers, we need to confront that today, directly.\"\n\nHe urged those gathered at the annual meeting in Davos to rethink how prosperity is defined and to create a \"credible plan\" for broad participation in the gains AI can deliver.\n\n\"This is going to be the test. Capitalism can evolve to turn more people into owners of growth instead of spectators watching it happen,\" said Fink.\n\nThe world's wealthiest 10% own roughly 75% of global wealth, while the poorest half hold only about 2%, according to the World Inequality Report 2026, released in December 2025 and based on data compiled by 200 researchers.\n\nFink acknowledged in his speech that the World Economic Forum has lost trust and \"feels out of step with the moment.\"\n\n\"Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone,\" Fink said, adding that the forum should be more transparent and precise about what economic success means, especially with those who don't feel represented at gatherings like Davos.\n\n\"Prosperity just isn't the growth in the aggregate. It's not just GDP. It can't be measured by GDP or the market caps of companies. It has to be judged by many people who see it, who can touch it, can feel it, and can build their own future on it,\" said Fink.\n\nFink has previously spoken about how the pandemic fueled a rethink of the US economy.\n\nIn his 2022 annual letter to shareholders, Fink said the growth of stakeholder capitalism — the idea that companies should prioritize interests beyond shareholders — was a natural evolution of how capitalism can best work to build a strong economy.\n\n\"It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term,\" he said.\n\nBlackRock, which manages some $14 trillion in assets, has been one of the loudest voices in support of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing, with Fink often highlighting climate change and sustainability in his annual letters.",

Maybe it's that there are reportedly a lot more people here than there have been in a long time.\n\nWhatever the case, everyone seems to be on edge. Multiple attendees told me they were already feeling exhausted, as if we were halfway through the week, even though we're just getting started.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been a big talking point. Speculation continues to swirl about his Wednesday address.\n\nI heard the word \"trust\" used a lot yesterday in the context of the rising geopolitical tension and fears that we've reached a breaking point.\n\nFor the business world, that means a global economy that's a lot less … global. We've been headed in that direction for a while, but this week feels like an inflection point. Talk of the year ahead includes discussions about businesses needing to silo their global operations, even for digitally focused strategies.\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom. The conversations around AI have been fascinating, from the evolution of AI agents to concerns over cyber risks in the space to the potential that physical AI (think robots and autonomous systems) could be much larger than generative AI.\n\nFor more of our Davos coverage, please follow along on our live blog and",

The three-piece set, in its winter-white shade, featured a delicate floral print.\n\nShe wore the ensemble with ballet flats and chunky black glasses.\n\nIuliia Bazhan, a model and the founder of Evoautism, attended in a full Chanel getup.\n\nShe wore a jacket and miniskirt from the fashion house's Coco Neige collection, a floor-length coat, and white boots with thick chain detailing.\n\nOne attendee, photographed by Business Insider, accessorized his navy jacket with a multicolored scarf, sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses, and blue leather gloves.\n\nHe also wore a thick gold ring and a giant watch.\n\nOne woman was seen in Davos wearing a bright-pink suit with a white mock-neck top. On its own, the outfit was chic and feminine — especially when paired with her Louis Vuitton tote bag.\n\nHowever, she didn't accessorize with heels or jewelry. Instead, she wore tan snow boots and brown leather gloves.\n\nOf course, they're doing so fashionably. One person wore dark-wash jeans with white socks, red sneakers, and a puffy coat that combined both colors with others across its statement print.\n\nThey also wore a thick red scarf and a lilac beanie.\n\nSarah Backhouse, an executive director at executive networking company World Fifty Group, matched the fur collar of her Frankie Shop coat with a cozy fur hat.\n\nShe accessorized the ensemble with Saint Laurent sunglasses and a Maison Goyard bag.\n\nWealth manager Andrew Gan gave his suit a Davos upgrade with a fur-lined coat and sunglasses as he headed to the Philippines House to moderate.\n\nNidhi Sinja, the head of marketing and communications for BCG North America, opted to carry a notebook in her quilted weatherproof Tory Burch bag.\n\nShe coordinated the look with a North Face coat and L.L. Bean boots, both in cream hues that matched her white purse.\n\nWendy Diamond is the founder and CEO of Women's Entrepreneurship Day Organization. She's also an investor and board advisor for numerous companies.\n\nShe wore a green satin suit, a statement charm necklace, and thick black boots. She told Business Insider that green is her \"happy color,\" and that she likes to wear bright colors when \"the world is so dark.\"\n\nWhen the CEO of Philip Morris International US travels, even for long trips, she takes a carry-on. Her trick: Pick a color for the week and coordinate outfits around that, with travel-well fabrics. For Davos this week, the color is black.\n\nJonathan Nowak Delgado, a senior advisor at nonprofit ViaTalenta Foundation, per his business card, has a strategy to stand out at Davos: wear a mix of bold colors.\n\nHis outfit included a statement orange scarf, which his mother made for him.\n\nOne attendee photographed by Business Insider was seen wearing a tweed suit beneath a gray fuzzy coat and a thin, floral scarf.\n\nIn addition to the fabric layers, she wore black platform boots, white sunglasses, Chanel earrings, and a pink Prada handbag.\n\nJolie Hunt, the CEO of communications agency Hunt & Gather, has worn some of the event's most statement-making looks.\n\nOn Monday, she donned a printed minidress from Balmain with sheer tights, paired it with Larroudé x Libertine pumps adorned with lips, and carried an Hermès Birkin bag.",

    "fullText": "How do you separate the pretenders from the real deal when it comes to business AI adoption?\n\nFor Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, it comes down to building AI into processes from the ground up.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Dara Khosrowshahi said some companies are \"saying the right words\" and \"play-acting their way into a pretend transformation.\"\n\nFor example, having an AI agent complete tasks like summarizing a client pitch is the \"easy stuff\" that won't differentiate companies, he said.\n\n\"Truly changing how you work with AI, we've found it to be much harder than it sounds,\" he added.\n\nHe gave the example of using AI to improve customer service at Uber. The company had some success by having AI follow its old policies, but had a real \"breakthrough\" after its developers rebuilt everything from scratch.\n\nThat involved giving an AI agent clear underlying goals, Khosrowshahi said, such as making the customer feel good after the interaction.\n\n\"Allowing the AI actually to reason through that and throwing away all of the old policies is turning out to be the most promising way forward,\" he said.\n\nKhosrowshahi added that companies are essentially a \"bunch of policies,\" and that to get the full potential of AI, they would need to \"break down those rules and start over.\"\n\nInternally, Uber developers are using AI tools like Anysphere's Cursor and Anthropic's Claude, he added.\n\nMany companies have been ramping up their AI spending in the hope of unlocking productivity gains. A recent poll of IT professionals by RBC Capital found that 90% of respondents plan to spend more on AI this year.\n\nHowever, there are also fears that AI isn't always living up to the hype, and companies are grappling with concerns that it's eroding workers' skills.\n\nKhosrowshahi acknowledged that getting AI adoption right at a company isn't always plain sailing.\n\n\"You have to survive through a bunch of car crashes internally to do so,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Five years ago, I changed careers from a dental hygienist to a full-time travel writer. Since then, I've spent much of each year on the road, researching destinations and traveling internationally.\n\nWhat I enjoy most, though, is planning and hosting trips for women.\n\nEach year, I bring small groups together in destinations around the world, and certain places consistently stand out.\n\nIt's rarely the most trendy or Instagram-famous locations that resonate most. Rather, the trips women love are built around places that feel safe, comfortable, and easy to enjoy together.\n\nThese are the five destinations I recommend most often for girls' trips, and a few must-try highlights in each spot.\n\nYork is perfect for a girls' trip because it's so easily walkable and has plenty to offer, from modern boutique shops and pubs to historic cobbled streets full of stories from the past.\n\nThe English city is also easily accessible by a short train ride from London or Edinburgh.\n\nPro tip: Book a historical walking tour with Mad Alice; she's phenomenal.\n\nIncredible outdoor experiences, restaurants, wildlife experiences, and temples are all within reach in this central part of Bali.\n\nUbud is also a great place for relaxation, as it's known for its first-class wellness resorts that still feel accessible, especially compared to similar retreats elsewhere in the world.\n\nPro tip: Hire a private driver while you're there, as traffic can feel overwhelming to navigate. Keep in mind that some resort packages, including several at Goddess Resorts, include access to a driver.\n\nWith about 300 days of sunshine a year, first-class wineries, white-washed buildings, and a beautiful coastline, Santa Barbara is a great travel destination in California.\n\nIts downtown is walkable and full of shops, and the newly revitalized Funk Zone is home to more restaurants, bars, and wine tasting rooms than I can count.\n\nPro tip: Take the Santa Barbara Trolley tour for a great overview of the city's sights and history.\n\nScottsdale is easily accessible for a range of travelers as it's just a short drive from the Phoenix Airport. Surrounded by the Sonoran Desert, the city's natural beauty is also visible around every turn.\n\nPro tip: Eat brunch at Hash Kitchen if you want to enjoy Instagrammable surroundings and a build-your-own Bloody Mary bar.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to feel ike you are the main character in a storybook, head to the charming Alsace region in France.\n\nA short train ride from Paris will land you right in the heart of Alsace, and you can explore numerous villages and wineries with both German and French influence.\n\nEach village has its own charm, but my favorites are Eguisheim, Obernai, and Ribeauville.\n\nPro tip: Go during December to see the villages come alive with Christmas markets — it's magical!",

    "fullText": "Steven Bartlett said one use of AI has mattered more to his business than anything else: translating his podcast into other languages.\n\n\"There's nothing more important than what we've done for our business than translations. Period,\" Bartlett said during the \"What it Takes to Build\" panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nThe British entrepreneur and host of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast was in conversation with Jessica Lessin, the CEO of The Information, alongside Bret Taylor, formerly the co-CEO of Salesforce and CTO of Meta.\n\nBartlett said using AI tools to translate the podcasts was initially an \"expensive experiment.\" The problem he was trying to solve, he said, was reaching the untapped market of non-English speakers.\n\n\"If we're just in English, we're reaching like 10% of the world,\" Bartlett added.\n\nThere were technical challenges, too. Some languages use longer words, Bartlett said, meaning three-hour English-language conversations could become significantly longer when translated, risking the audio and video falling out of sync.\n\nTwo years ago, Bartlett announced on LinkedIn that \"The Diary of a CEO\" had hired a full-time data scientist who helped the company achieve a technological breakthrough, enabling them to use AI to translate the podcast into \"EVERY language.\"\n\nAt Davos and in the LinkedIn post, Bartlett did not elaborate on exactly how the AI translations work. Today, however, the videos show Bartlett speaking Spanish in a voice similar to his own, a shift he said had significantly expanded the podcast's reach.\n\n\"This month, 28% of my audience is Spanish,\" he said, adding that Spanish speakers now have access to interviews with some of the world's most high-profile podcast guests, citing his own interview with former first lady Michelle Obama as an example.\n\nOther guests on the podcast include former vice President Kamala Harris, Simon Cowell, and the psychologist Jordan Peterson.\n\nSpotify said in its \"2025 Wrapped\" press release in December 2025 that \"The Diary of a CEO with Steven Bartlett\" was the platform's second-most-listened-to podcast globally, behind \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" On YouTube, Bartlett's podcast channel has 14.5 million subscribers.",

    "description": "A sell-off in Japanese government bonds was part of a one-two punch hitting markets on Tuesday, alongside Trump's latest Greenland threats.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's latest threats to hike tariffs on major European economies are shaking up markets on Tuesday, but a surge in Japanese bonds yields is also weighing on investor sentiment.\n\nJapanese 40-year bond yields surged to 4.2% on Tuesday from 3.94% on Monday — the first time ever they've crossed the 4% mark. Yields started the year at 3.6%. Rates on 30- and 20-year bonds have also spiked.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Jeffrey Favuzza, an equities trader at Jefferies, called the Tuesday sell-off a two-standard-deviation move lower. When yields rise, bond prices fall.\n\nWhat's behind the volatility? A potential pause on food taxes.\n\nOn Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called a snap parliamentary election set to be held on February 8. Takaichi's goal is to gain more support for her agenda — which includes a proposed 2-year break from the 8% tax on food products — in the new parliament.\n\nThe news has been too much for investors to swallow. Japan's government debt levels have already been a concern for markets, and investors fear such a tax holiday would exacerbate an already shaky fiscal situation.\n\nAs of 10:30 am ET, the S&P 500 was down 1.16%, while the Nikkei 225 had fallen 1.11%. Meanwhile, gold, which investors have increasingly seen as a hedge to the threat of global fiat currency debasement, was up 3.3%. The Japanese bond turmoil was part of a one-two punch battering markets, along with Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive rhetoric on Greenland.\n\n\"These moves highlight the extent to which investors are souring on this snap election that is promising a food sales tax holiday, which will only make a bad fiscal situation worse,\" David Rosenberg, the founder of Rosenberg Research, said in a note on Tuesday. \"Since Takaichi took office in October, longer-term interest rates have jumped +80 basis points, with obvious spillover effects across the globe.\"\n\nRising Japanese bond yields have an impact on broader markets because of the country's outsize influence on global capital flows. Both domestic and foreign investors have used low yields to lever up positions in higher-yielding assets like US Treasurys and stocks.\n\nWith yields surging, Japanese investors could pivot away from US bond markets and simply buy domestic government debt. It also revives fears of an unwind of the \"carry trade.\" Concerns about the carry trade have been on display in recent years, as investors fear an unwind of levered positions amid rising Japanese yields.\n\nYields on 30-year US Treasurys rose to 4.9% on Tuesday from 4.84% on Monday. Generally, higher long-term government bond yields tend to hurt equity performance as investors can get attractive returns on risk-free assets.\n\nHow things develop in Japan in the days ahead should be top of mind for investors, said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\"On a quieter data week, we are looking at what global flash PMIs say about global activity. Otherwise, the focus is on Japan where the expected snap election may pave the way for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pursue looser fiscal policy and add more pressure to global long-term bond yields,\" Boivin and his team wrote.\n\nThere are plenty of other things happening this week for investors to keep an eye on, too.\n\nFor one, Trump is speaking in Davos on Wednesday, perhaps offering another update to his approach to acquiring Greenland from Denmark. Trump may also join G7 leaders for dinner in Paris on Thursday, per an invite from French President Emmanuel Macron. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data is also out on Friday, which could provide a window into whether renewed tariff uncertainty is weighing on Americans' economic outlook.",

I'm not sure that's true of all human immigrants, but it will definitely be true of the AI immigrants,\" he said.\n\nHarari asked the audience whether they want to allow AIs to be recognized as \"legal persons\" with rights in their countries, giving them the ability to start businesses, form and preach their own religions, or befriend their children on social media.\n\n\"If you want to influence where humanity is going, you need to make a decision now,\" he said.\n\nHarari is a distinguished research fellow at the University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Alongside \"Sapiens,\" his book tracing human history across the centuries, he also released \"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow\" in 2015, where he discussed the existential threat AI poses to humanity.\n\nHarari is not the first person to refer to \"AI immigrants.\" Earlier this month, the Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang, referred to robots using the term, and said \"AI immigrants\" will help humans with work we no longer want to do, such as manufacturing jobs, AFP reported.",

    "fullText": "Trial involving 4,000 children will explore impact on mental health, sleep and time spent with friends and family\n\nA pioneering investigation into the impact of restricting social media access for children in the UK has been announced as politicians around the world consider action on the issue.\n\nIn December, Australia became the first country to ban under-16s from social media, with governments in other countries, including the, coming under pressure to do the same.\n\nHowever, while experts say there is evidence that aspects of social media are harmful to most children, there has been no large-scale experimental study exploring the effect of limiting time spent on social media in healthy children as a population.\n\n“This study is a world first to try to look at that question,” said Prof Amy Orben, of the University of Cambridge, who is co-lead of the study.\n\nOrben and colleagues plan to study about 4,000 children across 30 secondary schools in Bradford, West Yorkshire, focusing on students in years 8, 9 and 10.\n\nAll participants would be asked to complete an initial questionnaire on areas including their mental health, sleep and friendships, and to download the research app on their main device.\n\nEach year group in each school would be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the app would simply record the pupils’ social media use, or it would curtail their social media use by limiting access to the apps for TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube and Snapchat to one hour a day, as well as imposing a curfew from 9pm to 7am.\n\nCrucially, the team said, all pupils within a particular year group in a school would experience the same intervention.\n\n“We know that if we take away social media for one adolescent, that might have a very different impact than if we take it away for their whole friendship group for a certain period of time,” Orben said.\n\nAccess to messaging apps including WhatsApp would not be restricted, the team said, as they were important for family communication.\n\nAfter six weeks students would complete another questionnaire. After an initial pilot period beginning in April, the team planned to start the study itself in October, with the first results expected in summer 2027.\n\nMembers of the House of Lords are preparing to vote on an amendment brought by John Nash to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill which would introduce an outright ban on children using social media.\n\nThe amendment has the support of some Labour peers, and if it passes in the Lords it will then be debated in the Commons, where 61 Labour MPs recently wrote a letter to the prime minister urging him to bring in a ban.\n\nLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, reassured MPs on Tuesday that the government’s consultation on the issue would only take a few months and that it would have a firm position by the summer.\n\nHowever, Nash insisted he would press ahead with his attempt to legislate immediately for a ban, saying on Tuesday: “The time for delay and procrastination is over. Without swift action to raise the age limit for social media to 16, we are at risk of a societal catastrophe.\n\n“That is why I am urging all fellow peers to vote for my amendment, which has the backing of peers from every major party, to end the disastrous harm being done to our young people by social media and to give them their childhood back.”\n\nWhile the researchers have noted that the study, called the IRL trial, has limitations – for example students may use devices that belong to other people or may choose not to participate – they said they hoped the results would shed light on the effect of restricting teens’ social media use.\n\n“The participants’ levels of anxiety is our key outcome, and we’re also interested in depression,” said Dr Dan Lewer, who leads the Bradford Centre for Health Data Science and is co-lead of the study. The researchers would also explore the impact by looking at which apps were used and when, as well as participants’ sleep patterns, experiences of bullying, time spent with friends and family, and how they compared themselves to other young people, he said.\n\nThe trial was independent from the UK government’s announcement of a consultation on whether to ban under-16s from social media, Orben said, adding that the results may be valuable for other countries debating the issue.\n\n“The decision that policymakers need to make is up to them,” she said. “We’re really just delivering the best quality evidence we can in the timeframes that are available.”",

    "fullText": "Fulham are battling Wolfsburg and Real Betis in the race to sign Troy Parrott following his huge impact in the Republic of Ireland’s quest to qualify for the World Cup 2026.\n\nSo far, the trio are the clubs that have gone in strongest in what is expected to be a wide race for the AZ Alkmaar forward over the next few months.\n\nThe 23-year-old's profile exploded after the five goals against Portugal and Hungary that sent Heimir Hallgrimsson’s side into a World Cup play-off.\n\nBut that was only on the back of burgeoning development that had made a series of clubs around the Premier League and European football take note of his impact in the Netherlands.\n\nWolfsburg have talked about a €20m (£17.4m) deal, but it is understood that AZ would want even more. Fulham have so far shown the strongest interest from the Premier League.\n\nHaving energised his career at AZ, though, Parrott is understood to want to be very considerate about his next steps. While the forward does want to return to the Premier League at some point - he initially came through the Tottenham Hotspur system - any English move would have to fully make sense for both his current position and future prospects, which is why he is happy to stay in Europe.\n\nThe Bundesliga is an appealing option, particularly with the way the competition has proven so successful in developing young talent.\n\nAway from his prolific run for his country, Parrott has hit nine goals in 13 Eredivisie games, with 10 more goals this term in Conference League qualifiers and the KNVB Cup.\n\nParrott is tied fourth in the Eredivisie top scorer standings, with Ayase Ueda clear with 18 goals in as many games for Feyenoord.",

    "description": "A real-world comparison of GPT-5.2-Codex (high), Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro on two coding tasks, focusing on quality, speed, and cost.",
    "fullText": "If you want a quick take: Claude Opus 4.5 was the most consistent, GPT-5.2-codex (high) delivered strong code with slower turnaround, and Gemini 3 Pro was the most efficient but less polished.\n\nIf you want a quick take, here’s how the three models performed in our tests:\n\n💡 If you want the safest pick for real “ship a feature in a big repo” work, Opus 4.5 felt the most reliable in my runs. If you care about speed and cost and you’re okay polishing UI yourself, Gemini 3 Pro is a solid bet.\n\nOkay, so right now the WebDev leaderboard on LMArena is basically owned by the big three: Claude Opus 4.5 from Anthropic, GPT-5.2-codex (high) from OpenAI, and finally everybody's favorite, Gemini 3 Pro from Google.\n\nSo, I grabbed these three and put them into the same existing project (over 8K stars and 50K+ LOC) and asked them to build a couple of real features like a normal dev would.\n\nSame repo. Same prompts. Same constraints.\n\nFor each task, I took the best result out of three runs per model to keep things fair.\n\nThen I compared what they actually did: code quality, how much hand-holding they needed, and whether the feature even worked in the end.\n\n⚠️ NOTE: Don't take the result of this test as a hard rule. This is just a small set of real-world coding tasks that shows how each model did for me in that exact setup and gives you an overview of the difference in the top 3 models' performance in the same tasks.\n\nFor the test, we will use the following CLI coding agents:\n\nHere’s the repo used for the entire test: iib0011/omni-tools\n\nWe will check the models on two different tasks:\n\nEach model is asked to create a global action menu that opens with a keyboard shortcut. This feature expands on the current search by adding actions, global state, and keyboard navigation. This task checks how well the model understands current UX patterns and avoids repetition without breaking what's already in place.\n\nEach model had to add real usage tracking across the app, persist it locally, and then build an analytics dashboard that shows things like the most used tools, recent activity, and basic filters.\n\nWe’ll compare code quality, token usage, cost, and time to complete the build.\n\n💡 NOTE: I will share the source code changes for each task by each model in a .patch file. This way, you can easily view them on your local system by cloning the repository and applying the patch file using git apply <path_file_name>. This method makes sharing changes easier.\n\nThe task is simple: all models start from the same base commit and then follow the same prompt to build what is asked in the prompt.\n\nAnd obviously, as mentioned, I will evaluate the response from the model from the \"Best of 3.\"\n\nLet's start off the test with something interesting:\n\nGPT-5.2 handled this surprisingly well. The implementation was solid end to end, and it basically one-shotted the entire feature set, including i18n support, without needing multiple correction passes.\n\nThat said, it did take a bit longer than some other models (~20 minutes), which is expected since reasoning was explicitly set to high. The model spends more time thinking through architecture, naming, and edge cases rather than rushing to output code. The trade-off felt worth it here.\n\nThe token usage was noticeably higher due to the reasoning set to high, but the output code reflected that.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\n💡 NOTE: I ran the exact same prompt with the same model using the default (medium) reasoning level. The difference was honestly massive. With reasoning set to high, the quality of the code, structure, and pretty much everything jumps by miles. It’s not even a fair comparison.\n\nClaude went all in and prepared a ton of different strategies. At the start, it did run into build issues, but it kept running the build until it was able to fix all the build and lint issues.\n\nThe entire run took me about 7 minutes 50 seconds, which is the fastest among the models for this test. The features all worked as asked, and obviously, the UI looked super nice and exactly how I expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nTo be honest, this exceeded my expectations; even the i18n texts are added and displayed in the UI just as expected. Absolute cinema!\n\nGemini 3 got it working, but it's clearly not on the same level as GPT-5.2 High or Claude Opus 4.5. The UI it built is fine and totally usable, but it feels a bit barebones, and you don't get many choices in the palette compared to the other two.\n\nOne clear miss is that language switching does not show up inside the action palette at all, which makes the i18n support feel incomplete even though translations technically exist.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 lands in a very clear third place here. It works, the UI looks fine, and nothing is completely broken, but compared to the depth, completeness, and polish of GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5, it feels behind.\n\nThis test is a step up from the action palette.\n\nYou can find the prompt I've used here: Prompt\n\nGPT-5.2 absolutely nailed this one.\n\nThe final result turned out amazing. Tool usage tracking works exactly as expected, data persists correctly, and the dashboard feels like a real product feature. Most used tools, recent usage, filters, everything just works.\n\nOne really nice touch is that it also wired analytics-related actions into the Action Palette from Test 1.\n\nIt did take a bit longer than the first test, around 26 minutes, but again, that’s the trade-off with high reasoning. You can tell the model spent time thinking through data modeling, reuse, and avoiding duplicated logic. Totally worth it here.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\nGPT-5.2 High continues to be slow but extremely powerful, and for a task like this, that’s a very good trade.\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 did great here as well.\n\nThe final implementation works end to end, and honestly, from a pure UI and feature standpoint, it’s hard to tell the difference between this and GPT-5.2 High. The dashboard looks clean, the data makes sense, and the filters work as expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nGemini 3 Pro gets the job done, but it clearly takes a more minimal approach compared to GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\nThat said, the overall experience feels very bare minimum. The UI is functional but plain, and the dashboard lacks the polish and depth you get from the other two models.\n\nAlso, it didn't quite add the button to view the analytics right in the action palette, similar to the other two models.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 Pro remains efficient and reliable, but in a comparison like this, efficiency alone is not enough. 🤷‍♂️\n\nAt least from this test, I can conclude that the models are now pretty much able to one-shot a decent complex work, at least from what I tested.\n\nStill, there have been times when the models mess up so badly that if I were to go ahead and fix the problems one by one, it would take me nearly the same time as building it from scratch.\n\nIf I compare the results across models, Opus 4.5 definitely takes the crown. But I still don’t think we’re anywhere close to relying on it for real, big production projects. The recent improvements are honestly insane, but the results still don’t fully back them up. 🥴\n\nFor now, I think these models are great for refactoring, planning, and helping you move faster. But if you solely rely on their generated code, the codebase just won’t hold up long term.\n\nI don't see any of these recent models as “use it and ship it” for \"production,\" in a project with millions of lines of code, at least not in the way people hype it up.\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments.\n\nSoftware and DevOps engineer with 4+ years of experience building for the web and cloud, mainly with TypeScript, Python, Go, Docker, and Kubernetes.

EnergyNet utilizes 1) an Energy Router that enforces galvanic separation and utilizes software-controlled energy flows over a DC backplane, 2) Energy Local and Wide Area Networks (ELAN/EWAN) based on DC microgrids that interconnect through an open Energy Protocol (EP), and 3) a control plane comprised of the Energy Router Operating System (EROS) and EP Server which is managed at operator scale through an Energy Network Management System (ENMS). We distinguish the architectural contribution (Tier-1 including components, interfaces, and operating model) from expected outcomes contingent on adoption (Tier-2). The latter includes local-first autonomy with global interoperability, near-real-time operation with local buffering, removal of EV-charging bottlenecks, freed grid capacity for data centers and industrial electrification, as well as a trend toward low, predictable, fixed-cost clean energy. Evidence from early municipal demonstrators illustrates feasibility and migration paths.",

    "fullText": "It is less than seven weeks until Northern Ireland Women begin their 2027 World Cup qualifying campaign and they still do not have a manager.\n\nIn fact, the Irish Football Association is welcoming applications for the role until Friday, 23 January - just 37 days before their opening fixture, away to Switzerland on Tuesday, 3 March.\n\nTanya Oxtoby stepped away from the role on 20 November to take over as Newcastle United Women's manager after two years in charge.\n\nEight days later, the IFA issued a statement that they had \"started preparations\" to recruit her successor, but they have not moved much further beyond that almost three months on.\n\nIt is extremely worrying for NI given the condensed nature of the World Cup qualifying campaign, with all six games concluded by May.\n\nWhile England, Scotland, Republic of Ireland and Wales all have their respective houses in order, NI look ill-prepared for their quest to reach a second major tournament and their first World Cup, the longer the protracted search goes on.",

    "description": "Patrick Reed stands by the sentiment that he wants to be a worldwide player. It's why he would consider a return to the PGA Tour if given the chance.",
    "fullText": "Patrick Reed stands by the sentiment that he wants to be a worldwide player. It's something he has not only said but followed up on throughout his career.\n\nThe 2018 Masters champion opened his 2026 campaign last week at the Dubai Invitational on the DP World Tour and will compete in this week's Dubai Desert Classic. Next month, he'll kick off his fifth season competing for LIV Golf, where he has one win in 45 career starts. Late last year, he also made starts on the Asian Tour.\n\nOver the weekend, Reed was asked about a possible return to the PGA Tour. He's not eligible for the Returning Member Program, which only four players fit the criteria for, but that doesn't mean he hasn't thought about going back.\n\n\"I mean, of course; if it were up to me, I'd play everywhere,\" Reed told Golf Digest's Evin Priest. Then he continued: \"I'm already playing on three tours, why not add one more? I always enjoyed my time out there on the PGA Tour.\n\n\"Let's be honest, out there, it's the best tour in the world. Look at what they've done in golf … I could see myself playing there at some point again. But right now, you just never know; everything's so fluid.”\n\nReed joking about competing on four tours is somewhat ironic, considering the Texan's reason for leaving the PGA Tour in the first place was centered around wanting to spend more time at home with his family. “It wears on you as an athlete, wears on you as a person, as a father, and this is for me, I feel like this is the best decision ever,\" Reed said in 2022. \"Now I can compete at the highest level, but also prepare and get ready for every single event and be able to be home, and even though I'll be grinding at home getting ready, I'll be able to spend time with the kids.\"\n\nBut his praise for the PGA Tour is not too surprising. He has maintained, even since leaving, he wants to play all around the world, including back on the PGA Tour eventually.\n\n\"Right now, it's not even a decision,” Reed said. \"That was for ’22 and on winners. So, I definitely would have to think about it … if that number (came) down to 2018. Right now, it's hard to say really what we're going to do or anything like that.\"\n\nLast year, Reed tied for third at the Masters. He's a nine-time winner on the PGA Tour and has lifetime membership on the DP World Tour, which he received in 2019.\n\n\"Right now, the biggest thing is trying to play some good golf these (two) weeks, not only to solidify myself out here on DP, but to have a good momentum going into the year.”\n\nFor every LIV Golf event he competes in that is the same week as a DP World Tour event, Reed must pay fines for competing in a conflicting event. The amount of each fine is unknown, but Reed said having to pay those won't stop him.\n\n“Me traveling and playing around the world ... it helps this tour, but also it's something I've always held true to my heart and wanted to do,\" Reed saod. \"So, if that's what it takes, that's what it takes.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Patrick Reed calls PGA Tour 'the best tour in the world' in Dubai",

    "description": "During NBC's quadruple-header of Martin Luther King Day games, the All-Star Game starters also will be announced.",
    "fullText": "Fans from around the globe cast their ballots, picking who should start in the NBA All-Star Game next month in Los Angeles. Those fan votes (50% of the total) — combined with votes from NBA players (25%) and select media (25%) — have chosen the 10 All-Star Game starters. There are five starters from the Eastern Conference and five from the West (even though those players will later be divided into two USA and one World team for the new format, more on that below).\n\nThose All-Star Game starters will be unveiled today on NBC, read by the NBA Showtime crew live on set at 2 p.m. Eastern. This will be right before the tip-off of the Oklahoma City at Cleveland game, part of a quadruple header of Martin Luther King Day games on NBC and Peacock.\n\nRefresh this page, where we will have all the details on who the starters will be, as well as analysis of those selections.\n\nNow that the fans have had their say, it falls to the coaches around the league.\n\nNBA coaches will vote to choose the seven reserve (or bench) players from each conference. The results of the vote and the names of the remaining NBA All-Stars will be announced next week on NBC.\n\nThose starters and reserves will then be divided up into three teams as part of a new USA vs. World All-Star Game format. Two international players, Luka Doncic in the West and Giannis Antetokounmpo in the East, were the top vote-getters among fans.\n\nWhile the idea of a USA vs. international players All-Star Game format has been talked about for years, 2026 felt like the right time.\n\nThat's because the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. That was a perfect setup for the first-of-its-kind All-Star Game format.\n\nThe 24 All-Star players will be divided into three teams — two USA teams and one world team — that will compete in a round-robin tournament of four 12-minute games. Each of the three teams will have a minimum of eight players (if the USA or World teams are short on players, the league office will select one or more players to reach the required number).\n\nAt the end of the round-robin, the two top teams will play a championship game (the fourth 12-minute game of the day) for the title.\n\nAll-Star weekend tips off on Feb. 13 with the Rising Stars at the Intuit Dome at 6 p.m. PT, featuring the league's top first- and second-year players. Also on the 13th is the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, featuring stars from media, sports and entertainment at the Kia Forum. The Forum also hosts the fifth annual NBA HBCU Classic at 8 p.m. that night.\n\nOn Saturday, Feb. 14, All-Star Saturday night — featuring the Skills Challenge, 3-point Contest and the Dunk Contest — will take place at the Intuit Dome.\n\nThe 75th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, at 5 p.m. Eastern, earlier than in previous years, leading into more coverage of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nPeacock NBA Monday will stream up to three Monday night games each week throughout the regular season. Coast 2 Coast Tuesday presents doubleheaders on Tuesday nights throughout the regular season on NBC and Peacock. On most Tuesdays, an 8 p.m. ET game will be on NBC stations in the Eastern and Central time zones, and an 8 p.m. PT game on NBC stations in the Pacific and often Mountain time zones. Check local listings each week. Both games will stream live nationwide on Peacock. NBC Sports will launch Sunday Night Basketball across NBC and Peacock on Feb. 1, 2026.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA is trying its hand at a brand new All-Star Game format in 2026, but the honor of being named a starter remains unchanged. As in years' past, five players from each conference receive the starter label, even though 15 players will actually start as part of the league's three-team format.\n\nIf the early voting returns were any indication, fans expect the World team to have an advantage over the two USA teams on All-Star Weekend. Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokic were the top three vote-getters in the NBA's final update on Jan. 7, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Victor Wembanyama also not far behind.\n\nFor the Americans, Jalen Brunson put together a strong showing in early voting returns, while Stephen Curry was near the top of the balloting in the West even as he approaches his 38th birthday.\n\nWhich 10 players are 2026 NBA All-Star Game starters? The Sporting News is tracking the full results below.\n\nMORE: Highest-scoring NBA All-Star Games in history\n\nThis section will be updated when the results are revealed.\n\nFans voted on starters for the 2026 NBA All-Star Game from Dec. 17 to Jan. 14, with votes counting for three times the value of a normal vote on five particular days. The All-Star ballot included two guards and three frontcourt players from each conference.\n\nThe selection process remained the same as previous years, with fan vote accounting for 50 percent, media vote accounting for 25 percent and player votes accounting for the final 25 percent toward determining the five starters in each conference.\n\nThe NBA All-Star Game once again has a new format, and it means the honor of being named one of the 10 starters is mostly ceremonial.\n\nThe NBA is breaking in a new USA vs. World format comprised of three teams: two eight-man rosters of American players and one eight-man roster of international players. The teams will play a round-robin format to determine who will advance to the championship game. All games will be played on Sunday, Feb. 15.\n\nIf all three teams are tied after the round-robin format, point differential will be used to determine which teams go to the championship game. Each game will be 12 minutes, adding up to the equivalent of a 48-minute game of basketball.\n\nLocation: Intuit Dome, Inglewood, CA\n\nThe 2026 NBA All-Star will tip off at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 15 from the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. The game has an earlier start time this year to fit around NBC's Winter Olympics coverage.\n\nNBA All-Star Celebrity Game, 7 p.m. ET\n\nNBA Rising Stars Game, 9 p.m. ET\n\nNBA HBCU Classic (Hampton vs. NC A&T), 11 p.m. ET\n\nNBA All-Star Saturday Night, 5 p.m. ET",

    "fullText": "The billionaires and business execs are hitting the slopes.\n\nA sleepy ski town tucked in the Swiss Alps is being taken over by the world's elite (and a bunch of journalists) for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n(If you want to see how you get to this town, here's how I did it. And no, it wasn't by private jet.)\n\nYour immediate reaction to Davos might be a massive eye roll. Davos has gotten a reputation in recent years as a gathering of the elite who are out of touch with everyday people.\n\nThis year, though, some of the biggest topics at Davos will impact everyone. You can follow everything that's going on in our live blog and with our special Davos newsletter.\n\nTrump: In all honesty, the conversation around Davos largely starts (and arguably ends) with the president's appearance on Wednesday. He famously skipped attending the event in person last year (he had just been inaugurated). Instead, he offered a blistering virtual address that largely attacked the rest of the world.\n\nThis time, he's coming with a big contingent, and it's the talk of the town. He's already said a focus of his speech will largely be affordability, interestingly choosing a US-specific issue on the global stage. (It is America First, after all.)\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is also coming to town. He plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure. It's another example of the ever-evolving future of capitalism, a topic we've been closely covering this year.\n\nTariffs: Tariffs have been a staple of Trump's second term, and they don't appear to be going anywhere. Their impact is also felt worldwide, making them a perfect fit for the global Davos crowd.\n\nTheir latest iteration is a threat Trump is wielding against countries that oppose his plan to take over Greenland. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said controlling Greenland is actually about Trump trying to avoid conflict.\n\nAI: You didn't think you'd get through this without an AI mention, did you? Last year, the word of the conference was \"agentic AI.\" This year it feels like three letters will be top of mind: ROI. The bets have been placed, and they are big, but what is AI doing for companies?\n\nAlso expect some chatter about how the tech is affecting workforce headcounts.",

    "description": "Luisa Zhou followed the traditional path her immigrant parents wanted, then built a million-dollar business that gave her time and flexibility.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Luisa Zhou. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy parents raised me to get good grades, go to a good college, and get a good job. They were entirely focused on security because they didn't want my sister and me to experience the hardships that they had as immigrants. They encouraged me not to take risks — just keep my head down, work hard, and appreciate what I had.\n\nThe day I got into Princeton, I thought, \"Thank goodness. I'm going to be OK.\" I graduated with an engineering degree and started working in analytics at a financial services company.\n\nIt was what I'd been raised to do, but from the beginning, it wasn't a good fit. I hated that my boss wouldn't let me leave before 5, even if I'd finished all my work. Still, I thought that if I climbed the corporate ladder, the work might become more challenging and fulfilling.\n\nIn my early 20s, I met a man who was launching a startup. He brought me on as cofounder because of my engineering background. Raising money for the startup opened my eyes to a whole new world of career options. That venture failed, but it gave me a different skill set and worldview.\n\nAfter that, I started working at a digital ad startup. I had a six-figure salary and a cool job, but I still wanted more.\n\nThen, my family had a difficult year: my dad had heart surgery, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and my little sister experienced an eye injury that required her to sit in the dark for weeks on end. My sister was staying with me, and as I shut the door on the way to work one day, she quietly said \"Bye.\" It broke my heart that I had to leave her.\n\nThat's the moment I vowed to do something that would let me spend more time with the people I loved.\n\nI'm fairly risk-averse, so I didn't do anything sudden. Instead, I spent the next two years building my side business, offering coaching, ad consulting, and other services. I was working on my lunch break and at night, so I had even less time for family than before.\n\nThat's where my background really helped me. My parents and grandparents raised me on a Chinese proverb: \"First bitter, then sweet.\" I knew I was working hard then, so I could enjoy the fruits later.\n\nThose early years were challenging because I'm not naturally confident. It seemed like no one believed in me. I was seen as nice, but not necessarily smart or business-minded. That gave me a chip on my shoulder, and I was determined to prove myself. The year I was 26, the business did more than $1 million in revenue. Last year, I did more than $1.5 million in revenue, while working fewer hours.\n\nAt first, I didn't understand that $1 million doesn't mean you're a millionaire, especially when you factor in costs and taxes. I still needed to learn about managing money and work on my own mindset about spending. As I did that, my wealth really accumulated: by the time I was 30, I had $1 million in investable assets.\n\nToday, I'm 36. Although I'm a millionaire, my parents still nervously ask me if work is going OK every time we speak. They don't understand this alternative path, and that's OK. We just don't talk about it much.\n\nHaving financial security was worth the non-stop work in those earlier years. These days, I typically work about four hours a day. I limit my screen time and only book phone calls two weeks out of the month. I spend about two hours each day walking my German Shepherd, and I have the flexibility to spend time with my husband — he's a doctor, so his schedule is much more demanding. I can easily travel to visit my parents.\n\nIt took a lot to get here, but I'm so glad that I've been able to step away from the time-money trade-off.",

    "description": "PwC's global CEO survey found that more than half of CEOs say they aren't seeing increased revenue or cost benefits from their investments in AI.",
    "fullText": "Everyone wants to know when AI investments will pay off.\n\nMost CEOs say they're still waiting, according to PwC's latest Global CEO survey, released on Monday to coincide with the start of Davos.\n\nThe consulting giant questioned 4,454 chief executives across 95 countries and territories about their strategic priorities and outlook in the year up to November 2025.\n\nMore than half of the CEOs surveyed, 56%, said AI hasn't produced revenue or cost benefits for their businesses to date.\n\nSome reported benefits for either revenue or costs: around a third said their revenue was up in the last year, and 26% said they were seeing lower costs from AI.\n\nBut only 12% said they had both decreased costs and increased revenue using AI in the last 12 months.\n\nRecent Morgan Stanley data on S&P 500 companies showed that certain sectors are seeing higher, measurable AI-driven returns than others. Technology, communication services, and financials topped the list, while energy companies were rising fast up the list.\n\n\"A small group of companies are already turning AI into measurable financial returns, while many others are still struggling to move beyond pilots,\" said Mohamed Kande, PwC's global chairman, in a press release.\n\n\"That gap is starting to show up in confidence and competitiveness—and it will widen quickly for those that don't act.\"\n\nEnsuring maximum returns from AI requires a balance of business strategy, strong underlying data architecture, and the right talent strategy. No matter how excited CEOs are about AI, they also have to get employees on board to see returns.\n\nA recent EY survey on how AI is being used at work found that companies are missing out on 40% of the AI productivity gains they could achieve with the right strategy.\n\nPwC found that the 12% of CEOs reporting both cost and revenue gains were two to three times more likely to have also built a strong AI foundation, meaning they have embedded AI extensively across products and services, demand generation, and strategic decision-making.\n\nAs they grapple with AI uncertainty and geopolitical volatility, CEOs told PwC they are less confident about their short-term growth outlook than they were last year.\n\nOnly 30% of those surveyed said they are very or extremely confident about revenue growth over the next 12 months, down from 38% in last year's report and a peak of 56% in 2022.\n\nThe strongest approach to dealing with future uncertainty was embracing reinvention, including through dealmaking and venturing into new sectors, PwC found.\n\nThe consulting giant found there was a \"strong association among a higher percentage of revenue coming from new sectors, bigger profit margins, and greater CEO confidence in company growth prospects.\"\n\n\"The companies that succeed will be those willing to make bold decisions and invest with conviction in the capabilities that matter most,\" said Kande.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Embark Studios’ multiplayer extraction shooter game has already sold 12m copies in just three months. Will it capture you too?\n\nReleased last October Arc Raiders has swiftly become one of the most successful online shooters in the world, shifting 12m copies in barely three months and attracting as many players as established mega hits such as Counter-Strike 2 and Apex Legends. So what is it about this sci-fi blaster that’s captured so many people – and how can you get involved?\n\nCreated by Swedish developer Embark Studios, Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter: an online multiplayer game that drops you into a world with other people to search for valuable weapons and items before attempting to escape with all your spoils. You can play alone or with up to two friends in a squad. Most extraction shooters feature two types of gameplay: Player vs Environment (PvE), which means exploring the world and fighting computer controlled enemies, and Player vs Player (PvP), which means fighting any other players you come across on your travels and then stealing their stuff. In Arc Raiders, you don’t have to fight everyone you meet: in fact human raiders rarely attack each other, choosing to band together instead. The game gives you a few stock phrases to shout such as “don’t shoot!”, or you can plug in a mic, chat to strangers you meet and form alliances.\n\nArc Raiders is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth in the distant future. The planet has suffered an ecological disaster that has wiped out most of the population and most technology. Now, a robotic alien invasion force named Arc has arrived to plunder all the remaining natural resources and kill off humanity, forcing everyone to flee underground, where a vast subterranean city named Toledo has been built. Now Earth is patrolled by a menagerie of deadly android guards.\n\nYou play as a raider making daring trips topside to scavenge ruined towns and facilities. As you go on more raids, your character earns experience points, which can be spent on improving their survival, looting and movement abilities, and finds blueprints that enable them to make more stuff. You can also carry out missions for traders, who will reward you with useful items. Traders also sell you things that you haven’t yet learned to craft yourself.\n\nThere are a lot of extraction shooters out there, from dystopian survival thriller Escape from Tarkov to the southern gothic horror of Hunt: Showdown 1896. What Arc Raiders brings is an excellent sense of style, with interesting environments, excellent music and audio, compelling lore and engrossing set-piece battles with the giant robots. Some enemies, such as the vast mecha-spider-like Matriarch, are absolutely huge and require lots of players to join forces in ad-hoc battles. These thrilling encounters have been widely shared on Twitch, TikTok and Instagram – as have comic moments where players fall off buildings, or accidentally kill themselves with guided missiles. The enemies, from the drone-like Wasps and Hornets to the lumbering land-based Bombardiers, are powered by machine-learning and AI that make them fun and unpredictable foes.\n\nJust jump in! Arc Raiders is available on PC, Xbox and PS5 and I’d recommend getting a gaming headset so you can chat to other players, if you haven’t got one. Also, listening to the world through headphones gives you a better understanding of where threats are coming from. Once you customise your character, you can start going on raids. In the beginning you can only access one map, the Dam Battlegrounds, but others such as the wrecked urban landscape of Buried City and the deadly industrial complex Stella Montis open up later. I’d advise sticking to the Dam until you have many hours of experience, as the other places are swarming with enemies and other players tend to be more aggressive. For your first few raids, just explore the map, get to grips with the different enemies and pop into buildings to search cabinets, lockers and desks for items.\n\nCollect absolutely everything at first – useful resources such as wires and springs will let you craft items later, while rare goods such as toasters and radios can be sold or recycled for scrap. You’ll begin with a very basic weapon and accessories but as you go you’ll find new guns, grenades and medicines, which you can store in your room or sell. With the money you earn, you can buy items from traders. It’s important to become self-sufficient as soon as possible, so concentrate on upgrading your workstations (where you craft new items). Whenever you find a blueprint, which teaches you a new item to craft, put it in your inventory’s safe pocket – this lets you keep it even if you’re killed during a raid. Blueprints are more likely to be found in high value areas (marked on your map in red) or during daily special events such as night raids and electromagnetic storms – but these are more risky and competitive.\n\nThese player guides by Games Radar, IGN and Rock Paper Shotgun are extremely useful.\n\nThe game’s skill tree has three branches – Conditioning, Mobility and Survival. You won’t be able to unlock everything, so think about how you’re going to play. I’d prioritise Mobility skills that focus on stamina at first as you’re going to be doing a LOT of running away. After this, it depends on you: if you’re going to fight other players, prioritise Conditioning skills: if you just want to loot and get outta there, prioritise the more stealth-focused Survival options.\n\nAs soon as you can, arm yourself with two guns: one that’s effective against Arc enemies (the Ferro is great for this); and one that is useful against other players, such as the Kettle or Stitcher, which are effective against even the best guns in the game. You should also carry bandages, shield rechargers and adrenaline shots. Consider taking smoke grenades everywhere as they’ll help you escape both Arc robots and aggressive players. Even when you have the best weapons and armour, you can still be overpowered by basic flying enemies such as Wasps and Hornets, so buy a bunch of seeker grenades – they’re cheap and highly effective against these tenacious foes.\n\nAs soon as you have the money, increase the size of your stash – ie the number of items you’re allowed to store. Keep doing this until you max it out to 280 slots. You’re gonna need them.\n\nIf you need to make money fast, go to Dam and visit the Pale Apartments, Ruby Residence and Pattern House – they are filled with high-value trinkets such as statues, snow globes and pottery jugs, and are relatively safe to explore.\n\nAt the beginning of each run, after you choose which map area you want to visit, the game offers you the chance to start with a basic gun and some health items. It lets you get to grips with the area and do a bit of looting without the risk of losing valuable equipment. This is a brilliant option for when you’re exploring a new map for the first time, or if you just need to recoup your supplies after being killed on a previous run.\n\nThe game takes aggressive behaviour into account when matching you with other players. If you shoot people, you’re more likely to be put on servers where people shoot back. If that doesn’t sound like fun, be nice to other raiders. Use the emote wheel to greet them, and join up to fight larger enemies. You’ll learn faster and I’ve often been given items by players who I’ve helped out.",

    "description": "Patrick Reed played on three professionalc circuits in 2025, but none of the were the PGA Tour,. He says he'd consider returning if he was given the opportunity",
    "fullText": "DUBAI — Patrick Reed is a true golfer of the world.\n\nIt’s why he’s in the Middle East to kick off his 2026 season with three DP World Tour events before the LIV Golf season starts next month. That globetrotting commitment to both the DP World and Asian tours is why he’s still ranked No. 41 in the world, despite LIV not receiving Official World Golf Ranking points.\n\nEarlier this month, the 2018 Masters champion was enjoying a well-earned rest following his 32-event 2025 season when news broke that fellow LIV golfer Brooks Koepka was going back to the PGA Tour via the newly established Returning Member Program. The plan was created for LIV players who have not been a PGA Tour member for two years and who have won the Masters, U.S. Open, PGA Championship, Open Championship or Players Championship from 2022-2025. Only Koepka, Cameron Smith, Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm were eligible, and the latter three said last week they would continue to play on LIV.\n\nReed, who has played on LIV since its 2022 inaugural season and has one individual victory in 45 total starts, didn’t have the ability to consider the opportunity, but at the Dubai Invitational on Saturday, he was asked, hypothetically, if he would think about returning. “I mean, of course; if it were up to me, I'd play everywhere,” Reed said.\n\nHe does play everywhere. In 2025, the Texan teed up in 14 LIV events, four majors, 10 DP World Tour tournaments and four Asian Tour stops. “I'm already playing on three tours, why not add one more?” he added with a laugh. “I always enjoyed my time out there on the PGA Tour. Let's be honest, out there, it's the best tour in the world. Look at what they've done in golf … I could see myself playing there at some point again. But right now, you just never know; everything's so fluid.”\n\nSince donning the green jacket in 2018, Reed, 35, has been a regular feature in majors. He was fourth at the U.S. Open at Shinnecock immediately after his Masters victory and 10th at the 2019 Open Championship. He logged top-10s at Augusta National in 2020 and 2021 before becoming a serious Masters contender again. Reed finished T-4 in 2023 and T-3 last year, where he was genuinely in the hunt on the back nine on Sunday.\n\nDespite that form in golf’s four biggest events recently, Reed is not eligible for the Returning Member Program, given it rewards major victories after LIV debuted in 2022.\n\n“Right now, it's not even a decision,” Reed said. “That was for ’22 and on winners. So, I definitely would have to think about it … if that number [came] down to 2018. Right now, it's hard to say really what we're going to do or anything like that. Right now, the biggest thing is trying to play some good golf these [two] weeks, not only to solidify myself out here on DP, but to have a good momentum going into the year.”\n\nReed, a nine-time PGA Tour winner, was given honorary life membership on the DP World Tour in 2019 due to his staunch support of the European circuit. His commitment will run even deeper this year when he is likely to be paying fines for each LIV event he plays that conflicts with a DP World Tour tournament. The amount of each fine is not known.\n\nAs reported by The Telegraph, LIV Golf has paid fines in the past on behalf of its players but will no longer do so in 2026. That won’t stop Reed though, although he says he’d “love for it to be resolved.”\n\n“I always plan on showing my support on this tour and it's not going to stop me,” Reed said. “Starting this year, any fines or anything like that will go on the players, not on LIV. Right now, playing [these three] DP World Tour events [before the LIV season starts Feb. 4], I'm not getting fined.\n\n“Me travelling and playing around the world … it helps this tour, but also it's something I've always held true to my heart and wanted to do. So, if that's what it takes [paying the fines], that's what it takes.\n\n“I've always wanted to be a worldwide player,” he said.",

It touched down shortly after 11 a.m. local time on Monday\n\nIt's perhaps the swankiest jet to arrive so far. The price tag for a G700 starts at $78 million.\n\nBenioff is scheduled to speak tomorrow.\n\nTwo BlackRock-owned Gulfstream G650 jets have landed in Zurich, too, per JetSpy's tracking data.\n\nOne of them arrived on Sunday morning, followed by the other about 25 hours later.

Business Insider editor in chief Jamie Heller spied the price of coat check at the five-star Grandhotel Belvédère, one of Davos' hot meeting spots during WEF week, thanks to its proximity to the main convention center.\n\nAt $5 an item, it is one of the costlier cloakrooms we've seen, but don't worry, you can pay with your Amex.\n\nAt any gathering of the so-called global elite, protests are pretty much inevitable, and Davos is no different.\n\nDemonstrators gathered in the town on Sunday to oppose the event, and call for higher taxation on billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and the world's richest man, Elon Musk.

But their decision to go public could serve as a stamp of approval for smaller companies to dive in as well.\n\n\"Having a mindset change is really important,\" Taylor told me, and those larger companies will give the public markets a stamp of approval, he added.\n\nSo which ones will IPO this year? Taylor declined to speculate on that — I asked — but he did say he could see a domino effect among the big players once one makes the leap.\n\nWhile there's no official confirmation of what Trump plans to talk about, it's likely that the ongoing saga of his desire to make Greenland part of the US will feature heavily.\n\nWhile there's no official confirmation of what Trump plans to talk about, it's likely that the ongoing saga of his desire to make Greenland part of the US will feature heavily.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump said that from February 1, he would impose an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, which controls Greenland, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, unless they agree to a deal to hand over Greenland to the United States.\n\nEuropean leaders have been unequivocal in their opposition to Trump's plan, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday morning giving a nationwide address to condemn the new tariffs and defend Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland.\n\nWhile Greenland seems most likely, Trump's speech may focus on something completely different, with rumors swirling in the rarified air of the Swiss Alps that he could make a major announcement during the speech.\n\n\"All we are hearing is that it's going to be BIG BIG BIG and to clear our schedules,\" veteran journalist Steve Clemons wrote in his \"Washington Note\" newsletter late on Sunday.\n\nDavos kicks off in earnest this evening at around 6 p.m. local time (midday ET), with a curtain-raising concert from Grammy winner Jon Batiste, French violinist Renaud Capuçon, and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra.

    "title": "An Alaskan mine that's been in political limbo for years might be the key to satisfying America's huge appetite for copper",
    "description": "S&P Global said in a recent analysis that copper supply would fall short of demand for the next 15 years, barring significant increases in production.",
    "fullText": "Copper prices are soaring, and supply is expected to badly lag demand in the coming decade, but a small Alaska mine that's been in political limbo for years might hold the key to meeting the voracious appetite for the metal.\n\nBristol Bay is located in the southwest corner of Alaska, in the easternmost arm of the Bering Sea. The area boasts one of the nation's richest sockeye salmon runs. It's also home to a stalled project to mine a resource that's highly important to the AI infrastructure boom.\n\nLocals know all about the Pebble Mine project. The site was touted as having the potential to bring an economic windfall to the remote area, but was stalled by an EPA ruling. The wrangling over the project has gone on for over a decade and has spanned three presidential administrations—but with a copper shortage looming, the mining project has been thrust back into the spotlight.\n\nCopper prices are up sharply, breaking above $12,000 a ton for the first time in the last week and rising more than 40% in 12 months. The AI buildout is one factor that's sent demand soaring. However, a study by S&P Global this month said that supply will fall massively short between now and 2040, barring a sizable increase in production.\n\nThe firm predicts that copper production will peak in 2030, leaving the world roughly 10 million metric tons short by 2040.\n\nThe Pebble Mine project sits on vast copper and gold reserves. However, its operations have been blocked since 2014 under an Environmental Protection Agency provision that has remained in place across the Obama, Biden, and Trump administrations.\n\n\"Pebble is a world-class deposit,\" Deantha Skibinski, who serves as executive director of the Alaska Miners Association, told Business Insider. \"The copper in the ground at the pebble project is immense.\"\n\nShe added that there are few copper producers in the US with the type of reserves that Pebble Mine is sitting on. The project's owner says the site is the world's largest undeveloped store of both copper and gold. It also has large deposits of molybdenum and silver, two metals that also play a role in the AI buildout.\n\nSkibinski recalled the EPA's 2014 decision to block the mine during its exploratory phase after it failed a watershed assessment.\n\n\"What they did, which we contend is not legal, is that they issued the 404(c) veto preemptively, meaning before the company went into permitting,\" she said. \"And that is unprecedented.\"\n\nPebble Limited responded with a lawsuit, kicking off a long, complicated legal saga. More than a decade later, the mine is still not in operation.\n\nNow, as the US under Trump scrambles to secure domestic supplies of critical materials, Skibinski thinks the Pebble Mine project should get another look by the administration.\n\n\"You would think that the government should fully examine, transparently and honestly, how to get more mines that produce copper and other minerals online,\" she said. \"But when you talk about what it actually takes, there are many that say they're not interested in going that route.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump expressed support for other Alaska mining endeavors during his first term, including the Pebble Mine and a project that would open up the state's mineral-rich Ambler Mining District. But the New York Times reported in 2020 that Donald Trump Jr. opposed the mine's construction, citing the potential environmental impacts.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump Jr. did not return a request for comment. The White House did not reply to a request for comment about the administration's current stance on the Pebble Mine project.\n\n\"It is crucial for the President and all the federal agencies that may be holding up Pebble to understand that copper is vital for meeting our needs of a modern society that relies on it,\" said Lisa Reimers, an area native and the CEO of construction and logistics company Iliamna Development. \"Pebble Mine is an important project for the United States so we are not to be dependent on foreign companies for copper.\"",
