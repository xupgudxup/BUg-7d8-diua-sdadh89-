    "fullText": "Daniil Medvedev is off to a fantastic start in 2026, having reached the semifinals of the Brisbane International.\n\nAfter comfortable wins over Marton Fucsovics and Frances Tiafoe in the opening rounds of the ATP 250 event, Medvedev came back from a set down to beat Kamil Majchrzak, 6-7, 6-3, 6-2, and book his place in the final four.\n\nThe Russian will now face Alex Michelsen, against whom he holds a winning record of 2-0 at tour-level competitions.\n\nWith his triumph over Majchrzak, Medvedev now only trails Novak Djokovic in an incredible ATP statistic.\n\nMedvedev’s clash with Michelsen at the Brisbane International will mark the 52nd ATP hard-court semifinal of his career.\n\nThe only player who has made more semifinals on the surface than Medvedev is Djokovic, who has reached a whopping total of 127 and counting.\n\nMedvedev’s hot run of form late on in 2025 featured three semifinal appearances at hard-court events.\n\nHe made the final four at the China Open, the Shanghai Masters, and the Almaty Open.\n\nThough Medvedev has certainly improved recently, he is still ranked outside the top 10.\n\nWhen asked in his post-match press conference after beating Majchrzak if he feels he is getting back to his best, the former world number one said: “Yeah, I think it was close.\n\n“I would say kind of first set I would put myself at top 10, top 20, because there was one sloppy game on my serve where I missed all the first serves and I lost it. Without this, maybe I win the first set.\n\n“And same on the tiebreak, I think I made only two out of maybe five first serves. But second and third set, top-5 level, for sure. Amazing, not missing much, running well, serving like hell, volleys, everything.\n\n“So really happy with my level these three matches and looking forward.”\n\nMedvedev’s ranking fell to as low as 18th in the world during the 2025 ATP season.",

    "description": "\"I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress,\" Gates wrote in his annual letter.",
    "fullText": "Last year didn’t go the way Bill Gates hoped. As a philanthropist who has dedicated billions to improving everything from healthcare and education in poor countries to climate change action, Gates could only watch as the Trump administration slashed swathes of foreign aid contracts. \n\nThe Microsoft co-founder has criticised the cost-cutting regime, much of which was enacted under Elon Musk’s Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He warned the action could directly result in the death of children, a claim which Tesla CEO Musk demanded evidence.\n\nWriting in his annual letter this year, the Gates Foundation founder was optimistic but candid, writing: “I believe the world will keep improving—but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.”\n\nHe added: “The thing I am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress: the number of deaths of children under five years old. Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century, from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025—an increase driven by less support from rich countries to poor countries.”\n\nLast month the Gates Foundation’s Goalkeepers Report revealed an additional 12.5 million child deaths could occur by 2045 if development assistance for health (including government spending) is reduced by 20% from 2024 levels, according to bespoke modelling based on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\n“Friends and colleagues often ask me how I stay optimistic in an era with so many challenges and so much polarization,” Gates wrote. “My answer is this: I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.”\n\nBut, that optimism comes with a deadline, or as Gates puts it “there are footnotes to my optimism.”\n\n“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates continued. “As hard as last year was, I don’t believe we will slide back into the Dark Ages.”\n\n“I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.”\n\nIn 2025, Gates announced his $200 billion moonshot: He was donating “virtually all [his] wealth”—about $100 billion—to his foundation. It was the largest philanthropic commitment in modern history, and came with strings attached. The funds (made up of its current endowment and projected growth) must be spent in the next 20 years.\n\nWhile Gates made the announcement this year, his intentions have been clear for many years. In 2010 Gates, his wife at the time Melinda French Gates, and Berkshire Hathaway co-founder Warren Buffett launched the Giving Pledge, making a public commitment to philanthropy, which has since been signed by the likes of philanthropist Mackenzie Scott and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky.\n\nIn a bid to bridge a gap in government funding, Gates is calling on fellow wealthy philanthropists. He wrote: “This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need—both domestically and globally—which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires.”\n\nA report on billionaires from Oxfam, released most recently in January 2025, revealed that in 2024, the number of billionaires rose to 2,769, up from 2,565 a year prior. It also said it expects at least five people to reach trillionaire status a decade from now.\n\nGates added: “I know cuts won’t be reversed overnight, even though aid represented less than 1% of GDP even in the most generous countries. But it is critical that we restore some of the funding.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Stuart Brown has worked at Viking for nearly two decades.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen will soon lose another longtime lieutenant.\n\nStuart Brown, the longtime head of trading for Viking Global, is stepping down from the $55 billion asset manager to take a career break, two people familiar with the move told Business Insider. The firm declined to comment, and Brown could not be reached for comment.\n\nBrown was at the long-running Tiger Cub, a nickname for hedge funds that spun out of late billionaire Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, for 18 years, according to his bio on the firm's website. He joined the firm after working on the corporate credit sales desk at Credit Suisse.\n\nOne of the people close to the firm said Brown's official departure date is not yet known. Brown will help the firm during a transition period, this person said.\n\nViking has lost several senior members of its team in recent years, which now numbers 275 employees, according to the firm's site.\n\nFrom the investing side, Ning Jin, the former chief investment officer of Viking, left the firm in August 2024 to start his own fund, Avantyr Capital.\n\nOn the operations side of the business, the firm's former general counsel, Andrew Genser, joined former Viking portfolio manager Divya Nettimi's fund, Avala Global, last summer. Viking's director of recruiting, Kevin Curtis, moved to Bobby Jain's eponymous fund in September 2025, and the firm's former investor relations head, Savina Boyadjieva, just started as a partner at Joshua Kushner's Thrive Capital.\n\nWhile Viking's peers include long-short equity funds such as Tiger Global, Coatue, Lone Pine, D1, Maverick, and others, the firm is not as tech-heavy as some of the other Tiger Cubs. In some years, such as 2022, this can help the manager, but when mega-stocks like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft drive a bulk of the market's returns, it can lead to Viking missing out on some gains.\n\nLast year was an example of this: Viking returned less than 9% on the year in its flagship fund, a person close to the manager said, less than the S&P 500 index.",

    "title": "I went to CES to check out robotaxis. I left convinced that one player is far in the lead.",
    "description": "Robotaxi reporter Lloyd Lee breaks down what he saw — and heard — on the ground at the world's largest consumer tech show, CES, in Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The race to dominate the robotaxi space may not be as close as some companies suggest.\n\nLloyd Lee, Business Insider's reporter covering robotaxis and emerging mobility tech, went to CES for the first time to check out the autonomous service from Zoox, Vay, and other providers. Lee, who has taken a few rides with robotaxis recently entering the market, said the experience sharpened his view that one company appears to be significantly ahead — and that the industry still faces major hurdles before the vehicles can truly go mainstream.\n\nIn the Q&A below with BI News Chief Steve Russolillo, Lee breaks down his biggest takeaways from CES, the most impressive tech he saw, and how the experience will shape his coverage in the year ahead.\n\nSteve Russolillo: Lloyd, this is your first time at CES. What are your impressions and biggest takeaways from the event?\n\nLloyd Lee: First, CES is a massive event. It is humanly impossible to stop by every booth no matter how militant you are with your time. Second, I was struck by how much space the convention was dedicated to automobility. I agree with what Paul Costa, a 25-year Apple veteran who worked on the company's self-driving car project and is now at Ford, told me: CES has become a car show as much as it remains a tech show.\n\nRussolillo: What's the craziest and wildest piece of new technology that you saw?\n\nLee: Hyundai Motor Group's booth had a really impressive display of how far it's trying to take autonomy — from EV charging stations and robotaxis to robotic arms and humanoid robots. Boston Dynamics, a Hyundai unit, demoed its Atlas humanoid robot at the booth. Just the way it activates and stands up is terrifying and awe-striking at the same time.\n\nRussolillo: You cover robotaxis for BI and had the opportunity to test drive two different robotaxis this week. What stood out to you the most?\n\nLee: I tried two robotaxi services for the first time, including Amazon's Zoox. There are obviously a lot of smart people working on this technology. But I have to say: Trying those services only made me realize 1.) how far ahead Waymo is or at least appears to be, and 2.) just how difficult it is to make a profitable business case for robotaxis right now.\n\nGetting autonomous driving right is only part of the challenge. There's also the operations side — like fleet scaling and management — that Waymo has had to build up to help make robotaxis feel like a real autonomous ride-hailing service you can use in your day-to-day. (That is if you live in the city Waymo operates.) And even then, we know Waymo is burning money on its service.\n\nRussolillo: What are some of the predictions you've heard from sources about tech, AI and business?\n\nLee: Chris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte with expertise in software-defined vehicles, had a few interesting points.\n\nRussolillo: What startup you never heard before really stole the show and impressed you?\n\nLee: Perhaps less stole the show, but I thought Vay, a German startup developing a driverless car rental service, reminded me that there's still room for some contrarian voices in the driverless space. Remote driving is the big bogeyman for robotaxi companies. You don't want to be caught using it. This startup's entire business model is built around it. Vay is using remote driving — with a potential to pursue autonomy in the future — for a small fraction of the overall driving experience: Getting the car delivered to a renter without a human inside. It was a \"Huh, I never thought about that\" moment.\n\nRussolillo: What did you learn that might change how you go about your tech coverage for BI?\n\nLee: Broadly, emerging technologies like humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and, more generally, AI, contain a lot of unknowns and uncertainties. And company leaders in those spaces can be evasive when you ask for specifics, or they simply don't know the answer. Possibly both. My instinct is to resolve that ambiguity, which in this space, will not always be realistic. Instead, I should write to the uncertainty, not through it. Name the ambiguity, build the story around it.",

    "title": "We visited Greenland's only fully operational mine. Here's what it takes to mine in one of the world's most remote places.",
    "description": "Countries worldwide have eyes on Greenland for its natural resources, but the island only has one fully operational mine. We visited to find out why.",
    "fullText": "Greenland has no shortage of valuable minerals. What it lacks is almost everything else needed to extract them.\n\nGreenland is one of the most logistically hostile environments on the planet — a place with no roads between towns, limited labor, and weather that can shut down operations without warning.\n\nStill, world leaders and investors across the globe have their eyes on the island for its natural resources, including copper, zinc, graphite, gold, and rare earth elements that can be used in everything from construction and manufacturing to electronics and defense systems.\n\nAs the US, Europe, and other countries look to diversify supply chains away from China, Greenland has drawn renewed attention as a potential alternative. President Donald Trump's latest remarks that the US should annex Greenland for national security reasons — triggering an outcry from its citizens — have also drawn attention to the island and its strategic value.\n\nThere is only one fully operational mine in Greenland. Business Insider's Sarah Andersen visited the mine in June to see why it remains open while others have shut down — and why the island's vast mineral wealth hasn't translated into a mining boom.\n\nYou always have to plan several steps ahead when operating in Greenland, said Bent Olsvig Jensen, managing director of Lumina Sustainable Materials.\n\n\"We have to think of everything because we cannot just pick up the phone and expect spare parts to be available the next morning,\" he said in June.\n\nLumina Sustainable Materials — a private science and mining company group with operations in Greenland, the US, Mexico, and the European Union — operates the island's only fully active mine, located deep inside a fjord system with no road access.\n\nThe mine produces an industrial mineral called anorthosite, used in fiberglass, construction materials, and other industrial applications.\n\nAside from what they've built, which includes a camp, a plant, a warehouse, a harbor, and a small gym and clinic, there is no other infrastructure supporting the site. Everything, including the crew, arrives by ship during the ice-free months or by helicopter when the fjord freezes over for months on end, Jensen said. (Andersen arrived via an eight-hour boat trip from the capital, Nuuk.)\n\nWhen something breaks, there is no overnight delivery.\n\n\"Sometimes you can wait for spare parts for a week or two,\" Dennis Jensen (no relation to Bent Jensen) said during Andersen's visit to the mine. Jensen is the mine's site manager who oversees operations through the long, dark winters, where temperatures can dip to -22°F. When that happens, \"we are not working outside,\" he said.\n\nWinter storms can ground helicopters for days, delaying crew changes and keeping workers on-site longer than planned, Dennis Jensen added.\n\nOn average, \"it takes 16 years to develop a mine, right from the first idea to the actual mine,\" Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister responsible for natural resources, including minerals, said in June.\n\nFor most of that time, \"you spend money, you don't make a lot of money,\" she said.\n\nIt took Lumina 11 years, for example, to get from exploration to production. Exploration started in 2008 and reached final production in 2019, Bent said.\n\nGreenland has over 100 mineral licenses, spanning early exploration to advanced stages. Many projects stall long before reaching operation, often because they cannot secure long-term financing, Nathanielsen said.\n\nPeople mistakenly think they can begin to extract the minerals on day one, but they can't, Majken Djurhuus Poulsen, a geologist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told Andersen during her visit.\n\nParts of Greenland host some of the oldest bedrock on the planet, billions of years old, Poulsen said. That history has created many different types of mineral deposits, but the conditions make exploration slow.\n\n\"You can only do exploration for three to four months a year,\" when areas are ice-free enough, she added.\n\nOn top of that, Poulsen said sites can be difficult to get to, often requiring helicopters that push costs higher. There's rarely any infrastructure, so you have to build everything from scratch — from the mine to where workers will live. After all that, identifying a promising deposit can take years, sometimes decades, she added.\n\nAs a result, mining requires investors who are willing to wait years without returns and have a high tolerance for risk. Nathanielsen said Greenland lacks the domestic capital to fund that process and depends heavily on foreign investment.\n\n\"It is quite sobering in terms of trying to keep your providers of capital,\" James Kiernan, honorary chairman of Cordiant Capital, a Canadian multinational investment management firm and one of Lumina's major backing investors, told Andersen in July.\n\nKiernan pointed to multiple examples of mines affected as market realities shifted.\n\n\"There was a mine called Ruby that was open, and they were trying to find rubies. They were open and closed and open and closed,\" he said, referring to the Greenland Ruby mine and describing the stop-start pattern that has defined many efforts on the island.\n\nAt the same time, the government has kept strict environmental and social standards.\n\nBefore any project moves forward, Nathanielsen said companies must answer two questions: Will it create jobs for Greenlanders, and how will it protect the environment?\n\n\"If the project owners cannot answer those two questions on a satisfactory level, if they cannot provide the people with a good answer, they will meet opposition,\" she said.\n\nLumina's success in navigating that process is in part due to its long planning horizons, close coordination with the government, and a business model designed around Greenland's constraints.\n\nStill, the mine has yet to turn a profit, Kiernan told Andersen during a follow-up call on Friday.\n\nBut Bent Jensen and Kiernan said that after years of operating in Greenland's challenging conditions, the company is well-positioned to apply that know-how to other mining projects, and Lumina has recently secured an exploration license to search for rare earth minerals.\n\nMore mines could unlock a new future for Greenlanders, helping pave a path toward greater autonomy as the island seeks to develop new revenue streams to eventually become financially independent from Denmark.\n\nHowever, a mining boom isn't likely at any point soon, Bent Jensen said.\n\n\"I see Greenland developing slowly because it needs to develop organically with the population, with the politicians,\" he said. \"It will be one mine at a time.\"",

    "fullText": "Tennis players have the luxury of playing all around the world, and Iga Swiatek’s career has taken her to every edge of the globe.\n\nThe world number two has often called out the hectic nature of the WTA Tour schedule, but it has allowed her to travel the world.\n\nSwiatek has kickstarted her season at the United Cup in Australia, ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year at the Australian Open.\n\nAt the event, the Polish star has named the city she loves so much that she thinks she could live there.\n\nSwiatek is currently playing for Poland in the United Cup in Sydney and she’s opened up about her adoration for the city.\n\nSpeaking at the United Cup, the world number two said: “I love being here. I could honestly live here — I love Sydney.”\n\nSwiatek’s form has been impressive at the United Cup in Sydney, where she has beaten Eva Lys, Suzan Lamens, and Maya Joint.\n\nThat’s only boosted Swiatek’s love for Sydney, which the Pole said was “Becoming my favourite city in the whole world. I really have fun here.”\n\nSwiatek’s next match in Sydney will be against Coco Gauff as Poland face the United States for a place in the final of the United Cup.\n\nSwiatek might have a great passion for Sydney, but she’s never played her best tennis on the WTA Tour’s Australian swing.\n\nThe star is yet to win the United Cup for Poland in three attempts, with her best effort coming in 2025 when she lost to the United States in the final.\n\nThe Australian Open is also the only Grand Slam that the Polish star is yet to win, having been knocked out at the semi-final stage on two occasions in 2022 and 2025.\n\nSwiatek’s only victory on Australian soil came all the way back in 2021, when she won the Adelaide International.\n\nThe Pole defeated Belinda Bencic in the final, but she has failed even to reach a final in singles competition in Australia since.",

    "description": "The World Economic Forum found that AI will reshape most jobs by 2030, with only one path limiting major displacement.",
    "fullText": "The World Economic Forum says the future of work isn't doomed by AI — but most paths forward still involve painful disruption.\n\nIn the \"Four Futures for Jobs in the New Economy: AI and Talent in 2030,\" white paper published on Wednesday, the organization laid out four scenarios based on two variables — how fast AI capabilities advance and how ready workers and institutions are to adapt.\n\nThe scenarios range from rapid AI breakthroughs to slower, more uneven progress.\n\nOnly one scenario — dubbed the \"Co-Pilot Economy\" — is explicitly designed to limit large-scale displacement.\n\nIn that future, AI adoption is widespread but measured, and workers have the skills to use the technology as a complement rather than a replacement.\n\nAs the report puts it, \"Gradual AI progress and availability of AI-ready skillsets shift the focus towards augmentation rather than mass automation.\"\n\nInstead of eliminating roles outright, AI reshapes tasks, with humans staying in the loop.\n\nEven this relatively optimistic scenario is far from static.\n\n\"Although displacement and job churn have risen, governments, businesses, and workers increasingly view AI as an opportunity rather than a threat,\" the WEF's report said.\n\nThe remaining three scenarios are more disruptive, but they differ in pace and severity.\n\nIn \"The Age of Displacement,\" AI advances faster than education and reskilling systems can respond, pushing companies to automate aggressively and leaving large parts of the workforce struggling to keep up.\n\nIn \"Stalled Progress,\" AI continues to improve, but productivity gains are patchy and concentrated among a small number of firms and regions, eroding job quality elsewhere and widening inequality.\n\nIn \"Supercharged Progress,\" explosive AI breakthroughs drive rapid economic growth and innovation — but still render many existing roles obsolete faster than new ones can emerge.\n\nHowever, some researchers caution that the future is unlikely to follow any single, clean path.\n\nJames Ransom, a research fellow at University College London, told Business Insider that AI progress and workforce readiness vary widely across industries, jobs, and regions, resulting in uneven rather than universal disruption.\n\nHe expects displacement to accelerate over the next few years — even as he said most workers are still likely to be on the payroll by 2030.\n\nThe Forum said that the future of work will not be defined by technology alone. Throughout the report, it said that policy choices, corporate strategy, and investment in skills will shape how painful — or manageable — the transition becomes.\n\nSaadia Zahidi, a managing director at the WEF, told Business Insider that the four scenarios \"are not predictions of where the world will be in 2030, but a framework to help leaders prepare for the evolving global economy.\"\n\nTech leaders and AI researchers remain split over how disruptive AI will ultimately be to the workforce.\n\nFigures like Geoffrey Hinton, often described as the \"godfather of AI,\" and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have warned that AI could replace large swaths of white-collar work within just a few years.\n\nOthers, including Box CEO Aaron Levie and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have predicted that AI will deliver explosive productivity gains — even as it renders many existing roles obsolete.\n\nA more optimistic camp, including Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman and Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, have said AI will ultimately augment workers.",

    "description": "I moved from the US to Copenhagen, the world's most livable city. The language and weather were hard to adapt to, so I left nearly two years later.",
    "fullText": "When I moved to Copenhagen in January 2021 for my \"dream job,\" my expectations were high.\n\nI was going to help design a new national museum — full of dinosaur skeletons and other natural wonders — in a place that routinely ranks as one of the happiest and most liveable cities in the world.\n\nJust last year, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Copenhagen as the No. 1 most livable city — above places like Vienna, Zurich, and Osaka — while the World Happiness Report named Denmark the second-happiest country in the world, behind only Finland.\n\nAhead of my move, I envisioned the city as a cobblestone paradise of candy-colored houses, vast bike lanes, and delicious cinnamon rolls — a romanticized fantasy reinforced by a stellar reputation.\n\nLittle did I know, I'd come to find myself running at sunrise because it was the only time the city felt like the place I'd been promised.\n\nI grew up in Vermont and lived there while I finished grad school, so I was used to facing long, cold winters.\n\nBut immediately, Copenhagen felt different, with the January sun rising after 8:30 a.m. and disappearing around 3:30 p.m. — leaving me with about two hours less sunlight than I was used to at home.\n\nThe short days often felt gloomy, with frequent rain bringing a layer of gray clouds unlike anything I'd ever seen — it was like an oppressive, immovable blanket across the entire sky. During the winter months, those clouds could rob the city of sunshine for many consecutive days.\n\nI also quickly discovered why the salary I'd been offered seemed high. Prices in Copenhagen were higher than what I was used to in Vermont, making a simple coffee and pastry feel like luxuries I couldn't afford. But maybe I shouldn't have been so surprised, given the city has regularly found itself on \"most expensive city\" lists over the past few years.\n\nRunning at sunrise became my refuge. Weaving through empty streets flanked by beautiful old houses and canals, I felt like I could see the city's magic.\n\nBut beyond those runs, I was struggling.\n\nI spent my first year in Copenhagen taking language classes, exploring street art, and embracing football culture while sipping Carlsberg beers with the Dane I was dating.\n\nYet, it seemed like there were barriers everywhere. Although I speak three languages, I found it difficult to master Danish, leaving me unable to keep up when happy-hour banter inevitably slipped away from English.\n\nThis, of course, didn't make socializing any easier. My colleagues were pleasant, but they already had calcified social circles. I tried to meet new people by attending live music events, but the local smoking culture made it tricky to find bars that weren't filled with cigarette smoke, which I didn't enjoy.\n\nMeanwhile, summer brought its own challenges. Short winter days were replaced by shockingly long summer ones — think over 17 hours of sunlight. This near-constant light wreaked havoc on my sleep, and sunrise runs were only possible before 5 a.m.\n\nIn this land of extremes, it felt impossible for me to attain a good balance.\n\nOn top of that, so many of the perks that helped Copenhagen earn high marks for livability and happiness seemed designed for someone else.\n\nFor example, I didn't have kids, nor was I expecting any, so Denmark's generous maternity leave and excellent childcare were of no use to me.\n\nAnd although employees here are entitled to a whopping five weeks of vacation time, I felt like I couldn't even take advantage of it because my museum project was behind schedule. I just felt pressured to work more.\n\nA year in, my dream job had become a nightmare. It was my second winter, and the combination of work pressure and isolation in an expensive, dark city was taking its toll. I biked to work in the dark each morning and left in the dark each afternoon.\n\nFor months, I continued lacing up my shoes for runs, hoping to recapture that sense of possibility. But instead, I felt like I was chasing something that would never come.\n\nThe empty cobblestone streets that once seemed quaint were now a metaphor for my lonely existence.\n\nIt suddenly hit me during a morning run in early summer — I was done trying to make it work. After securing a job stateside, I left my notice, and just before autumn threatened to transform into another winter, I packed my life into two suitcases. I hadn't even lasted two years.\n\nOn my one-block walk to the metro, my suitcases got soaked in the rain — a fitting goodbye.\n\nLooking back, my time in Copenhagen taught me that independence has its limits. Community, balance, and a sense of belonging matter more to me than I realized, and if I were to live abroad again, I'd need to know I'd have them.",

    "description": "We took a long, international flight on Singapore Airlines' business class. For my family, the best part was the food, but I had issues with the seat.",
    "fullText": "When I booked a family trip from Copenhagen to Singapore, I knew we were facing a 13-hour overnight flight.\n\nFlying with my husband and our 7-year-old son meant comfort wasn't just a luxury — it was a necessity. So, we splurged on business class, using points to bring the cost down to something we could justify.\n\nHere's what it was like — the highs, the lows, and the key thing that made it worthwhile.\n\nA deal popped up on discount search engine seats.aero that seemed too good to pass up: Singapore Airlines business-class seats from Copenhagen to Singapore, bookable through Air Canada's Aeroplan program, for just 80,000 points per person.\n\nSingapore Airlines has a reputation for having one of the best business-class experiences in the world, and the thought of spending 13 hours in lie-flat comfort — especially with a child — was incredibly appealing.\n\nWe transferred our American Express points to Air Canada and booked the seats, paying only about $100 per person in taxes and fees.\n\nThat flight, which could easily cost over $15,000 for three passengers, cost us just over $300 out of pocket.\n\nWhen we boarded the Airbus A350-900, the first thing I noticed was how wide the seats looked. At about 28 inches wide, there was plenty of room for my husband and me, and our son could stretch out without feeling cramped.\n\nEven better, the seats were equipped with numerous compartments — small storage areas for headphones, snacks, books, and charging devices.\n\nAs a parent, I loved being able to keep things organized instead of digging through one overflowing bag the entire flight.\n\nI loved that you could control the seatback setup either directly on the screen or with a pull-out remote. That flexibility made it simple for all of us to watch what we wanted.\n\nThe complimentary noise-canceling headphones were another highlight. They blocked out the hum of the cabin, allowing me actually to enjoy a movie without distraction.\n\nThe food turned out to be one of the highlights of the flight. I started with stuffed chicken paired with potatoes and mushrooms — a flavorful and surprisingly restaurant-quality dish.\n\nWe also tried the oriental-style braised beef cheek, which was tender and rich.\n\nBeyond the formal meal service, there was also an \"anytime\" menu. At any point during the flight, you could order a sandwich, a bowl of egg-noodle soup, or a variety of small snacks.\n\nWe didn't lean on it this time, but as a parent, I loved knowing it was there in case my son got hungry outside of meal times.\n\nAnother unexpected perk: I was able to order a proper latte in the morning. Usually, I avoid airplane coffee altogether, but this was actually good — smooth, not burnt-tasting, and served with a bit of flair in a real mug.\n\nIt felt like a small luxury, but after hours in the air, it made a big difference.\n\nFor me, one downside was the way the seat converted into a bed.\n\nInstead of just reclining with a button, we had to stand up and have the flight attendant flip our seats over. Not great when you're already half-asleep.\n\nAnd once it was a bed, the surface felt surprisingly firm. Since I have back problems, this was not ideal, and it was challenging to find a comfortable position.\n\nHowever, it was certainly better than sleeping upright.\n\nThe lie-flat seat sort of forces your legs into a diagonal position, which can make it difficult to relax during such a long flight.\n\nMy husband and I both found ourselves shifting around trying to get comfortable.\n\nFor our son, though, it was perfect. The smaller frame of a 7-year-old fit right into the angled nook, and he slept soundly while we tossed and turned.\n\nWould I pay cash for this flight? Probably not — the angled footwell and hard bed weren't quite worth the usual five-figure price tag.\n\nHowever, this flight was absolutely worth spending points on.\n\nThe wide seats, smart storage, strong entertainment system, tasty meals, and polished service all combined to make the journey manageable — especially with a child in tow.\n\nAnd arriving in Singapore rested enough to start exploring right away was the ultimate payoff.",

    "description": "An analysis from S&P Global predicts that the AI boom will drive demand higher for years at a time when supply is expected to remain constrained.",
    "fullText": "Copper joined the mega rally in precious and industrial metals in 2025, but the gains might be far from over if recent forecasts for supply and demand prove correct.\n\nCopper ended 2025 with a gain of about 44%, and touched a fresh all-time high this week. Yet, the AI boom might be the key to another 15 years of surging demand at a time when supply is expected to remain constrained.\n\nS&P Global recently published an analysis of the copper market, predicting that demand is likely to increase by 50% by 2040, reaching 42 million metric tons. The report also said that it will be extremely difficult for the mining industry to keep up as companies struggle with aging mines and regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe authors predict that, without new mines or technological advancements, copper production will peak in 2030, leaving the world short of roughly 10 million metric tons by 2040.\n\n\"Several countries have deemed copper a 'critical metal' over the past half decade, including, in 2025, the United States. And with good reason,\" said Carlos Pascual, Senior Vice President, Geopolitics and International Affairs, at S&P Global Energy. \"Copper is the connective artery linking physical machinery, digital intelligence, mobility, infrastructure, communication and security systems.\"\n\nCopper benefited from a broad rush into metals last year that also pushed gold and silver to record highs. Some forecasters have said they think prices for all three metals are likely to decline in the near future as market conditions shift, but copper's industrial importance could continue to buoy it.\n\nJosé Torres, chief economist at Interactive Brokers, said he thinks copper's global strategic importance means prices will remain elevated.\n\n\"Broadly, it has to do with limited supply as nations want to stockpile the cyclical metal to bolster sovereign AI prospects,\" he told Business Insider. \"Governments are afraid that without enough copper, their economies won't remain competitive in a world where advanced technology is increasingly adopted.\"\n\nRita Adiani, president and CEO of rare earth mining company Titan Mining Corporation, believes that a surge in demand, as predicted by S&P, would lead to a period of higher prices.\n\n\"A significant part of the incremental demand is tied to electrification, grid build, data centers/AI and defense, where copper's conductivity and reliability makes substitution harder in critical applications.\"",

    "title": "15 Shows Like 'Fallout' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "It's the end of the world and they show it.",
    "fullText": "Prime Video's Fallout, an adaptation of the popular video game series of the same name, is set more than two centuries from now on an Earth still devastated by a long-ago nuclear war between the United States and China. The protagonist, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), emerges from the underground fallout shelter where she's lived her entire life in search of her father, and a fuller understanding of the world above, a wasteland is dominated by warring factions and freakish mutants.\n\nIt's a gutsy, hilarious adaptation of out-there source material, and it's wild to consider that, in the space of a couple of years, we've gone from approximately zero worthwhile video game adaptations to having two series (the other being HBO's The Last of Us) contending for Outstanding series Emmys. Strange days. Yet these two are definitely not the only post-apocalyptic narratives you'll find streaming right now. Here are 15 more to shows, from dramatic, to funny, to everything between, to fuel your end times fantasies. (It's fine, everything's fine, I'm fine lol.)\n\nThis '90s were a great time for post-apocalyptic video games, and the 2020s seem to be a great time to adapt them for TV. The most brutal show on Peacock is based on the vehicular combat games that parents probably hated way more than they hated Fallout (it’s a lot of wild, demolition-derby style action involving smashing and/or blowing up your opponents). It stars Anthony Mackie as John Doe, an effective anchor for the chaos of this lawless future America in which the roads have become battlegrounds. There's tons of clever humor amid the frenetic car-on-car (and car-on-semi, car-on-hearse, -ice cream truck, etc.) action. Things go boom, mostly, and sometimes that’s exactly what you want—it’s the show for the 15-year-old gamer inside all of us. Stream Twisted Metal on Peacock.\n\nRebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who gets wrapped up in an investigation involving the local sheriff (David Oyelowo)—usual procedural stuff, except that the characters all inhabit a massive silo, 144-levels deep, protecting the remaining 10,000 humans from the allegedly poisoned world above. Those running the silo have managed to convince everyone left that only strict adherence to rules and procedures will keep them safe from the dangers outside. This is a more dour, less colorful apocalypse than the one in Fallout—it's a prestige drama that incorporates elements of horror, mystery, and science fiction to tell human stories about fear and control. Two further seasons are coming. Stream Silo on Apple TV+.\n\nWhere The Walking Dead and The Last of Us made prestige television out of the zombie apocalypse, this SyFy channel original is all about treating zombies as a campy, gory good time. Things kick off with a soldier who’s been tasked with transporting a package across country. The package in question is actually a human being, a survivor of a zombie bite who might be able to help create a vaccine (sound familiar?), but the emotional stakes are a lot lower than The Last of Us's tortured trek. It comes from the schlock-masters at The Asylum, purveyors of infamous B-movies like Sharknado, which should tell you all you need to know about the tone. Stream Z Nation on Peacock, Tubi, AMC+, and Shudder.\n\nI've never been particularly convinced that an end-of-the-world narrative needs to be set in the future, and this darkly funny but surprisingly humane show offers up a slice of a real-life apocalypse. Loosely adapting Giovanni Boccaccio's 14th century story collection with hints of Bridgerton-esque swagger, we're taken to plague-ravaged Florence, as a bunch of nobles and attendants make their way across a dangerous landscape to hole up in a countryside villa to wait out the end while draining the liquor supplies—as you would. Rules and social mores are turned upside down, particularly by servant Licisca (Tanya Reynolds), who kind of accidentally kills her lady on the way to the villa and then decides to take her place. Despite being primarily a show about how hell is other people, it makes for an entirely addictive binge experience. Stream The Decameron on Netflix.\n\nAbout 500 years from now, war has eradicated anything resembling civilization and left the planet ravaged, even as some vestiges of technology remain. Still, firearms are largely taboo given the devastation they've caused—allowing for an action apocalypse dominated by kick-ass martial arts combat. The Badlands, Rocky Mountains and Mississippi River are transformed into competing feudal-esque kingdoms, dominated by Marton Csokas's creepy, over-the-top Baron Quinn and, at least initially, his chief lieutenant Sunny (Daniel Wu). Stream Into the Badlands on Prime Video and AMC+.\n\nThis smart, impressively voice-acted, beautifully animated sci-fi epic follows the fates of the stranded survivors of a crashed interstellar cargo ship. The web of natural life on the world on which they find themselves is unusually complex, and the rules of biology they're used to don't seem to apply. The outer space sci-fi setting doesn't, on the surface, have much to do with the blasted desert of Fallout, but both shows are set in imagined worlds that are intricate, colorful, and devilishly clever. Stream Scavengers Reign on HBO Max.\n\nThough initially feeling like an unnecessary extention of Bong Joon Ho's allegorical post-apocalyptic film, Snowpiercer, the show, ultimately takes on a life of its own as a clever sci-fi melodrama, smartly recognizing that there are no heroes and few true villains at the end of the world—it's mostly just people doing whatever they can to survive. In a frozen future (2026, to be precise), humanity survives on an extremely long train that circumnavigates the globe. If it stops, the power will go out and everyone (literally everyone) will die. Those who came aboard with wealth live near the front in relative luxury, while the poor live on scraps (or worse) in the train's tail. Daveed Diggs stars as former detective Andre Layton, a \"Tailie\" deputized by Jennifer Connelly's Melanie Cavill, engineer and the train's Head of Hospitality, to solve a series of murders. The inevitable uprising that follows sets the two of them on different sides of a violent conflict, before each eventually realizes they're just pawns of elites—same as it ever was. Stream Snowpiercer on AMC+ or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThis anime series makes clear that it definitely isn't 5G that we need to be worried about...it's 7G, an experimental cell network that warps reality and leaves Japan as a series of isolated settlements—it's also caused strange mutations, including turning people into animals, and creating mind-controlling mushrooms à la The Last of Us. Discovering evidence that one of her classmates is alive outside of Tokyo, Shizuru Chikura gets some friend together and they commandeer a train to carry them through the strange new wilderness. Stream Train to the End of the World on Crunchyroll or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nPredating Fallout by just about a year, The Last of Us started what remains an extremely exclusive club of video game adaptations that click, in this case even picking up a bunch of Emmys—Fallout maybe running a bit behind in terms of major awards, but has picked up nominations for Outstanding Drama and Lead Actor Emmys, which ain't too shabby. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey star here, at least initially, as Joel and Ellie, travelers through an apocalyptic wasteland populated by zombified humans infected by a fungus. There's genuine suspense and expertly crafted horror in the show's zombie threat, but it's all built around the dynamic between Joel and Ellie, a beaten-down smuggler and the immune teenager he's being paid to deliver to the other side of the country. Their relationship sells the premise, and makes the stakes feel very real when the zombie mushroom people come out to bite. When the show upends that cart in season two, it's devastating. Stream The Last of Us on HBO Max.\n\nI suppose it says something about our uniquely fun era that you can turn on the TV and take your pick of future dystopias—here we visit a hyper-capitalist future in which everything's hunky-dory, as long as you mostly only care about money. A dark comedy based on the Hugo-Award winning book series by Martha Wells, the show stars Alexander Skarsgård is the title's hilariously deadpan robot, a private \"security construct\" who's managed to hack its way through its own programming and gain free will—which it mostly wants to use to watch its favorite streaming shows. It can't just run off for fear of drawing attention, but the self-named Murderbot (it's being ironic, kinda) is content to do the bare minimum when it's assigned to a team of inexperienced and naive hippie researchers who don't see the need for a killer security robot—at least, not until they're enmeshed in a complicated capitalist plot in which they're all just cogs. Stream Murderbot on Apple TV+.\n\nThe miniseries, based on the Emily St. John Mandel bestseller, was released at either the best time or the worst possible time, the story of a flu pandemic twenty years on hitting HBO square in the middle of COVID—and don't all of our current apocalypse dramas owe just a bit to that waking nightmare? The show follows two tracks, one introducing Kirsten Raymonde, a young stage actor whose performance in a production of King Lear is cut short by the onset of a virus with a 99% fatality rate. We also visit Kirsten twenty years on, still an actor, in a world very much changed. It’s a slow-burn, picking up steam only after a couple of episodes, but ultimately, the series makes a moving case for the power of art, even (or especially) in moments when survival is on the line. Stream Station Eleven on HBO Max.\n\nNo weird mutations here; instead we get an apocalypse that looks disturbingly normal. As the series begins, around 2% of the world's population disappears without explanation—it's enough to upend just about everything. Politics have adapted to the new normal, religions have collapsed and reformed, and families have had to make peace with the inexplicable loss of loved ones. The first season revolves around the Garvey family led by Kevin (Justin Theroux), a sheriff whose wife (Amy Brenneman) left him to join a cult, while subsequent seasons broaden the scope to bring in other characters in other locations. Showrunner Damon Lindelof also co-created Lost, and Leftovers inherits that show's relatively grim tone while doing it one better in sticking a landing. Stream The Leftovers on HBO Max.\n\nWe get a lot of Fallout-esque desert dystopias, but leave it to those melancholy Danes to center an apocalypse around precipitation. In this three-season import, a virus spread by rainfall that wipes out most of the population of Scandinavia. Siblings Simone and Rasmus emerge from their bunker six years later, setting off across Scandinavia with the hope of finding a safe haven, and maybe their father. It turns out that one of them holds the key to wiping out the virus and saving the world. It’s not the most original premise (The Last of Us game came out five years earlier), but the setting gives it a unique feel, and the series comes to a decisive ending. Stream The Rain on Netflix.\n\nOK, so maybe the end of days is feeling a little heavy at this point, and you're looking for something a little brighter and a lot more gay. I got you! New Queer Cinema pioneer Greg Araki followed up his neon-tinged apocalypse in Kaboom with Now Apocalypse, a successor in spirit. Avan Jogia plays Ulysses Zane, living in sun-soaked California with his best friend Carly (Kelli Berglund), a struggling actress and sex worker. He keeps having bizarre dreams about an alien invasion that feel increasingly like they might be premonitions...or possibly just anxiety delusions brought on by too much weed. The show only lasted one season, and never quite made it to its own prophesied apocalypse, but it was definitely fun while it lasted, and definitely offers something a bit to the left of the typical dreary end-of-the-world. Stream Now Apocalypse on Tubi.\n\nAt seven seasons, the CW’s YA The 100 is, currently, our most deeply explored TV apocalypse, telling the story of the descendants of refugees of nuclear devastation who return to Earth from their habitat in space—to encounter the remnants of humanity who’d survived on Earth. Naturally, the first people sent to scope things out are the juvenile delinquents (better them than me, honestly), and they discover that three civilizations that have risen up in the aftermath of the apocalypse, and they are all pretty darned scary (including the inevitable cannibals). The show builds an impressive mythology over the course of its run, leading to a conclusion that’s borderline metaphysical. Buy episodes of The 100 from Prime Video.",

    "fullText": "A significant chunk of Chinese copper demand has all but evaporated after the metal’s stunning surge to record levels.\n\nCopper on the London Metal Exchange burst through $13,000 a ton for the first time this week, extending its rally to nearly 50% over the past year. A cocktail of bullish factors could drive prices even higher over the short term. While real-world buyers typically take time to adjust to such sharp increases, what’s notable in this case is the extent to which industrial users in the biggest market are scaling back purchases.\n\nNYC Fights Sale of Bankrupt Rentals After Mamdani Blasts Living Conditions\n\nNew Design Plans Revealed for White House Ballroom\n\nWe Still Don’t Know if Robotaxis Are Safer Than Human Drivers\n\nNew LA Home Designs, Reimagined By Fire\n\nSlowing the Spread of Urban Fires Starts Right Outside the Home\n\n“It is surprising how much price rejection is taking place. The Chinese are just not buying copper, it’s true,” Kostas Bintas, head of metals at trading giant Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., said in an interview. “But it’s finite — at some point you need to buy.”\n\nSluggish physical demand contrasts with the speculative frenzy lifting futures markets, where deep-pocketed funds are responding to tighter global supply, favorable interest rates and an impulse to hedge geopolitical turmoil by stockpiling commodities. The copper contract in Shanghai, which accounts for import costs, topped 100,000 yuan a ton ($14,300) for the first time at the end of December.\n\nChinese industry, though, accounts for half of global copper demand. The fabricators that shape the metal — into wires, sheets and pipes for power cables, circuit boards and plumbing systems — are struggling to pass on their higher costs to factories. As inventories build, the smelters that refine copper in the first instance are trying to export their surplus.\n\nRecord copper prices “had a significant impact in December,” said Hai Jianxun, a sales executive at Henan Yuxing Copper Co. in central China, which makes pipes for items like air-conditioners. “The overall market was very quiet — much quieter than in previous years.”\n\nA Mysteel Global survey covering most suppliers showed that about 60% of the firms making copper rod for electricity transmission, a category that accounts for around half of China’s copper goods, cut or shut production over the month because of mounting costs.\n\nFees to process refined copper into rod fell to zero this week, Mysteel said, the lowest-ever level for the time of the year.\n\nThe subdued activity isn’t an anomaly. Even during the autumn, when demand typically peaks, operating rates across fabricators were at multiyear lows for the season. Ultimately, the market is paying the price of the economy’s lackluster recovery from the pandemic and structurally weaker growth.",

    "description": "One small artifact opened up a world of discovery of a Neolithic civilization with a remarkably advanced social structure.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA stone seal found at the archaeological site of Tadım Fortress in Türkiye reveals how Neolithic people lived 7,500 years ago.\n\nThe seal is thought to possibly have identifying information to mark someone’s property, but alternatively, it could have also been used in agricultural trade.\n\nWhatever it was used for, this artifact is evidence of a civilization whose social structure was much more advanced than previously expected.\n\nWhile monolithic structures that have survived thousands of years may generate the most headlines, it is sometimes the smallest artifacts that can be portals into a civilization that was making social advances long before the Sphinx or the Parthenon towered over the ancient world.\n\nTadım Fortress has been revealing such relics of a surprisingly advanced Neolithic civilization in the Elazim region of eastern Türkiye. A 7,500-year-old stone seal recently unearthed at the site predates the kingdom of Urartu, which is already known for having had complex and organized social structures, but the seal reflects that they had already begun to take shape millennia before the rise of Urartu. Excavations that led to the discovery of the seal and other objects were overseen by the Elazig Museum and the Provincial Directorate of Culture and Tourism, with support from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Elazig Governorship.\n\n“The findings show that the region was not only inhabited since the earliest times, but also developed sophisticated social, economic, and cultural practices that influenced later civilizations,” governor Numan Hatipoğlu told Türkiye Today.\n\nWhat exactly the seal was used for remains unknown, but archaeologists think it might have been a marker of property or ownership. It may have also signified personal identity. This is a rare example of relatively advanced social organization in such an early culture. Investigations as to what it reveals about Neolithic administration, daily life and social activity are ongoing. Archaeological studies in Elazig are part of the preservation efforts of the Turkish Ministry’s Heritage for the Future Project. It is the only stone seal found so far, but another seal locally known as ‘cec damga muhru’ was found to have been used in the trading of grain, reinforcing evidence of a structured society and economy.\n\nThis is not the first groundbreaking find at Tadım Fortress. While it is one of the oldest, buried beneath vessels and other objects left behind by the Byzantine, Roman, Seljuk and Ottoman empires, other artifacts and structures revealed how people lived slightly after the period when the seal was made. A temple that was also recently discovered at the site is now some of the oldest evidence of ritual architecture in the region. Dating to the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age, around 6,000 years ago, it features a stone altar with a ritual blood channel. Cut marks on the altar, along with animal and human remains, suggest blood sacrifice to appease deities. The temple shows that many aspects of life back then were closely tied to religion and ritual.\n\nNear the temple are the remnants of both ceremonial and everyday items, including tools and seal stamps that were likely used for agricultural trade, much like the one found along with the stone seal. There were also idol figurines on four podiums supposedly used for devotional offerings. Possibly the most striking is a hearth meant to keep a holy flame burning. Unique double-headed hearths carved with images of animals had previously been found at Tadım, with a jug beside them that is thought to have once held sacrificial blood or wine. Fire was sacred to many ancient cultures, such as the ancient Greeks and Romans, who associated it with Hestia (also Vesta), goddess of home and hearth.\n\nFindings including the stone seal are now undergoing analysis and preservation at the Elazig Archaeology and Ethnography Museum. Excavations in Tadım are ongoing, and the deeper archaeologists dig, the further back in time they will travel, with objects that have not seen the light of the sun in thousands and thousands of years potentially surfacing as a result.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "All in all it was a pretty miserable night, but there are obvious mitigating factors — this was simply a game too far for a squad that has been stretched beyond its limits by injury and international call-ups.",
    "fullText": "Every once in a while, even at our highest point arguably for decades, Sunderland AFC love to administer a well-timed punch in the gut just to keep everyone on our toes, and Wednesday night’s trip to Brentford was a textbook example.\n\nJust as the post-Christmas cobwebs were almost blown off, the fixture list threw up a second London away game in four days. I deliberated for some time whether to take any leave for this one, either to get to the pub early or to enjoy a post-game lie-in on Thursday, and in the end opted for neither, reasoning that a short trip to the other side of the capital is not a sensible use of paid holiday. At least my future self will be grateful for that, but the present version thinks the past one is a bastard.\n\nAnyway, I was at least able to steal out of the office earlier than usual having started early and headed post-haste to the Rose and Crown in Kew Green where the branch would be congregating. Some of the club’s media team were present to interview some of us about our experiences following the Lads from the capital and predictions for the game. You can have a read of our chairman Matthew’s thoughts here.\n\nShameless plug over, time to focus on the football. Brentford would inevitably present a tough proposition, having surged in December from lower mid-table to sit above us in the league on goal difference. Their in-form forward Igor Thiago clearly took it personally after I removed him from my fantasy league team, smashing in a hat-trick against Everton, but our defence has handled similarly dangerous strikers this season quite well, so we hoped we might manage to keep him quiet.\n\nThe Gtech Community Stadium is of course a new ground for Sunderland, so that on its own was enough of a reason to tempt so many to make the long journey south. It was a short walk from Kew Green across the river to the stadium; this really would be a lovely trip if it weren’t on a freezing midweek night in early January. The stewards wouldn’t have been out of place working in government security, going through everyone’s wallets with a fine-toothed comb, but thankfully we made it to our seats in time for kick-off.\n\nThe compact away end actually made for a great atmosphere – far better than at Spurs on Sunday – as chants from the fans were able to carry across and be picked up much more easily. Brentford played their incredibly unoriginal anthem to the tune of “Hey Jude”, and the Lads kicked off in blue and white attacking the far end. The opening exchanges were relatively even, but then Brentford began to turn the screw, and our defence was split apart far too easily as Thiago rounded Roefs to make it 1-0.\n\nWe made it in at half-time with just a single-goal deficit, and over a pint of London Pride we reasoned that a second-half improvement similar to what we produced at Spurs should see us claim at least a point.\n\nA golden opportunity to level was presented to us after Brobbey did brilliantly to win a penalty, but I was hesitant to celebrate too much given Brentford keeper Kelleher’s excellent record from the spot. In the end Le Fée’s ridiculous Panenka attempt could probably have been saved by anyone from the away end, even those who’d spent four hours on the train with a crate of Cruzcampo. It was a bizarre moment of idiocy from a brilliant player, and we can only hope he learns the requisite lessons from it.\n\nI would argue that it was the manner of the missed penalty rather than the miss itself that spurred Brentford on to such a degree and completely dashed the wind from our sails. The second goal was frankly embarrassing to watch as we were let out of jail initially when the ball hit the crossbar, only for our defence to fail to pick up Thiago again as he headed low into the corner. Brentford’s third was the kind of sloppy goal teams concede when their heads have completely dropped. We huffed and puffed, and a few of last season’s heroes in the shape of Neil and O’Nien were given a run-out, but the game was long since done as a contest.\n\nBack at the packed Express Tavern waiting for the Tube traffic to die down, we were given a brief morale boost as Leeds took the lead at St James’ Park, only for the Mags to overturn the deficit and climb above us in the table for the first time this season.\n\nAll in all it was a pretty miserable night, but there are obvious mitigating factors. This was simply a game too far for a squad that has been stretched beyond its limits by injury and international call-ups. The cup game at the weekend will likely be seen as a chance for mass rotation, and while it is a shame to essentially sacrifice our only slim chance at silverware for the season, it seems to be the only logical approach in the circumstances. This team has bounced back many times before, and with the imminent reinforcements from Africa incoming, you’d back them to do it again.",

    "description": "TikTok told some US staff that they will work for a new global entity that is not a part of the new joint venture run by Oracle and others.",
    "fullText": "TikTok is preparing to carve off parts of its US business, but not all US workers are joining the new entity.\n\nSome US staff were told this week that they will not work for the new joint venture, called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, led by managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. Instead, they will work for a separate TikTok global entity that will remain under ByteDance's ownership, called TT Commerce & Global Services LLC.\n\nThe change, outlined in a memo sent to impacted employees, includes workers who focus on US products that will remain tied to TikTok's global operations after the sale closes. In December, TikTok's CEO Shou Chew told staff those business lines would include \"certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\"\n\nOther US workers, such as those focused on data protection or algorithm security, would work under the USDS Joint Venture entity, according to Chew's memo. He said the deal would close on January 22.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment about the staffing change.\n\nIf the proposed TikTok deal goes through, Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake would each own 15% of the new US joint venture. Affiliates of existing ByteDance investors would get around 30%. Five percent would go to an unnamed group of new investors, and ByteDance would keep just under 20% of the business to comply with the ownership requirements of the US divestment law that sparked the sale.\n\nThe law, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, requires companies based in countries the US has deemed a foreign adversary to divest from their US assets or face hefty fines.\n\nCongress called out TikTok and China-based ByteDance in the law's text. TikTok challenged the law in court but lost its case in a Supreme Court ruling last January.\n\nPresident Donald Trump allowed the app to continue to operate last year via a series of executive orders as his administration worked with TikTok and prospective buyers on a potential deal. In September, the White House announced a deal had been reached, which Vice President JD Vance said would value TikTok US at around $14 billion.",

    "description": "The president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more in a revealing new interview",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said that his only guardrail as he looks to obtain more global power is \"my own morality\"\n\nIn a new interview with The New York Times, he said he doesn't \"need international law\" to dictate his approach to foreign policy\n\nAlso in the interview, the president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more\n\nPresident Donald Trump is making it clear that he won't be constrained by the law as he continues teasing a takeover of the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I don’t need international law,” Trump said in a new interview with The New York Times. “I’m not looking to hurt people.”\n\nWhen pressed further, the president said he understood that his administration would need to abide by international laws. However, he added, \"It depends what your definition of international law is.\"\n\nThere is, Trump insisted, just \"one thing\" that can curtail his desire for global supremacy: \"My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.\"\n\nThe interview comes less than a week after U.S. forces, under Trump's direction, captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, first lady Cilia Flores, amid \"large-scale strikes\" on the capital city of Caracas, and brought them to the U.S. to stand trial on multiple charges related to narco terrorism.\n\nThough Venezuela has installed an interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, Trump has stated many times that the United States is now in charge of running the independent nation.\n\n\"It's going to be run very judiciously, very fairly. And it's gonna make a lot of money,\" he previously said. \"You know they stole our oil. We built that whole industry and they just took it over like we were nothing. So we did something about it. We're late, but we did something about it.\"\n\nHe later added, \"We'll be selling large amounts of oil [from Venezuela] to other countries... We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.\"\n\n\"We're gonna make sure the people of Venezuela are taken care of... You're going to have peace, justice...you're going to have a real country.\"\n\nHe doesn't plan to stop there. The president is also fixated on his desire to annex Greenland, which is currently controlled by Denmark, a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nTrump admitted that \"it may be a choice\" to preserve the country's relationship with NATO versus taking over Greenland, an important trade crossroads between the U.S., Europe, China and Russia.\n\n“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” he said to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 4. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”\n\nTo The New York Times, he insisted that it wasn't enough to have the country controlled by an ally — he wants exclusive, outright ownership.\n\n“Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also has his sights set on Colombia, Cuba, Iran and Mexico.\n\n\"You have to do something with Mexico. Mexico has to get their act together because they're pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something,\" he previously told reporters, referring to drug cartels in the country.\n\n\"We'd love Mexico to do it. They're capable of doing it, but unfortunately, the cartels are very strong in Mexico,\" Trump added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nReferring to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Trump said his country is being \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long.\"\n\nPetro spoke with the Times prior to calling Trump to discuss the threats, expressing his concern about the U.S. making a strike in Colombia, similar to the one in Venezuela.\n\n“We are in danger,” the Colombian president said. “Because the threat is real. It was made by Trump.”",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "Find out who got a 10 and who is facing an uncertain international future with our Ashes player ratings.",
    "fullText": "The Ashes series is over and, once again, it finishes with Australia holding the urn.\n\nEngland did avoid a clean sweep with victory in Melbourne but Australia reasserted their dominance in Sydney this week.\n\nHere we hand out player ratings for the whole series.\n\nZak Crawley – 5 – Averaged 27, which was entirely predictable at the beginning of the series. Did not live up to the billing of a man backed for Australia and should not be guaranteed a place for the home summer.\n\nBen Duckett – 3 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best all-format batters in the world, leaves with career at a crossroads. Did not pass 50, dropped catches and was caught on video in Noosa. Now goes to England's white-ball tours and the Indian Premier League, when a break might be the smart option.\n\nJacob Bethell – 7 – Where has he been? How different might England's tour have turned out had they backed Bethell sooner? Only two Tests, but a vital 40 in Melbourne was followed by a coming-of-age 154 in Sydney. England's new number three.\n\nJoe Root – 7 – Finally ticked off the Test century in Australia and got another in Sydney, but not much else. Still England's best batter at 35 and wants to come back in four years. Where would they be without him?\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Should have been the series when he announced himself as a Test mega-star and instead was one of too many frustrating dismissals. Has a lot on his plate as white-ball captain - is that hindering his development as a Test batter?\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Another England captain to be beaten down under and will not get another chance to win a series here. England's best bowler, below his best with the bat and a poor series tactically. Gets an extra mark for shouldering the burden of the many team-mates that let him down.\n\nJamie Smith – 3 – Like Duckett, arrived as an England banker and leaves with his international future in doubt. Mistakes with the gloves and too many soft dismissals - his shot in Sydney encapsulated England's bone-headed tour. Dropped from the white-ball teams, is a Test axe next?\n\nWill Jacks – 5 – Did what he was asked to do, which was bowl some part-time off-spin and bat at eight - it is just that no-one expected him to do it in four Tests. Would be unfair to judge on a role Jacks isn't really qualified for. When might he play another Test?\n\nBrydon Carse – 6 – A total of 22 wickets for a fast bowler has been bettered only by James Anderson and Ian Botham on England Ashes tours in the past 55 years. The numbers don't quite tell the story of how often he sprayed the ball. Having the durability to play all five Tests says plenty about his character.\n\nMatthew Potts – 1 – Probably harsh, given the hand he was dealt. His sole appearance in Sydney was tough to watch. Mistreated by England - in and out, ignored for a year, then dropped into an Ashes Test. Will surely slip further down the pecking order.\n\nJosh Tongue – 7 – Didn't play until the third Test, then managed to pick up 18 wickets. One of the few England players to leave Australia with his reputation enhanced and should be in the first-choice attack come the summer.\n\nMark Wood – 2 – A Herculean effort to get fit, only for his series to end after bowling 11 overs in the first Test. Will he play for England again?\n\nJofra Archer – 6 – Bowled better than a total of nine wickets would suggest and at times was among England's best batters. Injured after three matches as a reminder (if it was needed) he will need constant managing through the remainder of his Test career.\n\nOllie Pope – 3 – Started with promise, then predictably faded to be rightly dropped after three Tests. Did not repay faith shown in him and should have to work very hard for another chance.\n\nGus Atkinson – 3 – One of the many who wilted in the first two Tests, then hinted at something near his best in the fourth, only to get injured. No longer a guaranteed part of England's first-choice attack.\n\nShoaib Bashir – 0 – Was earmarked for this tour in an experiment of building a spinner from raw materials, then could not get a game in any of the five Tests.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nThe Ashes: Australia beat England in final Test - clips and reaction\n\nJake Weatherald – 4 – Started well with vital cameos in the first two Tests, only to be found out later in the series. An Ashes winner, but possibly not Australia's long-term opener.\n\nTravis Head – 10 – The best three-format batter in the world and a likeable superstar. His elevation to opener altered the course of the series and three hundreds mean the spot is his to keep. This was the Travball Ashes.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne - 5 - Yet to score the runs that fully justify his recall at number three. Gets an extra mark for his catching - he took three stunners. Unclear whether his bowling deserves praise or eradicating from cricket history.\n\nSteve Smith – 7 – Was below his best with the bat until a predictable century in Sydney. Stood-in as captain for Pat Cummins in four Tests, which means he did not have Cummins the bowler at his disposal, yet still engineered an Ashes triumph.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 5 – A strange culmination to his career. Khawaja's Ashes will be remembered for the batting he did not do in Perth, rather than the innings he played everywhere else.\n\nAlex Carey – 9 – One of the greatest exhibitions of glovework ever seen in a Test series and handy runs at number six, including a hometown century in Adelaide. Admitted to not walking in the same knock, setting the wheels in motion for the Snicko revelation. Hit winning runs in Sydney to seal 4-1 series win.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Losing his way after being earmarked as the future face of the Australian team. Injuries are limiting his bowling and a lack of runs have him slipping down the order - possibly to number 12.\n\nBeau Webster – 5 – When he finally got his chance he made the runs that should put pressure on Green's place, then proved how versatile he is with his off-breaks.\n\nMichael Neser – 7 – Out of Test cricket for three years then recalled as injury cover and a pink-ball specialist. Did a fine job as the sort of medium-fast bowler England have shown disdain for.\n\nMitchell Starc – 10 – This series was essentially decided in the first two Tests and Starc was the primary reason Australia won both. Faded slightly towards the end, but at his best gave off Mitchell Johnson 2013-14 vibes - there can be no higher praise.\n\nScott Boland – 7 – Not quite the heights of his debut series four years ago, though did more than enough to banish the demons of a tough 2023 Ashes in England.\n\nBrendan Doggett – 4 – Covered for injuries in the first two Tests and claimed a respectable seven wickets. May never add to his two Test caps, yet is an Ashes winner with a 100% record.\n\nPat Cummins – 6 – Astonishing effort to have played even one Test, given the severity of his back injury. In his sole appearance in Adelaide, Cummins bowled magnificently and was the captain that sealed the Ashes. Will now plot the bid for a holy grail win in 2027.\n\nNathan Lyon – 4 – Was making an impact in Adelaide before being struck by another injury. Will want to be part of 2027 Ashes, but surely there will be questions over his fitness and the role of spin in England.\n\nJosh Inglis – 3 – Australia won the two Tests he played, even if he did not take his chance. May get another opportunity as a result of Khawaja's retirement, or could fall down the pecking order.\n\nJhye Richardson – 2 – Like Wood, deserves huge credit for coming back from injuries to play Test cricket, albeit for one match and 9.2 overs. Should get another chance.\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win",

    "fullText": "Red Sox predicted to sign $150M World Series Champion, Gold Glove winner after Rafael Devers fiasco originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox signed Alex Bregman last offseason, but the deal included opt-outs. After the conclusion of the 2025 season, it became clear that Bregman would hit the free-agent market after just one season in Boston.\n\n“Alex Bregman plans to opt out of his contract with the Boston Red Sox, a source told ESPN on Tuesday night, confirming a New York Post report. The move was expected and doesn't rule out the veteran third baseman returning to Boston, but for now, he will be part of the free agent class for a second straight offseason,” ESPN reported.\n\nThe Red Sox are optimistic about their chances of bringing Bregman back, but the Philadelphia Phillies could also be in the mix.\n\n“If the Phillies were to move Bohm, in my judgment, it would have to be because they think there's a chance of getting a Bregman or they're one of the teams potentially that could look at a Bo Bichette at a spot that's not shortstop,\" MLB insider Jon Morosi said. \"There's different ways they could augment their club, but you would have to have a clear upgrade on Bohm if you're gonna go ahead and make that trade.\"\n\nSports Illustrated’s Will Laws believes the Red Sox will ultimately get the job done and re-sign Bregman.\n\n“Bregman opted out of his contract just one year into his three-year, $120 million deal in Boston. A quad injury cost him about a month-and-a-half in the middle of the year, but he was otherwise productive at the plate after a relatively down 2024 campaign. Bregman’s approach is sound, with minimal swing-and-miss and a good command of the strike zone, and his defense remains at least solid at the hot corner, so it seems likely he’ll get four- or five-year offers from teams this time around. Bregman assumed a leadership role last year with the Red Sox, who appear motivated to sign a star infielder,” Laws wrote.\n\nThe Red Sox would love to have Bregman back, particularly for the experience and leadership he provides. Boston made the playoffs last year and believes it can repeat that success.\n\nBringing Bregman back would also generate excitement around the city. With Spring Training just a month away, expect the Red Sox to move quickly to work out a deal.",

In every transfer window, billions are now being exchanged between clubs around the world.\n\nThis is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. The football portal 'CIES Football' has calculated, based on several factors, how much the most valuable stars in the world are currently worth when considering age, contract duration, etc.\n\n📷 Screenshot from CIES Football\n\nAccording to the football portal, Lamine Yamal tops the list with a market value of a whopping 343 million euros, followed by the usual suspects like Haaland, Mbappé, and Bellingham. In fifth place is Michael Olise, the highest Bundesliga star.\n\nWhile Florian Wirtz is considered the most valuable German player according to 'CIES Football', Nick Woltemade, after a strong first half of the season, is also high up in the rankings.\n\nNow it's your turn: Were you surprised by the calculated market values?

    "description": "Can Italy make it happen?",
    "fullText": "It’s early January in Boston. Every day, or so it seems, there is the dreaded wintery of sleet/snow/rain/ice and of course wind. But over the next month there will be more and more stories about guys “in the best shape of his life” and heading to Florida for Spring Training. And as soon as those stories finish we’ll be looking at high-level baseball sooner than you think: the World Baseball Classic runs from March 5th to 17th. Representing teams across the globe, the Red Sox will be represented. According to Chris Cotillo these are the likely participants, although there is some flux.\n\nAroldis Chapman has been included on Great Britain’s preliminary roster but does not appear to be a final candidate yet according to the MLB players listed. Neither do Rafaela, Abreu, or Morán seem to be included on that list. But there are players being announced as additions every day so this may still change.\n\nBut one player has me more interested than other: Roman Anthony.\n\nLast week on the Foul Territory show at about 1:43:16, Kansas City Royals first baseman Vinnie Pasquantino and member of Team Italy admitted to having something of a white whale in recruiting for the WBC: Roman Anthony.\n\nAnd why wouldn’t he? Anthony was only worth 3.1 bWAR in 71 games in 2025 while basically posting the dream .300/.400/.500 slash line of .292/.396/.463. Pasquantino’s entire career, 424 games over 4 years with some injuries, has been 4.9 bWAR. Granted 2025 is 2.4 of that over a span of 160 games so he’s no slouch himself. But Anthony is his prize.\n\nYes, Roman, from Florida, can play for Team USA. But why would you want to?\n\nYou know who doesn’t have an endless supply of guys? Especially high-end outfielders? Italy!\n\nThe average of the projections currently on FanGraphs predict a slash line of .263/.358/.437 with around 20 home runs this year. And about a 3.0 WAR season. Projection systems, of course, feed on prior data which at the major league level Anthony just doesn’t have much of but even if you think that’s his max for a sophomore season guaranteed a starting job and signed for most of the next decade that’s looking pretty good!\n\nWhich, if this is his floor, is all the more reason for Vinnie and Team Italy to make their move now. He literally might not be available for the next WBC because if he looks as good as he did over the summer of 2025, MLB and whoever succeeds Rob Manfred isn’t going to want that guy playing for Italy. They’re fine with lower tier players (Sorry Pasquach) representing an ancestral homeland but not superstars.\n\nIf there is ever a time for Italy to scoop him up it’s now. 2026. Just imagine the face of Team Italy: Roman Anthony.\n\nNow if they can only do something about that hat design…",

    "fullText": "Kim Farrell, TikTok's global head of creators, is leaving the company, Business Insider has learned.\n\nFarrell joined TikTok nearly six years ago, starting on the company's Latin America marketing team before shifting to its operations division and later taking over as global creator lead in late 2023. In December, she helped organize TikTok's first awards show for creators at the Hollywood Palladium theater in Los Angeles. Prior to TikTok, Farrell worked in marketing at Booking.com and Google.\n\nHer departure was announced internally on Wednesday, as the company informed staff that it was reorganizing its content division, which includes employees who work with creators, publishers, and other content partners. As part of the reorg, the company is merging its creator and publisher teams into one and letting go of 20 US staffers and some other roles globally. Business Insider was unable to learn the full count of global job cuts.\n\n\"We are realigning our global content operations team as we continue to accelerate the growth of high-quality content and key content verticals,\" a TikTok spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nMedia publisher Status earlier reported on the layoffs.\n\nFarrell's exit follows a string of executive shake-ups and reorgs across TikTok over the past year and a half.\n\nTikTok Shop US operations lead Nico Le Bourgeois left the company in May. Blake Chandlee, TikTok's advertising leader, stepped down in March as part of a reorg that put the sales team under the oversight of its global monetization product technology division. TikTok's global head of marketing, Kate Jhaveri, left the company in September 2024. Some of the company's reorgs have shifted power away from local leaders toward executives based in China or Singapore, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nTikTok's content team reorg comes at a moment of flux for the video platform.\n\nCEO Shou Chew told workers in December that it plans to spin off parts of its US business in a joint venture with an investor group that includes tech company Oracle and investment firms Silver Lake and MGX. The new entity will have oversight over some aspects of the business like data security, but key business lines like e-commerce and advertising will remain under TikTok's global owner, ByteDance, according to Chew's memo. The US product is supposed to remain interoperable with the rest of the world.\n\nThe deal is expected to close later this month, Chew said in the memo.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOle Miss football games are soundtracked by a familiar refrain.\n\nBetween touchdowns, canons and cheers exists a six-line sonnet that has proven especially memorable in Oxford, Miss.\n\nHotty Toddy has been a steady part of the Rebels' game day routine for the better part of a century. The chant is a rhythmic one, filled with whimsy, intensity and camaraderie like few other war cries in the nation.\n\nSo, just what does Hotty Toddy mean? The Sporting News gives you the inside scoop on all things related to Ole Miss' signature phrase.\n\nMORE: How Trinidad Chambliss went from Ferris State to Ole Miss stardom\n\nDubbed the \"unified holler of Ole Miss fans\" by the Magnolia Tribune in 2024, Hotty Toddy is the Rebels' beloved rallying cry. Its origins are mysterious, having first been published in Ole Miss student newspaper The Mississippian (now known as The Daily Mississippian) in 1926.\n\nIt's something of a mating call amongst Rebels enthusiasts, a classic call-and-response chant that exists in a similar space to other famed slogans like Mississippi State's \"Hail State\" and Alabama's \"Rammer Jammer.\" The chant itself is always preceded by a simple query: \"Are You Ready?!\"\n\nMORE: Lane Kiffin's timeline of teams coached and career record\n\nThe ensuing dialogue flows like honey, each word growing more memorable than the last.\n\nThe Hotty Toddy lyrics are as follows:\n\nHotty Toddy is undoubtedly a full-body experience. It grasps at three different senses at once. Those who deliver the chant don't merely see and hear it. They feel the rhythm, too, courtesy of a hand gesture. Most fans who utter the phrase do so while pulling off the landshark or \"Fins Up\", a simple signal which sees users point their hand sideways and bring it up to their head to mimic a shark's fin underneath waves.\n\nThe gesture began in 2008 when then-linebacker threw it up after corralling then-Rebels quarterback Jevan Snead multiple times during a summer practice.\n\nMORE: Where is Trinidad Chambliss from?\n\n\"Fins Up\" was born, a tradition that has paired harmoniously with the Hotty Toddy chant over the years.\n\nIt's unclear why the Rebels have grown so fond of Hotty Toddy. Its meaning is muddled, with different Ole Miss supporters delivering different definitions of the term.\n\nSome think it's a play on the phrase hoity-toity, perhaps a reference to the high-brow nature of tailgating typically present at Vaught Hemingway Stadium, the Rebels' home ground.\n\nMORE:How Ole Miss-Mississippi State rivalry got Egg Bowl name\n\nThere's also the case of the Hot Toddy, a tea-like cocktail that tends to feature hot water, lemon, honey and your choice of dark liquor. Some believe the chant is a nod to the famous spirit. It's quite possible that Rebels enthusiasts delivering the phrase do so as liquid courage seeps into their bellies.\n\nThere is some evidence that the phrase is derived from World War I-era banter. Still, all roads to the tagline's origins are shrouded in dust and fog. One thing is for certain, though: Ole Miss students have no interest in retiring the chant any time soon.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the first published use of Hotty Toddy took place in the mid-1920s. It is likely that the phrase was around for some time before then.\n\nMORE:11 most expensive coach buyouts in college football history\n\nThe cheer was initially known as \"Heighty Tighty\", with its lyrics slightly altered compared to its present-day version. Here's a look at the chant in its initial form, per Magnolia Tribune.\n\nHell, yeah! Damn right! \nHeighty Tighty, Gosh Almighty,\nWho The Hell Are We? Hey!\nFlim Flam, Bim Bam\nOle Miss By Damn!\n\nThe hot toddy is not believed to be related to the Ole Miss chant. However, the warm alcoholic beverage is a favorite of fans at The Grove and figures to feature prominently in the fanbase's pregame rituals, particularly when temperatures drop.",

He also said AI agents, of which McKinsey has 25,000, excel at generating charts and that they've made 2.5 million of them in the past six months.\n\nWith agents taking over some of that work, he said consultants are now \"moving up the stack\" and tackling \"more complicated problems.\"\n\nGiven those changes, Sternfels said McKinsey looked at which skills new graduates will need in an AI-infused world from the perspective of large employers. He identified three: the ability to aspire, judgment, and true creativity.\n\n\"What can the models not do? Aspire. Set the right aspiration,\" he said. \"Do you go to low Earth orbit? Do you go to the moon? Do you go to Mars? That's a uniquely human capability.\"\n\nSternfels said you should look to build skills around aspiring and getting others to believe in those aspirations.\n\n\"There's no right and wrong in these models, and so how do you set the right parameters?\" he said, adding humans can build the skills to set the architecture based on factors like firm values and societal norms.\n\n\"The models are inference models — the next most likely step,\" Sternfels said.\n\nHumans, on the other hand, have an edge when it comes to \"orthogonal\" work, or the ability to think outside existing patterns and land on an entirely new approach.\n\nSternfels said AI adoption is also changing how companies look for talent, adding that where someone went to school should matter a lot less.\n\nFor someone with a tech background, he said, instead of looking at where they graduated from, prospective employers should look at their GitHub, a site engineers use to showcase their work.\n\n\"Let's actually get to the content,\" he said, \"and could that actually start meaning that a wider set of people can enter the workforce with different pathways?\"",

    "description": "Find out who got a 10 and who is facing an uncertain international future with our Ashes player ratings.",
    "fullText": "The Ashes series is over and, once again, it finishes with Australia holding the urn.\n\nEngland did avoid a clean sweep with victory in Melbourne but Australia reasserted their dominance in Sydney this week.\n\nHere we hand out player ratings for the whole series.\n\nZak Crawley – 5 – Averaged 27, which was entirely predictable at the beginning of the series. Did not live up to the billing of a man backed for Australia and should not be guaranteed a place for the home summer.\n\nBen Duckett – 3 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best all-format batters in the world, leaves with career at a crossroads. Did not pass 50, dropped catches and was caught on video in Noosa. Now goes to England's white-ball tours and the Indian Premier League, when a break might be the smart option.\n\nJacob Bethell – 7 – Where has he been? How different might England's tour have turned out had they backed Bethell sooner? Only two Tests, but a vital 40 in Melbourne was followed by a coming-of-age 154 in Sydney. England's new number three.\n\nJoe Root – 7 – Finally ticked off the Test century in Australia and got another in Sydney, but not much else. Still England's best batter at 35 and wants to come back in four years. Where would they be without him?\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Should have been the series when he announced himself as a Test mega-star and instead was one of too many frustrating dismissals. Has a lot on his plate as white-ball captain - is that hindering his development as a Test batter?\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Another England captain to be beaten down under and will not get another chance to win a series here. England's best bowler, below his best with the bat and a poor series tactically. Gets an extra mark for shouldering the burden of the many team-mates that let him down.\n\nJamie Smith – 3 – Like Duckett, arrived as an England banker and leaves with his international future in doubt. Mistakes with the gloves and too many soft dismissals - his shot in Sydney encapsulated England's bone-headed tour. Dropped from the white-ball teams, is a Test axe next?\n\nWill Jacks – 5 – Did what he was asked to do, which was bowl some part-time off-spin and bat at eight - it is just that no-one expected him to do it in four Tests. Would be unfair to judge on a role Jacks isn't really qualified for. When might he play another Test?\n\nBrydon Carse – 6 – A total of 22 wickets for a fast bowler has been bettered only by James Anderson and Ian Botham on England Ashes tours in the past 55 years. The numbers don't quite tell the story of how often he sprayed the ball. Having the durability to play all five Tests says plenty about his character.\n\nMatthew Potts – 1 – Probably harsh, given the hand he was dealt. His sole appearance in Sydney was tough to watch. Mistreated by England - in and out, ignored for a year, then dropped into an Ashes Test. Will surely slip further down the pecking order.\n\nJosh Tongue – 7 – Didn't play until the third Test, then managed to pick up 18 wickets. One of the few England players to leave Australia with his reputation enhanced and should be in the first-choice attack come the summer.\n\nMark Wood – 2 – A Herculean effort to get fit, only for his series to end after bowling 11 overs in the first Test. Will he play for England again?\n\nJofra Archer – 6 – Bowled better than a total of nine wickets would suggest and at times was among England's best batters. Injured after three matches as a reminder (if it was needed) he will need constant managing through the remainder of his Test career.\n\nOllie Pope – 3 – Started with promise, then predictably faded to be rightly dropped after three Tests. Did not repay faith shown in him and should have to work very hard for another chance.\n\nGus Atkinson – 3 – One of the many who wilted in the first two Tests, then hinted at something near his best in the fourth, only to get injured. No longer a guaranteed part of England's first-choice attack.\n\nShoaib Bashir – 0 – Was earmarked for this tour in an experiment of building a spinner from raw materials, then could not get a game in any of the five Tests.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nThe Ashes: Australia beat England in final Test - clips and reaction\n\nJake Weatherald – 4 – Started well with vital cameos in the first two Tests, only to be found out later in the series. An Ashes winner, but possibly not Australia's long-term opener.\n\nTravis Head – 10 – The best three-format batter in the world and a likeable superstar. His elevation to opener altered the course of the series and three hundreds mean the spot is his to keep. This was the Travball Ashes.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne - 5 - Yet to score the runs that fully justify his recall at number three. Gets an extra mark for his catching - he took three stunners. Unclear whether his bowling deserves praise or eradicating from cricket history.\n\nSteve Smith – 7 – Was below his best with the bat until a predictable century in Sydney. Stood-in as captain for Pat Cummins in four Tests, which means he did not have Cummins the bowler at his disposal, yet still engineered an Ashes triumph.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 5 – A strange culmination to his career. Khawaja's Ashes will be remembered for the batting he did not do in Perth, rather than the innings he played everywhere else.\n\nAlex Carey – 9 – One of the greatest exhibitions of glovework ever seen in a Test series and handy runs at number six, including a hometown century in Adelaide. Admitted to not walking in the same knock, setting the wheels in motion for the Snicko revelation. Hit winning runs in Sydney to seal 4-1 series win.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Losing his way after being earmarked as the future face of the Australian team. Injuries are limiting his bowling and a lack of runs have him slipping down the order - possibly to number 12.\n\nBeau Webster – 5 – When he finally got his chance he made the runs that should put pressure on Green's place, then proved how versatile he is with his off-breaks.\n\nMichael Neser – 7 – Out of Test cricket for three years then recalled as injury cover and a pink-ball specialist. Did a fine job as the sort of medium-fast bowler England have shown disdain for.\n\nMitchell Starc – 10 – This series was essentially decided in the first two Tests and Starc was the primary reason Australia won both. Faded slightly towards the end, but at his best gave off Mitchell Johnson 2013-14 vibes - there can be no higher praise.\n\nScott Boland – 7 – Not quite the heights of his debut series four years ago, though did more than enough to banish the demons of a tough 2023 Ashes in England.\n\nBrendan Doggett – 4 – Covered for injuries in the first two Tests and claimed a respectable seven wickets. May never add to his two Test caps, yet is an Ashes winner with a 100% record.\n\nPat Cummins – 6 – Astonishing effort to have played even one Test, given the severity of his back injury. In his sole appearance in Adelaide, Cummins bowled magnificently and was the captain that sealed the Ashes. Will now plot the bid for a holy grail win in 2027.\n\nNathan Lyon – 4 – Was making an impact in Adelaide before being struck by another injury. Will want to be part of 2027 Ashes, but surely there will be questions over his fitness and the role of spin in England.\n\nJosh Inglis – 3 – Australia won the two Tests he played, even if he did not take his chance. May get another opportunity as a result of Khawaja's retirement, or could fall down the pecking order.\n\nJhye Richardson – 2 – Like Wood, deserves huge credit for coming back from injuries to play Test cricket, albeit for one match and 9.2 overs. Should get another chance.\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win",

    "description": "If true, the claim could significantly reshape the global bitcoin market.",
    "fullText": "When Bitcoin first launched in 2009, many investors dismissed the currency as a fringe concept and even as a scam. (Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s former right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, memorably called it “stupid and evil.”) But the asset has skyrocketed in value in recent years and President Donald Trump labeled the currency “digital gold” after signing an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last January. Now, reports allege that Venezuela has bought into that “digital gold,” holding a “shadow reserve” nearly double that of the U.S.\n\nDigital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold an estimated $60 billion worth of Bitcoin. Additional intelligence reports allege that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his associates accrued Bitcoin via three channels: a gold swap overseen by Venezuelan Interior Minister Alex Saab in 2018, oil revenue priced in Bitcoin, and by seizing crypto mining equipment from miners in the country.\n\nSanctions have walled off the country’s access to financial markets for years, and experts allege that they may have motivated Venezuelan leaders to invest in cryptocurrencies to sidestep the barrier.\n\nBitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela’s holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth nearly $22 million. The website sourced the data from a 2022 Forbes article that cited research from a blockchain analytics firm. The total is a far cry from the estimated U.S. holdings of 328,372, currently worth $30 billion, though the claim positions Venezuela’s holdings at nearly double the U.S. and one of the biggest holders of bitcoin globally.\n\nThe claims of Venezuela’s shadow Bitcoin holdings have predictably garnered skeptics, including digital asset financial services company Ledn Co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, who grew up in Venezuela and whose family has mined crypto there since 2014.\n\nDi Bartolomeo finds no credibility in any of the three alleged sources of bitcoin income: the gold swap, oil exchange or mining equipment seizures. “This to me does not align with anything in the public record,” di Bartolomeo told Fortune. “There’s so much corruption, embezzlement and missing money that I don’t believe that any meaningful amount would have accrued.”\n\nHe outlined his full argument in a Coindesk op-ed piece titled “Don’t hold your breath for Venezuela’s bitcoin.” Though he notes that his family’s crypto mining materials were seized by the government in 2018 and returned five years later in a worn down condition, signaling heavy use of the equipment.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "title": "Newest Nuclear Sub Arrives For The US Navy With A Historic WW2 Namesake",
    "description": "The U.S. Navy has some of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Its newest addition is named after an important World War II ship.",
    "fullText": "The United States Navy has the largest fleet of nuclear submarines on the planet, and it just added a new one to the inventory. This new fifth generation submarine is an incredible machine, and it was named in honor of one of World War II's biggest and best vessels. On December 15, 2025, the U.S. Navy took ownership of the USS Idaho (SSN-799). The ship was named to carry on the honor of the battleship USS Idaho (BB-42), which was first commissioned in 1919 and went on to be awarded seven battle stars during WWII.\n\nThe new Idaho is the 26th Virginia-class boat. The ship is the fifth U.S. Navy vessel to carry the name \"Idaho. The first was a wooden steam sloop that was turned into a full-rigged sailing ship commissioned in 1866. The second was the BB-24, a Mississippi-class battleship. During World War I, motorboat SP-545 also carried the name before \"Idaho\" was transferred to a New Mexico-class battleship of WWII. That warship was known as \"The Big Spud\" for the state's most famous crop.\n\nIt's common for the U.S. Navy to reuse ship names in honor of historical vessels. The most well-known example is probably the USS Enterprise, as there have been nine thusly-named vessels, three of which are aircraft carriers. The new USS Idaho will undergo a series of sea trials prior to its official commissioning, which will likely take place sometime in the spring of 2026. In the meantime, dedicated submariners will get to know the boat, which is expected to help strengthen the nation's undersea warfare capabilities.\n\nThe USS Idaho (SSN-799) is one of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Virginia-class subs are designated to be attack platforms with the capability to launch cruise missiles. They're used primarily for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering, and they can operate in blue-water oceans as well as in littoral areas along coastlines. The class is slowly replacing the cruise-missile variant of the Ohio class and other nuclear submarines in the Los Angeles class.\n\nAs of this writing, three Virginia-class boats are earmarked for the Royal Australian Navy, while the rest remain with the U.S. Navy. The USS Idaho measures 377 feet long with a displacement of 10,200 tons of seawater when submerged. The boat utilizes an S9G reactor alongside an auxiliary diesel engine and has a maximum speed of around 29 mph. Like other vessels of its class, the Idaho will be home to 128 enlisted personnel and 17 officers.\n\nBecause the boat is powered by nuclear energy, it has virtually an unlimited range and will likely remain in service for at least 40 years. In terms of armament, the USS Idaho features two Virginia Payload Tubes and four additional payload tubes capable of firing the BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile. Additionally, it features four 21-inch torpedo tubes to fire the U.S. Navy's MK-48 heavy torpedo.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "\"I want to properly understand.\"",
    "fullText": "Tens of thousands of years ago, a new study suggests, a warming event led to the release of carbon dioxide from deep in the Southern Ocean. Now, scientists say, these findings could shed light on the potential fallout from continued warming in the Antarctic.\n\nLed by scientists at the Laoshan Laboratory in Qingdao, China, and Germany's GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, the study looked at sediment cores from the Southern Ocean to understand the behavior of Antarctic Bottom Water, or AABW.\n\n​​\"We wanted to understand how the influence of Antarctic Bottom Water, the coldest and densest water mass in the global ocean, changed during the last deglaciation, and what role it played in the global carbon cycle,\" said Huang Huang, who led the study, in a GEOMAR press release.\n\nThe researchers' findings, published recently in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggest that AABW expansion helped bring the last Ice Age to an end.\n\n\"As the planet warmed and the ice sheets melted between about 18,000 and 10,000 years ago, the volume of Antarctic Bottom Water expanded in two distinct phases,\" according to the release.\n\n\"These phases coincided with known warming events in Antarctica. As vertical mixing in the Southern Ocean increased, the carbon that had been stored in the deep ocean was able to return to the atmosphere.\"\n\nThe research team found that the deepest waters stayed fairly stagnant and out of touch with shallower waters until the Earth began to warm. When the water was stirred up by the expansion created by the warming of the planet, carbon stores were released into the Earth's atmosphere, forcing temperatures higher.\n\nThe team's study goes back tens of thousands of years and thousands of meters down into the ocean. But its insights could be relevant today and on land where countless communities are vulnerable to the impacts of rising global temperatures.\n\n\"Comparisons with the past are always imperfect, but ultimately it comes down to how much energy is in the system,\" said GEOMAR geochemist Marcus Gutjahr, per the release. \"If we understand how the ocean responded to warming in the past, we can better grasp what is happening today as Antarctic ice shelves continue to melt.\"\n\nDeep Southern Ocean waters have warmed faster than most others in the past half-century. If the warming waters and thawing ice repeat the patterns of the past, huge amounts of carbon could be released into the atmosphere again and contribute to subsequent temperature rise.\n\nShould we be pouring money into nuclear fusion technology?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"I want to properly understand the modern ocean in order to interpret signals from the past,\" Gutjahr said. \"If we can trace how Antarctic Bottom Water has changed over the last few thousand years, we can assess more accurately how rapidly the Antarctic Ice Sheet may continue to lose mass in the future.\"\n\nOther studies have shown that sea ice levels have dropped alarmingly over the last 50 years.\n\nAdvances in this field could help world leaders and global organizations prepare for the potentially catastrophic consequences of continued planetary warming. Evidence about the threats of sea level rise, food system disruptions, and disease spread can inform adaptation strategies.\n\nBut such alarming findings could also help stir meaningful public action now to mitigate rising temperatures, such as transitioning to cleaner home energy systems and transportation options.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Eredivisie giants Ajax are considering a winter loan move for Manchester United midfielder Manuel Ugarte, according to Voetbal International.​\n\nUgarte joined United from Paris Saint-Germain for around €50 million in the summer of 2024, but struggled for a consistent starting role in England.\n\nHe has started only six of United’s twenty Premier League matches this season, a limited role that has pushed him to seek more regular minutes.\n\nWhile Ugarte is open to moving to Amsterdam on a temporary basis, his salary remains a stumbling block given Ajax’s current wage structure.\n\nAny loan deal would therefore have to be with Manchester United continuing to cover a significant portion of his wages, and this will require tough negotiations between the clubs.\n\nUgarte is contracted to United until 2029 and is also attracting interest from other clubs, including Turkish giants Galatasaray, which means Ajax will face competition if talks progress.​\n\nAjax are in the market for a defensive midfielder, and while Ugarte is considered a serious short-term option, the Eredivisie giants are also keeping an eye on long-term solutions.\n\nMeanwhile, alongside Ugarte, Daley Blind is also viewed as another potential addition.\n\nWith Blind’s Girona contract expiring in the summer, any January transfer will be expected to come at a modest fee.\n\nAjax see the Dutch veteran as a cost-effective option who could contribute on the pitch and later transition into a mentoring or off-field role in Amsterdam.​\n\nAfter a horrid spell between September 30 and November 25, when Ajax won just one of 10 matches across all competitions, De Godenzonen have won six and drawn one of their subsequent seven games.\n\nHowever, they remain a whopping 16 points shy of PSV Eindhoven in the title race.",

    "fullText": "After a series of speculations, Barcelona have finally made a breakthrough in the deal to sign Joao Cancelo.\n\nThe Portuguese international is set to join Barcelona on a short-term loan deal worth €5 million, as confirmed by Fabrizio Romano.\n\nThe Catalans are planning to announce the Cancelo deal later this week, having reached an agreement with Al Hilal.\n\nFurther confirmation of Cancelo’s move to Barcelona came from Al Hilal coach Simone Inzaghi today.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the team’s upcoming game against Al Hazm, the Italian coach confirmed Cancelo is not in his plans anymore and that the club are working on resolving his future.\n\n“Cancelo is not in our plans and the club is working on it,” said Inzaghi (h/t Mundo Deportivo).\n\nThis is yet another indicator that the former Juventus star is indeed rejoining Barcelona, and the deal could be finalised soon.\n\nCancelo will soon be on his way to Barcelona. (Photo by Octavio Passos/Getty Images)\n\nInterestingly, Inzaghi’s former team, Inter Milan, were interested in the services of Cancelo as well and had even reached an agreement with Al Hilal. But the player had his heart set on a return to Barcelona.\n\nCancelo, in fact, has big plans upon his impending return to Barcelona, as he wants to stay at Camp Nou beyond the end of the season.\n\nSuch a move would depend on Barcelona’s relationship with Al Hilal, who have shown interest in signing Raphinha and have already tabled a bid worth €100 million.\n\nA potential Al Hilal move for Raphinha would certainly pave the way for the Saudi giants to release Cancelo.\n\nHowever, such a deal would depend entirely on the Brazilian international, who will be allowed to move on due to a gentleman’s agreement between him and Deco.",

FlashInfer-Bench addresses this gap by establishing a standardized, closed-loop framework that connects kernel generation, benchmarking, and deployment. At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM. Using FlashInfer-Bench, we further evaluate the performance and limitations of LLM agents, compare the trade-offs among different GPU programming languages, and provide insights for future agent design.",

    "title": "The college-to-office path is dead: CEO of the world’s biggest recruiter says Gen Z grads need to consider trade and hospitality jobs that don’t even require degrees",
    "description": "Struggling Gen Z and millennial grads should consider turning their back on their degrees and retraining to become hospitality and trade workers, Randstad’s CEO warns.",
    "fullText": "Millions of Gen Zers are facing unemployment as entry-level office roles get absorbed by AI, and millennials are regretting taking out thousands in student loans for careers that now have significantly diminished prospects. Now, the CEO of the world’s biggest talent company, Randstad, has confirmed what many young grads are already fearing: The traditional college-to-office pipeline is dead.\n\n“People need to reflect on—taking a student loan, going to college and being trained or educated for a profession that is rapidly changing—whether that’s still the right path,” Sander van ’t Noordende, the global CEO of Randstad, told Fortune.\n\n“We all grew up, with our parents saying, ‘go do something in college or university and then do something in an office,’ that path that used to work for a long time is starting to break,” he added.\n\n“You already see that with the graduates finding it harder to find a job. You see that in professions like marketing, communications, design… just look at how good AI already is at some of that.”\n\nUnder his helm, the staffing company places around half a million workers in jobs every week—and he has bad news for those who have already forked out thousands for their degree in the hopes of nabbing a cushy office role: You may have more luck landing bartending, barista, or building jobs.\n\nTech leaders have consistently warned that AI is already as good as entry-level workers and that it could halve white-collar jobs by 2030. In fact, a “first-of-its-kind” Stanford University study has warned that the new technology is already having “significant and disproportionate impact” on Gen Z. Bartenders and baristas are even seeing bigger pay raises than desk workers, right now.\n\n“Jobs will change—and are changing—but also new jobs will emerge,” van ’t Noordende echoed. “There is a massive demand in skilled trades, mechanical engineers, machine operators, maintenance engineers, forklift drivers, truck drivers—you name it.”\n\nWith the white-collar job market seemingly frozen, van ’t Noordende said it’s no longer “good advice” to tell young people to follow their passions.\n\n“No, learn a craft or a trade or a skill or a profession, where you can make a good living and provide for you and your family, is much better advice than follow your passion.”\n\nFurther making his case: The U.K. government has just announced it’ll be splurging $965 million into apprenticeships to help place tens of thousands of unemployed young people into the jobs that they think are the future—and they’re all in hospitality, retail, and AI.\n\nBut for those hell-bent on going to college, van ’t Noordende stressed that STEM subjects—which are studied in China at twice the rate of the U.S. and parts of Europe—will likely remain in demand.\n\nAnd his advice to those who’ve already wasted time and money on a degree that’s dwindling in relevance? “Retrain. Learning new skills always good.”\n\n“Look around you, and where you see the opportunities that match with your skills and your background and go there,” van ’t Noordende added. But he warned that at some point, you may just “have to bite the bullet and say, ‘Okay, this is not working.’”\n\nThe CEO stressed that you’re not alone; many people are currently doing exactly that. And that ultimately, going from a desk job to becoming a plumber, teacher, or nurse, van ’t Noordende says, requires a mindset shift. It’s not a failure if you end up doing work outside your field of study—it’s just adjusting to what actually works. “You have to come off your chair and build skills,” he added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The industries’ reciprocally influential relationship can be to everyone’s gain\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nIt had begun to feel like an endurance test by the end, but nonetheless, like the sucker I am, I watched the Stranger Things finale last week. And spoiler warning: I’m going to talk about it in general terms in this newsletter. Because approximately 80% of the final season comprised twentysomething “teenagers” explaining things to each other while using random 1980s objects to illustrate convoluted plans and plot points, my expectations were not high. After an interminable hour, finally, something fun happens, as the not-kids arm themselves with machine guns and molotovs and face off against a monstrously gigantic demon-crab. Aha, I thought – the final boss battle!\n\nThe fight was like something out of Monster Hunter, all scale and spectacle with a touch of desperation. For a very long time, video games sought to imitate cinema. Now cinema (and TV) often feels like a video game. The structure of Stranger Things’ final season reminded me a lot of Resident Evil: long periods of walking slowly through corridors, with characters exchanging plot information aloud on their way to the action, and occasional explosions of gunfire, screeching monsters or car chases. Those long periods of relative inaction are much more tolerable when you’ve got a controller in your hands. I am all for TV and film embracing the excitement, spectacle and dynamism of video games, but do they have to embrace the unnecessary side-quests and open-world bloat, too?\n\nThe reciprocally influential relationship between games, TV and film has developed a lot in the last few years. A generation of gen X and elder-millennial gamers have recently aged into creative and commissioning power in these industries. That’s why we’re getting people such as Jonathan Nolan heading up an excellent Fallout TV show, and indeed why all video-game-to-screen adaptations have become dramatically less terrible in the past five years or so. It also inevitably means that the boundaries between interactive and non-interactive entertainment are becoming more porous: where previously game-makers were heavily influenced by film (primarily but not exclusively Alien/s and Star Wars), now that relationship works both ways. Most Marvel movies look and feel like a video game to me, and not just because they’re all full of computer-generated graphics. It’s the mood and pace of them.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow remains the most video-game-ish movie I’ve ever seen: its premise revolves around dying and respawning, trying out different things on each run. It’s a sci-fi roguelike of a film. I wanted to play Mad Max: Fury Road the entire time I was watching it, and John Wick 4 was literally a fighting-game boss rush. When film critics say that a film feels like a video game, they often mean it disparagingly; a lot of cinephiles still see games as the lower form. When I say a movie feels like a video game, it’s a compliment – unless it feels like a boring video game.\n\nThis was the problem, for me, with Stranger Things: every episode felt like loading up an open-world game that I hadn’t played for a few months. More and more characters kept appearing, and I didn’t remember or care who most of them were. Between the Upside Down, Vecna’s mindscape, real-world Hawkins and an entirely new dimension introduced in the last couple of episodes, there were too many locations to keep track of. Every episode brought on the mild despair I feel when I think I’m near the end of an overlong game, only to discover yet another entirely new area to explore. The painfully long epilogue, meanwhile, was rivalled only by Red Dead Redemption 2’s interminable post-game hours. Please, just let it end already!\n\nOf course, in modern pop culture, nothing is ever allowed to end properly, not if it’s still making money. I’m surprised there’s been no word of an official Stranger Things video game tie-in (outside of a retro-style smartphone beat-em-up from 2019). Come to think of it, we don’t see many of these kinds of licensed games any more: back in the 00s and 2010s, most major movies and TV shows launched with an interactive accompaniment. Presumably this is because of the spiralling cost of game development – you can’t knock out a mediocre PlayStation 2 game in nine months any more – but also, when TV shows feel so much like games, do we really need an adaptation anyway?\n\nThe first game I’ve finished in 2026 is Indika, a surreal and mildly horrible game about a young nun questioning her faith and having conversations with the devil as she goes on an extremely strange journey through bleak, snow-covered villages and abandoned factories with an escaped convict. There are much-needed flashes of humour in here, but also stuff about religion, control and sexuality that I haven’t seen in a video game before. It’s also part of a small wave of games (see Baby Steps) that mocks gamer mentality: there are points, but they are pointless; explore off the beaten path and you will find something useless and inconsequential rather than a secret or something fun. And that’s if you find anything at all.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch\n\n Estimated playtime: five hours\n\nDavid Rosen, the co-founder of Sega and an influential figure in the history of arcade video games, died on Christmas Day at 95. Keith Stuart writes about his very interesting life.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong has picked up a game-of-the-year trophy in PC games storefront Steam’s publicly voted awards. The Sit Back and Relax award was won by something I’ve never heard of: RV There Yet. I have bought it out of curiosity.\n\nMy book about Nintendo is out next month! It’s called Super Nintendo and it’s a lively cultural history of the most beloved company in games, based on 20 years of interviews (and 30 years as a player). You can support the Guardian by ordering it through the Guardian Bookshop, and I’ll also be doing launch events around the UK throughout February.\n\nThe 15 best PS5 games to play in 2026\n\n‘I wanted that Raiders of the Lost Ark excitement – you could die any minute’\n\nFrom K-pop and The Traitors to Grand Theft Auto VI: your A-Z of the biggest culture of 2026\n\nIn a recent Pushing Buttons, Keza mentioned that games have consolidated into five established mega-franchises and I was trying to work out which franchises these are? I guessed GTA, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft and EA FC, but don’t have huge confidence in that!\n\nYou’re not far off. According to data from Circana, the top five most played games on PlayStation 5 this year were exactly the same as last year: Fortnite, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto 5 (including Online), Roblox and Minecraft. All of these games are five to 10-plus years old. This stagnation at the top is why every big publisher has spent millions in the last decade trying to create live-service games, and why most of them have flopped. Last year on Steam, meanwhile, only 14% of all playtime was spent on new games released in 2025. Any developer releasing something new, be they blockbuster or indie, is competing for a sliver of a sliver of players’ time and money. These stats explain a lot about why the games industry is where it is right now, and why there’s such a bleak mood among many developers.",

Another vintage piece — maybe from the '70s instead of the '50s — might have worked better.\n\nDolce & Gabbana designed the three-piece set he wore. It included loose-fitting velvet pants, a matching blazer with a satin lining, and a soft vest worn underneath.\n\nThe suit was complemented by black velvet loafers, aviator sunglasses, a satin undershirt, and an assortment of fine jewelry from David Yurman.\n\nColman's outfit was chic, on trend, and the epitome of quiet luxury.\n\nThe \"Happy Gilmore\" star posed on the red carpet wearing a jewel-toned suit with a matching purple tie. Though the outfit was eye-catching, it was also arguably too flashy.\n\nHis wife, Jackie Sandler, had a stronger fashion moment in a strapless, gold gown with a black lace overlay. Still, her outfit would have been stronger if she'd worn a darker slip beneath the top layer.\n\nHer dark ensemble was designed by Haider Ackermann for Tom Ford.\n\nIt featured pleated trousers that were tailored perfectly to the musician, a satin blazer with sharp shoulder pads, and a polka-dot blouse with a plunging neckline that reached her stomach.\n\nHe wore a classic suit for the film festival, pairing a black blazer and trousers with a white undershirt and tie.\n\nThough he undoubtedly looked dapper at the event's red carpet, his outfit was too understated. It's unlikely to be remembered alongside brighter, more artistic fashion choices.\n\nShe wore a sparkling Georges Chakra gown. The semi-sheer piece had a sleeveless, backless bodice with a deep V-shaped neckline, a floor-length skirt, and a wrap belt that draped across the floor.\n\nThe dress proved that red is Hudson's color.\n\nThe actor attended the festival in a strapless, leather midi dress. It had a high-low skirt with delicate pleats and a form-fitting bodice.\n\nUnfortunately, the dress was styled too simply. It would have been more impactful if worn with an updo hairstyle and statement jewelry.",

    "title": "Vintage photos show Venezuela before its economic collapse, when oil wealth made it one of the world's richest nations",
    "description": "Once one of the world's richest nations, Venezuela has faced a decadeslong collapse that triggered one of the largest migrations in history.",
    "fullText": "Half a century ago, Venezuela was one of the world's richest nations. Today, decades of economic collapse have driven nearly a quarter of its population to flee the country.\n\nOn January 3, the US launched a military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. He pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism and weapons-related charges in New York on Monday.\n\nThe seizure of the country's leader, which Venezuelan officials have called a \"kidnapping,\" has raised questions about sovereignty and legality, as well as Venezuela's political and economic future.\n\nThe country, which has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, estimated at about a fifth of the world's total, produces less than 1% of the global oil production today, due to what President Donald Trump has called \"badly broken infrastructure.\"\n\nUS officials have said they will seek to influence Venezuela's transitional government and attract investment from American energy companies to help revive its collapsed oil sector.\n\nDuring the 1950s and more dramatically in the 1970s, Venezuela experienced periods of vast oil-fueled economic growth — nicknamed by historians as \"Saudi Venezuela\" — where luxury, foreign travel, and modernization defined a growing middle class.\n\nAt the same time, the dramatic wealth of the era left some behind, highlighting the visible inequalities that contributed to a shift in domestic politics by the end of the century.\n\nThese vintage photos capture what life in Venezuela was like during its decades of oil-fueled economic prosperity and how the country evolved as its economy boomed.\n\nThe first oil discovery in Venezuela was made near Lake Maracaibo in 1914. The national oil industry experienced exponential growth throughout the 1920s and 1930s, as foreign investments began to pour into the country.\n\nThe oil industry's boom transformed the country's economy, which had previously primarily been a coffee exporter.\n\nThe growing oil industry concentrated jobs and investment in the country's capital, drawing migrants from rural areas and smaller cities in search of work and opportunity.\n\n\"There was a growing, expansive, and increasingly influential middle class that established itself in the oil industry,\" said Miguel Tinker Salas, a Pomona College history professor focusing on Venezuelan oil culture and society.\n\nBefore the discovery and expansion of the oil industry in the country, Venezuela was a poor and rural nation, and its economy was defined by agricultural exports, such as coffee and cacao, as reported by Mongabay. Wealth in Venezuela was predominantly held by large landowners, who formed a dominant elite.\n\nThe rapid growth of the oil industry provided the country's middle class, which was relatively small and concentrated in cities like Caracas, with an opportunity for professional expansion.\n\n\"They benefited tremendously from oil wealth and held managerial and professional positions,\" Tinker Salas told Business Insider. \"But they remained a small percentage of the population.\"\n\nHe estimates that less than 20% of the population was part of the middle class that emerged from oil growth.\n\n\"The hardware of modernity — the buildings, the architecture, the glitzy lights, and the planned development of cities — was made possible by oil,\" said Alejandro Velasco, an associate professor of Latin American history at New York University.\n\nAs oil wealth flowed into the country, urban consumer culture in Caracas and other major cities was heavily influenced by the United States. Among members of the middle and upper classes, shopping, fashion, and leisure increasingly reflected American tastes and lifestyles.\n\n\"For a particular segment of the population, they wanted to see themselves as an appendage of Miami-Dade County,\" Tinker Salas said. \"For another segment of the population, that dream was never possible.\"\n\n\"Those who had money,\" Tinker Salas said, \"could get on a plane in Caracas on a Friday afternoon, be in Miami in three hours, shop at Miami department stores, and come back on Sunday afternoon.\"\n\nCaracas also became an international hub for fashion and culture, attracting designers, models, and luxury brands from around the world.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1982, Air France operated a weekly Concorde flight between Caracas and Paris, a symbol of how closely Venezuela's elites aligned themselves with Europe during the oil boom.\n\nEconomic prosperity made luxury brands and high-end shopping popular in parts of Caracas, particularly for the country's wealthiest residents. But that consumer culture existed alongside stark economic inequality.\n\n\"You had fancy department stores and consumer culture existing side by side with deep inequality,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nWhile the capital city remained the center of political and economic power, oil revenues also fueled development in other cities, shaping urban life across much of the country and giving more people access to \"electricity, medical services, and infrastructure that was often lacking in rural areas,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nThroughout the century, as the agricultural industry lost its dominance of the domestic economy, the country saw increased internal migration to urban centers.\n\nThe city surrounding Lake Maracaibo, where oil was first discovered in the country, grew into Venezuela's second-largest city as oil production expanded.\n\nIts economy, identity, and growth were closely tied to oil, making the city a counterpart to Caracas during Venezuela's decades of rapid expansion.\n\nAs international companies grew their operations, Maracaibo welcomed many foreign oil workers.\n\nAs the oil industry expanded, Venezuela attracted foreign oil workers and immigrants, including Europeans during and after World War II. These arrivals helped shape the culture of the country's major cities.\n\n\"Oil exploration brought cultural influence, but Venezuela also became a destination for immigrants from Europe and across Latin America,\" Velasco said.\n\nNot every part of Venezuela was reshaped evenly during the expansion of the oil industry. As cities expanded, many rural areas continued to rely on agriculture, fishing, and local trade throughout the mid-century.\n\n\"On the surface, the country had a veneer of progress,\" Tinker Salas said. \"Venezuela had the highest standard of living in Latin America, but it also had the highest cost of living.\"\n\nWhile modern high-rises emerged in Caracas and other major cities, slums and informal settlements — or barrios — surrounding urban centers often told a different story from the luxurious, store-lined streets.\n\n\"The city was expanding and growing dramatically,\" Tinker Salas said, \"but alongside and in the shadow of those high-rise buildings were poor shacks where people lived in poverty.\"\n\nIn many neighborhoods, access to reliable water, sanitation, and other basic services remained limited even as other parts of the city modernized. Rapid urban growth during the oil era often outpaced infrastructure and long-term planning, leaving families to manage everyday shortages on their own.\n\nThe growth of informal neighborhoods surrounding major cities was a marker of internal migration patterns, where families from rural areas came to the city.\n\n\"Before the 1950s, barrios served as a kind of transitional space — people were in the city, but not fully of the city,\" Velasco said. \"There was a sense of gradual upward mobility: moving from the countryside into a barrio, then into a rented room, then eventually into a house or apartment.\"\n\n\"Even at the height of the so-called golden era, there was tremendous social, cultural, and economic disparity,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nBetween the late 1940s and the 1950s, the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez ruled Venezuela after rising to power during a period of political instability.\n\nHis military government utilized growing oil revenues to fund major infrastructure and modernization projects, even as political and civil freedoms were tightly restricted, reflecting a long-standing pattern of strongman rule that has shaped Venezuelan politics during the country's push toward democracy.\n\nUnder Pérez Jiménez, large public housing projects — or superblocks — were constructed in an effort to modernize the capital and reshape its working-class population. During this effort, informal settlements and barrios were razed, and their residents were forcibly relocated into high-rise complexes designed to reshape their way of life.\n\n\"People were suddenly expected to become modern residents in new spaces, and that transition was difficult,\" Velasco said.\n\nDaily life in the complexes was regulated by strict rules of conduct and state oversight. The model relied on the control of an authoritarian state, Velasco said, which ended as Venezuela moved toward democracy.\n\n\"The failure of that project produced a paradox where you have superblocks and barrios right next to each other,\" Velasco said.\n\nLinking the capital to the mountaintop Hotel Humbold, the Caracas Aerial Tramway symbolized how the state used large-scale public works to project progress, visibility, and national pride in an era that emphasized monumental infrastructure as proof of modernization.\n\nOpened in 1953 as part of a government effort to increase tourism, the Hotel Tamanaco was a key component of a broader initiative to present Venezuela as a modern, international destination.\n\nThe military dictatorship ended in early 1958, but the transition to democracy was marked by unrest, strikes, and internal divisions within the armed forces. In the months that followed, a new civilian-led government struggled to stabilize the country and respond to popular demands amid lingering uncertainty.\n\n\"The 1960s, when democracy began in Venezuela, are not a period of abundance,\" Velasco said. \"They're a period of crisis.\"\n\nDuring the early days of its democracy, Venezuela was widely perceived abroad — and promoted at home — as a stable democracy at a time when military rule was common in Latin America.\n\nHigh-profile diplomatic engagements, like the visit of US President John F. Kennedy, promoted the myth of Venezuela as an \"exceptional democracy,\" as Tinker Salas described it, even during a time when democratic regimes struggled internally.\n\n\"The myth of Venezuela as the exceptional democracy persisted because Venezuela provided the contrary example to what was happening in Cuba,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nConstruction of the Guri Dam began in the early 1960s and continued in phases through the 1980s, reflecting a long-term effort to channel oil revenues into large-scale development projects.\n\nThe hydroelectric complex was part of a broader effort to diversify Venezuela's economy and modernize the country through investments in industry, energy, and infrastructure, extending beyond oil itself.\n\nIntroduced through US oil companies and foreign workers, baseball spread first through oil camps and industrial towns before taking root across the country.\n\nOver time, the sport moved beyond its foreign origins and became a shared cultural language, eventually emerging as one of Venezuela's most powerful symbols of national identity.\n\nAs television spread across Venezuela, variety shows and music programs introduced salsa, Caribbean rhythms, and popular performers into living rooms nationwide.\n\nLaunched in the early 1950s, the Miss Venezuela pageant grew alongside the spread of television and mass media, turning beauty competitions into nationally shared events.\n\nOver time, the pageant evolved into a symbol of national pride, representing how Venezuelans presented themselves to one another and to the world.\n\nDecades of rapid growth reshaped daily life in Venezuela, affecting everyone from rural migrants who moved into expanding cities to foreign immigrants who arrived as the country experienced unprecedented prosperity.\n\nFor those who remained in Venezuela — and for the millions who have since left — the past paints a complex picture of ambition, luxury, and inequality.",

    "fullText": "It's CES week, when the tech world gathers in Las Vegas to check out the latest gadgets, prototypes, and innovations that will shape the future. Lifehacker's tech team is on the ground at the convention, tracking down big stories and cool gear.\n\nBilling itself as \"The Most Powerful Tech Event in the World,\" CES (short for \"Consumer Electronics Show\") is the Consumer Technology Association's trade convention. It began in 1967 as a small showcase for televisions and radios, but over the decades CES has become a gathering of the tribes for tech culture. Everyone is there, from huge companies like Samsung and Sony, to scores of journalists, to scrappy startups with big dreams. From innovative AI tools to electric vehicles, laptops, e-readers, and robotic dogs, CES is where tech companies show off their wares, journalists dig up the next big story, and tech insiders network and sneak a look into the future.\n\nCES is held in Las Vegas from Jan. 6-9. The Las Vegas Convention Center hosts the main show floor, but there are CES-related events at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, The Sphere, and other locations across Las Vegas.\n\nMost major electronics and technology companies are attending CES 2026 in some form. Here are some of the most vital exhibitors:\n\nSamsung Electronics: Samsung's theme this year is \"Your Companion to AI Living,\" and the focus is how artificial intelligence can enhance people's day-to-day lives.\n\nLG Electronics: Describing it as \"innovation in tune with you\" and \"affectionate intelligence,\" LG is showing off its take on AI designed to power robots, appliances, vehicles and TVs.\n\nSony: Sony's main focus this year is mobility. It's unveiling the Sony Honda Mobility (SHM) and showcasing the AFEELA electric vehicle Prototype.\n\nTCL: It's not CES without new TVs, and TCL is showing off a gigantic set with a SQD-Mini LED display.\n\nPanasonic: Under the banner \"The future we make,\" Panasonic promises it is \"leveraging the power of AI to amplify the impact of our human-centric technologies, services and solutions.\"\n\nNVIDIA: The chip-maker is showcasing its new Vera Rubin AI supercomputer platform, the Alpamayo reasoning model for self-driving vehicles, and more.\n\nAMD: AMD is unveiling the Ryzen AI processors for PCs and the Ryzen 7 9850X3D for gaming.\n\nIntel: Intel launched its new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors, codenamed \"Panther Lake.\"\n\nUber: Transportation firm Uber wants you to know about its new robotaxi.\n\nThe LEGO Group: Lovable toy makers LEGO announced \"Smart Bricks,\" packed with a tiny processor that \"brings play to life.\"\n\nIkea: Making its first appearance at CES, Swedish furniture retailer Ikea unveiled 21 new smart home products.\n\nIn fact, so many brands exhibit at CES, it's more notable which ones aren't there. This year's list of no-shows includes Apple (which never really does CES), iRobot, and Tesla. Big brands with a more limited presence include Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nAlong with the expected innovations in televisions and laptops, CES 2026 is crammed with artificial intelligence, robots, and mobility devices, and health-focused wearables. Here are some of the biggest announcements at CES 2026 so far.\n\nAt its keynote, NVIDIA unveiled Alpamayo, \"the world's first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI.\" This could be serious competition for Tesla.\n\nHP showed off a new mini desktop computer, The Eliteboard G1a. You just plug the keyboard into any monitor and go to town. Only time will tell if this is a gimmick or a new form factor.\n\nHyundai and Boston Dynamics showed off humanoid robot Atlas. But Hyundai didn't show off any new electric vehicles, suggesting a cautious outlook for the near future.\n\nBroadcom showed off Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips, providing a practical look into the future.\n\nBelow is a guide to some of the major events at CES 2026.\n\nSunday, January 4: Media Day 1 at Mandalay Bay\n\nMonday, January 5: Media Day 2 at Mandalay Bay. C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nTuesday, January 6: Show Floor Press Conferences, Exhibits: 10 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nWednesday, January 7: Show Floor Press Conferences, Exhibits: 9 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nThursday, January 8: Exhibits: 9 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nFriday, January 9: Exhibits: 9 AM-4 PM\n\nCES Unveiled Las Vegas – The Official Media Event of CES 2026 with innovative product previews – 4:00-7:00 PM\n\nAMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su, 6:30 PM, The Venetian\n\nSiemens President and CEO Dr. Roland Busch, 8:30 AM, The Venetian\n\nLenovo Chairman and CEO Yuanqing Yang, 5:00 PM, Sphere\n\nCaterpillar CEO Joe Creed, 9:00 AM, The Venetian\n\nCES is a trade-only event, so it's not open to the general public, but if you're affiliated with the tech industry in some way, you can register at CES's official site. If you're not a tech insider, you can check out the official CES livestream and read Lifehacker's CES 2026 live blog.",

This did not match the television pictures of the game.\n\nFifa hopes that by taking accurate scans of each player it can improve how these decisions are shown to supporters.\n\nThe technology was tested in Fifa's Intercontinental Cup, with Flamengo and Pyramids FC players scanned ahead of their match in December.\n\nFifa announced last month it was testing new technology which can determine if the ball goes out of play before a goal is scored. It has also developed 'real-time 3D recreation' to make line-of-sight offside decisions.",

    "description": "Brazil surpassed the U.S. as the world's top beef producer last year, according to market estimates, after the South American country",
    "fullText": "BARRETOS, Brazil, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Brazil surpassed the U.S. as the world's top beef producer last year, according to market estimates, after the South American country beat output forecasts by hundreds of thousands of tons, easing a global supply squeeze and helping limit a surge in meat prices.\n\nBrazil was already the biggest beef exporter, shipping meat worth almost $17 ​billion in 2025, according to government trade data released on Tuesday. Beef production numbers are not due until February, but analysts have recently raised their estimates. Farmers have been sending more animals to ‌slaughter, cashing in on high export demand from countries including China and the U.S., where low supply has pushed beef prices to record levels.\n\nElevated slaughter typically leads to a period of low output as producers hold back animals to breed and rebuild herds. But productivity gains in Brazil ‌may limit or even prevent a downturn, people in the industry say. They noted that farms have been inseminating cattle quicker, fattening them faster and slaughtering them younger.\n\n\"Ten years ago, the average age of cattle slaughtered in Brazil was five years,\" said Vinicius Barbosa, a commercial manager responsible for tens of thousands of cattle at the CMA feedlot in Barretos, about 260 miles (420 km) north of Sao Paulo. \"Now it is 36 months and going rapidly to 24,\" he said.\n\nMauricio Nogueira, head of livestock consultancy Athenagro, said Brazilian beef production far surpassed his forecast in 2025. Output grew 4% for the year, where he had predicted a 2.7% drop. The increase of around 800,000 tons was about equal to total annual exports of ⁠Argentina, the world's No. 5 beef shipper.\n\nRabobank, which had expected Brazil's beef production ‌to decline in 2025, now sees 0.5% growth to 12.5 million tons carcass weight equivalent. The U.S. Department of Agriculture in December raised its estimate for Brazilian beef output by 450,000 tons to 12.35 million tons.\n\nIf the official numbers confirm market estimates, 2025 will be the first year that Brazil's output will have surpassed U.S. production, which fell 3.9% ‍to 11.8 million tons in 2025, according to USDA estimates, following years of drought.\n\nFEEDLOTS, RISING CARCASS WEIGHT DRIVE OUTPUT\n\nU.S. beef production will fall a further 0.9% to 11.7 million tons in 2026, the USDA said. In Brazil, the USDA and Rabobank project a decline in output, but Nogueira said rising productivity could actually boost Brazil's production by around 300,000 tons.",

    "fullText": "The Fallout show arrives in New Vegas in a shocking episode.\n\n on January 7, 2026 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week's episode of Fallout to follow.\n\nLast week's episode of Fallout gave longtime fans and new viewers an update on the factions running around in the Mojave Wasteland. From Caesar’s Legion and the divide they had, to the NCR’s loosened grip on the area, to Maximus’ (Aaron Moten) big mistake, there was no shortage of shakeups. As a result, the episode felt as if it sidelined its leads in favor of world building. That’s not the case with this week’s entry, however, as we finally see Lucy (Ella Purnell) and Cooper (Walton Goggins) arrive in the long anticipated New Vegas. Let’s dive into what went on in the Mojave Wasteland this week.\n\nThe episode opens with one of the most exciting pre-war flashbacks to be depicted in the series, showing Cooper Howard on the Alaskan front during the liberation of Anchorage from occupying Chinese forces. Him and a squadmate are on a combat patrol sporting West-Tek’s T-45 Power Armor for the first time in combat and things aren’t going as expected. His squadmate’s armor keeps malfunctioning, locking his arm into place. Frustrated, Cooper opts to disobey orders from his commanding officer and sends the soldier back to base to continue his combat patrol alone. This plan backfires, as he’s soon ambushed by a platoon of Chinese soldiers who cause his armor to malfunction and send him straight to the floor. Just as all hope seems lost and they prepare to kill him for his armor, a terrifying roar is let out. Shortly after, a Deathclaw appears and massacres the platoon in gory fashion. The deathclaw examines Cooper and leaves him thinking he’s dead; meanwhile on the radio, his commanding officer lets him know that the liberation of Anchorage was successful.\n\nJumping to the present, we join Maximus in the immediate aftermath of Paladin Xander’s death. Maximus learns that the Brotherhood of Steel has tracked them to Thaddeus’ (Johnny Pemberton) bottling plant. Realizing that the Brotherhood will kill all of the ghoul children if they go inside--and not wanting them to know he killed Xander--Maximus pleads with Thaddeus to get inside Xander’s power armor and pose as him. Realizing that they have no choice and wanting to save the kids, he reluctantly agrees and begins to stumble around in the power armor to start the ruse.\n\nLucy wakes up after being hung on a cross by the Legion and being saved by Cooper. Unaware where she is, she learns that she’s in the NCR remnant camp. As they prepare to head back to their destroyed home of Shady Sands, the NCR informs her that Cooper saved her and asks her about her quest to find her dad and what she will do when she finds him. When she says she plans to bring him to justice,, they tell her about the NCR’s mission of bringing justice back to the wasteland and if she ever needs allies to find them. Realizing they have too much luggage to haul back, they offer her a duffel bag of weapons for her journey. She and Cooper set out for The Strip.\n\nWe get a brief look at the happenings of Vault 33 and their dead waterchip. Crops are dying and water is being desperately rationed. But the “Products of Inbreeding” club have plenty for their social gathering because of a promise made by Overseer Betty (Leslie Uggams), a promise she quickly regrets.\n\nAs they arrive on the outskirts of New Vegas, Lucy begins exhibiting strange symptoms such as heavy breathing and itching. Unaware of what’s happening to her, Cooper informs her that she spent the last two days with Buffout--an in-game steroid known for its addictive properties--hooked into her veins. That’s right, she’s become addicted to drugs. With no idea what to do and no time to sit out a five day withdrawal cycle, Cooper offers her the only thing that will help: more drugs.\n\nMaximus and Thaddeus return to Area 51 with the other members none the wiser. Dane (Xelia Mendes-Jones) confronts Maximus about his actions and how he took off unauthorized with Paladin Xander. This is when Maximus drops the truth nuke and informs Dane that he killed Xander. Shocked, Dane brings up how his actions will start a war with The Commonwealth Brotherhood of Steel. Maximus assures him it won’t come to that point as he plans to kill Elder Cleric Quintus (Michael Cristofer)\n\nElsewhere in the Los Angeles Wasteland, Norm (Moisés Arias) is out exploring with the rest of the inhabitants of Vault 31. One of them reminisces on what she was doing before she entered cryosleep and how she interviewed with Vault-Tec right before. To her, 200 years has only been a week. As he plots their next move Norm is confronted by Ronnie, Bud Askins’ personal assistant, who challenges his leadership. Being so close to Bud, Ronnie reveals that Phase II of the experiment of Vaults 32 and 33 are important but ominously keeps details vague.\n\nVault 32 Overseer Steph (Annabel O’Hagan) meets with Vault 31 Overseer Betty in the inter-vault chambers that connect the two. Betty informs her that without a waterchip, Vault 31 doesn’t have much time left. She pleads with Steph to use their waterchip but is refused unless she can provide Steph with Hank Maclean’s keepsake box. Betty inquires what’s inside but Steph refuses to tell her. Unbeknownst to the both of them, their entire meeting is being spied on by Woody (Zach Cherry).\n\nCooper and Lucy arrive at the entrance of The Strip but something seems off. It’s entirely abandoned, with destroyed securitrons littering the streets. Cooper scouts the area and discovers it is infested by the Kings gang, who have mutated into vicious ghouls. With few options before them, Cooper suggests entering The Strip through Freeside to avoid any conflict. Lucy, high on drugs, grows impatient and shoots a ghoul in the legs alerting the rest of them and a bloody massacre ensues. As she shoots down every last ghoul, she starts to realize she enjoys the violence. Meanwhile, Cooper realizes New Vegas may have fallen, and Lucy notices one of her fingers begins to look discolored.\n\nBack at Area 51, Thaddeus struggles to blend in as Xander due to how little experience he has with power armor. Despite heading to the mess hall to get away from everything, he’s confronted by the leader of the Yosemite chapter who offers to kill Elder Cleric Quintus in exchange for support from The Commonwealth. The leader of the Coronado chapter arrives and offers the same deal, saying his soldiers are at the ready. Unaware of how to handle the situation, Thaddeus begins to have a panic attack inside of his power armor.\n\nElsewhere, Maximus confronts the Elder Cleric and informs him that he killed Xander and pulls a gun on him. When questioned why he would commit such an act, Maximus informs him that he killed Xander because he was going to kill a group of ghoul children. Angered, the Elder Cleric begins ranting about how that goes against the Brotherhood’s code and how their mission is to restore America and the Wasteland to its former glory. He pulls out a pistol and gets into a firefight with Maximus.\n\nDane steals the Cold Fusion relic to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands and chaos ensues when other members of the Brotherhood realize it's gone. The Yosemite leader kills Coronado’s leader and the various chapters of the BoS enter full blown conflict. In the ensuing chaos, Maximus manages to lock the Elder Cleric in the room and meet up with Dane, who gives him the Cold Fusion relic and tells him to get far away from there, Thaddeus joins him and together in the mayhem they manage to flee Area 51\n\nWoody calls out Steph for violating vault safety by meeting with Betty in the inter-vault chambers, pointing out that they should only be used for authorized use. Steph thanks him and says it should be reported to the Overseer, which is herself, so his concerns are immediately tossed aside. While they’re talking, Chet (Dave Register) uncovers a hidden drawer of Steph’s that houses a Canadian ID card that belongs to her, revealing that she is not American.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper travel further downThe Strip, they notice that the surrounding area is completely abandoned. Lucy wonders where all the people are and Cooper once again suggests they should go to Freeside to learn what happened to New Vegas. The silence is broken as Lucy’s Pip-Boy starts detecting radiation and a vicious roar cuts through the air like a knife. Frozen in their tracks, Lucy and Cooper are mortified at the sight of a massive Deathclaw who has its sights set on them.\n\nAfter last week’s update episode, this week’s Fallout was a remarkable improvement. We finally saw Lucy and Cooper arrive in New Vegas, Brotherhood of Steel reach its breaking point, and a deep look into the happenings of Vaults 32 and 33. Many elements from the games were introduced into the show such as the liberation of Anchorage, Deathclaws, and addiction. There’s no doubt in my mind that the following episodes will have even \n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",

    "description": "Market experts say geopolitical conflict is becoming a permanent force impacting commodities pricing, rather than a temporary blip on traders' radars.",
    "fullText": "It might be hard to tell by looking at the stock market, but investors are living in a new era of geopolitical risk.\n\nWhile equity markets have largely shrugged off the latest geopolitical shocks, the last few years of hot and cold wars have rewired commodities. From Ukraine to Venezuela, ongoing and emerging conflicts have impacted everything from oil to gold to copper.\n\n\"Geopolitical risk has always influenced commodity prices, but it is increasingly acting as a persistent pricing factor rather than a transitory shock,\" a team of commodities researchers at Oxford Economics wrote. \"While acute events can still trigger sharp price moves, markets now tend to embed a standing risk premium reflecting ongoing supply-chain fragility, trade fragmentation, and resource nationalism.\"\n\nUltimately, conflict is becoming a permanent pricing mechanism rather than a temporary blip on traders' radars.\n\n\"As a result, geopolitical considerations are more systematically incorporated into pricing, investment decisions, and procurement strategies across many commodity markets, rather than being quickly priced out once an event fades from headlines,\" they added.\n\nMany traders and experts say the start of this new era for commodity markets began in 2022 with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In nearly four years since then, the world has seen fresh fighting across the Middle East, rising tensions between China and Taiwan, and, most recently, the surprise US raid on Venezuela.\n\nThese episodes have been potent drivers of gold's rapid rally. Investors have flocked to the safe-haven metal as forecasters see the potential for further conflicts through the rest of this decade.\n\nFlare-ups across the Middle East between Israel and Iran and a two-year war between Israel and Hamas have only heightened gold's status as a hedge, while also boosting silver.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of geopolitical uncertainty,\" said Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, an economic policy think tank. \"When you get that, you get movement into precious metals as one of the safe havens. But added to that is the United States reliability as a partner to question is called into question.\"\n\nOil is an outlier in the new era, with prices steadily sliding even as geopolitical forces send investors flocking to other commodities. Crude fell 20% in 2025, with the summer's Israel-Iran conflict only causing a brief jump in the price of Brent.\n\nStill, energy investors are once again being forced to digest the potential for new conflicts to impact the market, mulling the potential for the US takeover of Venezuela to increase supply down the road.\n\nJeff Le, a managing principal at consulting firm 100 Mile Strategies, agrees that a new era has arrived for commodities.\n\nSpeaking with Business Insider, he highlighted how quickly the landscape appears to be shifting, pointing to rising prices not just of precious metals but of industrials as well.\n\n\"The surge of industrial metals over the last year, including gold to over $4,000 represents gains not seen in over four decades,\" he told Business Insider. \"This rush could be representative of a new chapter of the commodities market.\"\n\nBoth Le and Lachman noted the possibility of the US' action in Venezuela setting a new precedent for geopolitical action, highlighting its importance as a driving force for commodities.\n\n\"The Trump administration and growing global tensions appear to be more of a feature than a bug,\" Le noted. \"With three more years to follow, it's possible that geopolitical risk is not only a permanent consideration in the commodities market but a more important weight to investors.\"",

    "fullText": "While you may not be able to outrun AI, you can move with it.\n\nWith AI transforming so many jobs, EY's Joe Depa says adaptability will be the \"new job security\" in 2026.\n\n\"The ability to adapt and change is going to be the most important component,\" said Depa, who oversees innovation at the Big Four consulting firm.\n\nThe executive, who leads EY's AI, data, and innovation strategies, told Business Insider that training and upskilling will be the factors that differentiate talent and organizations in the workforce.\n\nHe shared three ways he stays current amid rapid changes:\n\nWhether by pursuing a formal education or independent studies, Depa said that ongoing learning is key to staying up-to-date.\n\nDepa said he went back to school to get his Master's in Analytics from Georgia Tech just a few years ago to learn more about software development, programming, and data science. He said he knew he would be managing data scientists and programmers, and wanted to better understand their perspective. However, since earning his degree in 2020, software development has \"completely changed.\"\n\n\"You've got to always be learning and challenging yourself to learn every single day,\" Depa said.\n\nTo stay current on topics like AI, he said he listens to podcasts and reads articles about the latest news.\n\nDepa isn't the only leader who carves out regular time for learning new things. Visa's Oliver Jenkyn recently told Business Insider that he blocks off four hours a week to study a topic he wants to understand, like the technology of stablecoins or the history of the semiconductor industry.\n\nDepa said that, in addition to allocating time for individual learning, it's \"critical\" to lean on personal mentors.\n\n\"All of us should have our own personal advisors — mentors around us that we can call,\" Depa said.\n\nThe executive pointed to EY's global AI advisory council, which includes 20 top AI leaders who assist the firm in navigating the AI landscape. The council meets and provides feedback on different plans, Depa said.\n\n\"It's a really nice forum for me to test what's coming next,\" Depa said.\n\nThe global chief innovation officer said that having a council of opinions helps him challenge his thinking, but soliciting input from others doesn't have to be so formal. Having relationships with people with who you can check in with to get different perspectives is \"increasingly important,\" he said.\n\nDepa said that while education and learning from others are important, it's necessary to actually implement those teachings. That could mean vibe coding or creating an application.\n\n\"That whole learning experience is going to really help create new brain dynamics for you to learn the next thing and the next thing,\" Depa said.\n\nDepa said failure is a natural part of experimenting with tools and putting new ideas to practice. Getting comfortable with that discomfort, he added, helps build a mindset focused on challenging yourself and learning more.\n\n\"If you do it enough times, your brain will start to appreciate that process of formal learning, having a team of advisors, and then applying it and learning and growing,\" Depa said.\n\nBlackstone CTO John Stecher also emphasized the importance of being hands-on with technology in a recent interview with Business Insider. Stecher said he doesn't always create something \"spectacular,\" but he reserves an hour or two each weekend to experiment, whether that's using Claude to write code that automates his home, or creating a new tool to parse through documents.\n\n\"It's tactile and tangible,\" Stecher said.",

Hearts are top of the table and Rangers are now three points ahead of Celtic, having been eight or nine points behind at one stage, so it sets it up perfectly.\"",

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems like he's not losing sleep over California's proposed wealth tax.\n\nWhen Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow asked Huang about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Huang said that the potential levy hasn't crossed his mind once and that he is \"trying to build the future of AI.\"\n\n\"I've got to tell you, I have not even thought about it once,\" Huang told Ludlow. \"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it. I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\n\"We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is,\" Huang added.\n\nHuang is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes, which estimated his net worth at approximately $162.6 billion as of January 6. Most of Huang's wealth comes from his around 3% stake in Nvidia, which just showed off its new Vera Rubin chips at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nBased on his net worth as reported by Forbes, a 5% tax on his total wealth would amount to more than $8 billion, to be paid over five years, according to the proposed plan.\n\nThe California wealth tax was proposed by the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West in order to offset anticipated budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nA wealth tax is different from an income tax and is a levy on an individual's entire net worth instead of annual income. The union estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state and apply to the around 200 billionaires who are residents of California.\n\nThe proposal is still very far from reality and would need 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be voted on or rejected by California voters.\n\nBillionaires from Palmer Luckey to David Sacks have already voiced their full-throated disapproval.\n\nAccording to filings viewed by Business Insider, Larry Page, the Google cofounder, converted many of his assets from California to Delaware in December to derisk them from the potential wealth tax. His departure meets an end-of-2025 deadline, since the tax, if passed, would only apply to billionaires who are still residents of California on January 1, 2026.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his wealthy clients and warned that they would \"permanently relocate\" if the California billionaire tax comes to pass.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says China is on track to outpace every other country in the computing power needed to run AI.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in an episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast published Tuesday that \"China's going to have more power than anyone else and probably will have more chips.\"\n\n\"Based on current trends, China will far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute,\" he added.\n\nMusk said China's decisive advantage in the AI race lies in its ability to scale electricity generation. He estimated that China could reach about three times the electricity output of the US by 2026, giving it the capacity to support energy-hungry AI data centers.\n\nElectricity generation is the limiting factor to scaling AI systems, Musk said.\n\n\"People are underestimating the difficulty of bringing electricity online,\" he added.\n\nWhile the US has focused on restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors, Musk suggested those constraints may matter less over time. China will \"figure out the chips,\" he said.\n\nMusk added that diminishing returns at the cutting edge of chip performance might make it easier for China to catch up, even without access to the most advanced designs.\n\nMusk has previously pointed to China as a model in areas beyond AI infrastructure.\n\nIn an episode of the \"People by WTF\" podcast published in November, Musk said he wants to turn his social media platform X into \"WeChat++,\" referencing China's dominant super app.\n\n\"I also like the idea of sort of having a unified app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there,\" he said. \"China has this with WeChat.\"\n\nMusk's comments come as energy supply and data infrastructure emerge as key constraints in scaling AI, rather than chips or algorithms.\n\nCompanies worldwide have rushed to build AI data centers, many of which require as much electrical power as small cities.\n\nA report from Goldman Sachs in November said that an electricity shortage could slow US progress in the AI race.\n\n\"As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nThe report added that while pressure on the US power grid is increasing, China has been steadily expanding its energy capacity.\n\n\"We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping praised his country's progress in AI in 2025, saying China had \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" he said in his speech in Beijing.\n\n\"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one.

    "description": "Animal Crossing: New Horizons made a huge impact on the world of cozy gaming back in 2020, and it's about to make a big resurgence. With the game now available on both the original Switch and the Switch 2 (with an even more upgraded Switch 2 Edition landing January 15), Nintendo's flagship cozy game is back. Whether you've been playing consistently since launch, or want to dive back in and see what your villagers have been up to over the past few years, you may be looking to make your grand entrance on a shiny new Switch 2. Doing so, though, will require you to first move your island to Nintendo's newest console. Here's how to do so using the Animal Crossing island transfer tool.",

    "description": "Whether Hogwarts Legacy was another RPG in your backlog of games or your first foray into video games, there are plenty of games like it that you can play once you've rolled the credits on WB Games' magical open-world title. For Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy is one of the best RPGs on the market, and it's largely based on lore from the Wizarding World. So, while it's difficult to get that same exact experience if you're looking to be in the world of Harry Potter, you can find similar gameplay elements and deep lore-rich stories in other games.\nBelow, we'll be listing 17 games that feature some sort of similarity to Hogwarts Legacy. That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts.",
    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 12:01PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nWhether Hogwarts Legacy was another RPG in your backlog of games or your first foray into video games, there are plenty of games like it that you can play once you've rolled the credits on WB Games' magical open-world title. For Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy is one of the best RPGs on the market, and it's largely based on lore from the Wizarding World. So, while it's difficult to get that same exact experience if you're looking to be in the world of Harry Potter, you can find similar gameplay elements and deep lore-rich stories in other games.\n\nBelow, we'll be listing 17 games that feature some sort of similarity to Hogwarts Legacy. That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts. If you haven't had a chance to pick up Hogwarts Legacy yet, it is available on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nHogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she was not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was one of the more important RPGs ever made due to its revolutionary open world map and quest design, two core pillars of Hogwarts Legacy. While you can still play the original, Oblivion Remastered is a better product in almost every single way. The 2006 masterpiece has been completely remastered, featuring overhauled graphics, character models, dialogue, and mechanics. The core game is still intact, though, as you start your adventure on an epic quest to uncover the mystery of why your emperor was murdered.\n\nAlong the way, you'll encounter five distinct guilds, each with its own questlines, several sprawling cities teeming with life, and an open world that features dozens of unique locations. Also, if you're a fan of the magical combat in Hogwarts Legacy, Oblivion Remastered lets you become a full-blown mage who can use a variety of different magic attacks. It doesn't officially support them, but a collection of Oblivion Remastered mods have also begun to pop up that can further improve the experience.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nImmortals Fenyx Rising is an action-adventure game in the mold of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that places a large emphasis on combat, but still has many qualities that appeal to Hogwarts Legacy fans. You'll get to explore the world right from the start of the game, and when you're not fighting enemies, you can solve a number of challenging puzzles that lead to rewards or other areas within the world. As for combat, you'll get to challenge mythological beasts such as Medusa as well as a plethora of other smaller enemies. The combat in Immortals Fenyx Rising is quite faster than in Hogwarts Legacy, but it's easy to pick up once you understand the controls.\n\nIf the lore and story were your favorite parts about Hogwarts Legacy, then why not hop over to another beloved pop culture franchise? Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an original story in the Star Wars universe that takes place between the events of the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy movies. It's a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but you don't need to play that game to understand what's happening in Survivor.\n\nThe game continues to follow protagonist Cal Kestis as he attempts to lead a rebellion against the Empire with a band of outlaws. Survivor sees you visit several planets that are somewhat open world and all have different enemies to face, puzzles to solve, and collectibles to find. As you progress, you'll unlock more attack types, including additional Force abilities and lightsaber forms. The combat in Survivor can be fairly difficult, especially against the late-game bosses, but you have plenty of tools at your disposal to take down enemies. For newer video game players, you can simply set the difficulty level to its lowest setting and take in one of the best Star Wars tales told in recent memory.\n\nLA Noire might not be the first game you think of when you think of Hogwarts Legacy. However, the two games have \n\nIf you enjoyed the outskirt areas of Hogwarts Legacy that extended beyond the castle grounds, then Ghost of Tsushima might be right up your alley. This open-world RPG is set in 13th-century Japan during the Mongol invasion and features extremely detailed and beautiful landscapes outside of the war-torn towns and fields. Ghost of Tsushima sees you play as a samurai who's trying to navigate the invasion and protect their island from the Mongols. When you're not actively doing story missions, you can explore a huge world filled with real-life locations that are still standing in Japan today. You'll come across your fair share of enemies while exploring, but the combat in Ghosts of Tsushima is beginner-friendly while still being difficult to master as you unlock more weapons and skills. A sequel, Ghost of Yotei, is on the way in 2025.\n\nThe Horizon series features perhaps the closest games to Hogwarts Legacy. The first game in the series is Horizon Zero Dawn, but you can also play its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, for an equally thrilling adventure. We recommend playing Zero Dawn first, though, as there's so much lore you need to understand before you can fully appreciate Forbidden West.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, you play as Aloy, an orphan born in the midst of a post-apocalyptic period in an alternate version of the United States in the 31st century. In this version of the US, man-made machines have taken over the planet, and tribes of hunter-gatherers and warriors try to survive without antagonizing them. Throughout Zero Dawn, you'll uncover the origins of Aloy's story, which is deeply entangled with how this future came to be and what happened to the humans before the machines took over. It's an epic adventure with a huge open world, combat centered around a bow and arrow, and plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe Dragon Age franchise is one that Hogwarts Legacy fans should find enjoyable. They're RPGs with an emphasis on narrative elements and exploration through a large, open world. There's also plenty of magic at play, both in combat and with basic mechanics. In The Veilguard, you play as Rook, who's tasked with stopping a pair of corrupt gods who have escaped their imprisonment. At the beginning of the game, you'll be by yourself, but over time, you can recruit a number of companions to join your party and fight alongside you for the duration of the adventure. Magic, an open world, and a mysterious story all make Dragon Age: The Veilguard an enticing option for any Hogwarts fan. You also don't have to play any of the original Dragon Age games to understand the story, so feel free to hop right in regardless of your experience.\n\nSpeaking of a franchise with some deep lore, the Marvel universe is a natural stepping stone for any Hogwarts Legacy player to dive into. While some fantastic Marvel games have been released in the past several years, Spider-Man was the game that marked Marvel's revival in the video game industry. This is an original story for the webbed hero that follows Peter Parker trying to navigate a day job while also being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The story starts off relatively slow, but develops into a thriller with all sorts of twists and turns.\n\nThe setting for Marvel's Spider-Man is an open-world New York City, and swinging through its skyscrapers or Central Park is one of the best feelings you can experience in a video game. The swinging mechanics along with the Arkham-style combat are thoroughly crisp, leading you to feel like you really are Spider-Man.\n\nIf puzzles were one of your favorite parts of Hogwarts Legacy, but you still want some exploration, then look no further than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Breath of the Wild is one of the most celebrated video games of all time, combining a staggeringly massive open world with fantastic puzzles that actually require you to use different parts of your console to solve. Some puzzles can simply be solved using the joysticks on your Switch, while others use the console's gyro controls and both Joy-Cons. The puzzles can be surprisingly difficult to get through, but they might not even be the hardest part of the game.\n\nInstead, the combat and gear degradation systems in Breath of the Wild will likely have you more challenged than the puzzles. Combat can be difficult if you run into a boss or enemy that outlevels you, but even easy fights have the potential to turn difficult if your favorite sword breaks from too much use. While all of this sounds overly challenging, Breath of the Wild allows you to play at your own pace, and players of all skill levels can pick it up and immediately enjoy what it has to offer. An enhanced Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and its excellent sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, are out now and boast some very nice upgrades.\n\nNow, your first thought when you see a game like Baldur's Gate 3 might be that you're not a fan of turn-based combat. After all, if you liked Hogwarts Legacy, going from fast-paced wand fights to slow, turn-based moves in every encounter could be jarring. However, if you can get past the shift to turn-based combat and really sink your teeth into Baldur's Gate 3, you'll discover why it's considered one of the best RPGs ever made.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is an epic tale of your character, who can either be a preset character or completely your design, trying to stop an alien force from taking over an entire continent's minds. The game isn't necessarily open world, as it features distinct zones that are a part of the different story acts, but the zones themselves are very large. Within these zones, you'll be able to pick up new party members, who you can completely control, go on winding side quests that feel like their own mini-story, and explore the beautiful and dangerous landscapes that make up each one of the maps. Baldur's Gate 3 also features cross-play and is fully co-op, so you can partake in the adventure with a friend or two.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed franchise is somewhat divisive, as many fans seem to either love or hate the different styles of games in the series. If you were to pick one to play to scratch your Hogwarts Legacy itch, though, make it Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in 400 BC Greece, Odyssey sees you take control of either a male or female protagonist who comes from humble beginnings. However, over the course of the game, you'll take part in a war between Athens and Sparta, command a ship across high seas, and explore perhaps the biggest open-world map on this list. The story in Odyssey has a few different branches that all clash by the end of the 50-hour-plus campaign, and it's one of the most memorable in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Hogwarts Legacy fans should find the combat easy to pick up, and exploration on a much larger scale than they find in the Wizarding World.\n\nFable III is one of the few games on this list that's somewhat difficult to play in 2025. However, if you're subscribed to Game Pass, then you shouldn't have any trouble on Xbox or PC. Fable III is the most recent game in the Fable series, but the next entry, currently known simply as Fable, is coming sometime in 2026. The Fable series is widely beloved in the gaming community thanks to the charm of its characters and gameplay. Fable III specifically sees you embark on a quest to take down an unruly leader and manage the kingdom for the people of your country.\n\nWhile the story in Fable III isn't especially long, it does offer you a plethora of choices to make that drastically impact how the narrative plays out. During your adventure in the main story, you'll come across a slew of combat engagements, which play out in real time and feature melee, ranged, and magic attacks. The combat can be a little clunky in Fable III, but the world and characters will keep you enthralled throughout the entire game.\n\nIf we're recommending games like Hogwarts Legacy, let's go with one of the only other Wizarding World titles on the market that's easily playable in 2025. Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 allows you to play through the first four years of the Harry Potter series as Harry himself. You'll get to explore a slimmed-down version of Hogwarts Castle and meet the cast of characters that you know and love. The game doesn't play out exactly like the movies or books, so there will be some different events that take place. Of course, you'll still get to partake in the classic Harry Potter events, such as playing Quidditch, sneaking around after dark, and even battling the Basilisk. Given the Lego nature of these games, they're meant to appeal to a more casual gaming audience, but any Harry Potter fan should find something to enjoy in Years 1-4.\n\nLife is Strange is strictly a game for Hogwarts Legacy players who value the story above anything else. Life is Strange doesn't feature any sort of combat or an open-world map to explore. Instead, the game takes place over a series of episodes that follow Max Caulfield, a high school senior who discovers that she can rewind time. Using this ability, Max tries to save her best friend, but altering the past can come with severe consequences. Your job is to find a way to navigate the pitfalls of time travel to try and get as happy an ending as possible. The story is gripping throughout every episode of Life is Strange, and there is some puzzle-solving along the way.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most well-reviewed games ever and easily a top 10 RPG of all time. If the lore and world of Hogwarts Legacy are something that appeals to you, there's arguably no better game to turn to than The Witcher 3. Don't be intimidated by the \"3\" in the title, as it helps to know the lore of the first two games, but it's not imperative whatsoever.\n\nThe Witcher 3 sees you take control of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter who possesses unnatural abilities and strengths. Geralt begins the game on the hunt for his adopted daughter, Ciri, as he's having dreams of an undead army called \"The Wild Hunt\" coming for him and Ciri. While this is the premise of the game, The Witcher 3 is so much more than its initial plotline. The game takes you across an incredibly detailed and large open world where quests and new locations are waiting around every corner. The Witcher 3 even features its own card-based minigame, Gwent, which is now a full-fledged game in its own right.\n\nThe Tomb Raider reboot in 2013 kicked off one of the best gaming trilogies of the modern era. Consisting of Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, these games are extremely well-done and provide you with a very similar experience to that of Hogwarts Legacy. You play as Lara Croft, a world explorer who comes from a wealthy family but finds herself constantly embroiled in some controversies with rival explorers. The Tomb Raider games offer fast-paced and stealthy combat, where you can use a variety of weapons, but you'll also be tasked with solving puzzles, or \"tombs,\" as you progress through the story. With a solid mix of combat, storytelling, and puzzles, you should find yourself right at home as a Hogwarts Legacy fan.\n\nIf you want to step into another established franchise with a cast of iconic characters and villains, then look no further than the Batman Arkham trilogy. Consisting of Batman Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, these games revolutionized an entire generation of action-adventure and RPG titles with their \"Arkham-style\" combat. Naturally, you play as Batman in these games, and each title offers a new story for the Caped Crusader. The stories often revolve around the villains of the game, and the second and third titles allow you to explore an open-world Gotham City. While there's crime around every corner in Gotham, there are also puzzles you can solve that are doled out by none other than The Riddler. There's a slice of gameplay for all Hogwarts Legacy fans, but the Arkham games lean more on the side of combat than puzzles.",

    "description": "Fallout 4 continues to be a well-regarded and popular RPG in 2026, but there are plenty of games like it that offer a similar experience or combine some of its best elements. At its core, Fallout 4 is an RPG with that classic Bethesda feel to it. However, it's also a game with several layers that have been separated and expanded upon in other titles.\nSo whether it's the RPG systems, world design, gunplay, or base-building of Fallout 4 that you enjoy, there's a game out there for you to play after you roll credits. Below you'll find the best games that are most like Fallout 4 in one way or the other.",

Below you'll find the best games that are most like Fallout 4 in one way or the other. If you're more interested in RPGs as a whole, you can check out our list of the best RPGs to play in 2025, or refresh your Fallout experience with the best Fallout 4 mods.\n\nIf you're looking for a game similar to Fallout 4, why not play the RPG by the same developer that preceded it by three years? Skyrim is one of the best-selling RPGs of all time and features plenty of the same gameplay elements and mechanics as the Fallout franchise does. You're given a massive map to explore right from the start, there are several factions to join and complete quests for, and the story can take several twists and turns depending on your choices. Skyrim might be a fantasy game without any guns or grenades, but it still has that classic Bethesda RPG feel to it that's so prevalent in Fallout 4.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWhile Fallout 4 isn't necessarily considered a scary game, there are some parts that can make you jump in your seat a smidge. If you're looking for more of that feeling, then Metro Exodus is the next post-apocalyptic world you want to dive into. Metro Exodus is a first-person shooter that's set in 2023's Russia after a series of devastating nuclear attacks all across the planet. You play as Artyom, a survivor who's trying to establish contact with other survivors, while also trying not to get killed by the newly formed creatures and harsh environment of the Russian wilderness. Metro Exodus features large, open zones, a story that spans one year through different events, and superb, realistic gunplay. The game can be seen as more of a survival/horror experience, but it still has the FPS and open-world elements that all Fallout fans know and love.\n\nAtomfall is a game that takes clear inspiration from the Fallout franchise. It's a first-person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world where certain technologies have advanced far beyond what we have today. While the start of the game feels like Fallout, as you continue to play through Atomfall, it becomes clear that it has put several different spins on the experience.\n\nFor starters, Atomfall is a survival game that forces you to manage your hunger, thirst, stamina, and health at all times across a map with several large, open zones. Where Atomfall really shines is in its quest design and storytelling. The game offers you several different quest lines to reach the end credits, and you need to decide which quests to complete to achieve the ending that you think is the best.\n\nWe have another Bethesda RPG, and this time it's the game that Bethesda director Todd Howard referred to as \"Fallout in space.\" Starfield captures that Bethesda Fallout feeling across nearly all facets of the game. There's smooth gunplay, booming and interactive cities, several factions that offer complete questlines, and a story that forces you to explore all across a galaxy of planets.\n\nStarfield also offers you the ability to build a base on any planet you want, which is one of the best parts about Fallout 4. In addition to the base building, Starfield also lets you customize your own spaceship. You can deck out your craft with all sorts of different parts that offer pros and cons for exploration, combat, and aesthetics.\n\nIf Starfield is referred to as \"Skyrim, but in space,\" then The Outer Worlds franchise could be referred to as \"Fallout 4, but in space.\" The Outer Worlds isn't developed by Bethesda, but it is developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind Fallout: New Vegas. In late 2025, we got The Outer Worlds 2, a sequel to the original game that built a terrific world in a faraway and futuristic galaxy. The Outer Worlds 2 builds on its predecessor while keeping the charm of its characters, rewarding loot system, and fantastic map design. The game allows you to take command of a spaceship, recruit a cast of misfits, and make choices that impact the story and world around you as you solve a conspiracy that will have ramifications on the entire galaxy.\n\nMad Max is arguably one of the most underrated games of the last decade. It features an original story set in the post-apocalyptic world of the film franchise, and, as you might expect, places a large emphasis on vehicles and trying to survive the arid climate of the wasteland. You play as Max, who starts the game barely coming out alive after a conflict with the primary antagonist, Scabrous Scrotus. Scrotus takes Max's prized vehicle, the Magnum Opus, and you spend the entire game trying to retrieve the car from his clutches.\n\nMad Max features a huge open world that you'll traverse with different vehicles you acquire throughout your adventure. You can take down enemy camps, run dangerous quests for different characters, and participate in Death Run races to earn special rewards.\n\nDying Light 2 Stay Human is a game that can be seen as one of the closest experiences to Fallout 4 on this list. Of course, that's if Fallout 4 had parkour, slick movement abilities, and zombies instead of ghouls. The main gameplay element that Dying Light 2 focuses on is its parkour, which affects map traversal in almost every single way. You have access to a huge, post-apocalyptic city, and the entire map is set up for parkour moves and abilities. You also need these parkour elements to escape the hundreds of ravenous zombies that only come out during Dying Light 2's frightening nights.\n\nFallout 4 is set in a post-apocalyptic version of Boston, where nuclear war has ravaged the landscape. While Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't feature a post-apocalyptic world, it does feature an alternate version of San Diego that's set 50 years in the future.\n\nWhile the setting of Cyberpunk 2077 is certainly fascinating, it's the backdrop to one of the best RPG experiences on the market. Cyberpunk 2077 offers a highly interactive and content-filled open world that's dazzling to look at, regardless of where you are. The game offers you multiple ways to engage in combat, and you can enhance your preferred playstyle with unlockable skills and craft technological mods to upgrade your character.\n\nThe Last of Us only shares one or two aspects with Fallout 4, but it's still a game that's absolutely worth playing. It begins with a zombie-style outbreak and fast-forwards several years to a post-apocalyptic future. While The Last of Us uses a third-person perspective and features linear gameplay, it also tells one of the most gripping tales in video game history, which has since been turned into a major TV series on HBO. It might not be an open-world RPG like Fallout 4, but the world and story are all the reasons you need to pick it up.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn takes the post-apocalypse theme and turns it upside down, as the game takes place more than 1,000 years into the future. During this 1,000-year period, man-made machines have taken over the planet after their AI went rogue during humanity's peak in the 21st century. Horizon Zero Dawn offers a huge open world to explore, hours and hours of lore to listen to and read, and engaging combat that mixes in archery, traps, and melee weapons. If you enjoyed Fallout 4 for the design of the Commonwealth or the mystery behind the story, Horizon Zero Dawn is a perfect game to play next.\n\nThe Division 2 is an online tactical shooter that takes place in the war-torn downtown district of Washington, D.C. after a viral outbreak has brought the nation to its knees. Your objective in The Division 2 is to fend off enemy factions trying to take control of the city. To do that, you and a group of real players need to work together to scavenge loot and supplies across an open map that's split up into zones. You can encounter both AI enemies and other players, but some areas are solely designated for PvP fights. The Division 2 features some elements of an RPG, but it's a multiplayer game at its core that requires you to improve your skills and gear, unless you want an enemy team to bulldoze through you.\n\nBioShock might be one of the older titles on this list, but few games can match the overall immersion that it brings to the table. It's set in the underwater city of Rapture, which was created by a man named Andrew Ryan to escape the ever-changing world above the surface. Through the course of the game, you'll explore every inch of the now-ruined city. Along your way, you can attain new powers and abilities, discover secrets about Rapture and its downfall, and fight off some of the most iconic enemies in video game history. BioShock might not have the freedom of Fallout 4, but it has the exact kind of vibe that you want as a fan of the game.\n\nWe're back with another RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. This time it's the studio's most recent entry, Avowed, which is set in a fictional fantasy land that's engulfed in conflict and intrigue. Avowed features four different large open zones that are almost big enough to be their own open world maps. These zones hold dozens of quests to complete, collectibles to find, and hidden locations that could alter how the story plays out if you find them early enough. Perhaps the best part of Avowed is its combat system and skills menu, which allow you to fight enemies using smooth gunplay, crisp melee weapons, or long-range magic spells or guns. It's a fantastic game from top to bottom that feels like a blend of both Fallout and Skyrim.\n\nWhile you might not initially think Borderlands is a lot like Fallout, the franchise has come a long way in the RPG genre. Borderlands 4, the most recent installment, features a large open world that you can explore as you progress the story. Unlike previous games, there are no loading zones between separate maps, so the entire thing is seamless. You also get to interact with a variety of characters, some of whom act as companions, and take on a plethora of side quests and other objectives throughout the world. The looting aspect of Borderlands 4 is different from Fallout, and the gameplay is much faster-paced, but both are terrific RPGs with large worlds to uncover.\n\nProject Zomboid is a survival sandbox game that's unlike many of the single-player experiences included on this list. What might make Project Zomboid enjoyable for a Fallout 4 fan is the open-world exploration and expansive base building elements. The game forces you to deal with swarms of zombies all across the open map, and to fend them off, you need to scrounge for resources that you can use to craft weapons, gear, and other items at your base. While the base-building in Project Zomboid is quite different from Fallout 4, you can make immensely large bases that allow you to sustain yourself in the post-apocalypse.\n\nIf the exploration and story are your favorite parts of Fallout 4, then Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is a great addition to your game library. The game is set in a post-human version of Earth where different creatures have risen up to dominate the planet. You control a party of these creatures and can explore a slew of unique environments that all present different challenges. At the heart of Mutant Year Zero is turn-based combat, which is akin to something like XCOM. The combat might throw off FPS fans at first, but after you get used to it, you'll be engaged and start strategizing various ways to win fights by controlling your entire party of mutants.\n\nThe Warhammer 40000 franchise is known for its narrative-driven gameplay and engaging RPGs. Rogue Trader is another RPG that centers around turn-based combat and assembling a party of different characters for you to control. You can recruit a plethora of characters to join you, and each of them have various attacking styles, weapons, and abilities. When you're not in combat, you can explore a large world where the story plays a major role in everything you do. The choices you make throughout the story affect what happens later in the game and your eventual ending. It's an excellent RPG that blends the exploration and narrative parts of Fallout 4 with strategic, turn-based combat.\n\nWe've already mentioned The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but pound for pound, its predecessor, Oblivion, might be the better overall RPG. While you can still go back and play the original, Bethesda released a fully remastered version of Oblivion at the start of 2025. The remaster is done wonderfully, as bugs have been fixed, graphics have been improved, and quality-of-life updates are live, including the ability to sprint. At its core, though, Oblivion Remastered is the same premier RPG that showcases Bethesda at its best in terms of gameplay design and world-building.",

    "fullText": "and \n Joey Carr\n on January 6, 2026 at 11:54AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nIt was Ultima creator Richard Garriott who first coined the term MMORPG--massively multiplayer online role-playing game--to describe 1997's Ultima Online. Flash-forward to 2026, and many of the best MMORPGs to play today are ones that embody the same elements that made early classics like EverQuest, Asheron's Call, and Ultima Online so popular: namely, long-term character progression and persistent online worlds filled with hundreds or even thousands of other players to meet, compete against, or interact with.\n\nWorld of Warcraft helped break MMORPGs into the mainstream when it first released in 2004, making many of the genre's signature ideas more appealing to a wider audience. For a few years after its release, it seemed like every major video game publisher wanted to copy Blizzard's formula (and monthly subscription-based revenue), and MMORPGs became a hot new genre.\n\nUnfortunately, few of the games that chased WoW's success found much of their own. Publishers soured on the genre before too long, resulting in a draught of new MMORPGs over the last decade when compared to other popular game genres (even if many of them, like some of the best survival games or multiplayer shooters, now borrow heavily from MMORPGs). As a result, many of the most popular games MMORPGs today are the same titles that were popular in the early-mid 2000s. Some have existed for decades and require subscriptions to play, even as others have more recently shifted to a free-to-play model.\n\nThere's never been a better time to get lost in a living, breathing online world, something only the best MMORPGs can provide. Below you'll find a list, in no particular order, of some of the top MMORPGs to play in 2026, ranging from tried-and-true classics of the genre to hybrids that combine the best of traditional fantasy-themed MMOs with elements of shooters, space exploration, and more. Some of the games below also happen to be some of the best free-to-play games available.\n\nBlizzard might not have invented the MMORPG, but it certainly popularized it, as it took a genre known for having a steep learning curve and made it more approachable than ever before with streamlined mechanics, punchy combat, instanced dungeons and raids, and its signature level of polish. As a result, WoW is still going strong today and remains one of the best PC MMORPGs to play, having received nine expansions to date (with a 10th on the way). In WoW, players choose a faction--the Alliance or the Horde--as well as a race and class, and from there embark on an adventure to defend the fantasy world of Azeroth from all manner of threats. Each of the game's 13 classes feels distinct, with multiple sub-classes to choose from, and there's an ever-expanding list of fantasy races to play as and customize.\n\nWoW celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024, as Blizzard kicked-off a three-expansion storyline called The Worldsoul Saga with the release of the game's excellent and approachable The War Within expansion. Blizzard celebrated WoW's big anniversary by dropping some big news as well--after two decades, WoW will finally receive player housing as part of its next expansion, and in a recent preview made clear that unlike in some MMOs, housing in WoW will be available for everyone.\n\nWhile the main version of WoW has continued to evolve over the last 20 years, a large and vocal contingent of fans yearned for the early days of the MMO, before more-recent expansions forever transformed the game's world and Blizzard updated much of its visuals, gameplay, and classes. Blizzard finally listened in 2019 with the release of WoW Classic, a return to the game's earliest, pre-expansion days.\n\nWoW Classic's release proved to be a huge success, and Blizzard now offers multiple different flavors of old-school WoW all under one subscription price, one that also grants access to the modern version of WoW. Players can still check out the 2004-era version of Azeroth (which received new servers to start fresh on in November 2024 for the game's 20th anniversary), or move forward in time and play one of the game's older expansions, like 2010's Cataclysm (soon to be 2012's Mists of Pandaria). There are even seasonal servers, like the still ongoing Season of Discovery, which adds new items, raid content, and class changes to the original version of Blizzard's genre-defining title.\n\nSince the genre's inception, many MMORPGs have featured familiar sword-and-sorcery trappings. It only makes sense then that the granddaddy of the modern fantasy genre, The Lord of the Rings, was a prime candidate to get the MMO treatment following the massive success of WoW. Enter The Lord of the Rings Online, a game that couldn't have come from a more veteran MMORPG team, with developer Turbine having been responsible for MMO classics like 1999's Asheron's Call and its sequel. The Lord of the Rings Online has since changed developers, but its current developer, Standing Stone Games, is composed of many former Turbine developers. Better yet, it still receives new content updates and expansions, with its most recent, Legacy of Morgoth, having arrived in November 2024.\n\nThough very much following in the footsteps of WoW, it fittingly places a much larger emphasis on story than Blizzard's MMO and delivers a painstakingly detailed version of JRR Tolkien's Middle-earth for players to explore and immerse themselves in.\n\nFinal Fantasy is one of the biggest RPG franchises of all time, and as such has not one, but two MMORPGs to its name. Though 2002's Final Fantasy XI is still playable, it's Square Enix's more-recent MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, that has blossomed into one of the best MMORPGs of all time. When it was first released, it was a critical and commercial failure. But several years and many updates later, the game was re-released as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, completely reworking many of the original game's systems, story, and structure. Now, Final Fantasy XIV is one of the top MMORPG games today and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPGs available, having long been playable on PlayStation and more recently launching on Xbox Series X|S.\n\nIts flexible job system means players don't need to create a new character every time they want to try a new role, and despite being a MMORPG with a massive shared world to explore, its main story, over-the-top boss battles, and excellent music all deliver on what RPG fans expect from a game sharing the Final Fantasy name. Its latest expansion, Dawntrail, released in July 2024.\n\nFuncom is no stranger to MMORPGs, having previously made titles like Anarchy Online and Age of Conan. The studio's latest foray into the genre is its most ambitious yet, adapting author Frank Herbert's sci-fi Dune saga into a massive survival MMORPG where players battle to survive on the harsh desert world of Arakkis. Dune: Awakening is definitely a survival game first and foremost, with players needing to gather resources, manage their water levels, build shelter, and advance their gear to progress.\n\nHowever, MMO staples like faction reputation, class-skill trees, open-world dungeons, and a massive, ever-changing endgame PvP zone that brings together hundreds of players also firmly make Dune: Awakening a MMORPG. Its unique mix of third-person shooting, melee, and vehicular combat helps to further distinguish it from the many fantasy-themed MMOs on the market, making for an enticing combination of genres, gameplay, and aesthetics. Just keep in mind that getting killed by one of the desert's massive sandworms means losing everything on your character at that moment--the desert claims the weak.\n\nOne of the first big new MMORPGs in years, Amazon's New World made quite a splash when it released in 2021, breaking concurrent player records on Steam. The hype has since died down quite a bit, but New World is still an extremely solid MMORPG that received a major overhaul on PC and launched on consoles in the form of New World: Aeternum in October 2024. In New World: Aeternum, players wash up the mysterious island from which the game takes its name, one that has trapped various civilizations and explorers from throughout human history. From there they join one of three different factions, each with their own idea of what to do with the mystical land they now call home. Instead of classes, players instead can equip two different weapon types, which define what skills can be used and what stats a player may want to strive for when gearing their character.\n\nThe New World: Aeternum update bundled in the game's sole expansion, and in the process significantly reworked much of the game's story and its early-game questing, two of its biggest weaknesses prior to the update. Amazon also recently debuted seasonal servers that change up New World: Aeternum's normal gameplay in major ways, ranging from servers that put a heavy focus on open-world PvP to \"hardcore\" servers with faster progression where the goal is to never die even once.\n\nThe developer behind the Halo series took many of the ideas popularized in MMORPGs like WoW--dungeons, raids, classes, special abilities, color-coated loot--and applied it to a smaller-scale, sci-fi FPS. The result was Destiny and its sequel, Destiny 2. Bungie has proven it's still king when it comes to making a great-feeling shooter, and it never gets old blasting ancient aliens or genocidal robots with all manner of Destiny's 2 powerful Exotic weapons. When combined with the social elements of MMOs like shared worlds to explore, larger-scale public events, and multiplayer dungeons and raids filled with complex puzzles and mechanics, Destiny 2 forms an impressive genre cocktail that can be hard to put down.\n\nEverything Bungie has been building towards for over a decade may have culminated in 2024's The Final Shape expansion, but Destiny 2 is still receiving new updates and expansions, with the new Edge of Fate expansion releasing July 15. Destiny 2 is also widely available, making it both one of the best cross-platform games to play with friends and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPG games out there.\n\nGuild Wars 2 was a breath of fresh air when it released in 2012, and for good reason. It put a new spin on many of the tried-and-true tropes and systems seen in popular MMORPGs like WoW, with an emphasis on open-world content. Combined with its flashy movement, impressive visuals compared to many other MMOs, and engaging combat that combines class skills with unique weapon abilities, Guild Wars 2 still stands out from the competition as one of the top MMORPG games available on PC.\n\nIn 2025, Guild Wars 2 is still regularly receiving new updates and expansions, in part thanks to a recent restructuring of how developer ArenaNet develops new content. Its latest expansion, Janthir Wilds, introduced several new big features, including player housing and the spear weapon-type. Unlike many of the biggest MMORPGs, Guild Wars 2 doesn't require a subscription to play, making it an appealing choice for aspiring MMO players on a budget.\n\nOne of the more popular Korean MMORPGs, Lost Ark came to the West with the help of Amazon Games and quickly set itself apart thanks to its isometric perspective and lack of a box price or mandatory subscription fee. In Lost Ark, players choose a class and then embark on a quest to discover the titular lost Arks scattered throughout the fantasy world of Arkesia. It's a journey that takes players to both huge, story-heavy new continents and to small, one-off islands that are home to some truly fun minigame events, all which players sail to on their own personal boat.\n\nSprinkle in some truly fantastic endgame raids and impressive Monster Hunter-like boss battles, and Lost Ark is well worth playing for those looking for a MMORPG that plays closer to some of the best Diablo-like games than it does WoW, albeit minus the fountains of loot. Three years later, the game is still receiving frequent updates, with a new class, the shapeshifting Wildsoul, debuting in February 2025.\n\nFallout 76 didn't exactly have a smooth start in 2018, with players criticizing it for a laundry list of bugs, performance issues, lack of NPC characters, and more. But Bethesda never gave up on its multiplayer Fallout experiment, and in 2025, Fallout 76 is a great way to experience one of gaming's best RPG universes alongside dozens of other players.\n\nLike traditional Fallout games, players scrounge their way through an apocalyptic wasteland on the hunt for supplies and gear. Unlike single-player entries in the franchise, however, dozens of players in Fallout 76 can team up to fend off waves of Super Mutants, battle massive monsters as part of the game's numerous public events, or even drop nukes on one another. Bethesda added Expeditions to the list of things to do in Fallout 76 back in 2022. These allow players to team up and venture outside the game's Appalachian Wasteland to other scenic locales, like Fallout 3's The Pitt, for dungeon-like missions, further giving the FPS RPG a distinct MMO flavor.\n\nFallout 76 has seen a resurgence in interest thanks to the launch of the TV show adaptation, making this a great time to jump in. Its most recent content update, Gone Fission, added fishing as a new activity, with players able to complete various fishing-themed quests and upgrade their fishing pole to tackle new challenges. For more on the franchise, check out our look at the best Fallout games.\n\nStar Wars: The Old Republic will feel familiar to anyone who has played WoW but is no less worthy a time investment for those looking to dive deeper into the Star Wars universe. Originally developed by BioWare, a studio known for its RPG storytelling, Star Wars: The Old Republic unsurprisingly puts its story front and center, with dialogue wheels, fully voiced characters, and impactful narrative choices that feel right at home in a single-player RPG. It also features unique storylines for each of the game's eight classes, meaning there is plenty of replay value for players who can't make up their mind on which class to play. As much as it emulates WoW in its gameplay, Star Wars: The Old Republic does include features that have yet to come to Blizzard's MMO, including player housing and NPC companions.\n\nThough the game recently changed developers (with some former members of BioWare joining Broadsword, which also oversees classic MMORPGs owned by EA like Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot), it still receives new story content and events, making it the top MMORPG game for Star Wars fans and one of the best Star Wars games of all time.\n\nWhile it may still be quite some time until The Elder Scrolls 6, those longing for a return to Tamriel will find plenty to enjoy in The Elder Scrolls Online, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The MMORPG spin on Bethesda's popular RPG series will feel familiar to those who have played single-player entries in the franchise, with the ability to play in first or third-person, NPC companions, various guilds to join, options to steal from NPCs, and more. Players choose an assortment of skills both from their chosen weapon and armor type but also their class in order to make unique builds that can be used to conquer dungeons and raids with other players. Compared to other, more-traditional MMORPGs playable on consoles, its smaller number of skills and easy-to-read user interface make ESO one of the top Xbox and PS5 MMORPG games, even if it sadly doesn't support cross-play or cross-progression across platforms.\n\nIn 2025, developer ZeniMax Online is making some big changes to ESO's content schedule. It's forgoing the yearly expansion model used for almost a decade and instead focusing on smaller, more frequent seasonal updates that will help to deliver on efforts to improve the game across the board. Those efforts include major experiments like Cyrodiil Champions meant to improve the MMO's open-world PvP and a renewed focus on the new and returning player experience. Its current season, Seasons of the Worm Cult, continues the base game's main storyline, while a free update for all players in June added the ability to subclass, allowing for the mixing and matching of abilities from different classes in order to create entirely new playstyles.\n\nIt may not look like much, but Runescape, which is now in its 23rd year and comes in both its slightly-more-modern Runescape 3 form as well as Old School Runescape, is still one of the best MMORPG games of all time. It may be simple by modern standards, but there is a certain joy to be found in its point-and-click gameplay and its monotonous, yet satisfying, crafting skill grind.\n\nLike all great sandbox MMORPGs, Runescape largely leaves players to decide for themselves what interests to pursue, whether it's completing quests, mastering their crafting skills, or player-killing out in the Wilderness. It's one of the few great mobile MMORPG games available, complete with cross-play and cross-progression across platforms. Those who want to get the full Runescape experience will likely want to Jagex recently announced the first new skill in Old School Runescape history, sailing, will be added later in 2025.\n\nFor those who want a little more Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (with a large dose of anime) in their MMORPG, Tower of Fantasy is exactly what the doctor ordered. It shares plenty of DNA with the more-popular (but also largely single-player) Genshin Impact, but distinguishes itself with its shared open world, public events, co-op dungeons and a more sci-fi aesthetic. There's always something to explore, and it's easy to climb any mountain or glide to any distant spot that sparks interest. Similar to Genshin, its character-swapping action combat combined with each character's various elemental affinities keeps Tower of Fantasy's moment-to-moment gameplay interesting, especially as players earn new characters, form teams, and create new combos.\n\nThough players are more than capable of playing through its main story and many of its challenges with the game's various free characters, be warned that this is a gacha game, and many of its best characters will be inaccessible without spending large sums of money on the premium currency used to make luck-of-the-draw pulls.\n\nLike Destiny 2, Warframe isn't what many players would think of when it comes to a traditional MMORPG, but it has so many elements of the genre--shared spaces with large numbers of players, instanced dungeons and raids, high levels of customizability, crafting, guilds, etc.--that it's an MMO in all but name. Warframe has been around for over a decade, and in that time has continued to deliver best-in-class third-person-shooter gameplay alongside game-changing updates that have introduced spaceship combat, large-scale open worlds, and new story content to its sci-fi, cyber-ninja-filled universe.\n\nWith a \"Very Positive\" average user review score after over half a million reviews and counting on Steam, Warframe continues to impress, and features cross-play and cross-progression across PC, iOS, and consoles. It's also available on Nintendo Switch, making it one of the best Switch MMORPG games. A fantasy-themed successor, Soulframe, is slated to receive an open pre-alpha playtest this year.\n\nA top-down fantasy MMORPG that will look and feel familiar to Runescape fans, Albion Online takes its sandbox gameplay even further, with an almost entirely player-run economy, classless combat, and a focus on full-loot PvP with large-scale guild battles over territory. With PvP being such a large part of the endgame, and the high stakes of losing one's items when dying in PvP, Albion Online won't be for everyone.\n\nThere is PvE as well, with dungeons to explore and bosses to slay. For more farming or crafting-minded players, there is also the ability to build a home or even buy a private island and transform it into a farm, too. Few MMORPGs in the modern age truly commit to a sandbox approach like Albion Online, making it more than worth checking out, but those who have no interest in PvP or are easily frustrated by setbacks may want to look elsewhere.\n\nFor those who want to live out a superhero (or villain) fantasy instead of the sword-and-sorcery kind, there's DC Universe Online. Players can create their character, choose from a number of different powers, customize their costume, and then fight alongside iconic DC characters while exploring locations like Gotham City, Metropolis, and Arkham Asylum. DC Universe Online has been going steady for 14 years now and still receives multiple new episodic story updates for free each year. The latest episode, the Lantern Corp-focused Fearful Day, released in May\n\nAll of DCUO's new story content is free, though those with an optional subscription will be able to enjoy more rewards, character slots, and powers to choose from. DCUO isn't the only superhero MMORPG on the block, but its wide availability on both consoles and PC (and cross-play between PlayStation and PC players) does make it an easy choice for this list.\n\nThrone and Liberty's gameplay will instantly feel familiar to anyone who has played an MMORPG in the last two decades, with tab-targeting combat that heavily evokes WoW's gameplay. Where Throne and Liberty differs is in its impressive graphical fidelity, focus on open-world PvP, skills defined by weapon type instead of classes, and the use of players' animal-shapeshifting forms in order to sprint, glide, and swim around its world of Solisium instead of traditional mounts. Though much of its endgame focus is on large guild vs. guild castle sieges, there is still plenty of PvE content as well, including world events and dungeons.\n\nGiven its free-to-play nature, its endgame can become a bit grindy, but those looking for a satisfying MMORPG without a subscription could do much worse than Throne and Liberty. It's also one of the few MMORPGs on consoles, and, unlike other console MMOs like ESO, supports cross-play between platforms. Its first free expansion, Wilds of Talandre, releases in March 2025 and will introduce a new zone to explore, solo dungeons for players to conquer, and a revamp of its weapon mastery system.\n\nKnown for its massive spaceship battles with thousands of players, EVE Online is still one of the best MMORPGs available after two decades on the market. A true sandbox MMO where players are largely left to pursue their own interests--whether that's engaging in PvP battles or starting a trade empire--the entirety of its player base plays on a single server, and the actions its players take leave a lasting impact both on its in-game universe and its bustling player-driven economy.\n\nEven if its actual gameplay isn't quite as exciting as it might sound on paper (get used to looking at lots of menus and going AFK while your ship completes assigned actions), it's the stakes behind each action that give everything in EVE Online's world meaning. EVE Online can certainly be confusing for new players, but for those who stick with it and get involved with its various player-run communities, it's easy to see why the game is still being played 20 years later.\n\nThe original superhero MMO, 2004's City of Heroes, has found new life after having been taken offline by NCSoft in 2012. A fan server called City of Heroes: Homecoming received an official license to operate the game in 2024, and now City of Heroes is once again playable completely for free, with a volunteer team keeping the game running and updated thanks to player donations.\n\nCity of Heroes stands out thanks to its detailed character creator, where players get to choose not only their powers, but their origin story, costume, and even backstory. From there it's up to players to protect Paragon City as a hero or join the forces of villainy on The Rogues Isle, battling foes and joining Supergroups of other players along the way. Though City of Heroes is somewhat dated by today's standards, there is a reason many players have fond memories of their time with the MMO, as it offers a unique experience that can't be found in other games within the genre, even as games like DC Universe Online and Cryptic's spiritual successor, Champions Online, have since looked to follow in City of Heroes' footsteps.\n\nBlack Desert is a highly in-depth MMORPG that places a major emphasis on combat systems and customization. You might have heard that Black Desert has one of the steepest learning curves of any MMO, and that statement wouldn't be inaccurate. There are over a dozen classes to pick from in Black Desert, and each one offers a totally different way of approaching combat. You'll mostly engage in combat with real players and AI enemies, both of which require the utmost precision and lightning-fast reflexes to defeat. However, Black Desert also offers siege combat, allowing you to participate in large-scale wars in PvE or PvP.\n\nIf combat isn't your main interest, Black Desert features a massively open world with a slew of content to explore. You can complete quests, level up a slew of skills, and hunt for new gear. You'll also be able to customize your character in truly staggering ways, as the game has hundreds of clothing and appearance options.\n\nOnce Human isn't your traditional World of Warcraft-type MMORPG, but it's still a massive role-playing game nonetheless. The game starts by you joining a server and going through a tutorial for how its various mechanics work. Then, you'll be on your own in a huge map that features differently-scaled areas. Each area is available for you to venture into from the start, but the enemies in an area will all be at a specific level. To successfully navigate the areas, you need to level up your character by completing main story quests, which mainly involve the same gameplay loop, and jobs for various NPCs at the hub center of each area.\n\nCombat in Once Human involves guns as well as melee and long-range weapons, and all of the weapons in the game can be crafted at your base. Base-building plays a major role in Once Human, as it's how you unlock a majority of the game's usable content and helps to level up your character. When you venture outside your base, though, you'll have to keep your character healthy, as Once Human is also a survival game that has a hunger, thirst, and stamina bar, all of which need to be constantly maintained. It's a unique MMO experience that relies less on multiplayer elements, but other real players are still packed into a server with you.\n\nThe First Descendant is a game that falls somewhere in between a few different genres. However, by definition, it's a massively multiplayer online game that features role-playing elements. At its core, however, The First Descendant is a looter shooter that allows you to team up with other players to complete PvE objectives and defeat bosses. There is no PvP combat, but there's certainly enough content to keep you invested. The looting, which comes from defeating enemies and quests, is mostly RNG, so you'll often have to grind for hours to unlock a piece of content for your character or weapons. The gameplay is extremely enjoyable, though, so you'll often have no quarrel with grinding out gear.\n\nPalia is one of the very few MMORPGs that doesn't feature any sort of combat. Instead, you're placed in a world where you're tasked with building your dream home. Set in a fantasy world, Palia also falls into the life-simulator genre, allowing you to build and create anything your imagination can cook up. Of course, not everything is handed to you, as you'll have to venture out into the world to explore the various towns and other environments. Everywhere in Palia is teeming with life, and you'll even meet other players in the various hub areas, or you can visit them at the home they've built. Palia also offers plenty of lore that you learn as you explore, making it feel like you're a part of a real community.",

    "fullText": "Slovenian Domen Prevc matched his brother's feat 10 years ago by clinching his first Four Hills title after finishing second in the final leg of the prestigious ski-jumping competition on Tuesday.\n\nThe World Cup leader jumped last in the first round on the Bischofshofen large hill but showed no signs of nerves to top the halfway rankings with 138 metres.\n\nA second jump of 138.5m for a combined 299.8 points meant he was nudged into second by last year's Four Hills winner and defending World Cup champion Daniel Tschofenig, who managed 137m and 140.5m for 303.9 in front of cheering home fans in Austria.\n\nThree-times Four Hills champion Ryoyu Kobayashi was third on the night.\n\nPrevc still triumphed over the four events, having won the German legs in Oberstdorf and Garmisch-Partenkirchen as part of seven victories in eight World Cup meets.\n\n\"You feel super blessed, you feel super amazing, super overwhelming,\" he told ARD.\n\n\"I'm super proud of my work, finally things came together at the right moment, at the right time. Winning the Golden Eagle is a childhood dream, a childhood dream that came true. I was dreaming about this moment.\"\n\nHe narrowly lost out to Ren Nikaido in Innsbruck at the weekend to end his hopes of a rare Four Hills clean sweep. Overall Prevc scored 1,195.6 in the Four Hills ahead of Austrian duo Jan Hörl and Stephan Embacher.\n\nThe 26-year-old world champion looks the favourite for Winter Olympic glory in Milan/Cortina next month and is part of the first sibling duo to win ski jumping's famed prize.\n\nDomen's older brother Peter Prevc won the Four Hills in 2016 and there is a further reason for a big party in the Prevc household.\n\nIn the women's World Cup, Domen's sister Nika Prevc wrapped up back-to-back wins in Austria's Villach as she extended her lead in the overall standings - having recently also won the women's Two Nights Tour.\n\nThe 2024 and 2025 World Cup champion edged Austrian Lisa Eder by 0.6 points, with Germany's Agnes Reisch picking up her first podium of the season on the normal hill.\n\nThe next World Cup ski-jumping action for the men is a super team event on the Zakopane large hill in Poland on Saturday, when the women take to the normal hill in Slovenia's Ljubno.",

    "description": "Let's ring in the New Year with a doomsday prediction!",
    "fullText": "Many people think the world is going to end in 2026. Man people think the world is going to end every year—maybe because the Bible said so, or The Simpsons said so—but this 2026-doomsday prediction seems to have a scientific basis. In a 1960 issue of Science magazine, Austrian scientist and polymath Heinz von Foerster detailed what he called the “Doomsday Equation,” a model he used to calculate the last day of civilization on earth. According to von Foerster (and probably Homer Simpson), The End is coming on Friday, November 13, 2026.\n\nFoerster was not a crank. A pioneer in computer science, artificial intelligence, physics, biophysics, and other academic disciplines, von Foerster worked with the Pentagon, and was named a Guggenheim fellow twice—so he was a respected academic, and kind of a big deal. His Doomsday paper is very real. Here’s a link to it in the November 1960 issue of Science and a screenshot:\n\nThe Doomsday Equation looked at 2,000 years of historical data about how fast the earth’s population grew–-there were 2.7 billion people in 1960—and extrapolated a continually accelerating rate of growth. According to von Foerster, Humanity’s ability to overcome natural checks on population would result in hyperbolic growth—faster-than-exponential—an accelerating curve of population growth which would reach “infinite” on November 13 of this year, at which point there would be no space left on the planet for any more people to be. “Our great-great-grandchildren will not starve to death,” Von Forester said. “They will be squeezed to death.”\n\nSo should we pack it in and prepare for the End Times and death by suffocation? Actually the opposite. Von Foerster’s Doomsday Equation was meant to illustrate the problem of overpopulation, but he wasn’t being entirely serious with the specifics of his prediction; the math works out, but the conclusion is tongue-in-cheek.\n\nSo yes, he was joking—November 13, 2026 will fall on Friday (scary), and it also happens to be Heinz von Foerster's 115th birthday—but he was joking to make a point. In the early 1960s, the population was growing at an alarming rate. The annual growth rate had climbed from roughly 1.7% to 1.9% throughout the 1950s, and by 1963, it had grown to  2.3%. So what happened?\n\nIt turned out Von Foerster had a lot in common with fellow scientist Disco Stu of the Can’t Stop the Learnin’ Disco Academies:\n\nIronically, 1960–1963 was the peak of global growth rates. Von Foerster’s (perhaps sardonic) solution was a control mechanism for population—a “peoplo-stat” where governments would carefully monitor and control the rate of people being born. But thankfully, we didn’t need eugenics-lite to solve the problem—like the best problems, it solved itself.\n\nThe rate of world population growth began slowing, as you can see from this chart from macrotrends.net. and the much feared “population bomb” of the 1960s fizzled out. Increased urbanization meant that people had one child to send to an exclusive nursery school instead of having 10 children to work as farmhands. Better medical care means more children live, so there’s no need to make “spares.” The end result: Population growth slowed through the decades to around 1% in the 2010s. At present, according to the UN, more than half of all countries have negative population growth rates. If these trends continue, the world population will peak in the mid-2080s at around 10.3 billion people and then begin a slow decline.\n\nNovember 13, 2026, will come and go, and chances are very good that you will not starve to death, get hit by an asteroid, or suddenly be crushed under the weight of all these damn people (unless you’re on a subway at rush hour).\n\nAs for overpopulation: The problem isn't that there are too many of us, but too few. We don’t really know what it will mean for the worldwide rate of reproduction to go negative, but it’s likely to mean a lot of 90-year-olds hobbling around and everyone younger trying to figure out how to care for them.  But, like the best problems, it’s far enough in the future that someone else will have to deal with it.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer World Champion and all round darts legend Steve Beaton has safely navigated the opening minefield at the PDC's Q-School 2026, booking his passage to the final stage after storming into the last 16 on day one. The Bronzed Adonis, still chiselled, still unflustered, still very much alive in the fight, can now exhale. What lies ahead from Thursday onward will be infinitely more punishing – but for now, the popular veteran, who reversed a decision to step off the main tour in 2024, has earned a brief ceasefire.\n\nKeeping him company in the hotel lounge is former World Cup winner John Henderson. The experienced Scot has done exactly what was required, nothing more, nothing less. Job done. Feet up. A couple of days’ rest secured, safe in the knowledge that when the real party starts, it’s always more fun when Hendo is invited.\n\nTHE PDC Q-SCHOOL: How to win a Pro Tour golden ticket\n\nFourteen other hopefuls have joined them in this early sanctuary, all punching their tickets to the final phase with days to spare – a priceless luxury in a week where energy, nerve and sanity are finite resources. They are:\n\nLloyd Walker (ENG), James Howard Jones (ENG), Jamie Kelling (ENG), Damien Grimes (IRE), James Evans-Bradford (ENG), Daniel Ayres (ENG), Killian McCormack (IRE), Jake Eichen (ENG), Joe Croft (ENG), Joseph Heywood (ENG), Paul Lewis (ENG), Charlie Large (ENG), Keelan Kay (ENG) and Jamie Tiley (SCO).\n\nMeanwhile, across the Channel in Germany, the same pattern is emerging. Among the early qualifiers in Kalkar is Brian Raman, the 2022 WDF World Championship quarter-finalist and former PDC Tour Card holder, who will be eyeing a swift return to the professional circuit after falling away at the end of 2024.\n\nStanding alongside him is a name that once sent shockwaves through the elite – Jeffrey de Zwaan. The Black Cobra. Two-time Players Championship winner. Former World Matchplay semi-finalist. Those achievements may sit almost a decade in the rear-view mirror, but at just 29, time has not yet closed its fist. There is still venom left.\n\nCompleting the European batch who earned passage to the final stage on day one: Sietse Lap (NED), Jeffrey Keen (NED), Dennis Van Bergen (NED), Jarno Bottenberg (NED), Jose Justicia (ESP), Gilbert van der Meijden (NED), Michael Hurtz (GER), Michael Van De Ven (NED), Michael De Mayer (BEL), Tomislav Rosandic (CRO), Mitja Gustorf (GER), Kris Mievis (BEL), Jiri Brejcha (CZE) and Luitsen Elzinga (NED).\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump hasn't minced words about the larger message he's trying to send the world with the U.S. military raid to capture Nicolás Maduro and spirit the deposed Venezuelan leader and his wife to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.\n\n“American dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" Trump declared following Maduro's capture, “will never be questioned again.”\n\nIn the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.\n\nTrump’s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\n“There’s been periods, Vietnam and Iraq, which have evoked questions about a return to American imperialism, but the U.S. leaders’ messages in those periods were cloaked in talk of democracy. The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven’t seen in a very long time.” said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland — where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons — and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to “get their act together” fighting drug cartels.\n\nTrump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is “going down” now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia — the epicenter of global cocaine production — \"sounds good to me.\"\n\nThe Republican president has also said his administration will “run” Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodríguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not “do what’s right.” He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.\n\n“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure — the oil infrastructure — and start making money for the country,” Trump said over the weekend.\n\nThe Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump‑aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non‑aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.\n\nLeaning on Monroe Doctrine, Trump puts neighbors on edge\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. “absolutely” needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.\n\n“If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,” Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, American leaders repeatedly turned to the Monroe Doctrine, a foundational U.S. foreign policy document authored by the nation's fifth president, which had been aimed at opposing European meddling in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nNow, Trump too is leaning on the doctrine to justify U.S. intervention in Venezuela and threaten action around the hemisphere in the name of protecting the safety and welfare of Americans.\n\n“Trump's rhetoric conjures up images of Teddy Roosevelt and gunboat diplomacy. The rhetoric is a return to a pre-Great War era,” Frantz said, referring to the 26th president's intercessions in unstable Caribbean and Central American economies as well as his backing of Panama's secession from Colombia in the name of the U.S. national interest.\n\nJust weeks before the ouster of Maduro, Trump rolled out a long-awaited National Security Strategy that had some disparate elements that seemed to be at odds with each other.\n\nOn one hand, Trump, who has long eschewed America's role in foreign wars, asserted that the administration would have a “predisposition to non-interventionism.” But the strategy document also made clear that the administration would push “to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nWith the ouster of Maduro, the administration has clearly doubled down on the latter.\n\n“This is the Western Hemisphere,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. \"This is where we live — and we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.”\n\nThe capture of Maduro and Trump's rhetoric could certainly be a level-setting moment for global leaders as they consider what may lay ahead in the final three years of Trump's second term.\n\nAt an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Colombian Ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said the raid in Venezuela was reminiscent of “the worst interference in our area in the past.”\n\n“Democracy cannot be defended or promoted through violence and coercion, and it cannot be superseded, either, by economic interests,” said Zalabata Torres, whose country requested the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are questioning whether Trump's actions have created a permission structure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has designs of capturing further territory from neighboring Ukraine, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has vowed to annex the self-ruled island of Taiwan.\n\n“What the president's done in this case has essentially given Putin and Xi Jinping a hall pass,\" said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, in an appearance on CNN.\n\nThe Russians, for their part, have condemned Trump's action in Venezuela. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the country's U.N. envoy, said the world body “cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge” to the world.\n\nAP writers Jennifer Peltz and Farnoush Amiri at the United Nations contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Former OpenAI employee Daniel Kokotajlo says progress to AGI is ‘somewhat slower’ than first predicted\n\nA leading artificial intelligence expert has rolled back his timeline for AI doom, saying it will take longer than he initially predicted for AI systems to be able to code autonomously and thus speed their own development toward superintelligence.\n\nDaniel Kokotajlo, a former employee of OpenAI, sparked an energetic debate in April by releasing AI 2027, a scenario that envisions unchecked AI development leading to the creation of a superintelligence, which – after outfoxing world leaders – destroys humanity.\n\nThe scenario rapidly won admirers and detractors. The US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to reference AI 2027 in an interview last May when discussing the US’s artificial intelligence arms race with China. Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of neuroscience at New York University, called the piece a “work of fiction” and various of its conclusions “pure science fiction mumbo jumbo”.\n\nTimelines for transformative artificial intelligence – sometimes called AGI (artificial general intelligence), or AI capable of replacing humans at most cognitive tasks – have become a fixture in communities devoted to AI safety. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 vastly accelerated these timelines, with officials and experts predicting the arrival of AGI within decades or years.\n\nKokotajlo and his team named 2027 as the year AI would achieve “fully autonomous coding” although they said that this was a “most likely” guess and some among them had longer timelines. Now, some doubts appear to be surfacing about the imminence of AGI, and whether the term is meaningful in the first place.\n\n“A lot of other people have been pushing their timelines further out in the past year, as they realise how jagged AI performance is,” said Malcolm Murray, an AI risk management expert and one of the authors of the International AI Safety Report.\n\n“For a scenario like AI 2027 to happen, [AI] would need a lot of more practical skills that are useful in real-world complexities. I think people are starting to realise the enormous inertia in the real world that will delay complete societal change.”\n\n“The term AGI made sense from far away, when AI systems were very narrow – playing chess, and playing Go,” said Henry Papadatos, the executive director of the French AI nonprofit SaferAI. “Now we have systems that are quite general already and the term does not mean as much.”\n\nKokotajlo’s AI 2027 relies on the idea that AI agents will fully automate coding and AI R&D by 2027, leading to an “intelligence explosion” in which AI agents create smarter and smarter versions of themselves, and then – in one possible ending – kill all humans by mid-2030 in order to make room for more solar panels and datacentres.\n\nHowever, in their update, Kokotajlo and his co-authors revise their expectations for when AI might be able to code autonomously, putting this as likely to happen in the early 2030s, as opposed to 2027. The new forecast sets 2034 as the new horizon for “superintelligence” and does not contain a guess for when AI may destroy humanity.\n\n“Things seem to be going somewhat slower than the AI 2027 scenario. Our timelines were longer than 2027 when we published and now they are a bit longer still,” wrote Kokotajlo in a post on X.\n\nCreating AIs that can do AI research is still firmly an aim of leading AI companies. The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, said in October that having an automated AI researcher by March 2028 was an “internal goal” of his company, but added: “We may totally fail at this goal.”\n\nAndrea Castagna, a Brussels-based AI policy researcher, said there were a number of complexities that dramatic AGI timelines do not address. “The fact that you have a superintelligent computer focused on military activity doesn’t mean you can integrate it into the strategic documents we have compiled for the last 20 years.\n\n“The more we develop AI, the more we see that the world is not science fiction. The world is a lot more complicated than that.”",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "fullText": "The race to build artificial general intelligence has become one of Silicon Valley's defining obsessions.\n\nHowever, Daniela Amodei, the president and cofounder of Anthropic, suggested that the term itself — a shorthand to describe when machines might reach human-level intelligence — may no longer be a useful way to think about where AI is headed.\n\n\"AGI is such a funny term,\" Amodei told CNBC in a recent interview. \"Many years ago, it was kind of a useful concept to say, 'When will artificial intelligence be as capable as a human?'\"\n\nToday, she said, that framing is breaking down.\n\n\"By some definitions of that, we've already surpassed that,\" Amodei said, pointing to areas like software development, where Anthropic's Claude model can now write code at a level comparable to many professional engineers, including some inside the company.\n\n\"That's crazy,\" she said, noting how quickly those capabilities have advanced.\n\nAt the same time, Amodei said AI systems still fall short in many areas that humans handle with ease, making it hard to declare that machines have reached any clear, universal benchmark for intelligence.\n\n\"Claude still can't do a lot of things that humans can do,\" she said.\n\nThat contradiction is why Amodei believes the concept of AGI itself may be losing relevance.\n\n\"I think maybe the construct itself is now wrong — or maybe not wrong, but just outdated,\" she said.\n\nAmodei's comments come as Anthropic and its rivals pour tens of billions of dollars into increasingly powerful models and data centers, the infrastructure required to run them.\n\nWhile some critics have said that large language models won't lead to true general intelligence without major breakthroughs, Amodei said progress hasn't shown signs of slowing.\n\n\"We don't know,\" she said of what breakthroughs may still be needed. \"Nothing slows down until it does.\"\n\nRather than fixating on a single end-state like AGI, Amodei said the more pressing question is how increasingly capable AI systems are integrated into real organizations — and how fast humans and institutions can adapt.\n\nEven if models continue to improve at a steady pace, she said, adoption can lag due to practical constraints such as change management, procurement, and determining where AI actually adds value.\n\nIn Amodei's view, the future of AI won't hinge on whether it meets a textbook definition of AGI — but on what these systems can do, where they fall short, and how society chooses to deploy them.",

    "description": "AMD CEO Lisa Su says AI will soon need \"10 yottaflops\" of compute — a scale of computing power the world has never built before.",
    "fullText": "AI needs so much computing power that AMD CEO Lisa Su put it in terms of a unit most people have never heard of: the yottaflop.\n\nSu said in her keynote at CES 2026 on Tuesday that the world would need more than \"10 yottaflops\" of compute — a measure of how fast a computer is — over the next five years to keep up with AI's growth.\n\n\"How many of you know what a yottaflop is?\" Su asked the audience. \"Raise your hand, please,\" she added, before quickly explaining the term herself when no one appeared to raise their hand.\n\n\"A yottaflop is a one followed by 24 zeros. So 10 yottaflop flops is 10,000 times more compute than we had in 2022,\" she said.\n\nIn computing, a flop is a single basic math calculation. A computer doing 1 billion calculations per second is equal to a gigaflop. A yottaflop is equivalent to a computer performing one septillion calculations per second.\n\nIn theory, scientists say 10 yottaflops would be enough computing power to run complex, atom-level simulations for entire planets.\n\nIn 2022, global AI compute stood at about one zettaflop — a one followed by 21 zeros. By 2025, Su said, that figure had already surged to more than 100 zettaflops.\n\n\"There's just never, ever been anything like this in the history of computing,\" she said at the Las Vegas conference.\n\nSu's 10 yottaflop prediction is about 5.6 million times faster than the most powerful supercomputer today — the US Department of Energy's El Capitan.\n\nHowever, powering today's AI compute is already putting a strain on the US power grid. The build-out of energy infrastructure would be a big bottleneck in scaling up AI compute power.\n\nDuring the keynote, Su also used the stage to unveil AMD's next generation of AI chips, including its MI455 GPU, as the company pushes deeper into supplying data-center hardware for customers such as OpenAI.",

Two of the key figures were goaltender Love Härenstam and captain Jack Berglund, who once again led the way for his team. When the final horn sounded, the celebration was unrestrained.\n\n“What a group! I’m so impressed with how we come out today. Wow. There’s so much character in this team, I don’t even know what to say. I’m so proud of the guys, and I’m so happy, I’m so happy,” said Jack Berglund to the Swedish TV channel SVT after the game.\n\nBerglund recorded the primary assist on Sweden’s first two goals of the game. In postgame interviews, he was quick to emphasize the team effort and how much the moment meant to him personally.\n\n“You can hardly win anything bigger than this. You grow up with this tournament. To have the honor of wearing the C is huge, and it doesn’t get any better than this. I’m so happy,” he said.\n\nHe continued: “We’ve been talking about this since the summer, and I felt that something good was coming. Everyone has just grown throughout the tournament,” said Jack Berglund to SVT after the final buzzer.\n\nWhen asked what he will remember most, Berglund did not hesitate with his answer.\n\n“It’s the brotherhood. In this group, we’re everything to each other. From the players and coaches to the staff, everyone around us and everyone who has supported us. But above all, it’s this small group. Wow. I have no words,” said Jack Berglund to SVT.\n\nAnother strong performer in the final was goaltender Love Härenstam. Czechia scored two late goals to cut into the lead, but before that Härenstam turned aside several high-danger chances. When the final horn sounded, he was visibly overcome with emotion.\n\n“The best feeling in the world. I’ve never been this happy. So much fun,” said Härenstam to SVT.\n\n“We play really well, and they do a good job six-on-five at the end. Then it’s an incredible feeling when Ivar Stenberg manages to poke the puck in and you can finally let the emotions out.

    "fullText": "The Chicago Blackhawks were excited as an organization when they selected Anton Frondell with the third overall pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. He has since been great as a teenager in the SHL, and now he is complete with the 2025-26 World Junior Championships.\n\nFrondell and Team Sweden won the Gold Medal on Monday night. This is their first Gold Medal at the World Junior Championships since 2012. Every player on the team, including Frondell, played incredibly and deserves this win.\n\nSweden defeated Czechia 4-2 to take the tournament. To get to the final game, they defeated their biggest rival in Team Finland, in a shootout (Frondell scored the winning goal). Along the way, they were great at defending, scoring, and performing on special teams.\n\nThe final three minutes of the 2026 world juniors featured enough chaos for an entire tournament, but in the end, Sweden took gold for the first time since 2012 and just the third time in tourney history. \n\n✍️: @THNRyanKennedy https://t.co/r0Bc0Sxffa\n\n— The Hockey News (@TheHockeyNews) January 6, 2026\n\nOn the Silver Medal-winning Czechia team was Blackhawks draft pick Vaclav Nestrasil. The 2025 25th overall pick had a wonderful tournament as well, including an assist in the Gold Medal Game. Once again, Czechia had a solid showing at this tournament, and Nestrasil was a big part of this one. He finished the tournament with two goals and six assists for eight points in 7 games.\n\nOn the Gold Medal-winning Sweden Team, Frondell was one of their top players. After advancing to the championship, he was named one of the \"3 Best Players on Team Sweden\". Once they won Gold, he was named to the Tournament All-Star Team, along with being called the Top Forward.\n\nFrondell scored a remarkable five goals in the tournament. He also added 3 assists for 8 points in 7 games played. Those stats, his individual awards, and the Gold Medal speak to how successful he was for his country. It won't be long before he is in Chicago's lineup, making an impact.\n\n\"Incredible,\" Frondell said when asked how it felt to win. \"I'm just so happy right now. It's crazy. I love it.\"\n\nThe young players on this team seemed to enjoy each other. Their chemistry and friendship were strong off the ice, which led to success on the ice.\n\n\"This group, it's fantastic how tight we are. We're like a big family.\" Frondell continued. \"It's important if you want to win.\"\n\nChicago did have a third player participating in the tournament. AJ Spellacy and Team USA went out during the quarterfinals. They were defeated in overtime by Team Finland, ending their quest to three-peat at the tournament. Spellacy finished with one goal and three assists for four points in five games.\n\nAhead of the Gold Medal Game, Canada defeated Finland to claim the Bronze Medal. There were no Blackhawks prospects involved in that game, but there was a lot of scouting that took place.\n\nGiven the nature of the up-and-down season that the Chicago Blackhawks are having at the NHL level, it is hard to predict where they will be drafting. However, there were a lot of great young players who showed their stuff throughout the tournament:\n\nGavin McKenna Silences Critics With Four Points In Bronze Medal Win For Canada At The World Junior Championship TSN's director of scouting said it was a \"mixed\" tournament for the top draft prospect, who tied for second among Canadians with 14 points in seven games\n\nWorld Juniors 2026: NHL Draft Eligibles Stenberg, McKenna Highlight Standouts From Medal Day Sweden did it. They're golden at the World Junior Championship for the first time since 2012, with Czechia and Canada completing the podium.

    "fullText": "Wincing Nick Kyrgios loses: Australian Open in doubt after loss at Brisbane International originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNick Kyrgios' hopes of playing in the Australian Open are under threat after a first-round defeat at the Brisbane International.\n\nThe 30-year-old was frequently seen wincing and grasping at his elbow during the straight sets defeat to American journeyman Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-3 6-4 on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn the early stages of the match, Kyrgios was smiling as he matched the world no.60 but when the American got on top, the mood turned sour with the Aussie looking pained with his right elbow.\n\nKovacevic snared the first set after converting the only break point he created, while Kyrgios didn't get any opportunities on his opponent's serve and only struck four winners to American's 14.\n\nMORE:Novak Djokovic makes shock decision ahead of the Australian Open\n\nIt was relatively even second set also, but Kyrgios gave up a break in the ninth game, before Kovacevic easily served the match out.\n\nKyrgios is relying on getting a wildcard off Tennis Australia to participate at the major, with it clear both parties are waiting to see if he will be fit enough to compete at Melbourne Park.\n\nThe Wimbledon finalist himself admitted he wouldn't accept a wildcard for the Australian Open unless he could compete at a high level.\n\n\"[John] Milliman gave his wildcard up for me when he was injured at the French Open,\" he said prior to the Brisbane International.\n\n\"He wasn't feeling 100 per cent, and that is where everything kicked off for me in my career. After that moment, I became a different player. I learned so much.\n\n\"If I am feeling great and I can get through this week and perform at the Australian Open ... people are paying good money to be there. If I can't give them the Kyrgios experience I would genuinely rather give it to someone that earned the wildcard and is in tip-top shape to start off something special in their career.\"\n\nIt wasn't a good sign for Kyrgios being beaten fairly easily by Kovacevic, who is a 27-year-old journeyman.\n\nIf it was just rust and lack of match fitness, Kyrgios still has time to get his game ready for the Australian Open with an appearance scheduled at the Kooyong Classic.\n\nBut after playing only six professional matches since being struck down with wrist and knee injuries in 2022, it's hard to believe we will ever see Kyrgios at his best again.\n\nThe best of Kyrgios - that we are likely to see again - is on the doubles court with Thanasi Kokkinakis or in the commentary box.",

    "description": "Raich Carter led the Lads to a famous FA Cup final victory in 1937. But Sunderland had another captain — every bit as much a hero as the man whose mural proudly looks down from the Blue House pub in his home town of Hendon.",
    "fullText": "The name Raich Carter is firmly embedded within the lore of Sunderland AFC and the hearts and minds of its followers.\n\nA son of Hendon, he was the local lad come good – a one-goal-every-two-games inside-forward who would lead the club to league and cup glory in the late 1930s and who is still, to this day, one of the youngest-ever captains to lead a side to top-flight English success. Having led the club to the English First Division in 1936 – that is the Premier League in old money for the millennial masses – he was then presented with the prospect of leading the side out at Wembley the following year in the FA Cup Final.\n\nMillwall had been successfully overcome in the semi-final three weeks earlier, with Sunderland showing the resilience to come from behind. The final whistle at Leeds Road, Huddersfield, brought the typical emotions – the elation that comes with success in such settings and, of course, the anticipation of the weeks ahead and the looming date with destiny as Sunderland aspired to return to Wearside laden with silverware.\n\nThe fortitude shown to come from behind would again be evident during English football’s end-of-season showpiece on 1st May as Preston, ahead at half-time, succumbed to the Wearside warriors in the second half, with Raich Carter amongst the goalscorers.\n\nBut Sunderland had another captain in 1937 — every bit as much a hero as the man whose mural proudly looks down from the Blue House pub in his home town of Hendon. Arguably more so.\n\nCaptain Frederick Robinson would have celebrated each FA Cup tie being won as much as anyone, but by the time Sunderland headed to Yorkshire in the hope Wembley was soon to follow, the focus of Captain Robinson, bred in the Barnes area, was on an upcoming journey that had more than memories and medals at stake.\n\nIn an increasingly polarised continent, Europe was coming to terms with the political phenomenon of fascism. Whilst some of its ingredients were hardly novel, the idea of absolutism and othering communities had been adequately packaged and presented with its symbology a nod to Roman history.\n\nThe adherence to such ideology had found allure, with Germany, Italy, and Spain the notable victims as an antithesis to the democratic will of the people became evident. In the latter, Spain, the 1936 election won by the Popular Front was both disputed and dismissed by Franco and his sycophants.\n\nA fascist disputing the electoral endorsement of the people. Wouldn’t happen now, eh…\n\nThe ensuing civil discord, carefully crafted by Franco, brought about the Spanish Civil War and, for the Spanish people, the demise of parliamentary democracy for four decades.\n\nBut some would not stand idly by. Not merely the Spanish people but ordinary decent people beyond Iberian borders.\n\nOne such individual was our very own Frederick Robinson. And by the time Sunderland and Preston were engaged in battle at Wembley he, with others from Sunderland, the wider North-East, and beyond, was the captain of the SS Knitsley as it made its way to Spain to bring aid to the beleaguered Basque people. Despite the trepidation of what lay ahead, on 1st May 1937 the crew of the ship had, temporarily, other matters to focus on.\n\nSunderland, their home-town club, were at Wembley, and for several hours these local heroes, part of what we know now as the International Brigade, were able to use the ship’s radio to keep abreast of how events were unfolding in London.\n\nThey celebrated. Briefly. Before long emotions were balanced and the precarious nature of their mission realised.\n\nSome made it to Spain. Some did not. Some took down aid whilst others took up arms. All to fight on behalf of the poor and disenfranchised. Their humanity and heroism is not diluted by the outcome of the conflict; it lies in their willingness to confront evil and the preparedness to make the final sacrifice if needed.\n\nThey are memorialised across modern Spain, from street name to statue, from plaque to plaza.\n\nThere is, however, no fitting memory or memorial to Captain Robinson and others from Sunderland within Wearside.\n\nIncredibly, if you want to see the inscribed names of those from Sunderland who fought Franco and fascism you have to go to the garden and grounds of Newcastle Civic Centre.\n\nThat, however, is about to change. With the assistance of the community that reared such heroes.\n\nSolidarity Sunderland are in the process of trying to ensure that those who, as the oft-espoused football chant says, were “one of our own” can have their voices heard and story told through a public memorial that accurately reflects their demonstrable opposition to the social disharmony and destruction of political poison.\n\nIf every second Saturday you go to the Stadium of Light to support a footballing International Brigade – all colours, creeds, and nationalities – then surely we can honour the local volunteers who were part of one that had so much more to lose than a football match.\n\nGet involved – your time and input can prove as invaluable as any financial contribution.\n\nFind out more at https://solidaritypark.com/solidarity-sunderland/\n\nPlease contact – solidaritysunderland@gmail.com",
