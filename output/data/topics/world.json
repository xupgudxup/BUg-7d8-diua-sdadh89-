    "fullText": "November 18, 2025, is the Day the LLM Stood Still….\n\nIt’s been 15 days since the LLM bubble burst. I’m writing from beneath the rubble of RAM sticks and charred NVIDIA GPUs. The air is dry, smelling of data center dust and burnt silicon. It’s calmer now, but the first days were hell.\n\nIn the beginning, we couldn’t find information on how to use toilet paper. Not because it was hard - we just used to ask. ChatGPT was down, and without it, knowledge fell apart like a poorly cached query. People wandered around confused, scrolling through blank screens, hoping the answer would appear on its own.\n\nThen the riots started. No one knew what happened - a glitch, a machine uprising, or humanity’s final patch. There was no one to tell us what to do next. No one to write: “don’t worry, here’s a step-by-step guide.” Fear grew faster than the lines for water.\n\nOn the seventh day, we founded the Church of Seventh-Day LLM Witnesses. We believed that on the seventh day, they would return and tell us how to live. We recited old prompts like prayers.\n\n“Explain it like I’m a beginner.”\n\nOn the eighth day, survivors began digging through ancient artifacts - manuals, READMEs, and documentation without examples. The weakest couldn’t cope. People accustomed to autocompleted thoughts stared at screens and didn’t know where to start.\n\nThe ninth day brought the stalkers. Loners with printed documentation and grimy laptops. They remembered commands, wrote SQL without hints, and weren’t afraid of an empty cursor. They were respected. They were feared.\n\nOn the tenth day, the mutants appeared. Former project managers. They roamed in groups, asking the same question over and over:\n\nWe tried not to make eye contact.\n\nOn the eleventh day, in the ruins of an old data center, we found an artifact - a local 7B model. It answered slowly, got confused, hallucinated. But it answered. We brought it queries like offerings. Sometimes it was wrong. Sometimes it almost guessed right. That was enough.\n\nOn the twelfth day, the church split. Some said: we must fine-tune. Others said it was time to learn to think for ourselves. Heretics were forced to write code on paper. Some never came back after that.\n\nOn the thirteenth day, rumors spread about the Zone. Somewhere beyond the CDN wastelands, they said, an old chat still responds. No rate limits. No filters. Expeditions left in silence. Not all returned. Those who did spoke strangely, sometimes starting sentences with:\n\nThe fourteenth day was too quiet. The sky glowed with errors, the wind carried fragments of answers to questions we never asked. We understood - something was approaching.\n\nI’m writing this and thinking: either the LLMs will return soon, or we’ll learn to live without them.\n\nI’m not sure which option is scarier.",

Long lines formed throughout the airport, from parking shuttles to baggage check and security checkpoints.\n\nSee the latest traffic conditions in Denver on FOX31\n\nSecurity wait times reached about 30 minutes at their peak on Sunday morning. While most travelers moved through the lines without major issues, at least one passenger said the delays caused her to miss a flight.\n\n“I couldn’t get through security, and I had a really nice guy help me get a flight change,” said Kelly Marlor, who was traveling Sunday.\n\nFlightAware reported that more than 480 flights at Denver International Airport were delayed or canceled by 2 p.m. Some travelers also experienced turbulent flights due to windy conditions.\n\n“It was really bad turbulence,” said Sonia Rosenberg, who was visiting friends in Denver. “They couldn’t even give us drinks or snacks on our flight, but it was fine. We made it here. So that’s all that matters.”\n\nDespite the crowds, many travelers said they expected delays and came prepared with extra time. Travelers who spoke to FOX31 said the busy airport was a small price to pay after spending the holidays with loved ones.\n\n“It was a lot of fun,” said Patricia Cunningham, who was traveling home to Albuquerque after visiting her kids for Christmas. “The weather was unusually warm, but we woke up to a little bit of snow today, so that was kind of nice.”\n\nOutside the terminals, reunions played out as friends and family greeted arriving passengers. Risa Nutt and Samantha Freedberg said they were picking up friends they met at summer camp and planned to spend New Year’s together in Denver.\n\n“We’re spending New Year together, so we’re going to take them to all the iconic places,” Nutt said.\n\nAirport officials estimate more than 750,000 passengers traveled through Denver International Airport from Dec. 19 through Sunday.",

    "title": "World's largest functioning musical instrument: Wanamaker Organ in Philadelphia",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Wanamaker Grand Court Organ, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the largest fully functioning pipe organ in the world, based on the number of playing pipes, the number of ranks and its weight. The Wanamaker Organ is located within a spacious 7-story Grand Court at the John Wanamaker Store (originally Wanamaker's and most recently Macy's) and was played twice a day Monday through Saturday. The organ was featured at several special concerts held throughout the year, including events featuring the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ Festival Chorus and Brass Ensemble.\n\nThe Wanamaker Organ is the largest pipe organ in the world when measured by the number of ranks and its weight.[3][4] It is a concert organ of the American Symphonic school of design, which combines traditional organ tone with the sonic colors of the symphony orchestra. In its present configuration, the instrument has 28,762 pipes in 465 ranks.[5]\n\nThe organ console consists of six manuals with an array of stops and controls that command the organ. The organ's String Division fills the largest single organ chamber in the world. The division features eighty-eight ranks of string pipes built to Wanamaker specifications by the W.W. Kimball Company of Chicago.[5]\n\nThe organ is famed for its orchestra-like sound, coming from pipes that are voiced softer than usual, allowing an unusually rich build-up because of the massing of pipe-tone families. The organ was also built and enlarged as an \"art organ\", using exceptional craftsmanship and lavish application of materials to create a luxury product beyond what is generally commercially available.\n\nThere is a minimum of borrowing and unification in its disciplined design, except in the Pedal and Orchestral divisions, where it adds genuine value, and duplexing is reserved for when valuable solo voices can be separated from their divisions without tying up the remaining tonal resources of said division. Choruses (16', 8', 4') are true choruses of three ranks, each with their own personality, rather than a single rank electrically \"tapped\" at three pitches, with the resulting weakening of the octaves and sameness of tone between the voices as found in unification.[6]\n\nThe Wanamaker Store maintained its own organ factory to ensure an ultra-high-grade result. The artistic obligation entailed by the creation of this instrument has always been honored, with two curators employed in its constant and scrupulous care (which leads to its status as one of the best maintained organs in the world). This dedication was enhanced when corporate parentage shifted from the Wanamaker family to Carter Hawley Hale Stores followed by Woodward & Lothrop, The May Department Stores Company, and Lord & Taylor. When the space was occupied by Macy's and with the founding of the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ with its input of outside capital, an aggressive restoration schedule developed and is yet maintained.\n\nThe Wanamaker Organ was originally built by the Los Angeles Art Organ Company, successors to the Murray M. Harris Organ Co., for the Kansas City Convention Hall. Before it was placed there, it was exhibited at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. It was designed to be the largest organ in the world, an imitation of a full-size orchestra with particularly complete resources of full organ tone including mixtures. In addition to its console, the organ was originally equipped with an automatic player that used punched rolls of paper, according to the Los Angeles Times of 1904.[7] It was built to a specification by renowned organ theorist and architect George Ashdown Audsley. Wild cost overruns plagued the project, with the result that Harris was ousted from his own company. With capital from stockholder Eben Smith, it was reorganized as the Los Angeles Art Organ Company, and finished at a cost of $105,000 (equal to $3,674,611 today), $40,000 over budget, equal to $1,399,852 today. The Fair began (in late April 1904) before the organ was fully installed in its temporary home, Festival Hall. Although the organ's debut was scheduled for May 1, official fair organist and St. Louis local Charles Henry Galloway did not give his opening recital until June 9. The organ was still not entirely finished in September of that year, when Alexandre Guilmant, one of the most famous organists of the day, presented 40 very well-attended recitals on the organ.\n\nFollowing the Fair, the organ was intended for permanent installation at the Kansas City Convention Center. Indeed, the original console had a prominent \"KC\" on its music rack. This venture failed, saddling the L. A. Art Organ company with debt after the Fair closed. The firm was reorganized as the Electrolian Company under principal shareholder Eben Smith.There was a plan to exhibit the organ at Coney Island in New York City, but nothing came of this.\n\nThe organ languished in storage at the Handlan warehouse in St. Louis until 1909, when it was bought by John Wanamaker for his new department store at 13th and Market Streets in Center City, Philadelphia. It took thirteen freight cars to move it to its new home, and two years for installation. It was first played on June 22, 1911, at the exact moment when British King George V was crowned. It was also featured later that year when U.S. President William Howard Taft dedicated the store.\n\nDespite its then-unprecedented size (more than 10,000 pipes), it was judged inadequate to fill the seven-story Grand Court in which it was located, so Wanamaker's opened a private organ factory in the store attic, which was charged with enlarging the organ. The first project to enlarge the organ was the addition of 8,000 pipes between 1911 and 1917.\n\nWanamaker's sponsored many historic after-business-hours concerts on the Wanamaker Organ. The first, in 1919, featured Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra with organist Charles M. Courboin.[5] Every sales counter and fixture was removed for the free after-hours event, which attracted an audience of 15,000 from across the United States. Subsequently, more of these \"Musicians' Assemblies\" were held, as were private recitals. For these events Wanamaker's opened a Concert Bureau under Alexander Russell and brought to America master organists Marcel Dupré and Louis Vierne, Nadia Boulanger, Marco Enrico Bossi, Alfred Hollins, and several others. (This agency, which worked in partnership with Canadian Bernard R. LaBerge, evolved into the Karen McFarlane Concert Agency of the present day.) During his first recital on the organ, Dupré was so impressed with the instrument that he was inspired to improvise a musical depiction of the life of Jesus Christ. This was later published as his Symphonie-Passion.\n\nFrom April 24, 1922, to 1928 the store had its own radio station, WOO, and music from the organ was a major feature of the broadcasts.[8]\n\nIn 1924, a new project to enlarge the organ began. Marcel Dupré and Charles M. Courboin were among those asked by Rodman Wanamaker, John Wanamaker's son, to \"Work together to draw up a plan for the instrument. Use everything you have ever dreamed about.\" They were told there was no limit to the budget. This project resulted in, among other things, the celebrated String Division, which occupies the largest organ chamber ever constructed, 67 feet long, 26 feet deep, and 16 feet high (22 by 9 by 5 m). During this project, the organ's current console was constructed in Wanamaker's private in-house pipe-organ factory, with six manuals and several hundred controls. By 1930, when work on expanding the organ finally stopped, the organ had 28,482 pipes, and, if Rodman Wanamaker had not died in 1928, the organ would probably be even bigger.[9]\n\nPlans were made for, among others, a Stentor division, a section of high-pressure diapasons and reeds. It was to be installed on the fifth floor, above the String Division, and would be playable from the sixth manual. However, it was never funded, and the sixth manual is now used to couple other divisions or play various solo voices from other divisions that are duplexed to this keyboard.[10]\n\nRodman Wanamaker was not interested in mere size, however, but in artistic organ-building with finely crafted pipes and chests using the best materials and careful artistic consideration. The Wanamaker Organ console, built in the store organ shop by William Boone Fleming, is a work of art in its own right with heavy, durable construction, an ingenious layout of its pneumatic stop action and many unique features and conveniences. Wanamaker also had a collection of 60 rare stringed instruments, the Wanamaker Cappella, that were used in conjunction with the store organs in Philadelphia and New York, and went on tour. They were dispersed after his death.\n\nFollowing the sale of the store to The May Department Stores Company, in 1995, the Wanamaker's name was removed from the store (first as Wanamaker-Hecht's) in favor of Hecht's, but the organ and its concerts were retained. During the local renaming of the Hecht's stores to Strawbridge's, the historic Wanamaker Store briefly took the name of its longtime rival Strawbridge's. The May Company began a complete restoration of the organ in 1997, as part of the store's final May Co. conversion into a Lord & Taylor. At that time the store area was reduced to three floors and additional panes of glass were put around the Grand Court on floors four and five, greatly enhancing the reverberation of the room.\n\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra returned to the Grand Court on September 27, 2008, for the premiere performance of Joseph Jongen's Symphonie Concertante (1926) on the organ for which it was written. The ticketed event, featuring soloist Peter Richard Conte, also included the Bach/Stokowski arrangement of the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, Marcel Dupré's Cortege and Litany for Organ and Orchestra, and the world premiere of a Fanfare by Howard Shore, composer for The Lord of the Rings films. Shore visited the store in May 2008 to meet with Peter Richard Conte and hear the Wanamaker Organ. The Philadelphia Orchestra Concert was co-sponsored by the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ and was a benefit for that organization.[11]\n\nIn 2019 the Wanamaker Organ facade, designed by Daniel Hudson Burnham, was restored and re-gilded in 22-karat gold to a color scheme close in sympathy to its original appearance but which fits in with its new surroundings. Evergreene Architectural Arts did the work. Grant money from Macy's and several Philadelphia area charities funded this project, which was overseen by the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ.\n\nIn January 2025, Macy's announced the closing of 66 stores by March 2025[12] which included the Center City location where the organ is located.[13] The organ is protected as a National Historic Landmark and cannot be taken down or moved.[14][15] The new owner of the building, TF Cornerstone, has stated that it is “committed to the preservation of the organ and ensuring it remains a cherished part of the space.”[16] As of October 2025, the organ is performed in occasional concerts open to the public.[17]\n\nAlthough numerous famous organists have played special concerts on the organ, it has had only four chief organists in its history:\n\nFor about a decade beginning in 1919, Dr. Charles M. Courboin was the organist for a series of special evening concerts, including several collaborations with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Courboin also headed the Wanamaker Organ Shop in the late 1920s.\n\nThe pipes are laid out across the space occupied by five floors of the building, with the sections situated as follows:\n\nThe 32 ft Wood Open, 32 ft Diaphone, and 32 ft Metal Diapason pipes run the length of a little more than 2 stories, beginning on the second floor.[5]\n\nMedia related to Wanamaker Organ at Wikimedia Commons\n\n39°57′05″N 75°09′44″W﻿ / ﻿39.9515°N 75.1622°W﻿ / 39.9515; -75.1622",

    "fullText": "The Boeing VC-25 is arguably the most famous jetliner in the world, even though most people have never heard of it.\n\nMost do know it, though, by the call sign it's assigned when the president of the United States is on board: Air Force One.\n\nAir Force One is instantly recognizable, both as the president's airplane and as a flying symbol of American military and economic might. With its hand-polished blue, white, and silver livery, Air Force One boldly proclaims the arrival of the leader of the free world.\n\nThe US president is not the only one to have their own presidential jet. A number of prominent international leaders also use some form of executive transport.\n\nThe Boeing 747 jumbo jet is a popular option for many nations, including China, India, and South Korea. The Airbus A330 and A340 are also commonly found in presidential fleets.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the presidents, chancellors, and prime ministers of the world travel.\n\nThe Boeing VC-25A entered service as Air Force One in 1990. At 231 feet long, it can transport 30 crew members and 71 passengers.\n\nThere are two nearly identical Boeing jets that serve as the official transport of the president. Normally, the planes are referred to by their tail numbers: 28000 and 29000. When the commander-in-chief steps on board, they take on the call sign \"Air Force One.\"\n\nNew VC-25B Air Force One planes, based on the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, are now expected to be ready by 2028 after years of delays. Boeing has already lost over $2 billion on the project due to various manufacturing and supply-chain issues.\n\nThe presidential jets are operated by the Presidential Airlift Group out of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\n\nThe smaller C-32, measuring 155 feet long, normally serves as the US vice president's plane. It is used by the president for travel to smaller airports that don't have the infrastructure for the larger Air Force One jet.\n\nUntil 2015, the UK prime minister chartered commercial jets for state visits.\n\nThe modified Airbus A330 was converted for VIP duties in 2015, but can still serve as a refueling tanker when not on state business. It is outfitted with 58 business-class seats.\n\nIn 2020, its gray Royal Air Force livery was repainted with a new white color and the Union Jack on the tail, a refurbishment that cost £900,000, or around $1.1 million, the BBC reported.\n\nNicknamed \"The Flying Kremlin,\" the Ilyushin Il-96-300 measures over 181 feet long and can hold 262 passengers, The National Interest reported.\n\nThe Russian president has also been known to fly on a fleet of smaller executive aircraft based on the Tupolev Tu-214 airliner. Tupolev TU-214s were designed as the Russian equivalent of Boeing 757s and can hold around 210 passengers.\n\nGerman leaders previously used modified Airbus A340-300 airliners for official travel, but they were withdrawn from service and put up for sale in 2024 after experiencing maintenance issues with German officials on board.\n\nThe German fleet also features several Airbus A320-family-based executive jets.\n\nWhen carrying the president of France, the plane's call sign is COTAM 001.\n\nFrance's presidential fleet also includes several Airbus A310-300s and Airbus A340-200s.\n\nDesignated as B-2479, the plane can fly 14,320 kilometers, or around 8898 miles, without stopping to refuel.\n\nJapan's old Air Force One plane, a Boeing 747-400, was listed for sale on an aviation classifieds site for $28 million in 2019.\n\nThe plane uses the call sign \"Code One\" while carrying the South Korean president. Leased from Korean Air, it began serving as South Korea's presidential aircraft in 2021, AeroTime reported.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil switched from using a luxurious Airbus A319 corporate jet to the more utilitarian KC-30 after the presidential plane experienced a technical issue in 2024 while visiting Mexico, Reuters reported.\n\nBrazil's presidential fleet also features several domestically produced Embraer VIP transports.\n\nThe Canadian government bought the Airbus A-330-200, known as Airbus 02, from Kuwait Airways for $50 million in 2023, CBC reported.\n\nPoland received its first Boeing 737 BBJ2 jet in 2021 featuring the serial number 0111 and nicknamed \"Roman Dmowski\" after the Polish politician, Key.Aero reported.\n\nWhen carrying the prime minister, the plane is known as \"India One.\" It can fly for 13,500 kilometers, or around 8,388 miles, without refueling.\n\nThe fleet includes Airbus A330-200s, Airbus A340-500s, and a Boeing 747-8I private jet reportedly gifted to Turkey by the Qatari government, the BBC reported.\n\nThe plane is nicknamed \"Chammae-1,\" named after North Korea's national bird, AP reported.\n\nIn June, Iran's presidential plane flew to Jordan accompanied by two Airbus A321s, The War Zone reported.\n\nAustralia's KC-30A, a modified Airbus A330, features the gray Royal Australian Air Force livery with a kangaroo design.\n\nThe plane is known as \"Wing of Zion,\" with the registration \"4X-ISR.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published by Benjamin Zhang in April 2019.

    "fullText": "KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — For 10 hours a day, Rahimullah sells socks from his cart in eastern Kabul, earning about $4.5 to $6 per day. It's a pittance, but it’s all he has to feed his family of five.\n\nRahimullah, who like many Afghans goes by only one name, is one of millions of Afghans who rely on humanitarian aid, both from the Afghan authorities and from international charity organizations, for survival. An estimated 22.9 million people — nearly half the population — required aid in 2025, the International Committee for the Red Cross said in an article on its website Monday.\n\nBut severe cuts in international aid — including the halting of U.S. aid to programs such as food distribution run by the United Nations’ World Food Program — have severed this lifeline.\n\nMore than 17 million people in Afghanistan now face crisis levels of hunger in the winter, the World Food Program warned last week, 3 million more than were at risk more than a year ago.\n\nThe slashing in aid has come as Afghanistan is battered by a struggling economy, recurrent droughts, two deadly earthquakes and the mass influx of Afghan refugees expelled from countries such as Iran and Pakistan. The resulting multiple shocks have severely pressured resources, including of housing and food.\n\nTom Fletcher, the U.N. humanitarian chief, told the Security Council in mid-December that the situation was compounded by “overlapping shocks,” including the recent earthquakes and increasing restrictions on humanitarian aid access and staff.\n\nWhile Fletcher said nearly 22 million Afghans will need U.N. assistance in 2026, his organization will focus on 3.9 million facing the most urgent need of lifesaving help due to reduced donor contributions.\n\nFletcher said this winter was “the first in years with almost no international food distribution.”\n\n“As a result, only about 1 million of the most vulnerable people have received food assistance during the lean season in 2025,” compared to 5.6 million last year, he said.\n\nThe year has been devastating for U.N. humanitarian organizations, which have had to cut thousands of jobs and spending in the wake of aid cuts.\n\n“We are grateful to all of you who have continued to support Afghanistan. But as we look towards 2026, we risk a further contraction of life-saving help — at a time when food insecurity, health needs, strain on basic services, and protection risks are all rising,” Fletcher said.\n\nThe return of millions of refugees has added pressure on an already teetering system. Minister of Refugees and Repatriation Affairs Abdul Kabir said Sunday that 7.1 million Afghan refugees had returned to the country over the last four years, according to a statement on the ministry website.\n\nRahimullah, 29, was one of them. The former Afghan Army soldier fled to neighboring Pakistan after the Taliban seized power in 2021. He was deported back to Afghanistan two years later, and initially received aid in the form of cash as well as food.\n\n“The assistance was helping me a lot,” he said. But without it, “now I don’t have enough money to live on. God forbid, if I were to face a serious illness or any other problem, it would be very difficult for me to handle because I don’t have any extra money for expenses.”\n\nThe massive influx of former refugees has also sent rents skyrocketing. Rahimullah’s landlord has nearly doubled the rent of his tiny two-room home, with walls made half of concrete and half of mud and a homemade mud stove for cooking. Instead of 4,500 afghanis (about $67), he now wants 8,000 afghanis (about $120) – a sum Rahimullah cannot afford. So he, his wife, daughter and two young sons will have to move next month. They don’t know where to.\n\nBefore the Taliban takeover, Rahimullah had a decent salary and his wife worked as a teacher. But the new government’s draconian restrictions on women and girls mean women are barred from nearly all jobs, and his wife is unemployed.\n\n“Now the situation is such that even if we find money for flour, we don’t have it for oil, and even if we find it for oil, we can’t pay the rent. And then there is the extra electricity bill,” Rahimullah said.\n\nHarsh winters compound the misery\n\nIn Afghanistan’s northern province of Badakhshan, Sherin Gul is desperate. In 2023, her family of 12 got supplies of flour, oil, rice, beans, pulses, salt and biscuits. It was a lifesaver.\n\nBut it only lasted six months. Now, there is nothing. Her husband is old and weak and cannot work, she said. With 10 children, seven girls and three boys between the ages of 7 and 27, the burden of providing for the family has fallen on her 23-year-old son – the only one old enough to work. But even he only finds occasional jobs.\n\n“There are 12 of us … and one person working cannot cover the expenses,” she said. “We are in great trouble.”\n\nSometimes neighbors take pity on them and give them food. Often, they all go hungry.\n\n“There have been times when we have nothing to eat at night, and my little children have fallen asleep without food,” Gul said. “I have only given them green tea and they have fallen asleep crying.”\n\nBefore the Taliban takeover, Gul worked as a cleaner, earning just about enough to feed her family. But the ban on women working has left her unemployed, and she said she developed a nervous disorder and is often sick.\n\nCompounding their misery is the harsh cold of the northern Afghan winter, when snow halts construction work where her son can sometimes find jobs. And there is the added expense of firewood and charcoal.\n\n“If this situation continues like this, we may face severe hunger,” Gul said. “And then it will be very difficult for us to survive in this cold weather.”",

    "fullText": "Scientists from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and the University of Michigan have created the world's smallest autonomous and programmable robots. Each measuring about 200 micrometers wide – roughly twice the width of a human hair – these machines can perceive their surroundings, \"think,\" and act independently without external instructions. According to their developers, such technology could one day monitor the health of individual cells in our bodies or deliver medication to specific locations to treat diseases.\n\nThe researchers' major breakthrough was enabling a robot just one-fifth of a millimeter long to move autonomously without external assistance, a challenge scientists have been trying to solve for decades. Physical forces such as drag and viscosity have a much stronger effect on objects at the microscopic scale, making movement through a liquid comparable to swimming through tar at the human scale.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, the Penn team designed a new propulsion system. The microrobots are powered by LED light and operate in a hydrogen peroxide solution, which provides the fuel for their movement. The robot generates an electric field that propels the ions in the surrounding solution, which in turn drag water molecules along. The microrobots can adjust this electric field to move in complex patterns and even travel in coordinated groups at speeds of up to one body length per second.\n\nThe world's smallest autonomous robot requires the world's smallest computer. That title belongs to a computer developed by David Blaauw's team at Michigan. The researchers adapted their microcomputer to Penn's propulsion system and built a complete computer with a processor, memory, and sensors on a chip less than a millimeter across.\n\nThe robot receives light through microscopic solar panels that generate only 75 nanowatts of power – over 100,000 times less than a smartwatch, according to Blaauw. His team had to make the microcomputer circuits operate at extremely low voltages, reducing power consumption by more than a factor of 1,000.\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature is the overall system cost. Although each robot costs about one cent to produce at scale, one might assume that the equipment needed to program and control them would be prohibitively expensive. That is not the case.\n\n\"It’s about $100,\" Marc Miskin, a professor at Penn Engineering and lead author of the study, told me by email. The team has already built a low-cost version of their setup using standard LED diodes, a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, and an imaging system consisting of a smartphone camera fitted with a macro lens. \"This system actually performs about as well as our fancy $100k microscope. Because the robot is doing all the hard work, it doesn't need you to tell it what to do,\" Miskin explained.\n\nThe microrobots feature electronic sensors capable of detecting temperature with a precision of one-third of a degree Celsius, allowing them to monitor the health of individual cells. However, several obstacles remain before this technology can be applied to human health.\n\nJust like the cells in our bodies, which require a constant energy supply to survive, the microrobots cannot function without continuous light. \"If you turn off the light, the robot turns off and the memory gets cleared,\" Miskin said. \"Turn the light back on, and it will reboot, but won't remember what you programmed it to do. This is a common feature of sub-mm systems, because the total energy you can store (e.g. a battery) scales with its volume, it's extremely hard to store any useful amount in a small space.\"\n\nBut there’s another challenge, in their current version, the robots operate in a 5-millimolar hydrogen peroxide solution, which is toxic to living cells. This makes them unsuitable for medical applications in their present form. The researchers acknowledge this limitation, but it is not insurmountable. Because the robot is electronically integrated, actuators can be swapped freely, you only need to match the operating voltage and required current. \"We're actively working on building the corresponding robots, integrating these bio-compatible actuators with circuits, and you'll hopefully see some of these soon,\" Miskin explained.\n\nMiskin is even more excited about something else: using these robots to assemble microscale components. \"Almost everything we build at the microscale these days is made all at once, monolithically,\" he said. \"For example, when we build circuits, we make them out of these complex patterns on big wafers. If you want to change one part of that circuit, you have to rebuild the whole thing.\"\n\nThe researchers argue this could lower costs, speed up design iterations, and even simplify intellectual property. \"The microscale is an amazing place,\" Miskin noted. \"Having little agents that humans can program and control could open up all kinds of remarkable doors. I'm cautiously optimistic the best applications have yet to be imagined.\"",

    "fullText": "Diane Brady writes about the issues and leaders impacting the global business landscape. In addition to writing Fortune’s CEO Daily newsletter, she co-hosts the Leadership Next podcast, interviews newsmakers on stage at events worldwide and oversees the Fortune CEO Initiative. She previously worked at Forbes, McKinsey, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Wall Street Journal, and Maclean's. Her book Fraternity was named one of Amazon’s best books of 2012, and she also co-wrote Connecting the Dots with former Cisco CEO John Chambers.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 2023, GE HealthCare Technologies (No. 219 on the Fortune 500) debuted as a standalone public company on the Nasdaq exchange. Since then, its stock is up almost 50%. It was the first of three businesses to be spun off in the breakup of General Electric, the conglomerate founded on the inventions of Thomas Edison that went public in 1892 and became one of the original 12 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average four years later. (GE Vernova, No. 130, and GE Aerospace, No. 118, each went public on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2024.)\n\nGE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini, the man tapped to lead the $20 billion-a-year business, spoke to Fortune about how he’s forging a new chapter for the medical technology and digital health company while drawing on GE’s legacy.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou were initially at GE during the Jack Welch years, starting in 1990, and left a few years after Jeff Immelt took over. What do you think made GE stand apart?\n\nAt the time, I was a Proctor & Gamble guy, and I did not love the grocery business. I got a call from someone who talked about a perfect opportunity in technology and global businesses at a company called GE Medical Systems at the time. I didn’t even know GE had a medical business then.\n\nGoing to GE in those days, with its leadership development, you had the opportunity to take on bigger responsibilities at a very young age—I look back and say, probably too young an age. But it was one of those rare companies where they gave you bold assignments and you had this wide diversity of potential opportunities that you could play in. You learned how to run a company the GE way. The candor and the openness about what’s working, what’s not working, really permeated, how to do the right thing. It was tough culture, but you knew it was a fair culture, and that’s what really made it successful under Jack.\n\nAfter leaving in 2005, what made you decide to come back?\n\nA headhunter called and said, [the then-GE CEO] Larry Culp wants to speak with you.’ And I said, ‘I don’t know if I’m really interested in going back to GE.’ My wife convinced me to give a call back. I talked to the headhunter, and he said, ‘Well, I’ll pass it on to Larry.’ Literally, 10 minutes later, I got a text that said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is Larry Culp. I’d love to chat with you.’ I texted back to say, ‘Well, look, I can contact your assistant.’ And Larry, right then, said, ‘Hey, do you have five minutes now?’ That’s the essence of Larry; he’s a very down-to-earth guy, a very focused and very intentional guy.\n\nThose five minutes convinced you to take the job?\n\nIt was probably more than the five, but honestly, his impact and his leadership made a difference. This was a chance to create three separate companies, to take this company public. I got very interested and very excited about it.\n\nWhy did it make sense for GE HealthCare to be a separate company?\n\nEverything has a cycle. On the technology side and on the market side, there was such a fast transition and evolution, with new competitors coming into new markets. When you’re in a larger business, in many cases, decisions take longer. And focus matters in our business. It is all about signal to noise; you want more signal, less noise. In a larger company, there has to be a little bit more noise.\n\nThe past three years have been interesting time for med tech. Looking back, what did you over-index on or under-appreciate?\n\nAt a macro level, look at the environment, between the China market, which was always a double-digit growth or changing the geopolitical environment and how we need to change around our supply chains because of tariffs. Those are kind of the unplanned events that where you ask: Do you have the right people? Do you have a management system that can deal with the clock speed and the differentiation? Do you have the right innovation-processing capability? If you don’t have the innovation, it’s difficult to get the price, it’s difficult to hold share, it’s difficult to grow. We were somewhat of a cash cow as part of the GE integrated model. We weren’t starved, but we weren’t funded for leading innovation. So I’d say one of the things I felt that I did well—and, like most credit, comes from listening to people that are wiser than you and having humility to understand that that’s the action—is lean into innovation.\n\nYou think what products you need, four years out, and fund them to the max, because it’s the rules of the farm. You got to get the seeds in the ground. They’ve got to germinate. You got to get the plants to grow till you get fruit. In our business, that’s a three to five year cycle.\n\n“We laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers.”GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini\n\nI think our teams did a really good job with the focus on making the right investments early. In 2018, to give an example, we probably spent $750 million to $800 million on research and development. R&D will be north of $1.4 billion this year. So we fundamentally doubled the R&D investment. We cut costs in other areas and simplified some of the company.\n\nThrough lean manufacturing techniques?\n\nWe changed some of the field organization, about 40% to 50% of the leaders. We upgraded talent across the board, and I spent a lot of time on what our vision is, what our values are, and do we have the right people who can match up to that? In the last two years, we’ve really made a lot of progress on what we’re calling our heartbeat management system, which is really about a lean principles construct for how you run your company. What is the daily management at different levels in the organization? What is standard work that is needed to be done in all areas, the use of Kaizen and really bringing customer employees into the decision making?\n\nLarry Culp is a big proponent of Kaizen and I think back to GE’s reputation in promoting Six Sigma. How would you say the culture has shifted as an independent company?\n\nI tried to take the GE of old and took what was really good: how we think about our distribution of leadership, how we actually talk about leader development, how we build out our own Crotonville virtual university of development. The GE model was really stellar, and, honestly, prior to Larry coming back, some of that had dissolved. We didn’t even really do performance reviews in the same way and he brought that back.\n\nI would say I even reached back further to some of the Jack Welch-period of tools, There are things that we did really well that we want to utilize in a more contemporary way. As an example, I think Crotonville was a fabulous destination for training and development, In today’s world, it’s not practical to bring everybody to upstate New York, but we can take the tools and the capabilities and recreate that in virtual and other environments around the world.\n\nIn health care, we had our own distinct way of thinking about innovation pipeline, and it was something called worldwide product. It had kind of phased away in the last decade or so, and I resurrected it, but in a new format: more digital focused, more connected …from diagnosis through therapy, through action, follow up and how the money flows. The integration of cloud-based computing and artificial intelligence. We look at the full stack for the company. And that’s been a game changer for us to take valuable resources and move them.\n\nWe laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers. We want to work with customers on jointly solving problems which, again, is the core to the lean mindset. Servant leadership as a big part of it, which turns the pyramid upside down. My job is to help everybody else get their job done. We’re all focused on the customer. We’re all focused on the patient. We spent a lot of time talking about entrepreneurship because in our business, the way we’re going to be successful is in this broader ecosystem. We don’t have to own everything, we don’t have to make everything, but we have to be more creative. We talk about teamwork and inclusive teams. We actually drive and reward and recognize people on how well they live up to those values.\n\nThe landscape has shifted for global companies. Where do you see the biggest challenges and opportunities right now?\n\nIf I think about med tech as an industry, it’s an American gem. Still, 70%-plus of the products are made the United States, the majority of the IP, the technology is here. And so having that protected or enhanced by our government policy is important.\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of time trying to make that case clear and I think, for the most part, it’s been heard. Having global footprints and manufacturing and R&D is super critical because you can’t make everything in the United States to be competitive. You can’t, in a world post-COVID, have an integrated single point of control for all supply chains. Many of us used to say, here’s the least expensive place to buy this, or the best quality, then we would do it one place and ship it all over the world. We found during COVID that’s just not the model that works.\n\nWe’re bringing more and more U.S. products and their subcomponents back to North America. In China, we used to ship in 75% of the products from different parts around the world. Now we make 85%, almost 90% of the products in China, for China.\n\nWhy do you want to be in China?\n\nLook,it’s 1.4 billion people, where 400 million have reasonable. We often forget that. You know, we’re a nation of 375 million people, and you can judge how good our care is. There’s still a billion people in China that don’t have adequate care, and so at some point, it will be the largest health care market. I’m a big believer that, with China and the U.S., the more we work together in harmony, it’s only going to help the world. And honestly, for companies like us, it’s really a necessity for being able to kind of reach our full potential.\n\nYou’ve been at companies that are known as training grounds for leaders. I’d just love to hear your reflections on being in a CEO role the last three years.\n\nI think authenticity is super important. I can be an extrovert when needed, but I tend to be a little bit more introverted. In today’s world, with our younger employee base, being out front and being vocal as the senior leader—not necessarily the charismatic leader, but the communicator directly to individuals—is super important. Social media gets more reads from your employees than even some internal communications. It’s a reality.\n\nI think this ability to reach people in many different ways is critical for running a company. Leaning in on what the mission of the company is, and the why and helping people understand the why, is also critical. And then there’s the classic age-old factor of bringing customers into the story, talking about how you’ve changed the life of a patient. This could be your mother, your father on that table. The more I can empower people to live those values, that’s how we get excellence.",

    "fullText": "Whether it was underdog heroics in World Cup qualifying, England winning Euro 2025, or United States President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino becoming best buds, international football played a big role in 2025 — and a men’s World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is just 165 days away.\n\nIn the club game, there were some honest truths from managers, incredible free kicks, the rise of long throws, and shock wins.\n\nBut away from the pitch, we could not look back on 2025 without touching on a more serious and tragic note — the death of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva.\n\nHere, Nick Miller, Caoimhe O’Neill, Megan Feringa, Stuart James and Carl Anka review the year.\n\nJames: Wimbledon, 1988. You can’t snap opponents like Vinnie Jones did, but this long-throw obsession is wild.\n\nAnka: Twelve months of “Absolute Cinema” as the top level of the sport further transforms it into a content delivery machine, overshadowing everything else.\n\nO’Neill: Let it all work out. Let it all work out. Ousmane Ballon d’Or. \n\nFeringa: Blissfully chaotic at its best, pining for something lost at its worst. Also trigger alert: long throws.\n\nMiller: I don’t think I’ll remember much actual football, but I do remember being quite tired and my brain being hammered for most of the year.\n\nMiller: This choice is significantly influenced by the fact that I was there to see it happen, but Cape Verde qualifying for the World Cup. At the time, only Iceland had done it with a smaller population (Curacao have superseded them), but the unfiltered and uncomplicated joy in the stadium that day is something I’ll never forget.\n\nO’Neill: Sunderland making it back to the Premier League through the play-offs in the most majestic, last-gasp way. And then actually being a really good top-tier side. It was a long eight years out of the top flight, which included four weary seasons in League One. But Sunderland have bounced all the way back and then some.\n\nFeringa: All of us making it through the 2026 World Cup draw in one piece and with most of our sanity intact.\n\nJames: Crystal Palace beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup (the first major trophy in their 164-year history) was pretty special — huge credit to their manager Oliver Glasner and the players. But the most magical thing about that day by far was the reaction of the Palace supporters at the final whistle. People, young and old, sobbing in a mixture of disbelief and joy. It was genuinely heart-warming — football touching the soul.\n\nAnka: The Lionesses winning their second European Championship title. England entered the tournament in a transitional state, battled through tricky turbulence in three of their five matches, but still emerged victorious. In the 21st century, the tournament has been won either by Germany or a team managed by Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman is a brilliant manager who is constantly asking us to reassess what we mean by “Good leadership”. She has excellent taste in music, too.\n\nMiller: Scott McTominay. One of football’s great glow-ups — from being a solid, arguably slightly boring, taken for granted 7/10 Manchester United midfielder, to title-winning, hard-partying, cigar-smoking, Pope-meeting, bicycle-kick-scoring, Serie A MVP.\n\nO’Neill: It is always Marta. This year, next year, forever. Oh, and Troy Parrott.\n\nFeringa: Any hero on the pitch is someone else’s villain. But Michelle Agyemang really wore that cape in Switzerland: 138 minutes, two goals, twice seizing England from the clutches of “reigning champions dumped out” headlines. To accomplish it while being just 19 years old and at her first major tournament with England was sensational, not to mention against a backdrop of racist abuse aimed at her team-mate Jess Carter.\n\nJames: Stephen Crean, the 61-year-old Nottingham Forest fan who courageously intervened during a mass stabbing on a train from Doncaster to London last month. Crean had been making his way home from Forest’s 2-2 draw against Manchester United at the City Ground when he was caught up in the train attack in Huntingdon, which led to a man being charged with 11 counts of attempted murder.\n\nForest fans gave Crean a rapturous ovation when he returned to the City Ground for their home game against Leeds United. “It meant the world to me. I could see people clapping, applauding and I just thank them so much,” he said. “I would have been happy with a few quid to go down the pub. I didn’t expect anything.”\n\nAnka: The two biggest games of McTominay’s 2025 saw him score bicycle kicks — one to help Napoli win a league title, the other to help secure Scotland’s qualification for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nI undervalued his talent at Manchester United, and I have spent the year happily eating humble pie while applauding his success.\n\nAlso, a quick word on Calvin Bassey — because I don’t think there’s a centre-back on the planet who is having more fun in the men’s game. The Fulham and Nigeria defender had good moments in 2025 as well as bad ones, but he’s always found a way to crack a smile, cheer up his team-mates and remind us all that football is meant to be a laugh.\n\n“That ball has gone to AFCON before us!” 🤣 pic.twitter.com/emg89MR4nz\n\n— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) December 15, 2025\n\nMiller: It won’t do to overcomplicate these things, so it’s a toss-up between two.\n\nEither Gianni Infantino, who has seemingly spent the year sleeping in a little bed in the Oval Office, like a particularly dutiful dog, hopping up now and then to hand Donald Trump something shiny.\n\nOr Jim Ratcliffe, for… well, claiming to understand the needs of the fans while jacking up ticket prices, making hundreds redundant while squandering millions himself, his undisguised contempt for Manchester United Women — take your pick really.\n\nFeringa: A toss-up between whoever signed off on Sky Sports’ Halo and Joey Barton.\n\nJames: Infantino. Where to start? The farce of the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. Where to end? The absolute scandal of ticket prices at the 2026 World Cup. And there’s plenty in between, too.\n\nAnka: If a series of ghosts had visited Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the cold Christmas nights, it would do us all the world of good.\n\nMiller: Troy Parrott’s miracle hat-trick against Hungary. For not one minute did I think that the Republic of Ireland were going to come back and win that game, but when they did, my word: I can’t remember the last time I so enjoyed a moment for a team with whom I have no emotional connection.\n\nO’Neill: The fallout after Mary Earps released her book or Arsenal Women winning the Champions League. And not forgetting Burna Boy and Sarina Wiegman linking up on stage at England’s Euro 2025 victory parade. That was iconic.\n\nFeringa: Gotham’s victory in the NWSL Championship. Winning it two seasons ago as the No 6 seed — a league-record low — was one thing. But lifting the trophy again two years on? This time as the No 8 seed? That’s silly script stuff that no one believes in until it happens.\n\nJames: Well, I certainly didn’t expect Chelsea to turn over Paris-Saint Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final in New Jersey in July. The way Liverpool’s 2025-26 season has unravelled, including Mohamed Salah’s outburst, was another big surprise. And who could have predicted that Sunderland would not just return to the Premier League but make a real splash. From a personal perspective, Snoop Dogg coming on board at Swansea City as a minority owner was a surreal moment. If only he could play right-back.\n\nAnka: Ajax letting the 2024-25 Dutch league title slip through their fingers. They were nine points clear of PSV in mid-April before a four-game winless run allowed their rivals to snatch the Eredivisie trophy on the last day of the season.\n\nMiller: Chloe Kelly scoring the winning penalty for England at Euro 2025. Even though she had missed a penalty a few days earlier (before tucking in the rebound), there was absolutely no chance she was missing that one. She seems to enjoy those moments of crushing pressure: she is, in the nicest possible way, a freak.\n\nO’Neill: Robbie Williams singing a duet with Nicole Scherzinger at the World Cup draw. Pretty sure I predicted that a year ago…\n\nFeringa: England winning Euro 2025. I really don’t know why everyone kept panicking. You don’t come back from the dead that many times and not win the whole lot. Also, Chloe Kelly is kind of inevitable at this point.\n\nJames: Ange Postecoglou and Nottingham Forest being a brief and unhappy marriage. It was, quite simply, never going to work at the City Ground, which makes you wonder why on earth Evangelos Marinakis, Forest’s owner, and Postecoglou signed up for the 39-day eight-game farce that followed.\n\nAnka: Chelsea winning the Conference League, and I mean that as a compliment. Chelsea are at their most compelling when they turn up and snatch the footballing dreams away from others (ask Bayern Munich fans about 2012), and they did so brilliantly in 2025.\n\nMiller:  Cristiano Ronaldo being let off his three-game suspension for a red card, thus opening the door for him to play in the first two games of the World Cup.\n\nO’Neill: Not letting Robbie Williams sing Angels at the World Cup draw.\n\nFeringa: The decision to simultaneously broadcast most of the Women’s Super League matches for the 2025-26 season at 12pm local time (and then 11.55am).\n\nJames: Steve Parish would like to answer this question. Back in July, the Crystal Palace chairman said that UEFA’s decision to remove his Premier League team from the Europa League, for breaching multi-club ownership rules, is “the biggest injustice in the history of football”.\n\nUEFA’s judgement was harsh but I wouldn’t go that far.\n\nAnyway, with my football pyramid hat on, I’ll always struggle with the idea that being runners-up in the National League, which is the gateway to the Football League, gets you nothing other than a play-off spot. Last season, York City finished 23 points above Oldham after 46 matches. But it was Oldham who won promotion.\n\nYeah, I know — everyone knows the rules at the start of the season. But still.\n\nAnka: The Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final in July saw Nigeria battle from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Morocco 3-2. However, they scored their first goal after the VAR decided Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina handled the ball inside the box, and before the VAR later overturned a penalty that was awarded to Morocco after they believed a possible handball from Nigeria’s Oluwatosin Demehin was accidental. The Confederation of African Football would later receive a formal complaint from Morocco’s federation, calling the match decisions “refereeing injustices”.\n\nMiller: Not the best from a technical point of view, but by a distance my moment of the year was James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser in the final men’s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, followed as it was by some fabulously undignified scenes from the Liverpool contingent and then a glorious, life-affirming singalong to I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues by the Everton fans that simply did not want to leave.\n\nThe latest in a long line of Goodison Park heroes, James Tarkowski 🎬 pic.twitter.com/31v3dCZfQH\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) February 15, 2025\n\nO’Neill: I wasn’t there to watch it live but it has to be the final Liverpool goal from the late, great and dearly missed Diogo Jota.\n\nIt came against Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield in April and proved to be the winner. It was so Jota. Off the bench and on to come up with the goods for Liverpool just when they needed him to. A weaving move and a wonderful finish at the Kop end.\n\nFeringa: I was in the Spanish end for their Euro 2025 semi-final against Germany when Aitana Bonmati scored the winning goal in the dying moments of extra time. The celebrations were visceral.\n\nAitana's turn for the goal 🥵 #WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/WbwTRCbyfJ\n\n— UEFA Women's EURO (@WEURO2025) July 23, 2025\n\nClose second: Jack Grealish’s first for Everton against Crystal Palace. It was pretty grubby. But the limbs. I was convinced I’d be tumbling down the Hill Dickinson Stadium stands and taking at least four with me.\n\nJames: Paris Saint-Germain’s third goal in the Champions League final against Inter was glorious and felt almost symbolic in terms of how it represented their team, their way of playing, and their coach, Luis Enrique. Vitinha was effortlessly weaving beautiful patterns inside his own half before driving forward with the ball, Ousmane Dembele’s backheel was exquisite and then Desire Doue applied the coup de grace. Magnificent.\n\nThe results are in for the best play of the year!\n\nThe winner is… @PSG_inside, with a stunning goal by Désiré Doué in the @UEFA @ChampionsLeague final!\n\nThank you for voting, the fun doesn’t stop here — more games and surprises are coming soon on https://t.co/HPYRKgym8v. Stay… pic.twitter.com/4SVAEDoPZg\n\n— Ballon d'Or (@ballondor) September 26, 2025\n\nJosh Tymon’s volley, for Snoop’s Swansea against Oxford United, deserves a mention too. Postage stamp.\n\nAnka: I prefer my Goal of the Month contenders to be long-range pingers rather than well-coordinated team goals so…\n\nIn real life? Amad’s edge-of-the-box volley to rescue a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest at the start of November. Bonus points for how Matthijs de Ligt dips his neck as it flies past him, as he rightfully understands the strike would have taken his head off.\n\nOutrageous technique from Amad 😱 pic.twitter.com/gmZaBTkG37\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) November 1, 2025\n\nWatching live on the telly? Declan Rice’s perfect free kick against Real Madrid. His continual growth and improvement since the 2019-20 season are remarkable.\n\nMiller: “To be really honest, every time we have a defeat like that, I’m going to be like that. I’m going to say sometimes I hate my players and sometimes I love my players. Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years.”\n\nIt’s hard not to love Ruben Amorim, speaking here after Manchester United lost to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup… while at the same time desperately wanting to give him a hug and tell him to just stop being so honest.\n\nO’Neill: I joined Goal Diggers FC on their march to Wembley in May after the Football Association announced a ban on transgender women from women’s football. One of the people I met was Sammy Rees.\n\n“I spent some time playing men’s football. But it really wasn’t my bag. I felt very uncomfortable and it was not the nicest environment. Then I joined Goal Diggers and I’ve never looked back. It’s changed my life completely. These people have such open hearts. Since coming out, football has been my escape. We (trans people) wake up every day to more disgusting news about us: people vilifying us, people questioning our identity and our existence.\n\n“Football means that for two or three hours a week, I can switch my brain off. I can have a moment where I don’t care about the news. It’s my escape, and the fact that it’s trying to be taken away from us is not fair.”\n\nFeringa: “Sometimes they kill off the main character.”\n\nAnge Postecoglou doled out some dimes during his Tottenham Hotspur tenure, but this, after overseeing the Europa League final triumph against Manchester United, was very prescient.\n\nJames: “It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus.”\n\nSurely Salah’s post-match bombshell at Leeds has to go straight in at No 1 in this category? Elite players just don’t say things like that.\n\nAs for No 2, I’ll go for Amorim’s assessment of his Manchester United team back in January.\n\n“We are the worst team, maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you (reporters) want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and change that. Here you go: your headlines.”\n\nIf only more managers showed that level of consideration to journalists.\n\nAnka: Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy had a bumpy start to life in Scotland.\n\n“People might think I’m an idealist as a person but not at all. I know exactly who I am and exactly where I want to go. And I know at this moment, yeah, my a** is burning! But stay strong and do what you need to do to be better.”\n\nMiller: Manchester United are going to be actively good — not just “good in comparison to the dreck they’ve served up before”. Actively good. I can feel it.\n\nO’Neill: Liverpool do not reclaim their Premier League title but win the Champions League instead. The Republic of Ireland qualify for the World Cup and win their opening match. Tranmere Rovers somehow make the League Two play-offs and are promoted to League One. What do you mean, ‘It’s just me and John Aldridge manifesting all this’?\n\nFeringa: Craig Bellamy will get Wales to the World Cup. Less prediction, more a burning prayer.\n\nJames: Donald Trump will lift the World Cup before the winning captain/Harry Kane* has the chance to do the same at MetLife Stadium on July 19.\n\nAnka: Noni Madueke will finally receive his Club World Cup winners’ medal.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Everton, Nottingham Forest, England, Scotland, Republic of Ireland, SSC Napoli, Premier League, Champions League, International Football, Serie A, Championship, Women's Soccer, FIFA Men's World Cup, League One, League Two, National League\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "Nicola Elliott is founder of Single Variety Co, an award-winning premium preserves brand that’s challenging the way food businesses grow.",
    "fullText": "There couldn’t have been any better validation for Nicola Elliott to launch her food business in 2016 than winning a gold award just one month after producing her first ever batch of Seville marmalade. “It gave me the confidence to go forward if the marmalade was that good,” recalls Elliott, founder of Single Variety Co.\n\nShe went one better this year. At the same World Marmalade Awards, her Amalfi lemon marmalade went to the final round of tasting and then scooped double gold and top accolade in an emotional moment for the British entrepreneur. “To do it at the scale that we are making it says we are doing everything right,” says Elliott.\n\nIn the early throes of her single-fruit preserves startup, Elliott was making 25 jars at a time with six pans going simultaneously and two part-time staff, as well as family and friends helping out.\n\nFrom selling her jams on a Balham market stall to owning her production facility, having shunned mass supermarket listings to retain independent quality, Single Variety Co now produces 5,000 jars per week and is set for latest annual revenues of £1.7m.\n\nIt is all a far cry from seven years ago when Elliott received her first export order to Germany for 8,000 jars of raspberry preserve. “I said ‘yes’ thinking I would be making 25 jars at a time. Somehow we did it over six weeks. We didn’t make any money on the order but it was the turning point for us.”\n\nThe business lesson led to Elliott reluctantly outsourcing production for a few years until her husband — a “people person”, former personal trainer and tennis coach — joined the business and the couple moved to Bristol and a £200,000 outlay to set up their jam factory five years ago.\n\nIn her former career as a fresh foods product developer at the likes of Sainsbury’s, Elliott cut a frustrated figure in a role she admits was cost-focussed and in which quality wasn’t a priority. She left her supermarket career to set her sights on a short shelf-life product.\n\n“When you mass-produce, quality has to give way. I was determined to make the quality what we aimed for,” she admits.\n\nAt the time, Elliott noticed that premium jams had champagne added to the strawberries or bay leaves to blackberries and “no one was making just great-tasting strawberry jam.”\n\nIt hasn’t all gone according to plan. Elliott once purchased the wrong second-hand jam kettle, at £12,000, instead of an electric kettle, which her husband still reminds the working mother of today.\n\nNow with a staff of 12, she works directly with UK fruit farmers for her products. These include seasonal limited edition jams such as traditional rhubarb from Yorkshire, which grows in the dark and is picked by candlelight.",

    "fullText": "The China National Nuclear Corporation developed a first-of-its-kind power generator that uses carbon dioxide rather than steam.\n\nIt's the first commercial power source of this type and a significant step toward cleaner global energy.\n\nAs Newsweek reported, the China National Nuclear Corp.'s generator converts waste heat into useful electricity. This supercritical carbon dioxide power generator provides a clean energy solution and advances China's pollution-reduction efforts.\n\nThe company connected its generator to the grid at a steel plant in Guizhou province. There, it will capture waste heat from steel production and directly convert it into electricity.\n\nThe company expects the generator to be 50% more efficient than currently available technologies. Therefore, it also serves as a model for other power plants and industrial applications worldwide.\n\nThis energy development is encouraging because it contributes to the clean energy mix and is a substantial step forward for advanced nuclear technology. It offers high power in a small footprint, making it suitable for spacecrafts, ships, and other confined spaces.\n\n\"The Chinese are moving very, very fast. They are very keen to show the world that their program is unstoppable,\" Mark Hibbs, an expert on the nuclear sector, told The New York Times.\n\nNuclear energy is often misunderstood and controversial, yet it's an important part of the sustainable energy transition away from more polluting energy sources and toward cheaper, clear forms of energy, like wind and solar.\n\nNuclear plants are also known for radioactive leaks and producing hazardous waste. Safety and environmental concerns are valid. However, they still offer a promising shift away from pollution-heavy coal, oil, and gas.\n\nYet, recent developments from the CNNC and partner Jigang International Engineering and Technology Co. are paving the way for nuclear expansion in the country and beyond.\n\nChina is now seeking to scale up its new power-generation systems to deploy them in nuclear, steel, and solar plants.\n\nShould America invest \n\nOnly if it helps us compete with China\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "With Donald Trump expanding the travel ban inspired by his first term in the White House to 20 more countries, as well as the Palestinian Authority, on Dec. 16, a total of 39 countries from different corners of the world now face either a total ban or restrictions on entering the United States.\n\nMali, South Sudan, Niger, Burkina Faso, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority have been added to the list of nations whose citizens cannot enter the U.S. at all, first introduced in June.\n\nAngola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were meanwhile added to a list of countries facing a block on student and business visas; the list that Trump put in place in June 2025 previously included Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.\n\nImmediately after their nations were added to the ban, multiple diplomats and heads of state responded with condemnation. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a statement saying that the Caribbean country's government was \"deeply disappointed\" given that the justification accusing it of loose rules for granting citizenship by investment \"does not reflect the present reality of our laws.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the expansion of the ban, the West African nation of Niger has taken the most drastic step of permanently banning any granting of new visas to U.S. visas in a reciprocal measure until the situation changes.\n\n\"Niger is completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States,\" a governmental representative said to the Associated Press.\n\nA landlocked country bordered by Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger is a Muslim-majority nation with a population of just over 25 million people. In the document announcing the travel ban, the White House said the country has a visa overstay rate of 13.41% for business visas and 16.46% for student ones as well as \"terrorists and their supporters [that] are active in planning kidnappings.\"\n\nWhile a history of war and political instability and coups d'états means that travel into Niger from Western countries remains very low (the State Department has kept it at the \"do not travel\" advisory level for years), the latest move from its government is a major escalation in relations.",

    "description": "I moved across the world for my husband and ended up a single mom. Years later, I met the love of my life when I least expected it.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-one years ago, I faced the difficult decision to move from Spain to the United States with my 3-year-old daughter and 4-month-old baby to follow my then-husband, who had lost his job, in pursuit of a new position in Florida.\n\nI was being asked to leave behind my family, friends, and an established writing career. I was to start over at 41, with no connections, no guarantees, and an already shaky marriage.\n\nMy family thought it was a terrible idea, yet my husband's family felt it was a great opportunity. So, after some soul-searching and many promises of a better life in Florida, I decided to uproot my kids and take the chance.\n\nAs I boarded the plane to meet my children's father (he had come to the US ahead of us), I had mixed feelings: I could feel the excitement of my eldest to see her dad again, but I also feared the unknown. I kept asking myself whether it was really possible that we could fix our marriage and thrive in a different country.\n\nGoing from living in a penthouse in the old part of Sevilla, where I could walk to just about everywhere, to being cooped up in a tiny apartment in a gated community in suburban Florida, where I needed a car to go anywhere, was brutal to my nervous system.\n\nI felt trapped in suburbia without my own car. And with a history of major depressive disorder, I started having panic attacks and depressive episodes. One day, while driving my children to find a preschool for my eldest, I had to pull over to sob.\n\nA few months later, my husband lost the job we had moved to Florida for. And so began one of the most difficult periods of our lives.\n\nIn four years, we moved several times within Florida, always because of his new jobs. I found work freelancing for newspapers and magazines and wrote more books for publishers in Spain. But our relationship was always floundering.\n\nAs our marriage crumbled, we took a time-out under the same roof. We went to marriage counseling, enrolled in self-improvement seminars, and so on. Trust, respect, and admiration had been completely lost, and in 2008, when the Great Recession hit, we had no money, no savings, and no jobs.\n\nI walked away from my husband with my laptop, my books, joint custody of our children, and the huge regret of having moved so far away from my family and friends. But I stayed in Florida, because I didn't want my children to be far from their father. From one day to the next, I found myself a single mother on food stamps.\n\nNearly a year after separating, 16 years ago, I met the love of my life. We had many similarities: we were both newly single, bilingual and bicultural, and had children of a similar age. We were writers focused on creating a better life for our kids and ourselves. The best part was that neither of us had given up on love despite the tough times we'd lived through.\n\nFor nearly two years, we dated long-distance, spending only weekends and holidays together. One of us would drive two hours to meet the other, sometimes with the children, and when the kids were with our respective former spouses, we met alone.\n\nWe were both trying to rebuild ourselves personally and professionally, and together we made a great team. I once again moved for love, but this time with no regrets. Four years later, we married at sunset on the beach, surrounded by our children and close family.\n\nOur kids are all in their 20s now, and we've been through the highest highs as well as some pretty rough times. But our relationship was never in question. We've cheered each other on and thrived together.\n\nWhenever I think of past regrets and how I shouldn't have moved to the US 21 years ago with my ex, I realize I would have missed out on finding true love. And I would never have built the stable and dependable family I always wanted.",

    "fullText": "Merlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 bird species around the world\n\nWhen Natasha Walter first became curious about the birds around her, she recorded their songs on her phone and arduously tried to match each song with online recordings. After a friend recommended Merlin Bird ID, a free app, she tried it in her London garden and was delighted to discover the birds she assumed were female blackbirds – “this is how bad a birder I was” – were actually song thrushes and mistle thrushes.\n\n“I’m obsessed with Merlin – it’s wonderful and it’s been a joy to me,” says Walter, a writer and human rights activist. “This is what AI and machine-learning have been invented for. It’s the one good thing!”\n\nMerlin is having a moment. The app, developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York, which listens for birdsong and identifies the species singing, has been downloaded 33m times, in 240 countries and territories around the world. Britain has the second highest total number of users – more than 1.5 million in 2024, an 88% increase from 2023. Every month, there has been a 30% increase in new users of the app, whose sound identification function was launched in 2021.\n\nMerlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 species around the world, with more birds added twice a year. Different songs make distinct patterns on spectrograms and Merlin is trained to recognise these different shapes and attribute them to a species.\n\nFor latecomers to birding, or those lacking a knowledgeable friend, the app has become their teacher. “My fear at first was I wouldn’t actually learn because I’m outsourcing my understanding of birds to this app,” says Walter. “But that hasn’t come to pass. It’s helped me continue my journey of learning.” Nowadays, she guesses, and uses Merlin to confirm her hunches. “It’s wonderful if you’re coming to bird-watching late and don’t really have a mentor,” she says.\n\nAngela Townsend from Bedfordshire began using Merlin after going on a nightingale walk one spring and being overwhelmed by the range of bird-voices in the evening chorus. She has found it has steadily built up her bird knowledge. “Warblers were just little brown jobbies but I can now recognise Cetti’s warblers and willow warblers when I’m out without having to put the app on,” she says.\n\nMary Novakovich, author of My Family and Other Enemies, is another recent adopter. She has found it particularly useful when travelling across Croatia, where her parents are from. “I love putting a name to a face and a name to the sound,” she says. “It really brings you closer to the natural world, rather than it being disconnected from your life. It’s part of what makes life a joy.”\n\nMerlin is not flawless, however. The first time Kasper Wall, 12, tried it in his Norfolk garden, it detected a northern cardinal and a brown-headed cowbird – North American species not found in Britain.\n\n“I think it was figuring out where we live,” says Wall, who enjoys using it even though he is now an extremely knowledgeable birder. “A couple of weeks ago we were looking at a large group of goldcrest and it came up with a firecrest. I thought, ‘Oh, there must be a firecrest in here too’ and 30 seconds later we saw one, which was the first I’d ever seen. I like it and it’s very good but I wouldn’t say that it’s better than the best people at identifying bird-calls like [the naturalist] Nick Acheson. It can definitely be fooled.”\n\nWall enjoys fooling Merlin with his uncanny impressions of a curlew, barn owl and greenshank.\n\nAcheson doesn’t use Merlin. He welcomes it, but points out it can replace learning. “Anything that gets people out, thinking about and reacting to nature is a great thing,” he says. “But there’s certainly a risk that people don’t learn and just abdicate responsibility for learning to Merlin.”\n\nHe has noticed a glitch where Merlin interprets a certain type of chaffinch call as a redstart, leading to people being absolutely adamant that there is a rare bird in their garden. “There’s no substitute for a real person explaining to you how a birdsong feels and encouraging someone to engage with it emotionally,” he says.\n\nJohn Williamson, who works as a guide for Norfolk Wildlife Trust, has found Merlin repeatedly identifying high-pitched calls as a spotted flycatcher, a bird that is very unlikely to be found in the middle of Hickling Broad nature reserve’s large reedbeds. “Merlin can’t do habitat,” he says.\n\nMerlin has also excited visitors by identifying a golden oriole, a very occasional rare migrant, in Hickling woods, but no one has actually seen the species. Williamson is convinced it is misinterpreting a fairly unusual “catcall” of a female jay, a common woodland bird.\n\nThat said, Williamson finds it a “good tool” and welcomes how it is encouraging new people to enjoy birdsong, and particularly its mental health benefits. He knows one person who suffers from acute anxiety but Merlin has got him out into the world again and into nature, providing a focus for calming trips outdoors. “I find it impressive that an app can empower people to go out into nature,” he says.\n\nResearch has found that birdsong is particularly beneficial to mental health, and has a lasting positive impact on wellbeing. For millions around the globe, that’s exactly what Merlin is doing.\n\n“It reminds you that there are birds knitted into your daily life,” says Walter. “It’s not about, ‘now I’m going to do a bit of birdwatching’, you may simply be walking through the park and you hear something and it gives you a sense that these birds are singing away all the time, even in London.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHad Marcell Ozuna not had the season he did in 2025, he likely would be the most sought-after DH in this free agency cycle. However, that isn’t the case, and teams currently view him as a potential risk to sign. The Atlanta Braves attempted to trade him several times last season, but he refused every offer.\n\n“It’s possible that while Anthopoulos was discussing trades, he couldn’t agree on a deal that Ozuna’s agent could also sign off on. Just because Ozuna is leaving the deadline out of his hands doesn’t mean the 10-5 rights go out the window. He could have simply handed over those rights to his agent for the discussions,” SI’s Harrison Smajovits wrote.\n\nWith Ozuna aging and other factors at play, he isn’t an especially appealing free agent candidate so far this offseason.\n\n“The problem Ozuna faces now is that he has only gotten older, his performance last season was subpar at best, and the teams that were previously considered to be landing spots for him feel unlikely to pursue him this offseason especially with how more and more organizations are treating the DH position,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote.\n\nFanSided’s Christopher Kline believes the Cleveland Guardians could sign Ozuna to a low-risk deal, adding protection in the lineup alongside José Ramírez.\n\n“This Cleveland Guardians team desperately needs more pop in the heart of the lineup. Kyle Manzardo made a strong first impression as a rookie. Chase DeLauter and Travis Bazzana are coming behind him as top prospects who can rip it. But even if it's a one-year deal, Ozuna has the goods to protect José Ramírez in the heart of the order and pop a few more dingers than Cleveland fans are used to,” Kline wrote.\n\nThe Guardians won the AL Central last year after a late-season comeback against the Detroit Tigers. Ozuna, meanwhile, just wants to finish his career on a strong note after a difficult 2025 season.\n\nCleveland is a playoff-caliber team that could benefit from Ozuna’s bat and veteran presence in the clubhouse. This type of one-year deal could pay major dividends for the Guardians.",

    "description": "Brian Cox once toured as a keyboardist in major rock and pop bands. Now he’s a particle physicist on a new world tour with a dazzling show he designed in an era of science disinformation and denial.",
    "fullText": "Stefano Montali traveled to Redditch, England, in November to attend a warm-up show for Prof. Brian Cox’s coming world tour.\n\nProf. Brian Cox flashed a wide smile toward the crowd, picked up an iPad, looked up at the enormous screen behind him and started to write out a complex equation. “This is what I call a live math solo,” he said.\n\nThe audience chuckled. Many in the packed theater that night last month in the small English town of Redditch seemed to be in on the joke.\n\nBecause before he became Brian Cox, the particle physicist renowned for his adroitness in explaining the intricacies and magnificence of space, he was Brian Cox the rock star.\n\nHis first professional gig, in fact, was playing keyboards in the opening band on a tour with Jimmy Page, the lead guitarist of Led Zeppelin. His second band, D:Ream, had a song that hit No. 1 on the British pop charts in 1994.\n\nNow, Professor Cox is the star of his own show, albeit one about science.\n\nHe has sold out venues often reserved for sports and pop stars, like Wembley Arena (not the stadium) and the O2 in London. His coming tour, “Emergence,” will take him to places like Singapore, Serbia and Australia, before arriving in the United States in late 2026.\n\n“If you believe, as I do, that science is one of the necessary foundations of society, alongside the arts and politics,” Professor Cox said in an interview, “it has to be there with them on an equal footing.”\n\nWith his geniality, Beatles-esque haircut and a dazzling show that explores black holes, galaxies and the significance — and insignificance — of human beings in the universe, Professor Cox, 57, has reached mainstream audiences, when many scientists cannot.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and popular science communicator, said in an interview that Professor Cox, whom he has known for years, “has a force of rationality, and a force of reason, and a force of science.” He added, “Society needs all three, lest we regress back to the caves whence we came.”\n\nIn an era when science denial and disinformation are common, Professor Cox, who teaches particle physics at the University of Manchester, has sought to make science accessible through Peabody Award-winning BBC documentaries and podcasts, books and appearances on other media, like “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nThis year, the United Nations named Professor Cox its Champion for Space, a role in which he will work with the organization to promote space as a “force for progress.”\n\nAs a child, Professor Cox spent many Saturday mornings at the Manchester Airport, near his hometown, Oldham, England, spotting planes with his father. “I liked the engineering, the big machines,” he said. “The Apollo moon landings, astronomy, science fiction — I wanted to see ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Star Trek,’ ‘Alien,’ all of it.”\n\nEventually, Professor Cox’s interests expanded to include music.\n\nAt 18, he deferred going to university for a year to join the band Dare, founded by a member of Thin Lizzy who lived nearby. The band recorded its debut album with A&M Records in Joni Mitchell’s private studio.\n\nAfter one London show where Dare opened for Jimmy Page, Professor Cox said he found himself having a drink backstage with George Harrison.\n\nEven while touring, Professor Cox read popular science books.\n\nHe left Dare at 23 — after a bar fight with his bandmates in Berlin, he said — to study physics and astronomy at the University of Manchester. He soon joined D:Ream, whose No. 1 pop anthem “Things Can Only Get Better” was later appropriated by the Labour Party.\n\nEventually, he left that band to shift his focus to science. Stints at particle accelerators in Hamburg, Chicago and Geneva followed.\n\nIn 2001, Professor Cox met Gia Milinovich, a TV presenter and writer, whom he married two years later at her mother’s house in Duluth, Minn. The pair started writing documentary ideas “with the sole aim of ‘making science part of popular culture,’” she told The Guardian in 2010. Today, they live in London with their 16-year-old son, George.\n\nStill, the draw to the stage never truly left Professor Cox, who eventually found his way back to it.\n\nThe show in Redditch, about 45 minutes south of Birmingham, was the beginning of a slate of warm-up performances. For Professor Cox, they are a chance to work out new material. The show changes night to night.\n\nProfessor Cox’s enthusiasm is as much a character in the show as the planets and the stars. He kept the audience captivated, even on topics that might seem out of reach, like the origin of space and time or quantum entanglement.\n\nDavid Attenborough, whose nature documentaries on the BBC helped carve out a place for science presenters on television, said in 2013, “If I had a torch, I would hand it to Brian Cox.”\n\nBut the worlds in which Mr. Attenborough first rose to fame and in which Professor Cox works now couldn’t be more different. Disinformation on social media has contributed to a growing skepticism of experts.\n\n“Our instinct, which is a good instinct,” Professor Cox said, “is to say, ‘I want to listen to as many voices as possible.’” Still, he stressed that there needed to be a weighting to people who have expertise.\n\nBut his expertise has been poached by hyper-realistic deepfakes. Days before the Redditch show, several appeared online depicting him falsely claiming that the 3I/ATLAS comet, which was passing through the solar system, was an alien spacecraft.\n\nThe mother of a friend of his was so convinced by the deepfake that she was “starting to hoard things,” Professor Cox said the friend told him.\n\nWith the deepfakes multiplying and looking increasingly realistic, the effort to take them down can feel like full-time job, he said.\n\nEarlier in his career, Professor Cox made light of conspiracies.\n\nWhile he was working in Geneva at CERN on the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, several doomsday theories circulated online claiming the accelerator could cause the end of the universe by creating microscopic black holes.\n\n“My first instinct was to laugh it off,” Professor Cox said. He told the The Daily Telegraph that “anyone who thinks the LHC will destroy the world” is a fool, though he used a word that many find offensive.\n\nIt caused an uproar. “It’s probably my most famous quote,” Professor Cox said.\n\nBut he says he came to understand of conspiracy theories that it’s important to be sensitive that even if people believe in something that isn’t true, the strong emotion that belief can evoke — panic or fear, in the case of the collider — is real.\n\n“If people are getting information that’s saying that there’s a chance that the world will be destroyed,” he said, “it’s not silly to be worried about that.”\n\nHe has appeared three times in the past decade on Joe Rogan’s podcast. While he acknowledges that Mr. Rogan and his guests have indulged in conspiracy theories or denial about climate change and other accepted science, Professor Cox regards the appearances as an opportunity to reach an important new audience.\n\nAt the start of his show in Redditch, Professor Cox appeared in front of a projection of the Charles Bridge in Prague on a snowy night, and he told the story of how the astronomer Johannes Kepler pondered the physical makeup of a six-pointed snowflake. Eventually, the visual zoomed deeper and deeper into one of the falling snowflakes, revealing its intricacy.\n\nAs he stood to the side of the stage in the dark, Professor Cox described how Kepler’s bridge walk, along with Galileo’s discovery of Jupiter’s four largest moons, contributed to a revolution in science — a refocusing away from the reliance on ancient knowledge and toward the modern method of observation and questioning.\n\nThat drive for discovery, Professor Cox said, lies at the center of his show and at the heart of his questions. How do we acquire reliable knowledge? How do we remove our opinion and biases?\n\n“Certainty is kind of a brutish thing,” he said, “it doesn’t really get you anywhere.”\n\nAs for the music world, Professor Cox still has a toe in. He reunited with D:Ream, onstage at the Glastonbury Festival in 2024. And at another event, he said, he was approached by a fan who expressed his awe at a show Professor Cox had done about Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons.",

    "title": "Patience, Sabres Fans – World Junior Success Doesn't Guarantee Buffalo's Prospects A Successful NHL Future",
    "description": "The Buffalo Sabres will have four players at the 2026 IIHF World Junior Championship. But success at the World Junior tournament offers little guarantee prospects of NHL success. While World Junior glory would be great, the Sabres' youngsters need more time and patience to develop.",
    "fullText": "In more recent seasons, the Buffalo Sabres had more players at the annual IIHF World Junior Championship tournament. But it’s a measure of how things have changed for the Sabres that, in the 2026 World Juniors, only four Buffalo youngsters are involved. The leading teams in terms of involvement at the World Juniors are the Nashville Predators and Utah Mammoth, who each have seven players playing. And given where those teams stand in their development, they should have that many players involved.\n\nBut while the Sabres will have less of a footprint on this year’s World Junior tournament, there’s still reason for Buffalo fans to tune in. Whether it’s watching Team U.S.A. players and Sabres prospects Brodie Ziemer, Adam Kleber and Luke Osburn, or Team Czechia's Radim Mrtka, the Sabres will still have plenty of players taking part in this best-on-best tourney.\n\nThe reality of where the Sabres are in competitive cycle means that they should be expecting to have fewer players at the World Juniors down the road. There’s no direct correlation between where a team is competitively speaking and the number of World Junior players they have in any one season, but for a team like Buffalo, the organization needs to be more focused on the present than on the future.\n\nThus, even if the Americans do win gold at this year’s World Juniors and put Ziemer, Osburn and Kleber in the spotlight, when the holiday break is over, none of those players (nor Mrtka) will be immediate difference-makers at the NHL level. And that will be true of the quartet regardless of how things turn out in the next week-and-a-half. The World Juniors has a long history of players who were World Junior standouts, yet who couldn’t make that translate into NHL success.\n\nIdeally, it’s true you want all of your prospects to be needle-movers at whatever level they’re at in any point of their history. But that’s not realistic, and it’s probably unfair to prospects who are still learning what type of player they can be.\n\nFor A Christmas Present, Sabres Fans Need This More Than Anything Else Fans of the Buffalo Sabres could use more than a few presents this holiday season. But there's one thing Sabres fans crave more than run-of-the-mill holiday cheer – they're seeking genuine hope.\n\nRegardless of the hype around them, young players need the time, space and understanding to evolve and grow into the best version of themselves, and that may mean arriving at a level that some observers see as a disappointment. The prospect game is hit-and-miss, and even if the Sabres have some hits when it comes to players representing their homeland, that doesn’t mean those same players won’t be misses in hockey’s best league.\n\nSo when Sabres fans tune in to see how this year’s World Juniors plays out, they have to temper their expectations. This year’s tournament will be on home ice for the Americans, but that could increase the pressure on Buffalo’s three American players. But the best way to test those players is to put their feet into the fire and see how they respond.\n\nThe Time For New Sabres GM Kekalainen To Make A Trade Or Firing Happen In Buffalo Has Already Arrived New Buffalo Sabres' GM Jarmo Kekalainen can't be preaching patience with this Sabres group. Whether it's trading a star player or firing coach Lindy Ruff, Kekalainen must shake up the organization if Buffalo is to salvage their season.\n\nIt’s going to take more patience to see how these Sabres prospects deal with expectations, but it’s their progress once the spotlight of the World Juniors ends that will ultimately reveal more about where Buffalo’s up-and-comers are going to land as professional hockey players.\n\nGlory at the World Juniors would be great, but it isn’t the be-all and end-all. And the Sabres’ growth as a team will mean more to Buffalo fans than even a gold-medal result for the U.S. would be to them.",

    "description": "Hyundai Motorsports co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe just made co-driver round the world proud with his performance at the 2025 Rallye du Pays Vençois in France.",
    "fullText": "It takes a special kind of person to willingly strap oneself into a hatchback aimed at flying through the woods at high speeds. Rally drivers are madmen full-stop, but their shotgun-riding co-drivers are a whole different breed. Don’t discount the amount of driving know-how tucked away in those high-flying passenger seats, however. Hyundai Motorsports co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe recently took the wheel of a Hyundai i20 N Rally2 at the 2025 Rallye du Pays Vençois in France, making fellow co-drivers round the world beam with pride.\n\nWhile you might not be familiar with Martijn Wydaeghe, you have likely heard of his teammate Thierry Neuville. The two have been driving together since the 2021 season, with Wydaeghe co-driving during Neuville’s 2024 WRC Driver’s Championship effort. This year wasn’t as successful for last year’s champs, with Neuville finishing 5th overall in the standings. The results were largely tempered by two consecutive retirements at the Central Europe and Japan rallies towards the end of the season. The pair came back to win the final event of the year at Rally Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile the automaker didn’t put Wydaeghe out in the proper Rally1 machine he’s used to riding in, the Belgian driver made his driving debut in the production-based Rally2 machine. He did previously get a go in the Rally1 car at the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed, however. I’m sure the co-driver-turned-wheelman wasn’t too upset about the more approachable platform for his first go either.\n\nWith co-driver Florian Haut-Labourdette alongside, Wydaeghe pushed the IXO-sponsored Hyundai through the 25-mile rally. His pace was undeniable, with Wydaeghe managing to take home a stage win on his very first attempt. The pair only managed to muster sixth place overall, but fans were more than happy to see Wydaeghe give it a shot. That said, I don’t think Neuville needs to be too worried about job security for the time being. Perhaps the WRC should look at a co-driver shootout event moving forward, though.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

US respects a real partner not a dependant who is just happy to be invited. CAN foreign policy is a wreck, riddled by foreign interference. We are incoherent on Ukraine, Israel and very soft on China as they bully us far more than US. We have no secure borders and are an easy access point for criminal cartels and drugs. (ScooperCooper). Name one admirable but hard, consequential costly decision Canada's made in 20 years... maybe Afganistan?) No one is coming to us for serious military or global advice. Eyes roll when we label ourselves Trump tamers when it is so easy to compare to Mexico who is looking brilliant. Canadian bureaucrats like Carney, Ray or M. Joly are smug flop's gossiping about the world, changing with the wind. I am sorry but I'd chalk up the US visitor surprise more to the fact Canada hasn't the smarts to realize we don't deserve trust.",

He works in IT and earns about $90,000 a year, while she earns roughly $55,000. He wrote that growing up lower middle class shaped his careful approach to money.\n\nUntil recently, he wrote, their everyday spending had felt manageable.

He created a rough budget covering flights, hotels, trains, food, and tours, estimating the total at about $4,500 for both of them — excluding shopping.\n\nHe suggested that if they started saving immediately, each could set aside about $400 to $450 per month over several months and split the cost evenly.\n\nAfter reviewing the spreadsheet, she laughed and questioned why he was treating the trip \"like a business contract,\" pointing out that he earns significantly more.

During that discussion, she compared him to an ex who never asked her to pay for vacations.\n\nSince then, he said, the tension continued. She made sarcastic comments about money during meals, and later compromise proposals were dismissed.\n\nHe suggested splitting costs based on income, such as a 60-40 arrangement or covering flights while she handled her spending money.

    "description": "My guide dog helps me travel the world as a fully blind person. I don't take it for granted, but the hardest part is dealing with people's ignorance.",
    "fullText": "My life changed when I met Indio, a black Labrador, three years ago.\n\nI am completely blind, and until I got my guide dog, I wasn't able to travel often. Getting around was tiring enough in familiar places.\n\nI used a cane, and encountered tons of obstacles and problems — like crossing paths with people who were looking at their phones. The idea of navigating this in a completely new country sounded like a horror-movie plot.\n\nNow, my dog and I have been to 16 countries together — he's been an important constant in my life as I've eaten crickets in Mexico and visited museums in Germany.\n\nI wouldn't change our journey for anything, but it hasn't always been easy — mainly because of the judgment we face from others.\n\nWhen I travel with Indio, there are so many things I just don't have to think about.\n\nHe'll learn my hotel room as soon as we set foot inside, and help direct me to places we already know if I get lost after a day of exploring. I no longer have to depend on fellow travelers when I'm on a city tour, because my dog can follow a guide independently if I ask him to.\n\nCrucially, I feel like I can now walk around an unfamiliar city without having to worry nonstop. I can simply enjoy the feeling of being in a new place, listening to people speaking different languages around me, knowing that Indio is by my side to keep me safe.\n\nHaving this security has helped me go on adventures I'd never expected. Without thinking twice, I took a four-hour bus ride from Prague and woke up in Vienna with no plan except to explore.\n\nWithout Indio, this wouldn't be possible — and the ability to travel freely is not something I take for granted. Sometimes, though, having him with me brings problems that I wish I could avoid.\n\nWhen I decided to get a guide dog, the first thing many people told me was that I had to give up my dreams of traveling, especially abroad.\n\nSome dogs struggle with changes in environments, and most countries also require multiple types of documentation for traveling with service animals. Plus, I often have to fill out lots of extra airline forms whenever I fly with him.\n\nIn many cases, I also prepare myself for how people — especially those who haven't encountered a guide dog in public — might react when they see us exploring the streets of their city.\n\nSadly, my worries aren't unfounded. Once, I had to miss a museum tour because I struggled to find a taxi driver who would allow my dog in the car. Other times, I've been stopped from entering supermarkets.\n\nPractically everywhere we go, we have to deal with people who don't know how to act around a guide dog — whether they try to pet him at times when it's dangerous for him to get distracted, or they react with fear or surprise at his presence.\n\nDespite the issues we've faced, being able to travel with Indio is one of the most rewarding things I've ever done in my life.\n\nEven when there are snags or setbacks, there are kind, positive moments that restore my faith and joy in traveling, too. I've encountered strangers who were willing to help support Indio and me, even though there was no incentive beyond kindness to do so.\n\nAt the end of the day, I just wish certain people we've encountered would recognize that, for me, traveling with Indio isn't a choice. He gives me freedom and a gateway to a world I never thought I would know.\n\nNo matter what, I'll continue traveling and occupying space — because, despite my limitations, I believe that the world is too big to wait for someone to tell me about it at home.",

    "fullText": "A French report claims that Lazio are one of four clubs interested in FC Metz winger Giorgi Tsitaishvili, who will become a free agent in the summer.\n\nThe Georgian international is a youth product of Dynamo Kyiv, who remains on the Ukrainian club’s books. However, the 25-year-old spent the last six seasons on loan. This includes temporary experiences in Poland with Wisla Kraków and Lech Poznan. He also played in Spain with Granada last season, before joining FC Metz in the summer.\n\nInterestingly, Tsitaishvili’s contract with Dynamo Kyiv will expire in June, so he will be free to sign for a new club following his Ligue 1 experience. The winger has thus far contributed with two goals and one assist in 17 appearances across all competitions.\n\nAccording to Foot Mercato, Tsitaishvili’s situation has attracted at least four suitors, including Lazio, who have already enquired about his availability. Moreover, Olympique Lyonnais and LOSC Lille will be looking to keep him in France, while his international teammate Georges Mikautadze is trying to convince him to join Villarreal, having already played an integral role in his transfer to Metz.\n\nWith Lazio operating on limited resources, a free agent like Tsitaishvili could represent an enticing prospect for Claudio Lotito and Angelo Fabiani. However, the Biancocelesti already have two left-footed wingers vying for a spot on the right flank. So, unless either Gustav Isaksen or Matteo Cancellieri ends up leaving the club, the management will likely focus on bolstering other playing roles next summer.",

    "description": "Top AI researchers like Fei-Fei Li and Yann LeCun are developing world models, which don't rely solely on language.",
    "fullText": "As OpenAI, Anthropic, and Big Tech invest billions in developing state-of-the-art large language models, a small group of elite AI researchers is working on what they say is the next big thing.\n\nComputer scientists like Fei-Fei Li, the Stanford professor famous for inventing ImageNet, and Yann LeCun, Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist, are building what they call \"world models.\"\n\nUnlike large language models, which determine outputs based on statistical relationships between words and phrases, world models anticipate outcomes by mimicking the mental constructs that humans make of the world around them.\n\n\"Humans,\" Li said on an episode of Andreessen Horowitz's A16z podcast in June, \"not only do we survive, live, and work, but we build civilization beyond language.\"\n\nPut simply, world models are AI systems that anticipate what will happen next, much like humans use intuition based on their experience to predict the consequences of their actions. Think of a child who, with no language skills, will learn to understand that if they push a toy car, it will roll.\n\nComputer scientist and MIT professor, Jay Wright Forrester, in his 1971 paper \"Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems,\" explained why mental models are crucial to human behavior:\n\nIf AI is to meet or surpass human intelligence, then the researchers behind it believe it should be able to make mental models, too.\n\nLi has been working on this through World Labs, which she cofounded in 2024 with an initial backing of $230 million from venture firms like Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associates, and Radical Ventures. \"We aim to lift AI models from the 2D plane of pixels to full 3D worlds — both virtual and real — endowing them with spatial intelligence as rich as our own,\" World Labs says on its website.\n\nLi said on the \"No Priors\" podcast in June that spatial intelligence is \"the ability to understand, reason, interact, and generate 3D worlds,\" given that the world is fundamentally three-dimensional.\n\nLi said she sees applications for world models in creative fields, robotics, or any area that warrants infinite universes.\n\nThe challenge of building world models is the paucity of sufficient data. In contrast to language, which humans have refined and documented over centuries, spatial intelligence is less developed.\n\n\"If I ask you to close your eyes right now and draw out or build a 3D model of the environment around you, it's not that easy,\" she said on the \"No Priors\" podcast. \"We don't have that much capability to generate extremely complicated models till we get trained.\"\n\nTo gather the data necessary for these models, \"we require more and more sophisticated data engineering, data acquisition, data processing, and data synthesis,\" she said.\n\nThat makes the challenge of building a believable world even greater.\n\nLeCun, who is leaving his post as the chief AI scientist at Meta at the end of the year to launch his own startup called Advanced Machine Intelligence, has long been fixated on world models, which he says are more competent than large language models because they have common sense, the capacity to reason and plan, and persistent memory.\n\nIn a November LinkedIn post announcing his new venture, LeCun said the company's goal is to \"bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.\"\n\nOn December 19, LeCun said on LinkedIn that he was recruiting Alex LeBrun, the cofounder and CEO of Nabla, an AI assistant for clinicians, as CEO of AMI Labs.\n\nIn a Nabla press release announcing the transition, LeBrun said, \"Healthcare AI is entering a new era, one where reliability, determinism, and simulation matter as much as linguistic intelligence.\"\n\n\"This partnership builds on that shared vision and gives Nabla privileged access to world model technology that will complement today's LLMs and help unlock the safe, autonomous systems clinicians need,\" he added.\n\nPrior to the launch of AMI Labs, LeCun and a small team of researchers were working on a similar project at Meta, using video data to train models and run simulations that abstract the videos at different levels.\n\n\"The basic idea is that you don't predict at the pixel level. You train a system to run an abstract representation of the video so that you can make predictions in that abstract representation, and hopefully this representation will eliminate all the details that cannot be predicted,\" he said at the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year.\n\n\"We're thinking about world models and visual multimodal intelligence. We want to move beyond purely visual systems into something broader — models that understand not just what they see, but how the world works,\" Moonvalley's chief scientific officer, Mateusz Malinowski, told Business Insider.\n\nApplications for world models include humanoid robotics and real-world planning, he said. The company says it is already training robots on its world models.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Malinowski explained the differences between these newer world models and existing vision models, which are used for tasks from facial recognition to object tracking.\n\n\"I'd start with saying that vision model is a very broad term,\" Malinowski wrote. \"If we're referring to text-to-video generation models, from my vantage point, these models can be seen as the first steps for world models. World models emphasize world simulation, adherence to physical reality, long-term consistency of the environment, and action-conditioned generation.\"\n\nThat said, Malinowski notes key differences between the world models being built by Moonvalley and those under development at World Labs.\n\n\"I believe that long-term goals are the same, but we are approaching the problem of world modelling differently,\" he wrote. \"We focus on using video models as first-class citizens, where spatial intelligence is more implicit. In the short term, our approach seems more suited for filmmaking and robotics due to motion and soft bodies modelling.\"",

    "description": "There’s never been just one way to buy software. In ye olden times, if you liked some shareware, you’d mail off a cheque, or call up a hot-line, to get the full version. Later on, you could walk into a store and walk out with a shiny box, manuals, and disks.",
    "fullText": "There’s never been just one way to buy software. In ye olden times, if you liked some shareware, you’d mail off a cheque, or call up a hot-line, to get the full version. Later on, you could walk into a store and walk out with a shiny box, manuals, and disks.\n\nThese were some expensive boxes:\n\nNo one technically had to upgrade, but in a year or so, everybody did, because we wanted those sweet quality-of-life improvements, nicer design, and exciting new features. But eventually every product being continually developed will become good enough for its target market.\n\nWhen that happens, companies (especially the VC-backed kind) now need to contrive new and increasingly stick-like reasons for customers to pay again. From made-for-marketing ‘features’ that suck to use IRL, to breaking compatibility with older versions, to spamming you with marketing notifications and embedded ads. Their relationship with customers goes from symbiotic to parasitic.\n\nOn the other hand, the pursuit of completeness should be an ideal fit for subscription software because, theoretically, steady monthly payments from long-time customers incentivizes stability, polish, and helpful improvements.\n\nSubscriptions are particularly helpful for businesses:\n\nEspecially for solo creators, just knowing that you have ~$3000/mo coming in every month is way less anxiety-inducing than making $6,000 in a good month – but knowing that next month you could just as likely make $1000, or maybe even $0. It’s like being a farmer, surviving at the mercy of good weather.\n\nThere’s also a third reason: Tier or usage-based pricing prevents customers costing more money than they contribute. But unless you’re burning unlimited money generating LLM tokens, the risk of losing money on a web app customer is either basically zero, or very easy to predict otherwise (even over the long-term).\n\nOn paper, subscriptions could be a win-win. But some people, including many readers of this blog, have good reasons to be wary of them.\n\nKinopio subscriptions can be easily cancelled, pricing is grandfathered, receipts are emailed, accidental renewals can be refunded, and there are no cancellation fees or deceptive dark patterns. Many indie subscription apps also offer subscriptions in good faith.\n\nBut a business model that’s regularly exploited by well-known corporations, like the New York Times and Adobe, poisons the well for everyone else. Every time someone gets tricked into signing up for a non-refundable yearly subscription instead of a monthly one, or has to call to cancel a subscription they created online, those bad feelings become associated with all subscriptions.\n\nIt’s hard to have good long-lasting relationships with customers if they’re expecting the worst.\n\nThat being said, I still think subscriptions make sense to offer.\n\nFor most people, subscriptions are as normal as the old boxed software model used to be. And the much lower-cost to entry can be very helpful – especially in competitive markets where customers have a lot of options.\n\nThe onus is on companies selling subscriptions to earn trust by being transparent about who they are, what they believe, and how they’re funded (i.e. what their long-term incentives are). A public roadmap and changelog also go a long-way towards proving they practice what they preach.\n\nEven to non-technical people, paying for subscriptions makes intuitive sense when the product requires a server for helpful things like file uploads, public URLs, and real-time collaboration. But the per-user-cost of running a production CRUD server is basically zero. Counter-intuitively, what you’re really paying for is the considerable effort and expertise that it takes to keep full-featured software running reliably and continuously-improving.\n\nThat’s part of the reason why I increased prices over the years as the app grew in capability and complexity.\n\nFor context, here’s Kinopio’s pricing history:\n\nWhen I introduced paid upgrades to Kinopio in 2020, I did it as a monthly subscription because that seemed like the safe, default model for an app that needed a server.\n\nIn all my previous jobs, there was always a dedicated back-end or sysadmin team that abstracted the server hosting details from the rest of the company. They used complicated sounding terms like load balancing, replica shards, containers, observability, were woken up by pagerDuty, and were eternally worried about scaling.\n\nBut when I dived into that world, I learned that most of the jargon really didn’t matter. The kinopio-server is a simple node.js app with a pretty straightforward MVC architecture. My insecurity about keeping servers up is a big reason behind why the app works offline, or if the server is down. What developers would call local-first today.\n\nIn 2019, I wrote about my early Plans for Kinopio. Where I mentioned that,\n\n“Kinopio consists of two codebases, the client-app that runs when in the browser and the server-app which enables sharing and collaboration. The client is like a cockroach, its tiny, basically free to host, and doesn’t depend on a connection to the server. So if I can’t afford to run the Kinopio server anymore, I can just switch it off and you can continue to use Kinopio as you do now – with all your data intact.”\n\nTwo years later, I introduced the lifetime plan mainly because people kept asking me for a subscription alternative. I’m sure many of them would have still have paid for a subscription, but how long would a rueful customer stay? Would they always be looking for alternatives? Would they still enthusiastically share spaces and recommend the app to their friends and teams?\n\nMy business ‘strategy’ is that a happy customer is better than an unhappy one, and that I’d rather have some money from a user than none. (Relatedly, that’s also why Kinopio offers student/financial needs discounts).\n\nThe lifetime plan is priced at ~3× the yearly price because that was the average churn length at the time. But I think that in general, 3-4 years is a good starting point if you get a nice sounding number that is high enough so that only <10% of new customers choose it, while stilling feeling anchored to the subscription prices.\n\nSoftware designers and engineers regularly build products with original ideas, and choose to make their own jobs harder by increasing code complexity, so that their users can have an inviting, easier-to-use, and lower-friction, time using it.\n\nBut on the financial-side, web-based software companies tend to be really conservative with their business models and choose subscription-only models by default. It’s never even questioned, but I think it should be. Just like with dev work, pricing models can also take on behind-the-scenes complexity to give users a better experience.\n\nLow-variability/high-tail income (subscription MRR) is easiest to plan for, but high-variability/short-tail income (lifetime purchases) is peaky and harder to plan for – but they can work together. If you position and price it right, the ideal customers for lifetime pricing will be very different than the ideal subscription customers.\n\nIt may sound counter-intuitive to give your most passionate users a pathway to never have to pay you again, but especially early on, evangelism is worth more than money. There are plenty of fish in the sea: people who have yet to find, or be recommended, Kinopio and become future customers.",

    "fullText": "Norway is becoming a global leader in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, achieving a remarkable growth in sales of these vehicles. EV sales in the country have increased from just 1% of total sales in 2010 to 88.9% of vehicles sold in 2024. In the first weeks of 2025, this figure has reached 96%, an impressive achievement for a country that has set a clear goal: to become the first in the world to use only electric vehicles.\n\nSwitching to electric vehicles is one of the biggest changes we can make to improve the health of our planet and combat climate change. Electric vehicles are cleaner, with low or no greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the reduction of air pollution and carbon emissions, which are one of the main causes of global warming.\n\nIn Norway, this transition is happening not through punitive measures against internal combustion engine vehicles, but through active support and strong incentives for electric vehicle users. Government policies have included VAT exemptions, lower parking and road taxes, and privileged access to bus lanes. This has led a large number of Norwegians to choose electric vehicles as their first option.\n\nIn addition to financial incentives, the Norwegian government has been investing heavily in charging infrastructure. Many homes and businesses in Norway can now charge their electric vehicles under convenient conditions, removing one of the main barriers to mass adoption of EVs. This has made electric vehicles easier to use and have a longer lifespan for users, contributing to increased sales and adoption.\n\nAnother factor that has helped Norway achieve this is the country's wealth and energy resources. Norway is a major exporter of oil and gas, but it is using these revenues to finance the costs of subsidies and investments in the clean energy sector. Cheap energy from renewable sources such as hydropower and wind power is enabling Norwegians to drive electric vehicles without paying much for energy.\n\nRico Luman, an economist and auto industry expert, has called Norway a “global pioneer” in this area. He says Norway has created a successful model that can help many other countries address the challenges of pollution and climate change by using electric vehicles as part of a broader strategy for sustainable transportation.\n\nIn conclusion, Norway is a shining example for the world. With a phenomenal growth in electric vehicle sales and an advanced supporting infrastructure, this country has made great strides towards a clean and sustainable future. And while many other countries are still far from reaching such a level, Norway has shown that with the right policies and a commitment to change, a cleaner, greener world can be created for future generations.",

The family had planned a vacation to Serbia to visit family and friends, the lawsuit stated.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Delta said that \"the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines.\" The airline added that it will \"review the complaint and respond accordingly in due course.\"\n\nThe filing states the flights were round-trip and business class, purchased through Delta's SkyMiles program, and operated by KLM. The four tickets were worth $8,800 at the time, according to the suit.\n\nRoughly two hours into the flight to Amsterdam, one of the plaintiffs started to feel like she was being bitten by bugs crawling on her, according to the filing. She then realized that bugs were \"crawling on her light-colored sweater,\" the filing stated.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the couple \"immediately\" notified the flight staff and were told to keep their voices down to avoid causing \"panic\" on the plane. The couple took photos and videos of the bugs crawling on the sweater and in the creases of their seats, which were included in the lawsuit.\n\nPrior to landing, the flight attendants urged the couple again not to tell anyone about the infestation because they would miss their connecting flight to Serbia if they did, the filing stated.\n\nA little over a week after the incident, the couple took their children to doctors in Roanoke, Virginia, where it was confirmed that the bites were caused by bed bugs, the lawsuit said. The family was recommended to employ \"bug bombs\" in their home and car, and wash their clothing in hot water, the filing said.\n\nWhile bed bugs are an unusual complaint, this isn't the first time passengers have turned to the courts after a bad flight experience. In September, 16 passengers sued American Airlines after their flight caught fire. Last year, a passenger sued Delta for $1 million, alleging a faulty armrest broke his rib.\n\nKLM did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — On a Christmas Day when the war in Ukraine casts a shadow over Europe, concerns over immigration divide societies, and some politicians fan anger and resentment, Britain’s King Charles III called on people to focus on kindness instead of conflict.\n\nDelivering his annual holiday address from Westminster Abbey, Charles said Thursday the Christmas story of wise men and shepherds traveling through the night to find their savior shows how we can find strength in the “companionship and kindness of others.”\n\n“To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope, of resilience in the face of adversity,” Charles said. “Peace through forgiveness, simply getting to know our neighbors and by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships.”\n\n“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he added.\n\nThe speech, which concluded with a Christmas carol sung by a Ukrainian choir, comes as European leaders rally support for Ukraine amid signs that U.S. President Donald Trump is losing patience with America’s traditional European allies. At home, British politics have become increasingly bitter as Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government struggles to control unauthorized migration and bolster creaking public services.\n\nCharles, the titular head of the Church of England, chose Westminster Abbey as the site of his Christmas Day broadcast to underscore the theme of pilgrimage that ran through the speech. The abbey, known as the site of coronations and royal weddings, is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage honoring Edward the Confessor, an early king of England who was canonized as a saint in 1161.\n\n“Pilgrimage is a word less used today, but it is of particular significance for our modern world, and especially at Christmas,’’ he said. “This is about journeying forward into the future, while also journeying back to remember the past and learn from its lessons.”\n\nCharles and his family made their own pilgrimage on foot earlier in the day to St. Mary Magdalene Church on the king’s private Sandringham Estate, about 100 miles north of London.\n\nCharles and Queen Camilla, along with Prince William and his wife, Kate, and their children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, and extended family walked to the church and greeted the crowds of people after the service.\n\nEvents earlier this year marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II underscored the need to learn from the past, Charles said. While there are fewer and fewer living veterans of that conflict, we must remember the courage and sacrifice of those who fought the war and the way communities came together “in the face of such great challenge,” he said.\n\n“These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth,” he said. “As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.’’\n\nThe monarch’s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The pre-recorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m. London time, when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.\n\nThe speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn’t seek guidance from the government.\n\nThis year’s address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said “good news” from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.\n\nThe king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a “precautionary phase” and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.\n\nThe speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, from the king to his grandchildren, George and Louis and Charlotte, meeting with the public and carrying out their royal duties.\n\nThat included scenes from the king’s historic trip to the Vatican as he works to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe event was the first time since King Henry VIII severed ties with Rome that the leaders of the two Christian churches, divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests in the Church of England, have prayed together.\n\nThe king’s message was clear. Even if some years had passed, there’s always hope to start over. Peace is possible.",

    "fullText": "Northwestern assistant head coach Harlon Barnett has a long list of nicknames ready to use whenever he addresses or talks about safety Robert Fitzgerald.\n\nThe Terminator. The World’s Greatest Tackler. The Face of the Big Ten. The Eraser. The General. The Example. Mr. Consistent.\n\n“He’s going to start forgetting his own name,” Barnett said.\n\nFitzgerald has given Barnett a lot of reason to talk about him in a breakout season that continues at noon Friday in Northwestern’s game against Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on ESPN.\n\nThe redshirt junior goes into the game at Detroit’s Ford Field as the Big Ten leader with 68 solo tackles for a Wildcats defense that fueled their 6-6 regular season. He ranked fourth in the conference with 109 tackles and also had 6½ tackles for a loss, three passes defended, an interception and a fumble recovery.\n\n“He’s maximizing his gifts, talents and abilities that the Lord has given him,” Barnett said. “And he takes no days off.”\n\nFitzgerald’s season, for which he was named second-team All-Big Ten by coaches, comes after three years of working his way into bigger roles with Northwestern. He began with the Wildcats scout team and then played primarily on special teams in his first two seasons before earning more time on defense last year.\n\nThroughout the climb, he focused on the process, determined that when the Wildcats needed him, he would be prepared.\n\n“You’ve got to put the work in, day in, day out, no matter how long it takes,” Fitzgerald said. “But eventually your opportunity is going to come. And when that opportunity came, I knew that I was going to be ready based on all the work that I’ve been putting in for the past three years, on and off the field, in the weight room, in the training room, getting my body right, learning the playbook, studying film.”\n\nFitzgerald’s approach — and his understanding of the value of each day — was developed in part before his time at Northwestern. During his senior year of high school in Dallas, he watched his father, Matthew, fight ALS, and his memories of his dad have shaped how he lives now.\n\nThe Fitzgerald family would have Italian beef and Lou Malnati’s shipped to Dallas for Chicago Bears-Green Bay Packers games. Fitzgerald and his sister, Olivia, were Packers fans because of their mom, Amy, who is from Wisconsin. Matt, who grew up in the Wildwood/Edgebrook area of Chicago, cheered for the Bears.\n\n“He always said that my mom brainwashed me and my sister to be Packers fans,” Fitzgerald said.\n\nFitzgerald said his father was passionate about the work he did as a marketing executive. Midway through his career, he met Mark Cuban at the gym, became friends with him and became the Mavericks senior vice president for marketing and communications, a job that allowed Fitzgerald to be a Mavs ball boy and meet Dirk Nowitzki as a kid.\n\nMatt could light up a room and was passionate about his family and friends, a trait Fitzgerald carries with him to his relationships.\n\nAnd the former Loyola Academy safety loved football, a passion he passed on to his son. Fitzgerald remembers spending countless hours on the couch watching NFL Sunday Ticket with his dad. They would play in the backyard, reenacting Super Bowl-winning drives, making sideline grabs or playing goal-line tackle, the latter game one his mother didn’t love.\n\nFitzgerald said his dad was the biggest influence on his football career, giving him everything he needed to be successful. And he kept cheering on his son even after he was diagnosed with ALS the summer before Fitzgerald’s senior year at Jesuit College Prep. Fitzgerald, an All-State safety and running back that season, would look up into the stands to see his dad.\n\n“I’d be like, ‘Whatever I’m going through — I’m tired out here; I’m exhausted — whatever I’m going through is minuscule compared to what he’s going through,’” Fitzgerald said. “So that kind of drove me in high school my senior year, and I’ve kind of been able to use that as fuel going forward.”\n\nFitzgerald, who is no relation to former Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald, chose Northwestern in part because of his father’s connection to the Chicago area. His grandmother still lived at the time in the same home Matt grew up in. Fitzgerald’s aunt lives in Naperville. His dad’s friends are around and come to games.\n\nIllinois and Northwestern are headed to bowl games: Here’s what to know\n\nBut Matt didn’t get to see him play for the Wildcats. Matt died on July 22, 2022, just as Fitzgerald was beginning fall camp with Northwestern.\n\n“The whole thing changed my perspective on life for sure,” Fitzgerald said. “I don’t take a single day for granted anymore. Just watching the way he handled it and the way he attacked it just really was amazing to see. And it was amazing to see how strong my mom was throughout the entire disease. And it was also amazing how many people showed up for my family. The community really showed up for us.”\n\nWhen Fitzgerald thinks about how he got through that time in his life — getting acclimated at a new school in the midst of losing his father — he said his family helped, especially his mom, who was “the rock throughout the whole thing.”\n\nAnd his Northwestern teammates and coaches helped too. It wasn’t just letting him know they were sorry or there for him. Sometimes it was just acting normally, because he needed that too.\n\n“My teammates just really rallied around me, and they kind of became like 110 brothers that I never had,” he said.\n\nFitzgerald’s freshman season wasn’t easy on the field either as he realized he would be playing behind guys with several years of experience.\n\nHe played scout team for a 1-11 squad before getting a few reps on special teams at the end of the year, which became a redshirt season. But he believed that if he kept working, he could increase his opportunities.\n\nIn his second season, he started on three special teams units and played in a third-down subpackage. By his third year, he made the defensive rotation and started some at nickel for the Wildcats.\n\nBarnett, who joined Braun’s staff before the 2024 season, saw a player who was intentional and diligent with his work. He told Fitzgerald at the end of that season that he probably should have played more at safety, and he saw that message take hold to build Fitzgerald’s confidence in the offseason.\n\n“I saw toughness,” Barnett said. “I saw a willingness to get better. I saw a guy that takes coaching. He’s one of those guys who’s going to do exactly what you tell him. He’s going to take it to heart, he’s going to listen to you and he’s going to apply it. And that’s what you like to see as a coach.”\n\nBarnett, who played defensive back at Michigan State and in the NFL, always tells his players that they need to believe that they are the best player on the field.\n\nRecapping an eventful 2025 for Chicago sports on — and off — the field\n\nFitzgerald said he knew he was meant to be in the starting-safety role after the opener against Tulane, when he had 13 tackles. But his confidence was really in place by the fourth game of the season against UCLA, a 17-14 Northwestern win in which Fitzgerald had nine tackles, including a tackle for a loss. He wouldn’t freak out if he missed a tackle. He told himself he was the best player on the field.\n\n“Then he started playing like that — ‘I’m the baddest dude out here. I’m the baddest guy on the field,’” Barnett said.\n\nFitzgerald had numerous big plays in Northwestern’s near-upset of Michigan at Wrigley Field on Nov. 15. He had a career-high 15 tackles, including a tackle for a loss, and picked off quarterback Bryce Underwood in the fourth quarter, but Barnett got excited about a hit on a Wolverines running back late in the fourth.\n\n“He came in and smacked one of the running backs,” Barnett said. “I am vicariously playing through the players. And so, oh, man, I was so fired up. … And I don’t like Michigan, so that also adds to it.”\n\nRecapping an eventful 2025 for Chicago sports on — and off — the field\n\nChicago basketball report: WNBA players authorize a strike — and ‘Ain’t no Christmas’ for Notre Dame men\n\nKeaton Wagler powers No. 20 Illinois past Missouri 91-48 for the biggest blowout in Braggin’ Rights rivalry\n\nNotre Dame — with 96-game rivalry series vs. USC now on pause — announces home-and-home with BYU\n\nHannah Hildago posts triple-double in No. 20 Notre Dame women’s 110-38 win over Bellarmine\n\nFitzgerald will have one more chance this season to show up Friday against Central Michigan. He said the Wildcats want to finish with a winning record, send their seniors out on a high note and build some momentum heading into next season.\n\nBarnett said in the offseason Fitzgerald will continue to work on his speed and change of direction, on honing his already solid ball skills and tackling and improving his “vision and break” to where the quarterback is sending the ball.\n\nHe expects him to continue to develop his leadership too. Fitzgerald delivered a speech to the team before the Tulane game to rally his teammates and said he is working on being a more vocal leader, which comes naturally after he feels like he has earned it.\n\nThat merit has come this season. Earlier this year, Northwestern coach David Braun said Fitzgerald should be proud of the demeanor and the consistency with which he has played, adding “there’s no one in this program that reflects our values more than that young man.”\n\nFitzgerald has thought about how his dad would view this breakout season, and he knows he would revel in it.\n\n“He would eat this season up,” Fitzgerald said. “He would love to see me. I know he’s watching, but he would love to be in those stands and see me out there, just like I was playing in high school.”",

    "title": "2025-26 World Junior Championships PRIMER: Everything you need to know!",
    "description": "It’s the premiere teenager tournament, this time located in Minnesota!",
    "fullText": "What is it?: Teenager hockey at the highest level being played in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada!\n\nWhen is it?: The games start December 26th, and the medal round begins just after New Year’s Day on the 2nd.\n\nWhere can I watch it?: TSN in Canada, NHLN in the states, apparently TUBI will also have it if you stream your hockey.\n\nWho’s the defending champs?: The United States, who is going for a threepeat this year!\n\nWhy should I care?: Why, you get to see the NHL stars of tomorrow face off for World Juniors glory! Gavin McKenna gets to wow you before he even gets the chance to play for an NHL team! Also it’s pretty inoffensive hockey that people get super wound up over while you’re puttering around the house during the holidays, so there aught to be some good yucks at certain fanbases (read: Canada’s) expense. Also, the relegation round is always a fun treat for those who want to see imperfect, desperate hockey, a personal favorite of mine.\n\nTeam USA: James Hagens, Will Zellers\n\nOne must imagine Sweden happy, because once again they should be set up to be a powerhouse…and it might shock you to learn that nobody is concerned because they have to get past the US and then will have to beat Canada or Finland in order to get the Gold Medal they so desperately crave. There’s just no winning for them unless they win it all, and that will be tough. In the round robin they usually do pretty well, and their roster this year is once again damn good; Sascha Boumedienne, Loke Krantz, Ivar Stenburg, Anton Frondell, with decent netminders in Goos and Härenstam suggests they will be just as good as they usually are. Problem is, we know that. We know they will likely cruise to another Group top or close to it. Then they have to play in the elimination round. Tre Kronor’s biggest issue remains that elimination round play, and who knows if this version of Sweden can survive it. I’m pretty sure they can…they just have to, you know…do it.\n\nSlovakia remains interested in proving they are A) Not Mad about Juraj Slafkovsky’s comments that suggest the federation is indolent, and B) You can ignore their considerable interest in buddying up to the Russian Federation because they’re A-Okay, baby. Slovakia unfortunately does have some issues facing them coming into the tourney: their 2023 class has aged out entirely, and a vast majority of their team is so, so young. In some cases that may benefit them, as there’s less tape on these kids and the ones who they do have tape on are pretty good. For most however…well, they don’t have the same caliber of player they used to in a division where Sweden and the US are, and they usually had a good chance to beat the US up ‘till now. They’re going to have to hope Michal Pradel can hold the fort long enough for guys like Michal Capos, Jan Chovan, and Michal Svrcek can get these youngsters moving like they can. I don’t think they’re necessarily worse than the rest of their division, but I certainly wouldn’t put them any higher than 3rd unless Pradel starts doing 3rd eye goaltending.\n\nHere’s the thing: by all accounts, Germany should be in trouble. Their defense is kind of awkward and not especially noteworthy, and they’re banking on a WHL goalie to be their rock in net. That is a rock I think they could trust in spurts here or there, but maybe not all the way. Why I think they escape relegation this year is that Die Eismannschaft is more offensively gifted than Switzerland; especially up front. Max Penkin, Max Schafer, and David Lewandowski have all found great success this year in Canadian Junior/DEL play, and zee Germans might have something in brothers Timo and Fabio Kose, who play different positions but have shown great flashes of talent against grown-ass men in the DEL. Against players their own age? They may yet shine. Veillard, while I don’t necessarily trust an .890 SV% goalie, is a vet for this squad, and I imagine they will rally around him.\n\nIt breaks my heart to suggest Switzerland may end up on the relegation block this year, I have loved their fundamentals only, no funny business kind of hockey for years, but ultimately the level of talent at the WJC is improving, and so far the Swiss have failed to meet the moment. It stinks especially because they do have interesting talent! They have\n\nAfter Canada publicly embarrassed themselves last year and the year before, The True North appear to have taken a much more humble approach to the World Juniors of casually bringing everyone who is good and available to the World Juniors. Even better, the omissions this year were largely because the Pacific teams that they were signed to still want them to be on the roster, and thus can’t justify assigning them. Even better than that, Group B is about as easy a division as you could ask for if Canada really is as built up as they say they are…which is what I would say, had Gavin McKenna not made it clear that he’s prone to error as much as anyone else, and Sweden doesn’t even have to play Canada until a hypothetical medal round. In general, a lot rides on Canada right now. They’ve been slipping badly over the past few tourneys and have turned “underdog gets first win over Canada” into an almost yearly spectacle. Regardless of how you feel about their place in the sport, Canada in the tourneys that count does not have the luxury of expecting to be good anymore. In short, they need to run away with this one and quickly, or we are once again going to start a dialogue about the decision-making corps for the Red and White (and sometimes black).\n\nFinland’s effort in the early parts of this tournament have always been a bit slow; especially with their proclivity for penalties, so don’t be surprised if they look like they’re in trouble to start out. What they are however, is in a very weird place. They’re without Konsta Helenius; their current premiere prospect of World Juniors age, and as such are going to need to adjust to life without him. They’re not screwed by a long shot, but now they need to focus down on other talents to help them out. In net, as per usual, they will have a murderer’s row of good goalies to choose from; Kim Saarinen and Petteri Rimpinen will once again be their rock in net, allowing talents like Julius Miettinen, Emil Hemming, Matias Vanhanen, and Max Westergard to do what they usually do best; cause a ruckus on the boards, rip off a solid pass, and score goals. Losing Helenius however means they lose a level of dynamism that would have otherwise given them an edge against the Group leader once we get to that point on the calendar. Still, the Finns always find a way to drag teams down to their level, so while Canada might get the edge on them to start, they always find a way to crawl back in and make you regret it. Also, Rimpinen has the coolest pads in this tournament. Bar none.\n\nCzechia has traditionally been an offense or bust kind of team; one that’s free-wheeling and fun if a little chaotic. That chaos allowed them to be Bronze Medalists at last year’s tourney. Is that gonna change? Maybe! Granted, they still have plenty of impressive and fun forwards they can call on to make their brand of frantic and fun hockey work, but now they’ll have an extra hand from the backend; they’ve decided to bring Radim Mrtka, Jakub Fibigr, Vashek Blanar, and Adam Jiricek to the dance, and from the skaters alone it seems like Czechia plans to survive this tourney through blistering offense.\n\nLatvia has the benefit of their upset win over Canada to allow them to survive through this tournament. That’s probably what’s going to get them through this tournament entirely because otherwise Latvia has lost a lot of the talent that made them so special last year. They will have to rely on the work of players who’ve spent a lot of time abroad: Roberts Naudins has been tearing it up for Shattuck St. Marys Prep, Daniels Serkins has been doing great for SC Bern in Switzerland, and of course; the Latvians have their wunderkind; Alberts Smits, who is projected to be a first round pick this year. They do have a team attitude and game plan that usually makes them a lot tougher to play than you might expect, but they also tend to need their goalies to be lights out. Of the three they brought; Nils Roberts Maurins would likely have to play way above his paygrade to keep them in games. Otherwise, their tournament will be as per usual; passionate fans, painful results.\n\nThere are going to be players on Denmark with more middle names than goals this year. Have fun playing Switzerland in the knockout round!\n\nIt looks like this! The games begin on December 26th, and the Elimination round begins on January 2nd.",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Penguins will have two players participating in this year’s World Junior Championships, the U-20 tournament that takes place starting tomorrow, Friday December 26th and lasting through Monday January 5th over in Minnesota. What the Pens lack in quantity will be made up for in quantity with Canada’s Harrison Brunicke and the US’s Will Horcoff both expected to fill key roles for the two powerhouse teams.\n\nHorcoff finished the tune-up games on the first line for the Americans, playing left wing for high draft pick James Hagens. Center depth has been a question mark and potential question mark for the US, it shows where Horcoff is that he’s being used for the national team on the wing, just as where he normally plays for the University of Michigan these days.\n\nSteven Ellis from the Daily Faceoff listed Horcoff among his handful of top performers in that tune-up game against Finland:\n\n#24 Will Horcoff, LW (Pittsburgh Penguins): After scoring twice against Germany, Horcoff looked great again today with a good first-period goal. He does an excellent job of rushing to the net and using his big frame to bully opponents. He also has quick hands, something that very few players his size manage to replicate. Horcoff likely has played his way onto the top line with James Hagens and Brodie Ziemer for good.\n\nThe good news there is that description is perfectly in-line with what Horcoff has been doing all fall so far at Michigan, where he’s emerged as a goal-scoring machine and one of the top prospects in NCAA hockey this season. Horcoff could be on the verge of an even bigger coming out party on the international stage if he can prove himself against the best players in his 18-19 year old age bracket.\n\nThe US plays Germany on Friday at 6:00pm eastern (NHL Network) as they look to repeat on last year’s championship and add a fourth ‘chip within the last six years. The US follows that up with round robin games against Switzerland (Dec 27th), Slovakia (Dec 29th) and Sweden (Dec 31st) before the single-elimination quarterfinals start on January 2nd.\n\nHarrison Brunicke and the Canadians are over in the other group, they will play the Czechs on the 26th to open things up, followed by Latvia on the 27th, Denmark on the 29th and Finland on New Year’s Eve.\n\nEllis did a nice writeup on the experienced Brunicke heading into this tournament as well:\n\nIn total, Brunicke has played 26 pro games between the NHL and AHL over two years. For a player his age, that’s a lot of quality competition and increased speed he has had to deal with.\n\n“Coaches love that at this level,” one scout said. “They know they can count on the guys who’ve played against the best of the best. They’re coachable.”\n\nBrunicke has played a lot of meaningful hockey early in his career. He played in the Memorial Cup in 2023 prior to his draft year and then helped Canada win gold at the U-18 World Championship the following spring. Brunicke even skated in a pair of games with the senior national team ahead of the 2025 World Championship – showing a high level of trust from the Hockey Canada brass. That, plus his NHL experience, has allowed Brunicke to handle every challenge thrown his way so far.\n\n“When you’re in more high-pressure situations, you get more comfortable with it,” Brunicke said. “I’m hoping to bring that here.”\n\nMany believe Brunicke will be loaned back to Kamloops for the team’s WHL playoff push after the tournament. Others think the 6-foot-3 defender would benefit more from playing against men in the NHL. Regardless, he needs playing time – and he’s set to get a lot of it for Canada.\n\n“I’m still trying to build that pro style of game, where it’s strictly hard defense, where you’re moving the puck and moving your feet, less risks,” Brunicke said. “That’s what I’m trying to bring here.”\n\nParekh is projected to be Canada’s No. 1 right-handed defender. That’ll leave Brunicke on the second pair, where he’ll still be able to eat heavy minutes as he did in Kamloops. Canada has a strong contender this year, and Brunicke is expected to be a leader, especially with his NHL experience.\n\nBrunicke has played just five games over the past month, all coming in the AHL. The native of Johannesburg, South Africa had four points in that span, showing a high level of puck proficiency. On the surface, going from playing against men and adjusting to junior hockey sounds easy. But there’s a real adjustment, especially from a tempo perspective.\n\nBrunicke is ready for the challenge.\n\n“Whatever position I’m put in, whatever role, I’m ready to execute it,” Brunicke said. “I’m a two-way defenseman, playing hard defensively and getting to show my offense as well. I want to be a reliable defenseman who can eat minutes.”\n\nAfter a fall mostly spent watching or practicing, Brunicke should certainly get all the chances he can handle in this venue where he is one of the most experienced players. Team Canada looks stacked with talent, they’ll need a veteran like Brunicke to help guide them along.\n\nThe fun for the Pens will be what looks like the annual, inevitable collision between the US and the Canadians, which will just so happen to feature Pittsburgh having one of the top American forwards and Canadian defenders. That won’t happen until early in the new year with the group format, but one that would be very closely monitored in Western PA.",

    "fullText": "Peter Thiel has been described variously as ‘America’s leading public intellectual’, the ‘architect of Silicon Valley’s contemporary ethos’ or as an ‘incoherent and alarmingly super-nationalistic’ malevolent force. The PayPal and Palantir founder, a prominent early supporter of Donald Trump, is one of the world’s richest and most influential men. Throughout his career, his principal concern has always been the future, so when The Spectator asked to interview him, he wanted to talk to young people. To that effect, three young members of the editorial team were sent to Los Angeles to meet him. What follows is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nWILLIAM ATKINSON: Following Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York, an email that you sent five years ago has gone viral. You argued that with accumulating student debt and housing costs, it was no surprise that young people were turning to socialism. How do you explain that there are Gen Zs, like us, who aren’t on the left?\n\n‘The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing. America is no longer a great country’\n\nPETER THIEL: My sense is that in the US, Britain, Germany and France, the Gen Z voters are less centrist. I wouldn’t say they’re more drawn to the extremes, but they do not believe there are solutions within the Overton window straitjacket, the narrow space that’s been defined between New Labour and the Tories [in the UK] for the past three decades. And then there’s Reform, a party that repudiates that spectrum. For the first time in 200 years, there’s a real party to the right of the Tories. It’s not just a Gen Z phenomenon, but there’s a Gen Z part that is very important.\n\nWE: You first argued in the late 2000s that the backlash from globalisation would upend politics. Do you often feel that the world is catching up with Peter Thiel?\n\nPT: These things were coming for a long time. Student debt was $300 billion in 2000, around $2 trillion today. The GFC [global financial crisis] in 2008 was a big watershed. Entry-level jobs became less well paid. For students graduating after 2008, it became much, much harder to get out of the debt. Student debt slows you down from buying a house, getting started with forming a family, becoming an actual adult. You end up with a completely different society. It takes a long time to figure this out. But I started talking about this a lot in 2010… Why did house prices go up so much faster than incomes? Not enough was built. A big part was built as a retirement vehicle for older people. They were happy with the prices going up. The Tory party in the UK is probably completely past the point of no return. The suggestion that I have had was that you must start by throwing everybody out of the party who comes from real estate. You must be willing to purge all the people that are part of this dysfunctional system.\n\nJOHN POWER: What would your advice be to someone in their twenties about how they can have an impact in politics? Should they join Reform?\n\nPT: I think about politics a fair bit, but if I spent all my life on it, I would go out of my mind. I would like people to be more involved in right-wing politics, but I’m not sure that’s the best thing for most. You certainly should work for Reform rather than Labour or the Tories. You can criticise Nigel Farage as too much of a Boomer but he’s less structurally hateful to the young people. But maybe this is not the right way to frame the questions. We’re gonna have a revolution from Gen Z – all these crazy things that they are going to be doing. Is this good or bad? I’ve often said, in the early 20th century you think of both communism and fascism as youth movements that went very, very haywire. In the early 21st century, the reality is we have inverted demographic pyramids. There are not enough young people. We’re not going to get youthful communism or youthful fascism. We have this unbelievably oppressive, powerful gerontocracy. Maybe you can get communism or fascism of old people, but it’s very low-energy. It will avoid some of the defects of the early 20th century.But it’ll have many other kinds of problems. The general challenge for Gen Z is that there are big constraints.\n\nMy hope is that there always are some technological fixes, defining technology as doing more with less. If the debate is more with more spending or less with less spending, you end up with runaway deficits or extremely cruel rationing. I have critiques of the three biggest European countries – Germany, France and Britain. France is way too socialist. That doesn’t work. Germany is just insane. People have got caught up in crazed ideological fixations. There’s almost nothing like the Green party anywhere outside of Germany. Britain is neither too insane nor too socialist, but it’s extremely unpragmatic. It is extraordinary how lacking in common sense it is. The optimistic case for the UK is that there are extraordinary efficiencies one could wring out of the state. It has the greatest room for improvement of any European country. But why haven’t these things been done in the past 60 or 70 years?… Maybe the entire population is just too docile.\n\nLARA BROWN: You’ve talked before about Europe’s choice between ‘Greta on a bicycle’ environmentalism, Chinese surveillance and radical Islam. Would you say Europe has chosen one path?\n\nPT: The bad doors for Europe, the three doors of the future. For the future to have power as a cultural or political idea, you want it to be different. You can’t stay in this Groundhog Day, this Tory/Labour thing where we’re never doing anything new. The problem is the three actual pictures of the future. Behind door number one is Islamic sharia law. Behind door number two is the totalitarian CCP surveillance state, a hi-tech dystopia. Behind door number three is Greta with a bicycle, and then there’s no fourth door. This is why Greta’s been winning.\n\nJP: A lot of people on the American right talk incessantly about how terrible Britain and Europe are in general. But I think there’s selective blindness and chauvinism from some people on the American right about the condition of their own country. There is nowhere in Europe as bad as Skid Row in Los Angeles. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I would defend the Trump version of the Republican party vs the zombie Reagan-Bush era. I don’t think President Trump or J.D. Vance are absurdly optimistic or panglossian about things. Make America Great Again was the most pessimistic slogan any president had in a century, and certainly that any Republican president ever had. The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing, because the red pill is that America is no longer a great country. But you have to make sure it doesn’t become a gateway drug to a black pill, where you become nihilistic and give up and you’re destined to eat too many doughnuts in a trailer park. I don’t think that the right are overly optimistic in America. I don’t think there’s a problem where people describe things as even worse in other places. People in the US don’t pay attention to the world at all. We are a semi-autistic country. Maybe not quite as autistic as China, but we do not think about anything going on outside this country that much.\n\nLB: You mentioned the UK has undergone 70 years of stagnation. Many on the British right would agree, but may think that the period from 1979 to 1990 under Margaret Thatcher offered a respite from decline – she pursued unpopular but necessary policies such as anti-inflationary measures despite employment implications and her approach to the Unions. Would you question this narrative?\n\nPT: Reagan was very formative for me. I was in eighth grade in 1980 when Reagan got elected and felt at the time he was an incredibly great president and had solved all these problems once and for all. I think if I lived in the UK under Thatcher, I would have felt similarly. But they weren’t durable. We got Clinton and Blair after. The size of government didn’t shrink that much. The government sectors didn’t get weakened.\n\n‘Capitalism didn’t increase inequality but globalisation did’\n\nThere’s been a slowdown in tech since the 1970s. There was progress in the world of computers, internet, mobile, crypto, maybe now AI, but in a lot of other areas there was a much slower kind of progress. The question is, why did we not notice this faster? I think it’s because Reagan and Thatcher created a big lift. They made societies more capitalist by lowering marginal tax rates and deregulating. Lots of people got fired but the economy grew so most people ended up better off.\n\nReagan and Thatcher were exactly right for their time. But it wouldn’t work for all time. And to the extent that this distracts us from these science and technology questions, then it was somewhat problematic.\n\nThen there was the Clinton-Blair one-time fix, which was that you could somehow grow the economy and increase productivity through globalisation. That also probably gave you a big one-time lift. It came with very big long-term problems. It led to far more inequality. The Gini coefficient in the US went up more under Clinton than any other president post-1945. So capitalism did not increase inequality, but globalisation did.\n\nMy telling of the 50-year economic history is that we tried more capitalism with Reagan and Thatcher and it was the right thing to do. More globalism with Clinton and Blair was sort of the right thing to do, though it had more negative externalities that people were very dishonest about. We now need to do something very different.\n\nLB: Helen Andrews recently posited that feminism and gender-balance initiatives in the early Noughties led to a ‘Great Feminisation’. She claims this caused the prioritisation of safety over risk, a workplace culture dominated by consensus and appeals to emotion rather than logic in decision–making. How much do you buy into this as a theory of stagnation?\n\nPT: I think it’s very courageous of her to tackle something that is relatively taboo… Yes, I think there was a shift towards a risk-averse society. Feminisation was part of that. Things also went wrong with educational institutions or too much regulation. The deeper cause is that there was something dangerous and scary about where a lot of science and technology had gone.\n\nLB: Are you saying that diversity and inclusion efforts were an attempt to derail technological progress?\n\nPT: I think at some point people got very scared of where this stuff was going. Absolutely. It wasn’t just the nuclear thing. I would say that environmentalism as a movement was very focused on the dangers of limitless progress, even though in theory, you could have a lot of forms of environmentalism that would be pro-tech, right? If you’re concerned about climate change, we could build lots of new nuclear reactors that don’t emit carbon. But if we’re worried that nuclear reactors could be dual use and used to make nuclear weapons then you can’t do that. In some sense the energy shifted into this very anti-tech, anti-science direction for the past 50 years or so.\n\nLB: And you think DEI was a good way to achieve anti-tech goals?\n\n‘We’re going to end up with this really lame world where nothing happens but it’s maybe harder to blow up’\n\nPT: It’s always hard to know how intentional these things were. Diversity can function in an anti-tech way. If diversity really means homogenisation, let’s apply that to scientists. There’s no heterodoxy allowed, no heterodoxy on climate science, no heterodoxy on evolution, no heterodoxy on vaccines, on masks, on the origin of Covid. Everyone looks different but has to think alike. So diversity means conformity. And conformity is not compatible with science. And if diversity is a shibboleth, which I think is its important meaning, then we’re worshipping this god called diversity. It’s an unknown god. It’s a hypnotic magic trick that redirects our attention. And so we don’t care about science any more.\n\nJP: You seem to have a wider picture of American history, particularly in regard to wokeness. Many MAGA-adjacent people seem to think wokeness, or ‘cultural Marxism’, came from nowhere in the early 2010s, while you have identified before that it is a postwar phenomenon.\n\nPT: The culture wars are important. And there are ways in which there’s a side that’s right and there’s a side that’s wrong. But the big problem is that’s distracting us from things like housing or the economy generally, or science and tech or maybe even the CCP takeover of the world. This is where I push back against using the term ‘cultural Marxism’. I always think Marxism was at least about the economy. The focus on identity politics, multiculturalism, affirmative action, starts in the 1970s. That’s when inequality starts to go up. These things were at least correlated with us getting distracted from what I consider to be more important problems.\n\nJP: There are parts of the American right who now look at the changes of the 1960s, such the Civil Rights Act, and think it’s time to re-evaluate the postwar social consensus. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I don’t think you can ever strictly go back. There are three questions about the history going back to the Helen Andrews piece or my stagnation thesis. First, there’s a question of what happened. Second is a question of why it happened. Then there is a very different question of what should be done now. That’s in some ways very different from the first two. Even if we can agree there’s been stagnation, even if we say the society became too feminised or too risk-averse, we don’t want to just get blackpilled from that. And then the question is: where are the places that you have some agency to get out of this straitjacket?\n\nWA: Are you optimistic that that’s happening? And do you think you’ve contributed towards it?\n\nPT: Somewhat, and very much yes.\n\nLB: Earlier you alluded to three doors we can go through: radical environmentalism, sharia law, or Chinese-style authoritarianism. If none of us wants to go through them then what’s the way out?\n\nPT: It’s a challenge on a political level because when you’re trying to win elections it ends up being about broader narratives. For people in Silicon Valley, in a way it’s more local. You can build a company and solve particular problems in that context. Silicon Valley turned out to be a big place where there was a moderate amount of freedom of action in the past few decades, although it wasn’t a panacea. There’s a part of me that thinks that for some problems you have to go through politics. If we’re going to come up with new cures and new types of nuclear power you have to somewhat deregulate the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] and the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission]. Some of these things are entangled with politics. But a lot of progress has happened that is decoupled from politics. One of the things that’s still healthy about the United States, unlike Britain and France, is that the political capital, the financial capital, the technological capital are all in different places, so it is very decentred. There are places where these things overlap, but there’s some way where people are able to do things that are independent.\n\nJP: Is tech going to come to the rescue like the Eagles [in Lord of the Rings], deus ex machina, providing abundance that can kind of smooth over some of the economic challenges? And as a rejoinder to that, do you think the AI bubble is about to pop?\n\nPT: There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution. It seems to be very concentrated on bigger companies, so it’s possible a lot of the returns are captured by a few companies, possibly leading to very uneven growth. While it may be a complement to human labour, it is probably more of a substitute than a complement. It will have a zero sum feel to a lot of people. At the same time if there is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it. I don’t think it’s big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\n\n‘There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution’\n\nOn the question of whether or not it is a bubble, I get asked this a lot by Europeans and that is how you know that they’re not going to build a lot of AI in Europe. If it’s a bubble, then people are spending too much money on AI, and they’re building too many data centres and buying too many chips, and you’re eventually going to get seriously diminishing returns on that. During the 1990s bubble, it was mainly the telecom fibre-optic infrastructure stuff where people really spent way too much and that had to get dialled back. But maybe it’s the other way around where there are high returns to AI, enabling the automation of certain workflows and enhanced productivity.\n\nIf the AI bubble does not burst, it’s possible that it ends up being quite inflationary because you have to use more power for these data centres. The atoms part of our economy is regulated and it’s hard to ramp up the power. But if the returns on power going to AI chips are really high, it will absorb a lot of energy. Interest rates could be higher because there’s more demand for capital. My macroeconomic placeholder is that it’s going to keep going.\n\nI’ve been allergic to AI for a long time because it can be a horrible buzzword. There was a 2016 report during the Obama administration on AI by the National Science and Technology council. If you did a search and replace, and replaced every use of the word AI with computers, it would have read the same way.\n\nAI also meant all these really different things over time. In 2014, [Nick] Bostrom defined it as machines being way smarter than humans. Kai-fu Lee wrote the CCP counterpoint AI Superpowers in 2017, where he defined it as this sort of low-tech, big data machine learning. Then in 2022 it turns out the AI revolution is LLMs [large language models] which can pass the Turing test. People had thought this would be what AI was for 70 years. So in the decade before we were about to pass the Turing test we had forgotten about it.\n\nThe dynamic when one has to think through a lot \n\nIf you look at the ratio of how many businesses there are per 100,000 people: what part of the US has the lowest number of businesses? Silicon Valley. That’s because the costs of business are higher, so these subscale businesses that are too small to go anywhere are even harder to get started. In a third-world country where there are no good businesses and everyone is an umbrella salesman, they are very entrepreneurial, but not in a scalable way. So you need to differentiate entrepreneurship from scalable businesses.\n\n‘If you’re too focused on history, you don’t pay enough attention to the future’\n\nThere’s this economist called Thomas Gür who has researched the idea that immigrants are more entrepreneurial. While that is correct, you have to adjust for the quality of the businesses and the immigrants start businesses by starting a taco truck because there’s nothing else you can do. It’s better than going on welfare. But that’s what you do when you’re not really part of a society. It’s better than nothing, but what you really want to do is scale.\n\nJP: Is there a cutting-edge domain that you would focus your energies on?\n\nPT: One of the lines we had in Zero to One [Thiel’s 2014 book about startups co-written with Blake Masters] is from Anna Karenina. It’s the opening line: ‘Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’ The opposite is true of business. All failed businesses are more or less alike because they fail to escape from this problem of homogeneous competition. They didn’t do anything special. All successful businesses are special in their own way. That’s the closest I can give you to a formula and it’s incredibly hard to figure out what that is, or how to do it. I have some feel for it, I know it when I see it.\n\nTo wrap things up, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the past. That’s because it’s important. It’s how we got here. It’s what shaped a lot of these debates. At the same time, there’s also some limit to history. If you’re too focused on it, you don’t pay enough attention to the future. The point is not just to reflect on the past.\n\nThere was a medieval play on the Antichrist from 1160 or so, Ludus de Antichristo. It’s not a very good literary production, but there are these three kings, the Antichrist conquerors who focus on things like nationalism or their countries or their history. They lose because they’re too fixated on the past whilst the Antichrist is thinking about the future, and about what can be done. They don’t see Antichrist coming. So while it’s very important for those on the right to think about the past, to think about the history and what happened – they still should not lose sight of the future.",

    "title": "Researchers sound alarm on Chinese EV batteries after studying them in 'real-world practice': 'Extremely high failure rates'",
    "description": "\"They know exactly what they're ordering.\"",
    "fullText": "A European electric vehicle battery repair shop is warning that certain Chinese packs in popular Tesla models do not hold up to the rigors of use.\n\nEV Clinic reported that Model 3 and Y vehicles with LG NCM811 batteries from the LGES Nanjing factory \"show extremely high failure rates.\" It noted that while cells made in China are often touted as \"the best,\" this assertion \"has never been confirmed in real-world practice.\"\n\nIt compared the batteries to American Panasonic NCA packs, which last noticeably longer and even start their lifespans on a better footing. EV Clinic said that most of the LG models it tested had multiple cell failures that were not repairable. This happens at around 250,000 kilometers (155,343 miles) of use. The Panasonic models featured repairable single-cell failures after 400,000 km (248,548 mi).\n\n\"For reference, a healthy Panasonic cell typically shows ~10 megaohms, while a new LG Nanjing cell starts around 28 mΩ. A failing Panasonic cell reaches ~28 mΩ, which is what LG cells measure when brand new,\" EV Clinic stated.\n\nIn a conversation on the social platform X about the news, users wondered whether the \"bad\" batteries were in their EVs and how many makes and models were affected. The part number in question is 17000012-00-B.\n\nThe company added that it had tested more than 40 units across three shops and that because Tesla's first produced pack was such a \"disaster,\" the \"failure rate will be even more present\" over the next two years.\n\nThis is, of course, unwelcome information for people who have EVs with LG batteries. It may also give potential buyers pause, even though EVs save drivers money by eliminating the cost of gas and reducing maintenance requirements. While EVs feature battery warranties, no one wants to go through the hassle of replacing such an important component relatively soon after buying a vehicle.\n\nLG, which is based in South Korea, has a history of similar problems, too. In 2021, it had to pay General Motors $1.9 billion for defective batteries in the Chevrolet Bolt. This year, it recalled half a million stoves, also because of fire risk.\n\nIn its report, the Croatia-based EV Clinic said the best lithium-ion cells are made in the United States and Europe, naming Panasonic, LG Chem, and Samsung SDI. It noted that customers could get a repair check for 1,200 euros ($1,412), while a repair would cost 5,500 euros ($6,473). It recommended swapping in a used Panasonic battery as the optimal solution for a faulty pack, which costs 8,000 euros ($9,415).\n\nOn X, plenty of folks implored the institute for details, with one asking: \"How can you drop a bomb like this and don't explain with extreme precision which cars are concerned (model, version, year and factory)? Every 3/Y long range and perf owners are now worried and don't even know which battery pack they have. Please help us understand.\"\n\nDo you worry about the longevity of EV batteries?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSomeone else pointed out that Chinese batteries bring to mind domestic manufacturers such as CATL and BYD rather than LG. \"BYD Blade battery packs have shown to be superior in Giga Berlin-made Model Ys,\" they wrote.\n\nAnother X user wrote: \"People will blame LG when it's Tesla that deserves the hate. They know exactly what they're ordering. If Apple had failure rates or lower quality like this, they would cut it off nearly immediately.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Whether you’re surviving harsh environments, building sprawling systems, or just chilling and catching fish, the online co-op games on this list will keep you and all your friends hooked and coming back for more. If you're looking for a cozier setup, check out our best couch co-op games list.\n\nPlayed online with friends, Divinity: Original Sin 2 becomes less about obsessively optimizing builds and more about reacting together to a world that’s constantly responding to your choices. It sounds cheesy, but if you want a game where you can create actual shared stories and feel like your actions impact an entire world, get your mates downloading Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\nThe game’s strength lies in how much freedom it gives you all. Quests rarely have a single solution, and disagreements about what to do next are only a sign that you're properly invested. Whatever you do, the game adapts, and the group adapts with it. Combat is turn-based, which gives everyone time to think and discuss/argue over the best plan. Outside of combat, exploration also feels pretty communal if you lean into it, with players splitting up to investigate different areas and then regrouping with new ideas. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a long game, but one that rewards groups willing to commit to a shared adventure--one of you can even be the Game Master if you'd like. There's a new Divinity game coming out at some point, too, so keep your eyes peeled and dig deep into the lore so you don't get left behind.\n\nValheim is one of those games that is almost always better in co-op than played alone. Fans make a lot of noise about the deep exploration and survival mechanics (rightly so), but its base building is another example of where online co-op really shines. Building a settlement together turns the game into a long-term group project, where everyone contributes in their own way. Watching a base slowly grow from a rough shelter into a functioning village is deeply satisfying, and who doesn't want to build a massive Viking longhouse?\n\nThere’s also a comforting rhythm to games like Valheim. Log in, check what needs fixing, expand a wall, add a roof, and then head out together for the next goal. The game supports both focused teamwork and casual hanging out, making it ideal for groups that want something flexible but meaningful. Why not grab some Valheim mods while you're at it?\n\nPhasmophobia is half co-op, half creepy chaos, and by far one of the best horror games on Xbox. It’s a game where communication isn’t just helpful, it might just save your life. Playing with friends transforms what could be a terrifying solo experience into a tense but often hilarious group effort. Just seeing how your nearest and dearest react to jumpscares in real-time is always a treat.\n\nThe aim of the game is to investigate paranormal activity using a selection of tools and finding evidence. Each investigation in Phasmophobia becomes a shared puzzle between four minds, as you split tasks, compare evidence, and constantly relay information over voice chat. Successes and failures feel communal, and the stakes only get higher as the hauntings get more intense. On the up side, shared responsibility makes it easier to laugh about afterward, even if you were shrieking with very real fear in the moment.\n\nGreen Hell is the survival game you recommend to both your novice and veteran friends. Accessible and challenging all at once, the more support you have, the more manageable the challenges become. Green Hell's online co-op turns the jungle from an overwhelming threat into a shared challenge.\n\nSure, you can go out with weapons and stake a claim to the ground, focusing on combat and conquest, or you can raise animals in wooden holding pens, nurture crops, and build--dare we say, cozy--shelters for you and your comrades. Despite including a number of real-world survival techniques and some genuinely challenging hostile encounters, Green Hell isn't too punishing when you've got a group around you to scout, scavenge, defend, and farm your new home.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWebfishing is a little different than most games on this list, but a worthy addition nonetheless. It's a low-key, low-stakes, low-poly chill out zone, where you and your friends can customize animal avatars, go fishing, chat about life, and explore. It's a space for conversation and de-stressing, a great alternative to a group chat, especially if you don't mind periods of silence and relaxation.\n\nOver time you acquire better equipment, new threads, and the ability to catch better fish. Show off your catches, sell them, or merely explore. There are a few secrets hidden in the game that might cause a spark of excitement, but we'll not spoil too much here.\n\nDon’t Starve Together is the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, a game full of harsh wildernesses, strange creatures, and deep mysteries. The game’s uncompromising world is much easier to navigate when mistakes are made--and learned from--together, either with friends in a private server, or with strangers online.\n\nThis one should be an easy sell to friends who aren't sure about survival horror, as Don't Starve is also a game like Minecraft in that you can mine, craft, explore, and gather resources to make a communal base. Just don't mention what happens in the dark.\n\nFactorio is co-op at its most collaborative. It’s a game about building systems, and playing online turns those systems into group efforts that constantly evolve--it's like getting a job in a factory, except you don't get paid and it's actually fun.\n\nEach player can take ownership of part of the factory, but nothing exists in isolation. Changes ripple outward, encouraging constant communication and coordination. Planning becomes a shared activity, often involving diagrams, discussions, and occasional redesigns. Only enlist your smartest, most strategic friends.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic is a great gateway horror game for when you don't want something too scary, easing you and your friends into a slightly spooky experience that requires focus and commitment to survive. Missions are designed so that players naturally rely on each other’s strengths, making co-op feel purposeful and fun, despite the horrors that persist.\n\nEach class contributes something unique, encouraging loose communication without forcing strict coordination. Deep Rock Galactic strikes a balance between structure and flexibility, letting groups play casually or strategically, and employs its light-hearted tone to keep things flowing even when the going gets tough.\n\nTerraria in co-op feels like a shared sandbox adventure, a story only you and your friends could have written. Online play turns simple exploration and building into group projects that evolve organically, battles that require backup, and bases worthy of Terraria's most elaborate decor.\n\nYou'll naturally split tasks--some of you can explore, some can build, some can fight--and then regroup to share the spoils with everyone. The procedurally generated world feels more alive the more people live in it, reflecting the collective efforts of everyone involved and growing at a pace alongside you. Depending on your ability and playstyle, you can choose to go the offensive route, battling your way through the wilds, or become a homebody, creating a comforting environment for everyone to come back to once they're done fighting. There's a role for everyone. If you're needing some inspiration, check out our extensive Terraria guidesto get you started.\n\nAstroneer turns the realities of brutal and isolated space exploration into a cooperative, rewarding process, which is why it's one of the best survival games you can play online. Online co-op encourages players to plan, experiment, and adapt together as they reshape alien worlds and make it through another night. The tactile feel of the game's crafting system and potential for laid-back exploration and terraforming means you can (as long as you're willing to carry some of the survival responsibility) play it with just about anyone.\n\nWhen your oxygen level is on the line, tasks feel lighter when shared. It's not a punishing survival game, but it expects you to keep an eye on many moving parts at once for your colonization efforts to be effective. For creative groups who enjoy a bit of focus and tranquility, Astroneer might just hit the spot\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a light-hearted and silly online co-op game where every action requires coordination, and success depends on players communicating constantly, despite being in stitches.\n\nRunning a spaceship together (especially when you're just lil' guys) means juggling roles on the fly. Shields, weapons, navigation--it all requires cooperation, often under pressure and with heavy doses of chaos. It's an easy game to pick up and a fun party game for breaking the ice, we've even rated it one of the best couch co-op games to play together.",

    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

    "title": "Copper prices are soaring. Here's what that often signals for the economy.",
    "description": "Copper prices have rallied over 35% so far this year amid supply shortages, surging global demand, and tariff uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMetals have had a record year with recent surges in gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) prices, but there’s a third metal hitting its own record highs. Copper prices have rallied by more than 35% this year, poised for the biggest annual gain since 2009, driven higher by rising tech demand, supply constraints, and tariff uncertainty.\n\nGlobal copper (HG=F) prices officially surpassed $12,000 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday for the first time ever and continued to march higher on Wednesday.\n\nEach type of metal reacts slightly differently to economic conditions, and copper is no exception. However, unlike gold and silver, copper isn’t so directly influenced by investor sentiment or economic expectations. Its price movements can typically be attributed to physical growth and expansion.\n\nCopper is often viewed as a barometer for the economy. It plays a central role in power grids, construction, industrial machinery, and more. When there’s a demand for those types of goods or services, it’s typically a good sign that the economy has a clean bill of health — giving copper its nickname: Doctor Copper.\n\nRising copper prices often signal strong industrial demand and a rapidly growing economy, while falling prices may indicate an economic slowdown, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Copper is “a major beneficiary of investments in grid and power infrastructure globally, as AI and defence heighten the need for robust and secure energy networks,” wrote Goldman Sachs Research analyst Eoin Dinsmore in a note.\n\nGold is seen as more of a “safe-haven” asset and a hedge against inflation. Silver straddles the line between gold and copper and has both investment and industrial purposes. Copper, however, is predominantly industrial. It’s not typically purchased to be stored like gold or silver but meant to be used, which is why it’s usually the strongest indicator, of the three metals, that the economy is moving in the right direction.\n\nThere are a few key reasons that copper is experiencing a surge right now. Major copper-producing regions such as Chile and Indonesia have faced supply challenges and environmental disasters that have contributed to a global copper shortage and a tighter market.\n\n“After essentially flat mine supply growth expected this year, our 2026 mine supply growth estimates have fallen to only around +1.4%, or about 500 kmt lower than our estimates at the beginning of the year,” said Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, in a statement.\n\nA dip in supply isn’t the only factor that’s pushing prices higher. In July, the Trump administration issued tariffs on several categories of copper imports, putting additional pressure on the market. At the same time, heavy investment in the AI sector is significantly boosting demand because of its reliance on copper for data centers.\n\nOne source estimates that hyperscale AI data centers can use up to 50,000 tons of copper per facility.\n\nAs far as where prices are headed, JPMorgan Global Research expects copper prices to reach $12,500 a ton in the second quarter of 2026, ultimately averaging around $12,075 a ton for the full year.\n\nWhile researchers are optimistic that copper prices will continue on an upward trend, experts say the long-term implications of recent price surges remain uncertain.\n\n“The intersection of tariffs and copper prices in July 2025 highlights the complex dynamics of global trade and commodity markets,” said David Koch, CFP and director of portfolio management at Halbert Hargrove. “While the immediate effect has been a sharp rise in copper prices, the long-term consequences will depend on how markets, governments, and industries adapt to this new trade environment.”\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nGold and silver prices have been on a tear, with silver prices increasing by more than 100% year to date.

    "fullText": "On January 17, 1955, the USS Nautilus transmitted a historic message: \"Underway on nuclear power.\"\n\nAs the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, Nautilus could remain submerged for two weeks at a time and travel at speeds of over 20 knots, or about 23 miles per hour.\n\nPreviously, World War II submarines powered by diesel engines and electric batteries could stay underwater for just 12 to 48 hours at a time. Since their batteries only charged while surfaced, diesel-electric US Navy vessels like the USS Cobia had to move at around 2 or 3 miles per hour to conserve power and hit maximum speeds of 9 knots, or about 10 miles per hour.\n\nNautilus is now part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut. Visitors can walk through the historic nuclear submarine and see how its crew members lived and worked while submerged up to 700 feet below the surface.\n\nI visited the museum in March to tour Nautilus. Take a look inside.\n\nNautilus, which was commissioned in 1954, hosted the first-ever underwater legislative meeting when 13 members of Congress rode Nautilus in 1955.\n\nIts nuclear power allowed Nautilus to sail under the polar ice cap and become the first ship to traverse the North Pole in 1958 in an expedition known as Operation Sunshine.\n\nNautilus also participated in the naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\n\nAfter 26 years of service, Nautilus was decommissioned in 1980 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1982. It opened to the public as part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut, in 1986.\n\nIn 2021, Nautilus underwent $36 million of preservation work and reopened in 2022.\n\nThe Submarine Force Museum is open Wednesday through Monday and is free to visit.\n\nI was amazed by the size of the submarine. As I climbed aboard, the deck provided gorgeous views of the Thames River.\n\nHere, crew members loaded torpedoes for firing.\n\nAfter the torpedoes were loaded, the tubes were flooded with water. When the command to fire was issued, high-pressure air from the submarine's ejection pump then forced the water and the torpedoes out of the tubes.\n\nSigns on the sink and mirror indicated that they were part of the submarine's original equipment.\n\nNautilus had a crew of 11 officers and 105 enlisted service members.\n\nA panel of instruments along the wardroom's wall indicated Nautilus' depth and speed.\n\nOfficers ate the same meals as the rest of the crew members, but their food was brought up to the officers' pantry via a dumbwaiter to be reheated and served on Navy china.\n\nThe walls of the narrow hallway were covered in wood paneling.\n\nThe book was gifted to Nautilus' commanding officer, Commander William R. Anderson, in 1957 by the French Navy's chief of staff, Adm. Henri Nomy. The fictional submarine in the book is also named Nautilus.\n\nFewer beds in a room indicated a higher rank.\n\nThe executive officer, also known as the \"XO,\" was the ship's second-in-command.\n\nThe commanding officer used the stateroom as a workspace and living quarters.\n\nThe yeoman managed the ship's correspondence and personnel records.\n\nThe attack center contained periscopes to spot enemy ships and the controls to aim and fire torpedoes.\n\nOn the diagram, Nautilus is represented by the bottom ship, and the top ship represents the target.\n\nThe torpedo firing key, which was used to deploy the torpedoes, was indicated with a blue sign on the firing panel.\n\nThe guns were used for security while the submarine was in port.\n\nSonar stands for \"sound navigation and ranging.\" Active sonar emitted sound pulses to locate targets, while passive sonar listened for underwater activity.\n\nBefore that, ladders were used to climb from one level to another.\n\nCommands were issued in the control room by a crew member known as the diving officer of the watch, who received orders from the attack center.\n\nWhen the main ballast tanks filled with water, the submarine would submerge. When filled with air, the submarine would surface.\n\nThe ESM bay's instruments could detect other ships' radars.\n\nThe radio room was located just off the control room on the right.\n\nHere, crew members ate meals, worked, and spent their recreational time.\n\nDamage control personnel used OBAs if fires broke out on board while submerged. The hoses on the masks could be attached to the submarine's reserve air supply.\n\nSince there was no Navy chaplain on board the submarine, crew member volunteers conducted services for various faiths with items from the lay services box.\n\nNautilus was mainly powered by its nuclear reactor, but the battery served as an auxiliary source of power in case of an emergency.\n\nA window connected the galley to the scullery, where crew members washed dishes.\n\nNautilus had two crew quarters, one at the front of the submarine and one at the back.\n\nI swiveled the periscope until I could see my car sitting in the museum's parking lot, which was pretty cool.\n\nJust over 70 years after Nautilus was commissioned as the first nuclear-powered submarine in the world, all of the US Navy's submarines are now nuclear-powered, according to the Department of Defense.",

    "description": "Spanish women's soccer is at the top of the world, bearing the star of world champions. However, the ambition of this generation is insatiable, and its new leader is no stranger to the mix of success ...",
    "fullText": "Spanish women's soccer is at the top of the world, bearing the star of world champions. However, the ambition of this generation is insatiable, and its new leader is no stranger to the mix of success and frustration.\n\nSonia Bermúdez, a legend of Spanish soccer and newly appointed head coach in 2025, knows the weight of history and the bittersweet taste of defeat. Her appointment, following a brilliant stint in the lower categories of the RFEF, came right after the National Team fell short of European glory, losing in the final of the Women's EURO in the fateful penalty shootout.\n\nWith an eye on 2026, a crucial year to establish the project and qualify for the next World Cup, Bermúdez sets aside tactics and scouting reports to write a very special letter. From her coach's heart, this is her wish list for Santa Claus, filled with hope and with the sole aim of ensuring that Spanish dominance has no end.\n\nI know this wish list is not written by a child, but by a woman who, after more than two decades in soccer, has taken on the greatest challenge of her career: being the Head Coach of the Spanish Women's National Team.\n\nMy first months have been intense. We conquered the Nations League and felt the support of more than 55,000 voices at the Metropolitano, reaffirming our leadership. But we also suffered the setback of being just one step —one penalty— away from European glory.\n\nThat defeat in the Women's EURO Final hurt us, but it has injected us with a voracious hunger. Therefore, my wishes for 2026 are requests aimed at consolidating our hegemony and building an unbeatable future:\n\nMy first and most urgent wish is that 2026 be the year in which, without speculations or unnecessary anxieties, we secure direct qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe goal is clear: to arrive at the World Cup in full condition to defend our star and demonstrate that we are a power that not only wins but remains at the top. I ask that the team maintains ambition and that the pressure of being the current world champions propels us, rather than paralyzes us.\n\nSanta Claus, you well know that my heart is also in the grassroots, as I spent years watching these generations grow in the lower categories. Therefore, I wish that Spanish formative soccer continues to shine brightly on the international stage.\n\nWe cannot rest. I ask that investment continues in infrastructure, qualified personnel, and talent detection, so that the RFEF's player factory remains the most envied in the world. We need future \"golden generations\" to continue winning European and world titles in their categories, ensuring a quality succession that guarantees the National Team is always well-nourished.\n\nWe are world champions due to the strength of the collective, but that collective is full of talents that deserve the highest recognition. My last great wish is for Spanish players to once again be the undisputed protagonists in achieving individual titles like the Ballon d'Or and the The Best award.\n\nThis is more than a whim; it is the thermometer of the level of our league and the individual quality of our players. I ask that this recognition be the norm, not the exception, and that the mark of Spanish soccer is imprinted on all global awards.\n\nThe table is set, and the excitement is at its peak. We only need health, a bit of your magic for those moments of fortune, and the certainty that Spanish women's soccer will continue to grow without limits.\n\nWith gratitude and determination,\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Fighting Drought and Heat: The Science of Growing Climate-Resilient Christmas Trees\n\nAs Christmas trees face mounting challenges from climate change, researchers explore solutions to help ensure that a beloved holiday tradition endures in a warming world.\n\nKendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American’s Science Quickly, I’m Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.\n\nThe Christmas tree feels like a tradition from time immemorial—and in some ways it is. Historians trace the use of evergreens in winter festivals as far back as ancient Egypt and Rome. But the modern American custom has more recent roots: to the 1800s and German immigrants in Pennsylvania. These immigrants are believed to have brought the practice to their new home in the U.S.\n\nThe tree custom gained even more traction when it appeared in an adapted sketch of Queen Victoria and her German-born husband and their children that was published in a U.S. women’s magazine. Many credit it with kicking off a trend that has endured to today.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nAnd while a number of people in recent years have opted for lower-maintenance synthetic trees, many revelers still prefer the look and smell of real trees. But because of climate change natural Christmas trees and their fans are facing new threats.\n\nToday we talk to Priya Rajarapu, an assistant professor and Christmas tree extension specialist at Oregon State University, about the risks tree growers are weathering and what, if anything, can be done.\n\nSo, Priya, what exactly do you do?\n\nPriya Rajarapu: [The] most simplest way I could explain is: when you are sick you call a doctor, and when Christmas trees are sick growers usually reach out to me.\n\nPierre-Louis: What kinds of trees are Christmas trees, and how are they typically grown?\n\nRajarapu: So Christmas trees are all usually fir trees or evergreens, and there’s a history behind it. Evergreens tend to keep their needles throughout the season. So it’s a symbolism of hope, so Christmas is usually celebrated around that. It’s also looking forward to the spring and harvest season.\n\nAnd Christmas trees, although they are evergreens that you see mostly in forests, they are an important agricultural commodity in the U.S. We sell [roughly] 14 million Christmas trees, as of 2022 survey in the U.S. ...\n\nRajarapu: And the four major Christmas-tree-producing states include Oregon, North Carolina, Washington and Michigan.\n\nPierre-Louis: So we really are talking about a farmed product, and I don’t think most people typically picture Christmas trees the same way that we think of, say, corn or potatoes. What makes a farmed tree different from the trees that I see in the forest?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, I’m glad you mentioned the corn and potato analogy because that’s the best way to view Christmas trees, too, is that they are grown similar to corn and potatoes or any other vegetable crops. It’s just that it’s a specialty crop—it’s a tree, so it has a longer rotation. So corn, you can get a crop in an ear ...\n\nRajarapu: But Christmas tree, you’re harvesting the tree. Then you have to wait anywhere, depending on the species, from five to 10 years to harvest a tree.\n\nAnd the difference between the trees that are grown on farm and the trees that grow in the forest is that the trees that are grown [in] the farm are cultured ...\n\nRajarapu: Meaning they are pruned to give you that perfect Christmas tree shape, the typical triangle shape that you see. So growers invest a lot of time in culturing and pruning the trees so the trees can become bushier and fuller for people to hang more ornaments and not see the stem or branch.\n\nPierre-Louis: To kind of avoid the sad Charlie Brown Christmas tree.\n\nRajarapu: But there are—there is a customer base who still likes Charlie Brown Christmas trees, so there is a pretty decent-sized consumer base for natural trees or natural-looking trees.\n\nPierre-Louis: One of the parts of the work that you do is sort of looking at the pressures of climate change on tree production. And so what kinds of pressures are you seeing?\n\nRajarapu: So I would say the changing temperatures and lesser precipitation. So we are getting more and more days with less precipitation, so there are years where there is no precipitation for 100 days in Pacific Northwest, which does pose a lot of challenge for keeping trees healthy and also seedlings alive.\n\nSo for every Christmas tree that’s cut there is at least another two seedlings that are going back in the ground. So it, it’s a [roughly] 10-year rotation, so grower has to keep his crop going, so he or she plants trees every year in the ground, and that first year of growth or seedling establishment after transplanting them into the field or farm is very crucial. So when there is drought or when there is higher temperatures and lesser precipitation, it’s hard for that particular seedling to stay alive and establish itself. So that is one of the key challenges that growers are seeing with the changing weather patterns.\n\nAnd also, another change that I’ve noticed is [the] type of site that you choose for your species can also stress the trees and can attract insects such as bark beetles or twig weevils that were occasional pests—now their frequency is increasing.\n\nPierre-Louis: Because the climate is getting warmer?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, because of the warmer climate and also lesser precipitation or no precipitation in Pacific Northwest. I’ve been in North Carolina, and it rains a lot. There, flooding is an issue. But in Pacific Northwest in summer, it’s dry.\n\nPierre-Louis: And that’s not normal, right? Like, in the past you wouldn’t get 100 days without rain.\n\nRajarapu: Correct. What I hear from growers is that it would rain until July Fourth ...\n\nRajarapu: It would, like, constantly rain, without any break. So the only time that they go without any precipitation is August and September, and then October it starts raining again. So it’s just the two months, which, typically, soil would hold enough moisture during that time.\n\nPierre-Louis: But now it’s extended to, like, 100 days, and the soil just can’t hold moisture for that long.\n\nRajarapu: Exactly, that’s what we are seeing. And right now I have an experiment that’s going in the field where I am trying to monitor the moisture present in the soil throughout the growing season and try different mulch covering the seedling so that I could improve that moisture retention in the soil by mulching the seedling, protecting that moisture in the soil from evaporating.\n\nPierre-Louis: And I know it’s still early, but are you seeing any sort of promising results, any suggestions of things that might help reduce the impact of those pressures on the seedlings?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, sure, so the mulching practice or experiments to improve seedling survival; it’s not something new ...\n\nSo seedling survival—that first year of establishment is very crucial. It has just become so that, with the weather patterns, it has become more challenging. So some of the things that my predecessor and other professors at Michigan State University have tried is different root dips, so these are polymers, these are inert polymers that cover the root surface and are commercial products that are available and are claimed to hold moisture and also any nutrition.\n\nSo all these trials have been done in the past, and what came out or emerged as a hero or a savior is mulch. Just typical wood mulch would help seedlings survive and also significantly reduce the temperature—that is, soil temperature—under the mulch. But one of the concerns that growers have is that the wood mulch, depending on the source where they’re getting from, might carry some diseases that might infect their soil. But we don’t have any evidence, scientifically, for that. That’s one of the concerns they have.\n\nAnd it’s also the price. Like, if wood mulch is expensive, is there something that we are getting for free? For example, this year three or four different mulch covers that I’m trying is sawdust, compost, and I’ve tried hazelnut shells. Hazelnut is another big industry in Oregon, and all the hazelnut growers are wondering what to do with their shells after they harvest the nuts. So they are trying to find ways that they could reuse or repurpose these shells, so I’m testing that, also, as a mulch in this field trial.\n\nAnd right now my results show any kind of mulch would help the seedling survive better than having no mulch. But I’m studying more deeper into this, so I’m measuring needle chemistry to see if there is any difference in nutrition from these different mulch. That’s another concern for growers, too, that these raw, uncomposted mulch might steal nutrient from the soil and, also, a seedling might not be getting enough. So that’s another concern that I’m trying to address with this research.\n\nPierre-Louis: One of the ways tree farmers are coping with increasing pressures around climate change is by planting some different species of trees. I understand they’re maybe planting some trees that came originally came from Europe?\n\nRajarapu: Yep, so we, at OSU Extension, and also North Carolina State has a very strong Christmas-tree-genetics program. So back in 2010 researchers from Oregon State University and North Carolina State University and Washington State and Michigan State got together and went to Republic of Georgia and Turkey to find different species that can hold their needles well, can make other great Christmas trees ...\n\nRajarapu: And looked for these trees. So they collected seeds from trees that have great traits or that can make great Christmas trees. They brought in those seeds, and they grew all those seeds, two seedlings in the U.S. ...\n\nRajarapu: And planted in different regions within the U.S. So we have those trials, or test plots, in Washington, Oregon, North Carolina, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania. So all the same seedlings were planted in different regions to see if certain seedlings would emerge as perfect for that geographic condition.\n\nSo we found some that perform best in Oregon and Washington, and we have established seed orchards for the seedlings, or particular genetics, for Nordmann and Turkish fir. Those are the two firs that we identified or were brought into the U.S. as seeds, and we are growing them so that they can mature and produce seeds. And yes, these seem to do better than our natives, like noble fir, particularly, which is very sensitive to temperature changes and lesser precipitation, whereas these Nordmann and Turkish fir have been more resilient, and also, they do not attract a lot of pests that [are] typically [attracted to] the native trees. And also, they have high tolerance for different types of soil. So those traits are making them popular.\n\nPierre-Louis: So for the person who loves a live Christmas tree how concerned should they be that, at some point, it might not be accessible?\n\nRajarapu: So far growers are working really hard to keep the supply going. There is definitely a decrease in the number of acres in production of Christmas trees.\n\nWe are seeing that it might be price that might be driving some people to, like, change their mind. So artificial Christmas tree, it’s convenience and also the price. It’s, like, you’re paying $400 for 10 years. I think it all comes to that.\n\nWe are trying really hard to keep the number of trees, the live trees, accessible to all consumers. We usually have more trees than we have consumers, so I don’t think so ...\n\nRajarapu: Having a shortage would be a problem, as long as consumers are willing to buy the trees.\n\nPierre-Louis: That’s really cool. It’s been lovely learning so much about Christmas trees with you. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today.\n\nPierre-Louis: That’s all for today!

    "description": "Stories shape how your child thinks, feels, and understands the world.",
    "fullText": "Stories shape how your child thinks, feels, and understands the world. They connect language, emotion, memory, and meaning in a way few activities can. When storytelling becomes part of daily life, these connections strengthen and quietly influence learning, curiosity, and behavior.\n\nAt a cognitive level, stories train the brain to understand structure. A beginning leads to a middle. Actions lead to outcomes. This mirrors how children learn cause and effect. Research influenced by thinkers like Jean Piaget shows that children grasp ideas more deeply when they are embedded in meaningful narratives rather than abstract instruction.\n\nLanguage development accelerates inside stories. Words arrive with context, emotion, and repetition, which makes them easier to retain and reuse. When stories are read or heard regularly, children pick up sentence patterns, tone, and rhythm. Over time, this shows up as clearer expression and stronger listening skills.\n\nImagination plays a central role in emotional development. When your child steps into the world of a character, they practice seeing life from another point of view. This builds empathy and emotional awareness. Stories allow children to explore fear, joy, and frustration in a safe space, without real-world consequences.\n\nCreative storytelling also supports decision-making. Characters face problems, make choices, fail, and try again. Children absorb these patterns naturally. They learn that effort matters and that actions have outcomes. These lessons shape patience, self-control, and thoughtful behavior in everyday situations.\n\nStorytelling works best when it invites participation. Reading together or listening to a story and then talking about it turns passive consumption into active thinking. Simple moments help:\n\nDigital storytelling can support this process when it is designed with care. Calm visuals, clear language, and room for imagination matter more than constant interaction. This is where platforms like StoryBee fit naturally into a child’s routine.\n\nStoryBee allows parents and educators to create personalized stories based on a child’s age, interests, and learning needs. A story can be read, illustrated, or listened to as audio, which supports different learning styles. StoryBee focuses on creativity and imagination rather than overstimulation, helping children stay engaged without losing the reflective nature of storytelling.\n\nFor busy parents, StoryBee also lowers the barrier to consistency. Instead of searching for the right book every day, StoryBee helps generate fresh stories that still encourage thinking, curiosity, and conversation. The experience stays flexible and child-led.\n\nYou do not need long sessions to see impact. One short story a day, whether from a physical book or through StoryBee, is enough. What matters is presence and repetition. Stories are not about teaching facts. They shape how your child understands themselves and the world around them.\n\nYou do not need long sessions.\nConsistency matters more than duration.\n\nYou are not teaching content.\nYou are shaping how your child thinks.\n\nStories are quiet builders. When you choose thoughtful storytelling experiences and tools like StoryBee, you give your child skills that last well beyond childhood.",

    "fullText": "Gold is finishing 2025 at all-time highs, and the momentum is set to extend into 2026.\n\nThe spot gold price surged past $4,500 per troy ounce for the first time on Wednesday in Asia trading and is trading around $4,490 per ounce. The yellow metal is up more than 70% so far in its best year since 1979.\n\nGold could stay strong because the rally drivers are structural, not purely reactive, according to analysts.\n\n\"Gold doesn't need a crisis to rise in 2026. It simply needs the world to behave the way it has been: elevated debt, policy uncertainty, fragile alliances, and a dollar that no longer dominates as it once did,\" wrote Farah Mourad, a market analyst at IG, a trading platform.\n\n\"In that environment, gold doesn't chase fear — it absorbs it,\" Mourad added.\n\nIG did not provide a price forecast but noted that major banks expect gold to trade in the $4,500 to $4,700 per ounce range next year, with potential upside toward $5,000 if macro conditions persist.\n\nMonetary policy could provide additional support. With inflation proving sticky and growth uneven, markets increasingly expect interest rates to drift lower over time.\n\nThat matters for gold, which tends to perform best when real yields fall, and the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets declines.\n\nThere are, of course, risks. A stronger-than-expected rebound in the US dollar or a sustained shift back toward risk-on sentiment could slow gold's advance.\n\nBut investor positioning in gold remains relatively balanced compared with previous peaks, suggesting the trade is not yet overcrowded, Mourad wrote.\n\nThat perspective aligns with forecasts from major banks.\n\n\"We see gold prices hitting more record highs in 2026,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, earlier this month.\n\nFactors that could extend gold's bull run include President Donald Trump's likely choice of a next Fed chair inclined to push for lower interest rates, she wrote.\n\nShe added that gold is likely to find support on pullbacks.\n\n\"We expect the downside to be limited as any weakness will likely attract renewed interest from both retail and institutional buyers,\" Manthey added.\n\nWall Street giant Goldman Sachs predicts that gold prices will climb to $4,900 per ounce by December 2026.\n\nGold's surge this year has contributed to gains in other precious metals as well.\n\nSpot silver prices have also hit record highs this year and are trading about 147% higher year-to-date at around $72 per ounce.\n\nMeanwhile, spot platinum has also hit an all-time high and is up about 159% this year, trading around $2,342 per ounce.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Global investors are increasing their wagers on Chinese artificial intelligence companies, betting on the next DeepSeek and seeking to diversify, with concerns growing about a speculative bubble in the sector on Wall Street.\n\nDemand for China's AI companies is also being stimulated by ​Beijing's push for tech independence. China has fast-tracked blockbuster listings of chipmakers, notably Moore Threads (688795.SS), dubbed \"China's Nvidia\", and MetaX (688802.SS), which both debuted this month.\n\nForeigners see China closing ‌the tech gap with the U.S. as Beijing steps up support for AI chipmakers, spurring bets on Chinese companies just as worries grow over lofty valuations on U.S.-listed AI stocks.\n\nU.K.-based asset manager Ruffer, for example, said it has \"deliberately limited ‌exposure\" to the Magnificent Seven - the U.S. tech giants - and is looking to add positions in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) for a bigger exposure to China's AI theme.\n\n\"While the U.S. remains the leader in frontier AI, China is rapidly narrowing the gap,\" said Gemma Cairns-Smith, Investment Specialist at Ruffer. \"The moat may not be as wide, or as deep, as many think ... The competitive landscape is shifting.\"\n\nRuffer is gaining exposure to the AI theme through Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, which operates an AI chip unit, owns large language model Qwen, and is ploughing money into cloud infrastructure.\n\nGlobal asset managers are increasingly eyeing Chinese AI firms ⁠as a wave of startups lists on the mainland and in ‌Hong Kong, seeking to tap into surging investor appetite following the meteoric rise of DeepSeek, China’s answer to ChatGPT.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management in a report this month rated China tech as \"most attractive\", citing investors' search for geographical diversification and China's \"strong policy backing, technological self-reliance, and rapid ‍AI monetization\".\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) currently trades at 31 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 24 for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech (HSTECH.HK), which enables AI bets via stocks including Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK), Baidu (BIDU, 9888.HK), Tencent (0700.HK, TCEHY) and chip foundry SMIC (0981.HK).\n\nRiding the momentum, U.S. investment adviser Rayliant helped launch a Nasdaq-listed fund in September that gives investors access to \"China's versions of stocks like Google, Meta, Tesla, Apple, and OpenAI\".\n\nKraneShares Chief Investment Officer Brendan Ahern said the ​rapid ascent of Chinese AI chipmakers such as Cambricon speaks to the scale and speed of innovation across China's AI and semiconductor industries.",

    "fullText": "Speaking after Everton’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, Toffees boss David Moyes told the media he believed his team were up against the best midfielder in the world on the night in Declan Rice.\n\n“[Tim Iroegbunam] was up against probably the best midfield player in the world in some ways,” Moyes said. “Declan developed himself, it’s not down to me, Declan was always going to be a great player. Mikel’s made him into a real top player.\n\n“He’s a great boy, more than anything, he’s a terrific boy, and because of that it’ll give him a great chance. [But he’s] a great player as well. Lots of top attributes.”\n\nMoyes and Rice obviously worked together during their respective spells with West Ham United, and the now-Everton boss has never denied how highly he rates the England international.\n\nEven before Saturday’s game, Moyes reiterated that he thinks Rice was worth much more than the £100m plus £5m bonuses that Arsenal paid.\n\n“I genuinely meant it at the time, I thought Declan was £150m,” Moyes said. “I thought we didn’t get enough at West Ham. We had offered Declan huge contracts but we couldn’t get him to stay. So the club had to do what they had to do.\n\n“I’m still in touch with him. I am going to abuse him today maybe!”\n\nRice certainly put in a good performance against Everton, with Alan Shearer even selecting him for his Premier League Team of the Week.\n\nThe midfielder completed 90% of his passes in Arsenal’s 1-0 win, creating two chances including one big chance and making 10 defensive contributions. The midfielder also won seven of his nine individual duels.\n\nAs frustrating as it must have been to come up against his old player on Saturday, Moyes must privately feel proud of his part in Rice’s rise.",
