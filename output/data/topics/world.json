    "fullText": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — What’s the secret to winning a seven-a-side tournament when $2 million dollars is on the line?\n\n“Be brave,” San Diego Wave midfielder Gia Corley said after her club won the second World Sevens Football competition on Sunday evening, beating Tigres 3-0 to cap off an impressive campaign. The Wave went undefeated in their ascent to the podium, scoring a total of 14 goals and conceding three. Corley was awarded Breakout Player of the tournament.\n\nHer advice was as simple as the Wave were flamboyant in the latest iteration of the three-day, seven-vs-seven tournament.\n\nFollowing the inaugural event in Portugal this May that featured all European teams, this World Sevens was an exaltation of its greatest strength: the communion of cultures not only across countries but continents, with an invitation to bring their own style of play into close quarters. The Wave play in the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) in the U.S., but their World Sevens roster featured players who also represent Germany, Sweden, Brazil, France, Canada, Colombia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n“If I wanted to play in the Champions League, I’d have to play for a European team. You’re never going to see a U.S. team or South American team play in that format,” said former England Lioness and WSL player Anita Asante, who serves on the World Sevens advisory board, before the start of the tournament.\n\n“Whereas so many more teams can participate and bring their own cultural elements to this experience as well and open up a whole new fanbase and fun experience because now everyone gets to see what it’s like.”\n\n“From South American teams and their style — and the evolution of the playing styles and trends as well that we don’t always get to see because we sometimes get really centered in one sort of format or one place in the world that we’re experiencing the game from,” she continued. “So just opening up that whole lens as well has been really powerful for the players and us.”\n\nSince its inception last year, when Gotham FC minority owner Jennifer Mackesy and her husband, Scott, made a personal commitment to sourcing $100million over five years, World Sevens has been marketed as a service for the social-media-obsessed. Soccer’s typical 90-minute matches have been chopped down to half an hour, the fields are split in two (the World Sevens pitch is roughly half the size of a traditional, FIFA-regulated field ), and there are rolling substitutions and no offside rule.\n\nThere’s an irony to this approach: the tighter parameters result in an abundance of flashy, shareable clips on TikTok and Instagram, but witnessing the tournament in person turns mindless scrolling into a liability. In fact, try to avoid blinking at all during World Sevens altogether — you could miss what makes it special.\n\nTake, for instance, the game-winning goal that Brazilian club Flamengo scored against the NWSL shield-winning Kansas City Current in the tournament’s opening match. Cristiane, a 40-year-old Brazilian forward with two decades of global success, received a ball off a throw-in with her hip and flicked it with her heel to assist Glaucia, who twerked to celebrate the goal.\n\n“It’s a fast-paced game, but it’s my style of game,” Glaucia told The Athletic after that match. “Using my talents of ball control and getting into the game, playing as a team, and just enjoying ourselves.”\n\nFlamengo’s flair wasn’t only in their attack. They were the only team in the competition to occasionally employ an outfield player as their ’keeper when they were hunting for a goal.\n\nWhen they were down 2-1 against AFC Toronto of the newly formed Northern Super League (NSL) with 45 seconds to go on Saturday, defender Monalisa Belem, playing as ’keeper for Vivi Holzel, dribbled the ball into their attacking half and shot a low, driven ball on frame. Toronto were unable to clear it and conceded an equalizer.\n\n“We did what we could,” Holzel said of Monalisa’s keeper swap, a knowing smile spread across her face. “In Brazil, we train a lot in futsal, so they are used to (it).”\n\nFlamengo won that game on penalties, which are played sudden-death style at World Sevens (as opposed to a best-of-five format). After the final whistle, the Brazilian side celebrated as if the $2 million had already hit their bank accounts, spraying their water bottles and dancing with supporters on the sidelines.\n\n“Today we won. We don’t know the next game, so we are enjoying every step to make this happen because the competition is like that,” Holzel said. “We have to enjoy.”\n\nStaying present and loose appears to be another ingredient to the secret sauce of World Sevens.\n\nThe players with standout performances were those for whom World Sevens looked like a return to simpler times, when mistakes were welcomed as opportunities to discover something new, improvisation was rewarded, and personality on the pitch was seen as an enhancement rather than a hindrance.\n\nFew embodied that more than Tigres winger Maria Sanchez, who won the Golden Boot and Golden Ball award with six goals and two assists.\n\n“I grew up playing with boys playing small-sided (games) for hours, so I think a tournament like this suits me very well and it takes me back to my childhood days,” Sanchez said Saturday.\n\nFor others, the fast pace and fluidity required more adjustment, and the film from the first World Sevens and its all-European lineup could only help so much.\n\n“We used a lot of the video for the structure and a little bit of the tactics, but I think we knew this was gonna be a different style of play,” San Diego Wave assistant coach Becki Tweed said of the team’s preparation. “When you see the South American teams play, they’re really smart in how they use their body, they have really good knowledge of space, and I think those are the things that vary a little bit from the European game.”\n\nThe requirements of the small-sided tournament also enlightened the coaching staff to their own roster. “Which is fun, because you think you know them until you put them in a new challenge,” Tweed added.\n\nThe format also exposed some teams that struggled to loosen up on the pitch. The Current, despite their superlative season in the NWSL, failed to advance from the group stage against Flamengo, Toronto, and Tigres. Star players like league MVP Temwa Chawinga, Michelle Cooper, and Claire Hutton were absent either due to injury or the need for rest, and were replaced by academy players.\n\nThe World Sevens organizers built off the success of their first event earlier this year, but they also had to account for key differences.\n\nIn May, the competition took place in Estoril, Portugal, in the days leading up to the Champions League final just 30 minutes away in Lisbon. Fans needed only to extend their trip by a few days to enjoy both. This time around, not only was World Sevens without the proximity of a major competition to drum up support and publicity, but it wound up competing with Art Basel in Miami and Inter Miami’s MLS Cup final (which they hosted) for attention that weekend. Attendance on Friday was scant but peaked on Saturday when each team played twice.\n\nIn the first edition, the fan zone and field were in two different places, preventing an easy flow of traffic between matches. That issue was resolved at Beyond Bancard Stadium, but the foosball tables, sign-making stations, and World Sevens-branded claw machines were lonely throughout the weekend as many of the kids in attendance were competing in the Rising Sevens youth tournament behind the stadium.\n\nBut for whatever World Sevens Football lost in the marketing department, it recovered in the passion that emanated across Beyond Bancard stadium in Fort Lauderdale from those who did show up. Deportivo Cali supporters saved the weekend. Dozens traveled from across Florida, the U.S., and even Colombia just to support their team. Clad in green and white, they flooded the stadium and filled it with percussion, chants, and songs, often drowning out the music coming out of the speakers from the DJ booth.\n\n“We’re going to make them feel like home, like this is home,” said Jose Luis, 40, who traveled to Fort Lauderdale from Cali, Colombia. “That’s why you see us shouting. I have no voice anymore. That’s our purpose. It’s 35 minutes.”\n\nCali narrowly missed a place in the knockout stage with a 1-0 loss to Club America, but midfielder Kelly Ibarguen told The Athletic on Saturday following their victory over Uruguayan side Nacional that they felt the energy of their supporters on the pitch.\n\n“We always approach things with great joy and happiness, and having the fans behind us is truly a source of pride for us. They’ve supported us in Argentina in every tournament we’ve played in,” she said.\n\nThe prize money sweetened the experience, and this time all teams brought something home.\n\nThe Wave claimed $2 million, Tigres earned $1 as finalists, and Club America were awarded $700,000 as the third place team. Flamengo, who came in fourth, got $500,000, and the remaining four teams were given $200,000 each.\n\nMoney is always nice, and earning large sums for two or three days of work is a rare opportunity in the women’s game. But U.S. women’s national team legend and player advisory board member Tobin Heath is looking even further at what World Sevens is building.\n\n“Life is about mirroring,” Heath said. “That, to me, is how women’s football has been developed. It’s been developed around every single men’s competition, then the women’s competition follows. And what has happened because of that is our culture, women’s football culture, has been completely eliminated when it comes to actually showcasing our uniqueness in the market of sports. Because we just act like the version of football that we’re playing in, this is the first time that there’s nothing for us to mirror against.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nKansas City Current, San Diego Wave, NWSL, Women's Soccer\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Accounts held by users under 16 must be removed on apps that include TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and Threads under ban\n\nHow is Australia’s social media ban affecting you and your family?\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nAustralia has enacted a world-first ban on social media for users aged under 16, causing millions of children and teenagers to lose access to their accounts.\n\nFacebook, Instagram, Threads, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and TikTok are expected to have taken steps from Wednesday to remove accounts held by users under 16 years of age in Australia, and prevent those teens from registering new accounts.\n\nPlatforms that do not comply risk fines of up to $49.5m.\n\nThere have been some teething problems with the ban’s implementation. Guardian Australia has received several reports of those under 16 passing the facial age assurance tests, but the government has flagged it is not expecting the ban will be perfect from day one.\n\nAll listed platforms apart from X had confirmed by Tuesday they would comply with the ban. The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said it had recently had a conversation with X about how it would comply, but the company had not communicated its policy to users.\n\nBluesky, an X alternative, announced on Tuesday it would also ban under-16s, despite eSafety assessing the platform as “low risk” due to its small user base of 50,000 in Australia.\n\nChildren had spent the past few weeks undertaking age assurance checks, swapping phone numbers and preparing for their accounts to be deactivated.\n\nThe Australian chief executive and co-founder of the age assurance service k-ID, Kieran Donovan, said his service had conducted hundreds of thousands of age checks in the past few weeks. The k-ID service was being used by Snapchat among others.\n\nParents of children affected by the ban shared a spectrum of views on the policy. One parent told the Guardian their 15-year-old daughter was “very distressed” because “all her 14 to 15-year-old friends have been age verified as 18 by Snapchat”. Since she had been identified as under 16, they feared “her friends will keep using Snapchat to talk and organise social events and she will be left out”.\n\nAnother parent said the ban had forced him to teach his child how to break the law. “I’ve shown her how VPNs work and other methods on bypassing age restrictions,” he said. “I’ve had to set her up with her own adult YouTube account and have assisted her in bypassing TikTok’s age-estimation and will keep doing so each time it asks.”\n\nOthers said the ban “can’t come quickly enough”. One parent said their daughter was “completely addicted” to social media and the ban “provides us with a support framework to keep her off these platforms”.\n\nThe Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in an opinion piece on Sunday: “From the beginning, we’ve acknowledged this process won’t be 100% perfect. But the message this law sends will be 100% clear … Australia sets the legal drinking age at 18 because our society recognises the ­benefits to the individual and the community of such an ­approach.\n\n“The fact that teenagers occasionally find a way to have a drink doesn’t diminish the value of having a clear, ­national standard.”\n\nPolling has consistently shown that two-thirds of voters support raising the minimum age for social media to 16. The opposition, including leader Sussan Ley, have recently voiced alarm about the ban, despite waving the legislation through parliament and the former Liberal leader Peter Dutton championing it.\n\nThe ban has garnered worldwide attention, with several nations indicating they will adopt a ban of their own, including Malaysia, Denmark and Norway. The European Union passed a resolution to adopt similar restrictions, while a spokesperson for the British government told Reuters it was “closely monitoring Australia’s approach to age restrictions”.\n\nInman Grant told the Guardian that from Thursday, she would be sending notices to the platforms covered by the ban to find out how the implementation was progressing.\n\nQuestions included “how many accounts [they’ve] deactivated or removed, what challenges they’re finding, how they’re preventing recidivism and preventing circumvention, whether or not their abuse or reporting abuse and the appeals processes are working as planned”, she said.\n\nAlbanese said the information gathered in this process would be made public.\n\nThe regulator would need to assess whether platforms were taking reasonable steps. If they were not, it could take that platform to court to seek fines.\n\nThere would be an independent evaluation of the ban conducted by an academic advisory group examining the short-term, medium-term and longer-term impacts of the ban.\n\n“It will look at the benefits over time, but also the unintended consequences,” Inman Grant said.\n\n“Everything from are sleeping? Are they interacting or are they actually getting out on the sports fields? Are they reading books? Are they taking less medication like antidepressants? Are their Naplan scores improving over time?” Inman Grant said.\n\nPotential unintended consequences to be investigated included whether children were moving on to “darker areas of the internet”, learning how to bypass the bans through VPNs, or moving on to other platforms, she said.\n\nTeens on Snapchat affected by the ban had been publicly sharing their mobile numbers in their profiles ahead of their accounts being shut down.\n\nA spokesperson for Snapchat said the platform understood under-16s were disappointed by the ban but “would strongly encourage any teens using Snapchat not to publicly share their personal contact information”.\n\nInman Grant said she had sent notices to 15 companies not initially included in the ban, asking them to self-assess whether they should be.\n\nYope and Lemon8, which shot up the app store rankings as teens looked for alternatives, were among those contacted.",

    "description": "The firm has been a longtime backer of big-name private companies such as OpenAI and TikTok parent ByteDance.",
    "fullText": "Tiger Global's latest private investment fund will raise substantially less money than its predecessors from 2021 and 2022, but the $50 billion asset manager isn't worried.\n\nThe firm is expected to raise close to $2 billion for PIP 17, a person familiar with the manager told Business Insider.\n\nThat's a fraction of what PIP 14 and PIP 15 raised and aligns more closely to PIP 16, which closed in early 2024 with $2.2 billion in assets after aiming initially for $6 billion.\n\nWhile smaller fundraises typically coincide with a decline in investor interest, Tiger Global is confident that the size of the new fund will be a benefit for those who do decide to invest.\n\n\"Over our history, we have also found that smaller, more concentrated funds have been correlated with our strongest returns,\" the firm wrote in a letter to prospective investors that was seen by Business Insider.\n\nTiger Global declined to comment.\n\nThe first 10 private funds, the letter states, all raised less than $3 billion each, made fewer than 50 investments on average, and \"generated a 34% gross IRR and a 23% net IRR and made distributions exceeding investor commitments.\n\n\"We believe funds in this size range afford us significant benefits, particularly with respect to the impact midsize investments can make,\" the letter reads.\n\nIn other words, Tiger Global's aggressive venture style from 2020 through 2022, when the firm led fundraising rounds seemingly every week and raised increasingly larger funds, has been replaced with one that is closer to what the firm built its business on. The manager previously wrote to investors earlier this year about how it reworked its risk systems following a 56% loss in its public-equity flagship hedge fund and compared the firm's bounce-back from that loss to golfer Rory McIlroy's Masters win.\n\nThe most recent private fund, PIP 16, has already reaped some of the benefits of the style focused on \"high-conviction\" bets. The fund has invested 70% of its assets across 25 companies, the letter states, with the 10 largest investments accounting for three-quarters of that total.\n\nAmong those big bets are some of the world's prominent artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI and Waymo.\n\n\"We have remained incredibly disciplined and selective\" when investing PIP 16, the firm wrote, and plan to continue that with PIP 17, which will hold its first close on March 18 next year. The new fund is the latest example of Tiger Global and its peers' renewed interest in private markets.\n\n\"This approach is opportunistic, guided by bottom-up, company-level underwriting, and informed by our deep research and cumulative insights,\" the letter states.\n\n\"To accomplish this, PIP 17 may have a pace of deployment spanning several years. With time on our side and an accelerated pace of innovation, we intend to remain patient — waiting for attractive opportunities to make high-conviction investments.\"",

And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,\" Jena said.\n\nAt the same time, children watching adult content online \"has a very bad effect\".\n\nAt a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia's move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have \"great benefits\" in India too.\n\nIn the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.\n\n\"Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,\" she said of the ban.\n\nAnother teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: \"I'm 15 so for me the ban would definitely come into effect. I can't really imagine giving it up completely.\n\n\"A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.\"\n\nAn AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.\n\nRazak is not in favour of a ban. \"It's really stupid, honestly,\" although \"there's not really much we can do as 16-year-olds\" if governments decide to act, she said.\n\nThe families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so \"it's going to be so much harder to talk to them\".\n\nAlso in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia's were \"a bit harsh\" and hard to enforce.\n\n\"We can use VPN.

In the classroom -- where phones are banned -- students in uniform sit at separate desks.\n\n\"I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,\" Okinedo said.\n\nEven so, \"we were born with it\", the 15-year-old added. \"And I don't think it's something I want to stop.\"\n\nHer mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents \"don't have time to monitor their children all day\".\n\n- Mexico City: 'Express yourself' -\n\nYoung Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.\n\nWithout it, \"I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn't really have a good way to spend my time,\" she said.\n\nSantiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.\n\n\"Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,\" said Rojas.\n\nBut \"there are many kidnappings that begin online\" and \"younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable\".\n\n- Sydney: 'Not going to have any impact' -\n\nIn Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go.\n\n\"I don't think the government really knows what they're doing and I don't think it's going to have any impact on children of Australia,\" said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.\n\nBut his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children \"have better, more authentic relationships\".\n\n\"They'll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,\" she said.",

He was also named as the PFA men's player of the year for a record third time and collected a third Football Writers' footballer of the year award.\n\nThe 33-year-old became the highest-scoring overseas player in Premier League history, overtaking Sergio Aguero's mark of 184.\n\nSalah has scored five goals in 18 appearances for Liverpool so far this season, and on Saturday said he felt like he had been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club and that his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down.\n\n'The hunger makes me want more' - Salah wins third PFA award",

    "fullText": "BENGALURU, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Amnesty International has said India's review of a telecom industry proposal to mandate always-on satellite ​location tracking on phones for better lawful surveillance was \"deeply concerning\" and puts data ‌of human rights defenders at risk.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long pushed telecoms companies to give ‌more precise locations of individuals under investigation.\n\nThe telecoms operators say the best way to achieve this would be for the government to order smartphone manufacturers to permanently enable location tracking on phones. Reuters reported on Friday that the government is reviewing that proposal.\n\nThe discussions are ⁠being privately opposed by big ‌smartphone firms Apple, Google and Samsung, due to privacy and security concerns.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Amnesty International said location data can ‍be \"incredibly revealing\" and can expose personal and professional connections, such as the confidential sources who meet journalists or human rights groups.\n\n\"This is deeply concerning. At a time where surveillance scandals are a ​mushrooming global threat, states should be working on improving their practices and safeguards, not ‌forcing people to reveal yet more sensitive data,\" Amnesty said.\n\nIndia's IT and home ministries, which are reviewing the plan, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday about the backlash.\n\nAmnesty has in the past denounced India's surveillance practices including alleged use of Pegasus spyware to target journalists and activists -- allegations Modi's government has repeatedly denied.\n\nA fierce ⁠privacy debate erupted in India last week after ​Reuters first reported another confidential directive from the ​government to preload a state-run cyber safety app on all smartphones. India was forced to revoke the order following outcry from activists and politicians ‍over fears of snooping.\n\n\"Why ⁠are we out to convert India into a 'Surveillance State'?\" Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said on X, criticising the proposal to track phone locations.\n\nA large ⁠number of Indian users on X joined Surjewala and other privacy activists to condemn the plan, with ‌one user framing it as turning phones into \"digital ankle monitors\".",

Symptoms typically appear three to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, and most people recover within a week.\n\nCdc Reports 19Th Cruise Ship Norovirus Outbreak This Year, Affecting Passengers And Crew\n\nIn severe cases, some may experience severe joint pain lasting months or even years while others \"may require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage and death,\" according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAccording to an Oct. 3 notice from WHO, there have been 445,000 suspected and confirmed cases of chikungunya and 155 deaths worldwide between January and September 2025.\n\nIn Bangladesh, WHO reported 700 suspected chikungunya cases in the capital, Dhaka, between January and September 2025, citing the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research.\n\nCdc Warns Of 'Enhanced' Virus Risk For Travelers Amid Outbreak Spread By Mosquitoes\n\nAs of late September, a total of 16,000 locally transmitted chikungunya cases have been confirmed in Guangdong Province, China, marking the largest documented outbreak of the disease in the country to date.\n\nBetween January and late September, 34 confirmed cases of chikungunya were reported in Cuba, and public health interventions have been implemented to contain the outbreak.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, a total of 150 confirmed chikungunya cases were reported between Jan. 1 and the second week of March 2025, WHO said, adding that cases reportedly peaked in June.\n\nThe CDC warned that Americans traveling to Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand may also face an increased risk of chikungunya infection, even if no outbreak is currently reported.\n\nThe U.S. has not seen any locally acquired chikungunya cases in its states or territories since 2019.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "A hot mic before Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s Monday press conference picked up an unexpectedly candid glimpse into how some TSA agents actually feel about their jobs.\n\nThe audio captured one of the agents complaining about being “scared” of his superior before the event at Tampa International Airport in Florida, where Noem presented over a dozen TSA agents with $10,000 bonus checks for working without pay during the government shutdown.\n\n“I used to be terrified of [her] when I started in HR, I was so scared of her,” a TSA agent could be heard saying in a video shared by reporter Alexander Willis to X. “She was just really busy; she did, like, discipline stuff in HR, so being an officer, she didn’t trust me to be around any of it because she didn’t know if I had a big mouth or not.”\n\nThe agent does not reveal the colleague’s identity.\n\nThat agent, along with another, also complained about how busy their work schedules were.\n\n“Now you can no longer go to the store,” they could be heard saying. “I wish I had Sunday-Monday or Friday-Saturday [off], because having both weekend days off is great, but it’s frustrating sometimes.”\n\nThe TSA, which falls under Noem’s DHS, was hit hard by October’s government shutdown—the longest in American history—which resulted from Democrats’ refusal to sign a spending bill that didn’t guarantee an extension to Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n\nAfter receiving only a partial paycheck at the beginning of October, TSA agents—who are classified as essential employees—worked for weeks without pay until the shutdown ended on November 12, after six Democrats broke party lines to pass a temporary spending bill.\n\nLike an earlier event in November at the Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, the “bonus checks” Noem presented to TSA employees onstage at Tampa International were not actual checks and were not given to all employees.\n\nNoem clarified that the envelopes given to the agents contained a piece of paper stating that the money would be added to their next paycheck via direct deposit. Only employees nominated by their superiors for “exemplary service” were awarded the $10,000 bonus.\n\nThe TSA employs over 50,000 transportation security officers out of its approximate 65,000 total employees.\n\nThe DHS did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "description": "Luke Combs' My Kind of Saturday Night world tour kicks off next March in Las Vegas. Ticket prices start at $71.",
    "fullText": "Following several days of teasing on social media, Luke Combs officially announced his 2026 concert series, titled the \"My Kinda Saturday Night\" world tour. With the announcement first being sent to his “Bootleggers” fan club members and then to the general public, fans are eagerly anticipating the chance to see Combs live. With all venues in stadiums and a long roster of opening acts scheduled to join the star, it’s no wonder tickets are already in high demand.\n\nLuke Combs has been praised for his dedication to his fans, and releasing the tour announcement and presale first to his Bootleggers fans has been specifically applauded. The “Fast Car” singer has been quoted as saying he is happy for the chance to promote country music in places where it is not typically found, and his 10 international stops can attest to that effort as well.\n\nIf seeing Luke Combs in concert next year sounds like your kind of Saturday night, we’ve got you covered. We’ve broken down everything Luke Combs and the My Kinda Saturday Night world tour, including purchasing details and price comparisons between ticket vendors. You can also browse concert and ticket specifics at your convenience on StubHub or Vivid Seats.\n\nThe My Kinda Saturday Night tour will kick off in Las Vegas next March, followed by several shows across the continental US and Canada. From July, Combs will embark on a tour of Europe and the UK. The My Kinda Saturday Night tour is scheduled to wrap up on August 2 in London.\n\n*Indicates an event that Luke Combs will be performing at in addition to other artists.\n\nOriginal tickets for the My Kinda Saturday Night tour went on presale on October 15, followed by general sale on October 17, with tickets available for purchase on Ticketmaster. As of writing, all dates still have limited availability for original tickets, and can still be purchased on Ticketmaster.\n\nTickets are also available for purchase from verified resale vendor sites such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. Many popular tour stops, such as Las Vegas, have limited remaining seating options; in such cases, you may find more ideal options on resale sites instead.\n\nWith shows still having yet to sell out, ticket prices between the original and resale options are somewhat similar, with resale options leaning slightly more affordable for certain dates. Original standard ticket prices vary depending on the venue and location, but currently tend to fall within the average range of $100 to just over $300. Many locations even offer pit options under $300 (Knoxville and South Bend, for example), which is very reasonable compared to other artists whose pit tickets can easily exceed $1,000.\n\nAs of writing, for the resale option, Vivid Seats has prices ever so slightly below those of StubHub, with the most affordable options ranging from $71 for the May 2 tour stop in Knoxville to $176 for the May 30 tour stop in Montreal. StubHub ranges from $79 for the same Knoxville show to $244 for the Green Bay performance on May 16. The biggest difference right now is that Vivid Seats has fewer international location options, which is somewhat common for the site in general.\n\nLuke Combs has a guest appearance at Alan Jackson’s event in Nashville on June 27, and prices for this are considerably higher than his own headlining tour’s stops. This is due to the event being large, with several artists performing.\n\nThere are no VIP packages for The My Kind Of Saturday Night tour available for purchase on Ticketmaster.\n\nSeveral artists have been confirmed to join Luke Combs on his upcoming 2026 world tour. For North American shows, Dierks Bentley, Ty Myers, The Castellows, and Thelma & James have been tapped as supporting artists. Europe will continue to see Ty Myers and the Castellows perform, with The Script also joining them for shows in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Ireland. The Teskey Brothers have been announced as an opening act for the Edinburgh show, and Thomas Rhett will also be supporting the London concert.\n\nThe My Kinda Saturday Night tour has 10 international dates currently scheduled. The tour will head to Sweden in July, followed by shows in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland, and will conclude in the UK with five performances in Edinburgh and London.\n\nLuke Combs is an American country singer from North Carolina who first emerged on the scene in 2014 with his debut EP, “The Way She Rides”. He has since gone on to win several Billboard Music and Country Music awards, and also has his own polarized sunglasses and hat company called Blue Otter Polarized. Luke Combs married Nicole Hocking in 2020.",

    "fullText": "Every match at the 2026 World Cup will have three-minute hydration breaks in each half.\n\nFifa said the measure is being introduced to \"prioritise player welfare\" and will happen in matches regardless of the weather conditions \"to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches\".\n\nThe referee will stop the game 22 minutes into each half to allow players to rehydrate.\n\nWith the tournament taking place across the US, Canada and Mexico in June and July 2026, experts warn that high temperatures, wildfires and even hurricanes could affect teams, fans and stadium workers.\n\nThe recent Pitches in Peril report - compiled by pressure groups Football for the Future and Common Goal - found that 10 of the 16 venues for the World Cup are at \"very high risk of experiencing extreme heat stress conditions.\"\n\nThe scheduling of last June and July's Club World Cup drew complaints from players and managers as matches took place in extreme heat.\n\nChelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez said he felt \"dizzy\" while playing in \"very dangerous\" heat at the tournament.\n\nLast week, England manager Thomas Tuchel said he may have his substitutes stay in the dressing room during matches because of the risks posed by high temperatures.\n\nFifa said the hydrations breaks will be a \"streamlined and simplified version\" of similar ones used at previous tournaments including the Club World Cup.\n\nCooling breaks were previously mandatory in each half when the temperature exceed 32C.\n\nHeat is one the factors that has led to the World Cup having 13 different kick-off times.\n\n\"For every game, no matter where the games are played, no matter if there's a roof, [or] temperature-wise, there will be a three-minute hydration break. It will be three minutes from whistle to whistle in both halves,\" said chief tournament officer Manolo Zubiria.\n\n\"Obviously, if there's an injury [stoppage] at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee.\"",

    "description": "Lando Norris has joined an illustrious sporting club, and is only just getting going at the very peak of F1, writes Andrew Benson.",
    "fullText": "With his first Formula 1 world championship, Lando Norris joins an illustrious sporting club.\n\nOnly 35 drivers in the 75-year history of the sport have won the F1 title, and 11 of them - by far the largest number from a single country - are, like Norris, from the UK.\n\nAll of them are different, wrote larger or smaller chapters in the history of the sport. From Lewis Hamilton, the most successful driver of all time, with seven titles and 105 wins, to the one-time winners such as Mike Hawthorn, John Surtees, James Hunt and Damon Hill - who, like Jenson Button, was in Abu Dhabi to watch Norris secure his crown.\n\nOn Sunday night in Yas Marina, the game everyone who watches and enjoys sport likes to play had already started. Where does this achievement stand in the annals? How good is Norris?\n\nIn truth, this starts as a soon as a sportsperson arrives on the scene, especially when it's apparent they are heading for the top. And it has always been clear that Norris was. His level of talent and pace have always marked him out as a future world champion.\n\nFrom there, in F1, as in all elite sport, it's about fine margins, not just how fast a driver is, but how consistently they can achieve their best level, how few mistakes they make on the way.\n\nAnd Norris, although already seven seasons into his F1 career, is only just getting going at the very peak of the sport.\n\nHe has had an absolutely competitive car only for a season and a half, a very good one only for a year more than that. And at 26, he has many more years of running at the front to come. His story, the assessment of his standing, is in its early stages.\n\nThis year, Norris has gone toe to toe with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, acknowledged widely as the finest driver of his generation, the one who most consistently takes his equipment to the very edge of the possible.\n\nNorris has won that battle, by two points over the Dutchman, and 13 over his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, after a season that has ebbed and flowed between the three of them.\n\nAnd Norris knows what's coming now.\n\n\"I hate ever having to try and compare myself to other people,\" he said on Sunday night. \"This is all for you guys to decide, whether someone's better than someone else or not.\n\n\"All I try and do every weekend is the best of what I can. But then you decide 'he's better than him, or he's got a worse car and he's doing better'. Write what you like, decide what you like.\n\n\"I certainly feel like at moments I've driven better than I feel like other people can. And I feel like I drove at a level I don't think other people can match.\n\n\"But have I also made my mistakes? Have I made more mistakes than other people at times? Yes. Is there stuff Max could do better at times than me? Yes. Do I believe he's unbeatable? No.\n\n\"But you also don't know, do you? It's hard to know.\n\n\"Like, they also struggled with the car in the mid part of the season. They've had an incredible second half of the season.\n\n\"They took advantage of the fact we had two of us fighting for a world championship. He really made the most of that, and Max drove like he is a four-time world champion. And I'm very happy that I got to race against him and try to prove myself against him.\"",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Campaign urges PM to show independence from US and push to rein in development of superintelligence\n\nMore than 100 UK parliamentarians are calling on the government to introduce binding regulations on the most powerful AI systems as concern grows that ministers are moving too slowly to create safeguards in the face of lobbying from the technology industry.\n\nA former AI minister and defence secretary are part of a cross-party group of Westminster MPs, peers and elected members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures demanding stricter controls on frontier systems, citing fears superintelligent AI “would compromise national and global security”.\n\nThe push for tougher regulation is being coordinated by a nonprofit organisation called Control AI whose backers include the co-founder of Skype, Jaan Tallinn. It is calling on Keir Starmer to show independence from Donald Trump’s White House, which opposes the regulation of AI. One of the “godfathers” of the technology, Yoshua Bengio, recently said it was less regulated than a sandwich.\n\nThe campaigners include the Labour peer and former defence secretary Des Browne, who said superintelligent AI “would be the most perilous technological development since we gained the ability to wage nuclear war”. He said only international cooperation “can prevent a reckless race for advantage that could imperil us all”.\n\nThe Conservative peer and former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said that “even while very significant and senior figures in AI are blowing the whistle, governments are miles behind the AI companies and are leaving them to pursue its development with virtually no regulation”.\n\nBritain hosted an AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023, which concluded there was “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional” from the most advanced AI systems. It set up the AI Safety Institute, now called the AI Security Institute, which has become an internationally respected body. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on the summit’s call to address risks through international cooperation.\n\nGoldsmith said the UK should “resume its global leadership on AI security by championing an international agreement to prohibit the development of superintelligence until we know what we are dealing with and how to contain it”.\n\nThe calls for state intervention in the AI race come after one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI scientists told the Guardian humanity would have to decide by 2030 whether to take the “ultimate risk” of letting AI systems train themselves to become more powerful. Jared Kaplan, the co-founder and chief scientist at frontier AI company Anthropic, said: “We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like: Oh, wow, AI is a big deal.”\n\nLabour’s programme set out in July 2024 said it would legislate “to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models”. But no bill has been published and the government has faced White House pressure not to inhibit commercial AI development, mostly pioneered by US firms.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI is already regulated in the UK, with a range of existing rules already in place. We have been clear on the need to ensure the UK and its laws are ready for the challenges and opportunities AI will bring and that position has not changed.”\n\nThe bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who is backing the Control AI campaign, called for an independent AI watchdog to scrutinise public sector use and for AI companies to be required to meet minimum testing standards before releasing new models.\n\n“There are all kinds of risks and the government doesn’t seem to have adopted a precautionary principle,” he said. “At the moment there are significant risks: the mental health of children and adults, the environmental costs and other big risks in terms of the alignment of generalised AI and [the question of] what is good for humanity. The government seems to be moving away from regulation.”\n\nThe UK’s first AI minister under Rishi Sunak, Jonathan Berry, said the time was coming when binding regulations should be applied to models that present existential risks. He said rules should be global and would create tripwires so if AI models reached a certain power their makers would have to show they had been tested, designed with off switches and were capable of being retrained.\n\n“International frontier AI safety has not gone on in leaps and bounds as we had hoped,” he said. He cited recent cases of chatbots being involved in encouraging suicides, people using them as therapists and believing they are gods. “The risks, now, are very serious and we need to be constantly on our guard,” he said.\n\nThe chief executive of Control AI, Andrea Miotti, criticised the current “timid approach” and said: “There has been a lot of lobbying from the UK and US. AI companies are lobbying governments in the UK and US to stall regulation arguing it is premature and would crush innovation. Some of these are the same companies who say AIs could destroy humanity.”\n\nHe said the speed with which AI technology was advancing meant mandatory standards could be needed in the next one or two years.",
