    "fullText": "The Henderson Silver Knights paid tribute to the International Hockey League’s Las Vegas Thunder, and they did good to live up to the memory of Southern Nevada’s first professional hockey team.\n\nOn Saturday, the Silver Knights relied on late-game heroics and strong defense to ride out a close 4-3 victory over the Tucson Roadrunners.\n\nIt would not take long for the Silver Knights to get themselves on the board. Ten seconds into their first power play, the Silver Knights were able to cash in for an early lead. Lukas Cormier, making his return to the lineup, got a shot off from the point, and Kai Uchacz took advantage of the chaos and finished the play by sliding the puck past Roadrunners goaltender Matthew Villalta to break the ice.\n\nMinutes later, Sloan Stanick would keep his momentum rolling and give his team a cushion. The undrafted forward has already made waves early in his time in Henderson, and he did it again on an incredible solo effort. Getting a turnover in the offensive zone, Stanick launched a wicked shot that beat Villalta clean and secured his third goal in his first five AHL games.\n\n“He’s gotten to the hard areas to score goals,” said head coach Ryan Craig about the rookie. “I think his first two goals were from the top of the crease. His goal tonight, he reloads back above and scores between the hashmarks with a real good shot.”\n\nThe good times would not always last, however. Andrew Agozzino would put Tucson on the board on a quick-developing play to make good on the Roadrunners’ first possession in the offensive zone.\n\nNo change in the score during the second period, but what remained apparent was how aggressive the Silver Knights forecheck was. By the time the second was over, they had limited the Roadrunners to only seven shots.\n\n“They didn’t have any offense,” said forward Tuomas Uronen.\n\nJesper Vikman would be up for the challenge, however, especially on a breakaway save in the second period.\n\n“Every save matters. Obviously, that one maybe meant a little more to our team,” said Vikman.\n\nThe third period would see the Roadrunners catch yet another break. Keeping the play on the offensive zone by mere inches, Tyler Tullio was able to best Vikman on the glove side to tie the game up at two.\n\nHowever, the Henderson power play would once again make the difference. Taking advantage of a prolonged power play and Villalta breaking his stick, Uronen saw his opportunity and beat a Roadrunners defender to the front of the net. The Finn did not miss from point blank range, getting the puck between Villalta’s pads to put the Silver Knights back in the lead.\n\n“There’s moments in games, and I think that was the moment in this game,” said Uronen on the quick play.\n\nUronen would finish the job on another power play, besting Villalta with a beautiful shot off the post and into the net.\n\nAn Austin Poganski deflection would cut the lead back down to one to keep things interesting, but the Silver Knights would close the deal out to take the fans and Thunder alumni home happy.\n\nHowever, Craig wants more as the Silver Knights approach the second half of the season.\n\n“Still learning, still growing,” said Craig about his team. “We haven’t necessarily seen everybody together for a little while, which is okay. Opportunities are here for guys.”",

    "fullText": "Vicky Mboko called Sunday's match at the Australian Open against first-seeded Aryna Sabalenka “a learning curve.”\n\nIf so, the 19-year-old Canadian is catching on very quickly.\n\nSabalenka won in two sets — 6-1, 7-6 (1) to reach the quarterfinals — but Mboko put enormous pressure on the world's top-ranked player in the second set and was a few shots away from forcing a third at Rod Laver Arena.\n\nAfter trailing 4-1 in the second set, Mboko rallied to force the tiebreaker and seemed to have the momentum until Sabalenka did, well, Sabalenka-like things and won her 20th straight tiebreak.\n\n“I think at the end of the day it really came down to experience,” Mboko said. “She played really great tennis. I, of course, had my chances.”\n\n“It was a pretty nice experience being it was my first time on the center court playing against the world No. 1,\" she added.\n\nMboko, No. 16 in the WTA Tour rankings, is becoming famous as a slow starter, which she was in the first set against the top-ranked Sabalenka. But it was different in the second once she seized an opening.\n\n“Trying to find my rhythm as the match went on was important for me,” she said. “I was pretty close in the second set.\"\n\nMboko has been showing off her tennis all across Australia.\n\nShe was the runner-up a week ago in the Adelaide International, losing to Mirra Andreeva in the final 6-3, 6-1. However, she defeated defending Australian Open champion Madison Keys 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to reach the semifinals.\n\nMboko noted that against lesser players she's able to escape even when she hits shots that are short — not deep enough into the court.\n\n“But with her (Sabalenka) it was from the start, the moment my shot quality wasn't good enough, she was dictating right away,” Mboko said. “So that's something I could work on and learn from the next time.”\n\nAnd there will surely be a next time in every Grand Slam from here into the foreseeable future. Sabalenka, who is shooting for her third Australian Open title in four years, also made that point.\n\n“She’s an amazing player,” Sabalenka said of Mboko. “It was quite a fight. I’m super happy that I was able to close this match in straight sets. The second set was a bit tricky.”\n\nSabalenka faces another rising star in American 18-year-old Iva Jovic in the quarterfinals.\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

    "title": "Jurassic Park: Effects Team Brings Dinosaurs Back from Extinction (1993)",
    "description": "Stan Winston and Michael Lantieri detail their real-world practical solutions to creating the film’s huge stars.",
    "fullText": "The jeep heads right for us, the driver so terrified he smashes into a log, shearing the windows and the seat backs clean off as the vehicle skids under, spinning almost out of control. A roar echoes from the dense grove behind the jeep; trees shudder, toppling down, crushed by some monstrous weight. Then it appears, its vast body supported by two powerful legs, its voracious jaws filled with teeth the size of daggers — a living Tyrannosaurus rex. The huge creature gives chase, careening through the mud. The T-rex smashes through the log, reducing it to kindling, then crashes into the jeep, denting its side and upending it into the mud. The driver and his companions stumble from the wreckage as the fearsome beast, more terrifying than any dragon of legend, chases them deep into the dense jungle of Jurassic Park.\n\nThis startling sequence, filmed in a single breathless shot, is one of dozens of collaborations between full-scale dinosaur creator Stan Winston and mechanical effects supervisor Michael Lantieri on Steven Spielberg's long-awaited adventure epic. Along with stop-motion animator Phil Tippett and ILM visual-effects supervisor Dennis Muren, ASC [whose contributions are further detailed in AC July, 1993], Lantieri and Winston round out Jurassic Park's revolutionary dinosaur-design team.\n\nUsing every known effects technique, and some they created out of necessity specifically for Jurassic Park, they may well have done the impossible: given convincing life to an unholy menagerie of creatures who haven't walked the earth in millions of years. It’s an achievement that may well change forever the way we look at effects films.\n\nLantieri and Winston's work was used almost exclusively for the live-action dinosaur effects during principal photography. Together, they helped one another solve problems that have plagued effects experts such as Willis O'Brien from the prehistoric era of cinematic illusion — the silent The Lost Continent and the legendary King Kong — to the present day. “We really worked as one crew,\" Lantieri marvels. “Early on, our four-person design team took this pie, which represented all of the effects in Jurassic Park, and cut it up. We figured who could best do each effect, and then one or the other would say, 'We can go so far with this; can you pick up from here and run with it?'\"\n\nIn the beginning there was Stan Winston. As the multi-Academy Award-winning makeup effects artist will tell you, every dinosaur created for Jurassic Park began on the drawing boards at his Stan Winston Studio in Van Nuys. The bearded makeup impresario is a cagey fox, dazzling his audience with reams of techno-jargon, but the man has undeniably produced some of the most remarkable creations in screen history: the xenomorph queen of Aliens, the Pumpkinhead demon (from the film he also directed), the robotic cyborg of The Terminator and the shape-shifting T-1000 in Mark 'Crash' McCreary.\n\nWhat gives Winston's mechanical marvels their edge seems to be a philosophy stemming from his own humble beginnings as a struggling actor who fell into the field he now dominates almost by accident. \"I got involved in a makeup apprenticeship program while I was waiting to be a star,\" he admits. \"I was a big Lon Chaney fan and I was inspired by him to create wonderful, bizarre and incredible fantasy and real characters for film. When I realized a prosthetic makeup on an actor's face wouldn't allow me to fully realize the characters I was asked to create, I began using special effects technology to create fantasy characters that were completely animatronic puppets. I haven't gone from makeup to special effects; I have increased my palette with more colors that allow me to create characters using all the technology available, be it a makeup, a prosthetic, or dinosaurs for Jurassic Park.\" Unlike others in Winston's field, he sees his creations as characters who have to perform, on cue, like any other actor. This makes his task more demanding, and more rewarding.\n\nOne and a half of Winston's two years on Jurassic Park were spent designing the creatures who populate fictional billionaire John Hammond's bizarre island amusement park. All told, Winston's crew visualized nine different species of dinosaurs, most prominent of which were two-legged predators such as the Tyrannosaurus rex, velociraptors [above], and \"spitters,\" [the dilophosaurus] along with four-footed vegetarians such as triceratops and the mammoth brachiosaurus. \"Steven felt that there should be a consistent dinosaur design,\" Winston explains, \"so even dinosaurs that were only realized in the computer at ILM, such as the ostrich-like gallimimus, were designed here. The approach is very simple and it's what we do on every project: artistically, everything starts on the drawing boards. We're certainly not going to throw two tons of clay at an armature and start sculpting a full-sized Tyrannosaurus rex and hope that it looks great! On Jurassic Park, our concept artist was Mark 'Crash' McCreary, who did all the final renderings of the dinosaurs. The creatures' skin coloring was created by Shane Mahan and John Rosengrant, among many others.\"\n\nOnce the designs were finalized on paper, Winston's crew created 1/5th-scale sculptures of each dinosaur, except for the brachiosaurus, which was so huge in life that Winston opted to do him as a 1/19th-scale model. These clay maquettes were molded, cast in fiberglass and painted not only to show Spielberg what the creatures would look like in three dimensions, but also to serve as the models for the computer-generated dinosaur effects created by Phil Tippett in conjunction with ILM and Dennis Muren. Winston's crew also fabricated 1/5th-scale mechanical versions of each character destined to become a full-scale animatronic puppet.\n\nWinston says it was a brainstorm in the middle of the night that led him to devise a system for exactly translating his miniature dinosaurs into their full-scale counterparts: using cross-sections taken at precise intervals from his 1/5th-scale dinosaurs, he had them blown up five times and made into wooden patterns which were then strung along metal spines. \"We covered the wooden patterns with fiberglass to create a smooth solid surface, then started putting clay on it to make our finished sculpture,\" Winston boasts, \"and that became our sculpting armature. It ended up looking exactly like a very large version of those wooden dinosaur skeleton toys you can buy! The form of the dinosaur was done virtually by mechanical drawing, so our full-scale creations were identical to our 1/5th-scale maquettes. All we had to do then was to sculpt the skin and the detail. Later I learned this was exactly the way the Statue of Liberty was built!\"\n\nEach of the full-scale dinosaurs, which included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the spitters, the velociraptors, a triceratops and an insert brachiosaurus head and neck, took teams of sculptors months to craft to Winston and Spielberg's satisfaction. The sculptures were then molded, and from these molds flexible skins were cast which were then fitted over graphite and metal skeletons laden with all manner of mechanical devices: air bladders to simulate breathing, cable-actuated systems to perform certain body movements, radio-controlled servo motors to control facial motion. The creatures were all designed to operate in real time.\n\nMeanwhile, mechanical effects supervisor Michael Lantieri was hard at work creating what the four man design team laughingly called “dinosaur interfaces,” mechanical systems that would help these full-scale behemoths to stand, walk and perform in scenes. \"We always joked that Stan got the glamorous end of it,\" Lantieri says, \"but the behind the-camera work turned out to be really important and Stan was great about including us. We really worked together. If he'd made a creature that was only there from the waist up, we built out of our special 'dinosaur interface' things that could be attached to the creature to move it. Stan and I talked about where we could attach our interfaces, how we would move them and the speed [we would use]. We built a lot of different rigs that would accommodate Stan's puppeteers, underground cranes and dollies, as well as pneumatic cranes that would assist with the broad movements. In addition, my guys would be involved in the shoving and pushing needed to give the full range of motion.\"\n\nOf all the life-size dinosaurs, the velociraptors embody the most controversial blending of techniques: at the core of several of the various effects models are human beings. Given the dubious legacy of el cheapo productions such as Unknown Island, The Land Unknown, and Japan's legendary contribution to the genre, the Godzilla series, the idea of man-in-a-suit dinosaurs has been reviled by cineastes from time immemorial. Today, the man-in-a-suit approach has become state-of-the-art, and Winston is almost single-handedly responsible for the public's dramatic change in attitude. \"If there was a man inside a dinosaur, there was a great deal of technology inside that dinosaur, too,\" Winston observes.\n\n\"For Jurassic Park, we designed and built full-sized, performing, live-action dinosaurs. The methods we used involved whatever technology was required to create the performance needed. We built two man-in-suit raptors and two fully animatronic, no-human-being puppet raptors utilizing a combination of cable and servo control. We also made a set of walking legs and a set of running legs from the waist down. For certain shots, we created insert hands which could, for example, open doors. Then we fabricated our stunt raptors, full-sized floppy puppets and poseable puppets. All told, we built 8 to 10 full-sized raptors that did different things. We also built a baby raptor splitting out of its shell [seen featured image at top of page], which was totally real-time using cable control.\"\n\nWinston's goal was to create fluid, believable dinosaurs that bore no trace of the mechanics which gave them life. Specifically, he wanted to conquer the phenomenon he refers to as \"waga-waga,\" which he scientifically defines as the jolt that occurs when a large moving mass comes to a stop. Such jolts, which mimes employ to simulate robotic movement, work fine for machines like in The Terminator, but they would have seriously undermined Winston's attempt to bring his dinosaurs to convincing life. Through the careful application of some unusual, though strangely related technologies, the raptors and some of Winston's other dinosaur creations, most dramatically the full-scale Tyrannosaurus rex, employed a breakthrough \"anti-waga\" system. They were dubbed \"Steadi-Dinos\" because their movements were based on neutral buoyancy, the same principal which is integral to the Steadicam. This concept was envisioned by Craig Caton, one of Winston's key mechanical designers.\n\n\"I saw the relationship between a person having a hard time trying to hold a camera at the end of his arm and the need to hold up a head mechanically on a long neck,\" Winston beams, \"and I realized that the same wonderful system of counterspringing the camera so the weight load becomes neutral could help us mechanically. We realized that this could work very well for us in terms of certain head and neck movements, to make everything fluid. The actual infrastructures of our dinosaurs were countersprung just like a Steadicam, which made our creatures' movements totally fluid and organic. That technology went into the spitters and the velociraptors, two of our most active dinosaurs.\"\n\nBut this system achieved its most remarkable results in Jurassic Park's star attraction, a 40'-long, 9,000-pound animatronic machine that perfectly recreated the appearance and fluid motion of a full-sized Tyrannosaurus rex. \"The technology of the T-rex is beyond anything I think anybody has ever seen,\" Winston says. \"One of our big problems was figuring out how to make this 40'-long creature move quickly and violently, perform wonderfully, yet come to a smooth stop on cue without the waga-waga you would expect. We solved the problem through a series of computer-involved aspects of ramping up and ramping down speed, and by building accelerometers into our anti-waga devices. A series of accelerometers enabled us to measure the speed of the hydraulic rams moving within our dinosaur, which allowed us to counter that movement with other rams moving in the opposite direction elsewhere in the body. So our T-rex never completed a particular move and stopped without another aspect of the body compensating immediately. In order to keep this creature moving with speed and dynamics, nothing was allowed to come to a hard stop against its rigid 9,000 pounds without something else counterbalancing that motion. When its head comes to a sudden stop, something moves in the neck to compensate for it at that exact split second, which acts as a shock absorber. It's wonderful how this guy performs — he’s fast and big and dangerous and he's a great actor.\"\n\nWinston was concerned that the T-rex, weighing in at 9,000 pounds, was potentially as lethal off camera as on, and he began to worry about how to control this gigantic performer so it would interact on cue with its environment and not present a safety hazard. \"Unlike any other hydraulic creature you've seen in an amusement park, say King Kong [at Universal Studios], whose specific moves have been programmed in over a long period of time and who repeats those movements over and over, our Tyrannosaurus rex was this big hydraulic machine that had to perform on cue,\" Winston states. \"When you're an actor in a film, you have to be able to take direction immediately, so I was concerned about how to coordinate the computer keyboards with 8 or 10 people on them to make these big moves. The biggest problem we had beyond all this technology was safety. There's a real big danger factor working on a set with a 9,000-pound machine. This dinosaur could've killed someone really easiiy.\"\n\nAs with many of Winston's best ideas, the ideal solution to this hazard presented itself in the middle of the night. Winston had worked with performance Waldos many times before, but these telemetry suits, which translate the motion of the person wearing them into the performance of the mechanical creature itself, were designed for more humanoid characters. No one had ever devised a telemetry system for creatures that didn't mimic human motion. \"Thinking back to our 1/5th-scale mechanical T-rex prototype, I had the brainstorm that we could actually use one similar to it as our telemetry puppet!\" Winston says. \"I realized that we could literally build a performance Waldo for the T-rex that duplicated every motion he made in 1/5th scale, and use that as an interface for us to organically puppet the creature. Instead of having linear potentiometers linked to a control board, each potentiometer would correspond to a cylinder in our puppet version of the T-rex, so we had a 9,000-pound puppet that was literally operated by puppeteers manipulating a small version. That way, Steven could say, 'Let him rear up' and we could pull our 1/5th-scale Waldo back and let him act; our full-scale T-rex performed on the spot. If a situation required a really critical move, we could puppet it on the fly, and then, using the computer system that controlled our T-rex, we could record that move and repeat it over and over again at the push of a button.\"\n\nThe animatronic Tyrannosaurus rex was built in two parts. The upper body from head to tail down to the knee made up one section, while the legs comprised the other. The two sections could appear to be one creature by strategically placing a tree branch across the joint, there was also a set of dummy legs that could be positioned under the mechanical upper body. The effects team also constructed a foresection of the T-rex consisting of the front half of his body, which at 4,000 pounds was easier to move around than the full 9,000-pound version.\n\nThe gross movements of the nose to tail T-rex's massive upper body were controlled via a motion platform Winston calls the \"Dino-Simulator\" because of its similarities to a flight simulator, a hydraulically actuated, computer-operated platform capable of handling all six axes of movement smoothly, even while bearing an enormous weight load. Winston stresses that the full scale T-rex's articulation was tied directly into the flight-simulator concept. \"We took that same technology and, like branches on a tree, moved it right out to the tip of its nose,\" he says. \"The basis for the hydraulics and the mechanics and the fluidity of the T-rex's movement was the methodology behind flight simulators. The Dino-Simulator could fluidly move the creature forward, back, from side to side, and up and down. We took that system and continued to work up into the beast with hydraulic cylinders, transducers, and the addition of accelerometers, so what worked the Dino-Simulator also moved the entire dinosaur. Our problem was that it wasn't enough for the T-rex to move fluidly; it had to perform, so we had to take another step because now we had a long load-bearing situation that was setting itself up for an amazing waga! The solution involved computer cards to rapidly ramp-up and ramp-down speed, combined with counter-moves to stop the waga.\"\n\nAssisting with the construction of the Dino-Simulator was only the tip of the T-rex for veteran floor effects specialist Lantieri, who gives off the impression of a youthful elf with enormous enthusiasm for the problem-solving that comprises most of his work. It's hard to believe he got his start some 20 years ago handling effects for The Six-Million Dollar Man series at Universal Studios, where he now works his magic from his permanent, Spielberg-funded workspace on the lot. Along the way, Lantieri has won two Academy Award nominations and three British Academy Awards for his ability to contribute invisible expertise to such landmark productions as Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Back To The Future films.\n\nEven with all of this experience, however, Lantieri had never faced problems like those confronting him on Jurassic Park: \"Once you bring a dinosaur in for a shot, then what do you do with it? Not only did we have to move our creatures within the shot, we had to move them into position for the next setup. We had to be able to turn them around and move them out of the way. This meant we had to build very dinosaur-friendly sets to accommodate our winches and cranes and air bearings, most of which helped move the creatures into position and also, for certain shots, handled some of their broad movements in conjunction with Stan's puppeteers.\n\n\"We literally built a walker with training wheels to move the full set of T-rex legs. We also mounted the Dino-Simulator onto a tower that I built which was on air bearings, so we could use high-pressure air to glide a great deal of weight. Air bearings are used for moving heavy equipment out in the real world, but we use it for simulating earthquakes and other effects where we move big, heavy objects.\"\n\nSuch as 9,000-pound dinosaurs. This concept brings us back to the aforementioned shot in which the tyrannosaurus rex wreaks havoc on a jeep. \"The T-rex was supposed to give chase, run through a grove of trees, break through a gigantic log that's fallen across the road, then slam into the jeep,\" Lantieri smiles, pausing to catching his breath. \"Naturally, Steven wanted it in one shot. Upon the action cue, we were controlling half a dozen large real trees that had to be mowed down in sequence before we even see the T-rex. Each tree had to be scored, precut and hinged using internal cables, as well as cables on a pulley at a 45-degree angle. We set off sequential charges in the trees and had them spring loaded so they'd seem to plow from the back forward.\n\n\"Then we had this tree that had fallen across the road, which had to rip the windshield and shear the seat backs off our jeep as it crashes under it, but then break as our T-rex plows through it!\" Lantieri says, shaking his head. \"The fallen tree was built as a hollow log. It was made out of steel, then skinned with fiberglass and real bark and real limbs and real leaves. We then put a big air-driven piston through the center of it, so that when it was closed, just like a big barrel bolt, the log was sturdy and sound. The jeep actually drove into it at 30 m.p.h. and sheared the windshield off as everyone ducked at the last second, which was a real stunt that Gary Hymes supervised.\n\n\"A beat behind that, in the same shot, the T-Rex plunges through this log chest-first, which meant that we had to weaken the log and cause it to break itself open so we didn't hurt our creature! The second the jeep went through, I used high-pressure air to pull the piston and create a weak joint in the middle of the tree. The tree was then pulled back from the outside edges using hydraulics, like a swinging barn door, so that at the moment of impact with the T-rex we didn't hurt our star dinosaur.\n\n\"Lastly,\" Lantieri says with visible relief, \"we kept the shot going as the T-rex hits the side of the jeep, denting it and causing it to raise off the ground. Since our 9,000-pound animatronic puppet didn't have the strength to do what a real T-rex weighing 20 tons might do, we had to build a jeep that would dent itself on cue and appear to raise off the ground from the impact! We had the entire side of the jeep rigged with pneumatic rams and covered with lead sheets painted to look like the genuine steel skin. The ram, which was extended and welded to the lead skin, was then closed at high pressure at the moment of impact with the T-rex, and it sucked a great big dent in on the side of the jeep. We also had a pneumatic foot hidden behind the rear tire that slammed down into the ground and lifted the jeep off the ground, all of which had to be timed to the movement of the creature. This whole sequence was done in one shot, so you can imagine the amount of timing and cueing required in order for my crew and the stunt people to all hit their marks at the right moment. That was a huge mechanical effect.\" For added protection, the shot was also done as a motion-control move minus the T-rex, which could then be added later by ILM.\n\nThe film's most elaborate mechanical effects set piece again involved the Tyrannosaurus rex, who ravages a two-car caravan on a tour of Jurassic Park. The tour vehicles were supposed to be driverless Ford Explorers on a magnetic track. In reality, they were either radio-controlled or blind-driven vehicles which a driver controlled from underneath the hood. Lantieri had gained a lot of experience with these systems on Roger Rabbit, but he had never created a car that would literally crush itself. \"The crushable car was a real Ford Explorer,\" Lantieri explains. \"We replaced the door panels we wanted to crush with lightweight aluminum and lead, and we created replaceable, crushable roofs as well. We built a telescoping roll cage inside the headliners of the car, which was what actually pulled the roof down. We also had metal buckling on the side and glass breaking. It was all hydraulically driven, like a big crush press that we could control with joysticks. We stood right by the camera and Steven would say, 'Crush it a little more... a little more.' We were trying to give the feeling that this creature's foot was actually on top of the car, crushing it, which meant it couldn't seem like a mechanically clean crush. The car had to rock and crush at the same time, which required some puppeteering. When we shot our pickup scene inside the car with the two kids, we had to be sure that the roll cage was engineered to come to a stop at the right height so it wouldn't harm them, because Steven wanted it to look as if they were almost crushed.\"\n\nOnce the T-rex finishes demolishing the Ford Explorer, he bulldozes it over a cliff, where it lands in the branches of a huge tree. The kids then clamber out of the crushed vehicle as the branches give way, and the car chases them down the tree. The mix of kids and a 3,000-pound falling Ford had all the elements of a full-scale real-life disaster, but both Lantieri and Spielberg were fanatical about safety precautions. \"The tree was built on Stage 27, which is a pit,\" Lantieri recalls. \"Our tree was 60' high, and so detailed that its trunk was even covered with rolled bark that would scrape off as the car slid down it. The tree had to hold the weight of the real Explorer we were going to fly down after it got shoved over a cliff, so you can imagine all the safety precautions we had to go through. We used one of our regular cars with the motor removed, so it was just the frame and body, and we removed or replaced every piece that could break off. The only pieces that broke were ones that we controlled so we knew where they were going to fall. The car was always on a cable, but it still had to fall like it wasn't. It couldn't jerk when it fell. We actually put it into freefall using custom-built hydraulic wedges with electronic braking. That way, we could bring the car from a freefall to a controlled stop in one foot and it wouldn't snap on the cables because of the braking. It was all controlled digitally using a system we built combined with a descender rig that was capable of holding three or four tons. That way, we were able to drop a full-sized car on a limb above people's heads and do close calls. It was a tremendous responsibility, as well as a challenge, to make this look real.\"\n\nTo complicate matters further, the entire effect had to be completely timed out to Spielberg's nod. \"We had hydraulically controlled branches that would break on cue,\" Lantieri reveals, \"so I could build that cinematic tension that Steven loves to create — he's famous for it. After the car hit, the branch slowly started creaking and bent until he nodded, and then we let the branch break and the car fall. Steven knew exactly the length of suspense that he wanted to build. He'd say, 'Let it slip a little... let it slip... now!' and the car had to go right on the money. And it had to be repeatable. After the tree branch broke, we reset and reskinned it. We were all set to go while he waited, or we wouldn't be there the next day. That's part of the joy and challenge of working with someone like Steven.\"\n\nLantieri and company also created the usual atmospheric effects — rain, mist and fog — on set and on location, and also took care of details such as dinosaur tracks and park fences. \"Fencing!\" Lantieri shrieks. \"Let me tell you about a simple job, the kind of thing that would just slide by on this movie. When I read the script, the last thing on my mind was fencing! I was thinking, 'My God, the special effects on this movie! Do I really want this job?' But once we got the drawings and they said, 'Okay, just go put some fence up for us,' well, that took months.\"\n\nAnd yet, Lantieri concludes, \"I'm wondering where I go from here. I hope that having the opportunity to work on this film, with Steven as our fearless leader, wasn't a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"\n\nWinston concurs, adding: \"To me, the most exciting thing about Jurassic Park is that these dinosaurs are beautiful, they're real, and everything about their movements and their looks is organic. Some of the finest artists in the world worked for the longest time designing them, creating their look, their texture, and their movement, and the piece de resistance is the fact that they do perform and that they can act. And when they can't do something, that's where ILM and Dennis Muren come in. It'll be a beautiful, seamless mix of technologies so that what you see are living dinosaurs that are almost too real to be real.\"\n\nAlso from the June 1993 issue of AC is Jurassic Park: When Dinosaurs Rule the Box Office, in which cinematographer Dean Cundey, ASC details his approach to the project.",

    "fullText": "In 2016, Olympus Camera made some buzz in the photo world when they claimed that their new camera was capable of an impressive 6.5 stops of stabilization and that the limiting factor was in fact the rotation of the Earth.  This was rather surprising given the slow and steady improvement since the first such stabilization systems were introduced in lenses in the 1990s.  These only provided a couple stops of benefit.  Since then the technology has improved dramatically and the move from film to silicon has allowed it to be incorporated into the camera itself as IBIS.\n\nA major driver of this increase in stabilization performance has been in the gyroscopic sensors used to measure the vibration and control electronics used to correct it.  For these types of applications, the accuracy of the zero offset of the gyro sensor is often the limiting factor.  Even when perfectly still, noise will cause the sensor to read a small but non-zero value, which will in turn cause the stabilization system to drift.  The smaller the drift, the longer the stabilization system can hold an image steady.  If there were no noise on the gyro sensor and the stabilization system worked perfectly, it should in theory be able to provide an infinite number of stops of benefit.  However, at somewhere around 6 stops of shutter speed increase, the limiting factor stops becoming the electronics, and instead becomes the rotational motion of the Earth!\n\nTo illustrate , lets imagine that you are somewhere on the Earth’s surface, pointing the camera due East or West.  For simplicity, lets assume you are on the equator, but your latitude doesn’t actually matter for this analysis.  There are 86,400 seconds in a day, so Earth rotates at a rate of 2π/86400 radians/second, or 7.27*10^-5 rad/s.  That means that your subject, which is presumably stationary on Earth’s surface as well, is rotating at this rate.  Your camera, which is using its IBIS system to attempt to keep everything as still as possible, may not realize that you are rotating with your subject and will instead try to zero out any rotation of the camera, including that of the Earth.  More technically, the camera is trying to maintain stability with respect to an inertial reference frame, which by virtue of the Earth’s rotation, you and your subject are not.\n\nThe camera will of course move with the Earth and your subject, but will rotate relative to the subject.  If the camera is pointed east as shown in the figure above, it will rotate up relative to the subject.\n\nLets say that you have an exposure time given by the variable T.  IBIS will therefore cause the image to move by a distance on the sensor given by:\n\nUsing our typical standard for the maximum allowable blur to be 1 pixel width, we get the maximum allowable shutter time to be\n\nA 24 megapixel full frame camera will have pixels that are 0.0059mm wide.  Plugging this into the above equation, we get\n\nIf we take 1/Focal Length as the standard advice for the maximum shutter speed you can use to achieve sharp images, this equation says we can use shutter speeds 81 times as long with stabilization before Earth’s rotation blurs the image by one pixel.  In more familiar terms:\n\nNeat.  Of course not all cameras have the same 0.0059mm pixel pitch, but the rule for the maximum hand-held shutter speed will vary accordingly, so this 6.3 stops will be consistent across most cameras.  We can turn this around and say that in order to provide 6.3 stops of stabilization, the system must be able to measure and compensate for rotations of the camera as slow as the Earth’s, or 360 degrees per day.  That’s pretty impressive.\n\nPresumably, a calculation like the one above or very similar was the inspiration for the claim by Olympus Camera:\n\n“6.5 stops is actually a theoretical limitation at the moment due to rotation of the earth interfering with gyro sensors”\n\nSince then the plot has thickened.  Olympus has released the OM-D E-M1X which claims to have 7.5 stops of stabilization, and Panasonic claims their new 70-200 f/2.8 has 7 stops of stabilization.  How could this be?  Without access to the data used to perform the CIPA stabilization rating test for these pieces of equipment, it’s difficult to say for sure.  In theory though, there are some possible ways to work around the limitations placed be Earth’s rotation:\n\nThe first isn’t a good solution for many reasons.  Don’t have GPS signal?  Shooting next to a magnet?  Your system won’t work.  The second solution is much more plausible, but still very difficult.  The user would have to be pointing the camera at the subject for long enough such that the drift in their aim at the subject is smaller than the drift from the rotation of the earth.  This is also implausible.  What is concerning though, is that this second method is one that could work very well to cancel out Earth’s rotation on the CIPA specified stabilization test apparatus.\n\nFor the CIPA stabilization test, the camera is mounted to a vibration platform.  The camera is then moved by the platform in a way that is determined by a CIPA provided waveform designed to mimic the motions from hand-holding a camera.  The setup is shown below:\n\nIn this test setup, the camera is mounted to a very stable platform and held there for a long time before and after the test images are being taken.  In theory, this could make it much easier to for the camera to identify and filter out any effects from Earth’s rotation.  If the waveform has no very low frequency components, it would be easy to identify any low frequency motion as Earth’s rotation.  Without knowing exactly what waveform is given to camera manufacturers to perform this test though, it’s impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions.  It would be great if we could get some independent verification of the stated stabilization values, but CIPA seems to make that deliberately difficult.  As quoted on their application guide:\n\nThis seems unnecessarily restrictive to me and makes independent verification and analysis of the test impossible.\n\nThis has been a long way of saying that I don’t know if Olympus and Panasonic have found a way to compensate for the Earth’s rotation in their stabilization systems, breaking through the 6.3 stop limit, or if they are achieving 7+ stops through oddities of the CIPA rating test.  If anyone has one of these cameras with 7+ stops of stabilization and some time on their hands, it would be really cool to show the camera breaking through the Earth rotation barrier.  If the cameras can’t, and you could show that Earth’s rotation is actually the limiting factor on the stabilization system, well that would be pretty cool too.",

    "description": "Jack Edwards shapes the online world’s reading habits from BookTok. But can he handle his success?",
    "fullText": "“Samuel Johnson, William Hazlitt, Harold Bloom and James Wood. And now you?”\n\n“Oh, I mean, that’s pretty crazy to hear, but I don’t know.”\n\nDr Johnson never filmed a “spicy books with cartoon covers” vlog. But Jack Edwards cannot quite deny being the most important literary critic in the world. In commercial terms, he certainly is. A nod from him fills bathtubs, train carriages and public parks with copies of a book he likes. Booksellers buy and arrange their stock to his taste. And he is not confined to new releases. When he dug up an obscure Dostoevsky (White Nights), his positive review moved it from cellars to shop windows instantaneously. I first met him for this interview around the time of the 2024 International Booker Prize. He had been asked to host the ceremony – and to livestream it. I watched him cruise up the red carpet, encircled by cameras and attendants.\n\nEdwards is a literary tastemaker, but not in the familiar mode. You will not find any submissions of his languishing in the LRB slush pile. Instead he posts on BookTok and BookTube, the social media planes concerned with reading, where millions of viewers watch videos about books. At first, BookTok was confined to the lonely bedrooms of coronavirus lockdowns. Now it has stalls at the Hay Festival and the National Literacy Trust. Waterstones has “BookTok made me buy it” tables.\n\nEdwards is the foremost star of these platforms. Per his bio, he is the “internet’s resident librarian”. He is 27 years old and, on YouTube, has 1.5 million subscribers and 158 million views – which is roughly 16 and 1,755 Wembley Stadiums respectively. He is conventionally handsome, and excitable and sensitive in manner. He started YouTube while at secondary school in Brighton. His first videos were “day in the life” vlogs, study tips and A-level results reactions.\n\nThe boom came when he progressed to Durham University to study literature. His atmospheric recordings of undergraduate life proved so popular that the dean of his college now calls its oversubscription “the Jack Edwards effect”.\n\nHis next major growth spurt came when his university career ended. When Oxford University rejected his master’s application in 2020, Edwards posted a video of himself crying, entitled “oxford university rejected my masters application… (sorry this video is sad)”. Social media rewards confession. Authenticity, sincerity and vulnerability were important – more important than orthodox intellectual baubles. He described social media to me as “democratic… When you log on, you don’t need a qualification, you don’t need to be an established journalist.”\n\nGraduating into the pandemic was “confusing and strange”, he says. Edwards did not feel he could be a “StudyTuber” if he was no longer a student. He spent a month alone. During it, he read 30 books and decided he wanted a career in them. But he could not secure a job in a hotel, let alone one in publishing.\n\nUnlike other hopefuls, however, Edwards had a platform. He could not get jobs with publishers, but HarperCollins was willing to publish his guide to university life, The Uni-Verse. Having tried the conventional routes into employment, Edwards launched himself as a full-time book influencer. He posted reading-related videos from London, Paris, New York, Korea and elsewhere. The period was “really special” to Edwards. He read favourite authors in their native locations. He started Mieko Kawakami’s All the Lovers in the Night on the bullet train to Tokyo and finished the last page as the train arrived. “From the first page I was just absolutely entranced… I felt this real sense of catharsis, that I’d been through this entire journey, physically throughout Japan, but also with that author.” Occasionally, in a bodega, a coffee shop, a bookstore or a library, people would “tap me on the shoulder and say that they read their favourite book because they found it from my channel. And there’s no better feeling in the world than that – nothing.”\n\nLike many graduates his age, Edwards settled down in London. He posts reviews, commentary and hauls. His style as a literary creator has become defined, and honours the lessons of his social media success. Books get positive reviews if they stir his emotions – especially if they make him weep. With social media, he told me, “we can visually see people reacting to a book and having a kind of subjective emotional response that feels even more personal than maybe a book critic or journalist can. [In traditional reviews] we don’t get to see them crying in response to a book that broke their heart. I think that’s part of the magic of BookTok.”\n\nEdwards champions BookTok and also defends it. Critics argue that the platform is more about being seen reading than actually reading, and that it promotes low-quality fiction. Edwards rejects that characterisation energetically: “The only feature common to all ‘BookTok books’ – which can mean both enemies-to-lovers roommate novels and Greek mythological retellings – is popularity with a young audience.” He reminds me of “White Nights”, the Dostoevsky story that his review placed “alongside Colleen Hoover and Sarah J Maas on a ‘BookTok made me buy it’ shelf… I’ll recommend contemporary novels alongside classics because I think often we’re looking for those moments that resonate with us and that feel perennial, that feel evergreen.”\n\nHis favourite classics are by Toni Morrison and James Baldwin. They are “people who I think really understood the human condition, what it was to feel, to love, and to interact with the people around us.” More recently, “I’m a big Sally Rooney fan. She talks about when you’re on your deathbed you’ll think about the people that you loved and that you interacted with… it’s not frivolous to make art about the people that you loved and that you interacted with.”\n\nHe keeps his core content mostly apolitical. There is a progressive, inclusionary tone to his videos – “a book from every country in Asia” or “banned books and rainbow capitalism” – but he is seldom explicitly partisan online. He is more outspoken, however, on his X account, where he reposts Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana and makes no secret of his dislike for Keir Starmer’s Labour government.\n\nMostly, his commitment is to books. He told me: “I think one of the truest things for the world right now is that the worst of times can facilitate really incredible art, and we need that sort of self-expression.” Where we have come from, where we are going, and so on are crucial considerations when giving praise: “They always do represent where we’re at as a society and a culture.” Edwards quoted Bertolt Brecht, asking if there will also be singing in the dark times – and answering yes: there will be singing about the dark times.\n\nWhen we first spoke I was struck by how open and positive Edwards was. It may come easily to the enormously successful, but Edwards maintained a generous, pleasant perspective the whole time we spoke. Abusive comments: “Sometimes people’s responses can be quite personal. I suppose that’s probably the drawback. But the pros outweigh the cons by a long way!” A spanner about the Booker’s politics: “You’re making me work for it, I’m on my toes!” Suffering a fanbase pile-on, as he did after criticising the author of The Kissing Booth: “Yeah! People feel very strongly about books. That’s part of the fun!” On the relevance of establishment awards: “For me they’re a good guiding light to discover new things.” On pressure: “I obviously feel pressure being online… to always keep it kind.”\n\nIt seems he has always been that way. A student at university contemporaneously with Edwards told me how sardonic whispers would circulate whenever it became known that “the YouTuber” was in a bar. People would ask for selfies, not without a trace of nastiness. At that time, Edwards was far from successful enough to overwhelm such sneers. But he was always a good sport. I was shown a picture in which he had been willing to hold up a baby doll that he had been handed without explanation.\n\nBut soon after our first interview, Edwards’s output waned. His videos became sparser and more subdued, and they stayed that way for the rest of 2024. Then, at the start of 2025, Edwards posted a confessional video titled “every book I want to read in 2025 (and why i stopped posting book reviews)”. He described last year as “something to survive” and admitted that it had “got to the point where I had to really seriously consider whether I wanted to continue doing this.”\n\nEdwards is subject to copious online abuse. On camera, he mentioned withholding his opinions on pop culture because people called them cringe. But the harassment is much harsher than that, and touches on topics Edwards does not mention. The top posts on his own Reddit page accuse him – without citing evidence – of not reading the books he talks about, plagiarising reviews and “scamming” his followers with unsubstantial paid-content tiers. The thread about him on the gossip forum Tattle Life has been remade after reaching the site’s comment limit four times. The comments often speculate, cruelly, about his sexuality.\n\nOn top of calculated abuse, Edwards also suffered from the ambient pressures of fame. For instance, the book review site Goodreads labels Edwards’s account “#1 most read”: if he leaves a review on a book, it will be the first one users see, meaning a negative review can severely affect a book’s chances of success.\n\nAll this got to Edwards. Friends asked if he realised he was apologising and issuing disclaimers before speaking when he socialised with them. He lived with his “guard up all the time, flinching constantly, feeling just genuinely afraid to share anything”. He stopped posting opinions and even changed his accent because of criticism. In the video in which he discussed his withdrawal, he acknowledged commenters who said they missed “the old Jack”. He said, “I miss him too, I really do.”\n\nBecoming an influencer is now by many accounts the most popular career ambition for the young. But many who succeed take long breaks for their mental health, or withdraw entirely. Edwards reckons that online fame is “not something the human brain is wired for”. He described it as “traumatic” to see “so many people discussing something about you.” It feels “so invasive and intimate”.\n\nEdwards was born in Brighton in 1998 with terrible eyesight. A prescription of 8.75 keeps you off the football pitch. “You don’t really see the ball until it’s, like, inches from your face, and by that point it’s too late to pick which part of the head it’s gonna hit,” Edwards told me when we spoke again in August last year. His bookishness proceeded from his near blindness; his parents taught him the letters very young so they could get him a proper eye test. He started a blog to review the new Hunger Games film when he was 14.\n\nIf reading was a solitary pastime for Edwards the child, it is a solitary job for Edwards the man. He lives in a flat in Soho – not a cheap part of London – with another content creator for a flatmate. He never joined anything like a graduate scheme with colleagues his age. He rents a co-working space because, he says, “I like to feel like there is life going on around me.” He sometimes wishes someone would give him feedback on his work before he publishes it, because when the first judges are the commenters, “at that point there’s no room to manoeuvre… you kind of get tested in the public court before you, you know?”\n\nEdwards’s Zoom background featured the same bookshelves visible in his dejected January 2025 video. But he seemed to have developed a new toughness since then. He looked older, with a more muscular neck and longer, slightly receding hair, and he seemed almost bloody-minded about pushing on. In his own words, “Maybe my prefrontal cortex just developed, but I no longer care to have to argue my point or prove my moral worth every time I don’t enjoy something.” He dismissed unfair criticism flatly, calling it “nitpicking culture” and “moral panic” that is “not how the world works”. Where his old videos overshared in “toxic honesty”, he now has definite lines about not discussing his friends or relationships. That “really cutting remarks” are the comments that “stay with you”, he acknowledged as an unfortunate but permanent fact. He had a detached view of social media. As well as disdaining the angsts it causes, he distrusts the comforts it offers. “You have this illusion of community,” it was surprising to hear him say, “when we’re really very alone.”\n\nHis latest project is an attempt to forge real community, though it is still essentially a social media product. He wants his new book club, Inklings, to be “this book club community where I can have something that’s a bit more solid, tangible”. When I asked about his hopes for the next five years, he said he was focusing on the work. At that time, Inklings had no episodes but was already the fastest-growing club in the platform Fable’s history. Since then, its episodes have featured Oisín McKenna (Evenings and Weekends), David Nicholls (One Day), Coco Mellors (Cleopatra and Frankenstein), Luke Thompson (Bridgerton) and the actor Cillian Murphy.\n\nIn September, he recorded an episode with Palestine-born novelist Yasmin Zaher at the Saatchi Gallery. A large, orderly crowd filled pews in a white gallery lit by pink accent lights. I had been the only man of the first 20 people to queue. It was possible to track the location of a daddy long legs that was floating through the room by the screaming and lurching it provoked. Edwards came down the aisle in a t-shirt and corduroy trousers, laughing nervously and smiling at his fans, who cheered. On stage, he said it was “so special for me to get to be here with you all… to take this thing we do in isolation… moments we spend in our own heads… and turn it into community”.\n\nEdwards said he escaped feeling overexposed by “finding something – for me, it’s been books and reading – to refract everything through”. He asked whether Zaher’s characters obsessed over “being clean, perhaps because there’s little else they can control”, and whether, in the case of another, the “dirty parts of her she couldn’t clean then became a target”. He said we knew “almost too much” about the protagonist when we heard her “sexual perversions and hot takes”, and mentioned another who “withholds, and she keeps for herself almost as a way of maintaining ownership of, and having control of, her identity, and saying, actually, I can’t be defined by external sources; I define myself”.\n\nZaher’s novel, The Coin, was her debut. Edwards asked if being unknown allowed her a “lack of inhibitions”. She agreed that you are freer when “you don’t know who your audience may be”. Edwards knows who his audience is, and they know him. He told me of fans commenting on his interviews that they could answer every question for him.\n\nBut if the relationship is not free; it is tender. Rose, 25, unemployed after failing to find a job in publishing, had been watching him “constantly for five years”. She said, “I literally rediscovered the love of literature through him – so big, big fan.” Allesia, 21, unemployed after recently graduating, had gotten into Edwards after immigrating from Ukraine six years ago, at which point she could not read in English. “I like how accessible he is to people who don’t read or have just started reading.” Ryan, 28, had watched Edwards for a decade. He now directs AI engineering at a tech company but had previously worked for influencers in LA. He had seen that “it’s all consuming when your entire life is to be someone; that can be brutal”.\n\nAlmost everyone was there by themselves. Some came with a parent or a friend, but I didn’t see a crowd of three. Rose said Edwards’s content was “the kind you stumble onto when you’re, like, in your room alone”. Ryan said that in his decade of viewing he had come to “enjoy my self more”. Almost immediately after taking the microphone, Edwards had said, “Bear with me while I try not to cry.” It was easy to imagine his audience feeling he had done the same for them. Edwards helped people, Rose reckoned: “He brings a lot of, like, humanity and empathy… I think the world would be a better place if everyone read fiction. It’s literally learning how to put yourself in other people’s shoes.”\n\nEdwards is working on his first novel. He would only tell me that it is historical and set in the UK. He will certainly find a publisher. He claims his whole life has been “that pursuit of letters on a page”. Whether that pursuit will lead to literary greatness of course remains to be seen. He may not become Dr Johnson – but Jack Edwards seems, at last, to be becoming himself.\n\n[Further reading: Cats are better than dogs – and much better than David Baddiel]",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The bloodiest crackdown on dissent since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution is slowly coming into focus, despite authorities cutting off the Islamic Republic from the internet and much of the wider world.\n\nCities and towns smell of smoke as fire-damaged mosques and government offices line streets. Banks have been torched, their ATMs smashed. Officials estimate the damage to be at least $125 million, according to an Associated Press tally of reports by the state-run IRNA news agency from over 20 cities.\n\nThe number of dead demonstrators reported by activists continues to swell.

The video footage shows crowds of people — including children and families — chanting, dancing around bonfires, marching on their streets,” said Raha Bahreini, of Amnesty International. \"The authorities have opened fire unlawfully.”\n\nThe killing of peaceful protesters — as well as the threat of mass executions — have been a red line for military action for U.S. President Donald Trump. An American aircraft carrier and warships are approaching the Mideast, possibly allowing Trump to launch another attack on Iran after bombing its nuclear enrichment sites last year. That risks igniting a new Mideast war.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to detailed questions from the AP regarding the suppression of the demonstrations.\n\nThe demonstrations began Dec. 28 at Tehran’s historic Grand Bazaar, initially over the collapse of Iran's currency, the rial, then spread across the country.\n\nTensions exploded on Jan. 8, with demonstrations called for by Iran's exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi. Witnesses in Tehran told the AP before authorities cut internet and phone communication that they saw tens of thousands of demonstrators on the streets.\n\nAs communications failed, gunfire echoed through Tehran.\n\n“Many witnesses said they had never seen such a large number of protesters on the streets,” said Bahar Saba of Human Rights Watch. “Iranian authorities have repeatedly shown they have no answers other than bullets and brutal repression to people taking to the streets.”\n\nAli Akbar Pourjamshidian, a deputy interior minister speaking on state TV Wednesday, acknowledged the violence began in earnest on Jan. 8.\n\n“More than 400 cities were involved,\" he said.\n\n“Tonight you all must be vigilant. Tonight is the night for keeping mosques, all bases everywhere filled with ‘Hezbollahi,’” Yekta said, using a word for “followers of God” that carries the connotation of fervent supporters of Iran's theocracy.\n\nAlready weakened by the 12-day war Israel launched against Iran in June, the authorities decided to fully employ violence to end the demonstrations, experts said.\n\n“I think the regime viewed it as this was a moment of existential threat and that they could either allow it to play out and allow the protests to build and allow foreign powers to increase their rhetoric and increase their demands on Iran,” said Afshon Ostovar, an expert on the Revolutionary Guard and professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey, California.\n\n\"Or they could turn out the lights, kill as many people as necessary ... and hope they could get away with it. And I think that’s what they ultimately did.”\n\nBasij key in disrupting protests\n\nIn Iran, one of the main ways its theocracy can squash demonstrations is through the Basij, the Guard's volunteer arm.\n\nMosques in Iran include facilities for the Basij. Guard Gen. Heydar Baba Ahmadi was quoted by the semiofficial Mehr news agency in 2024 as estimating “79% of Basij resistance bases are located in mosques and 5% in other holy places.”\n\nIranian state media repeatedly has aired images of mosques damaged in the protests without exploring their links to the Basij.\n\n“Most neighborhood Basij bases are co-located with mosques and most neighborhood Basij leaders are associated with the mosque leadership,\" Ostovar said, adding that demonstrators “going after regime targets” associated with repression would have considered them “a legitimate part of it.”\n\nVideos show Basij holding long guns, batons and pellet guns. Anti-riot police can be seen wearing helmets and body armor, carrying assault rifles and submachine guns.\n\nThe videos show police firing shotguns into crowds, something authorities deny despite corpses showing wounds consistent with metal birdshot. Scores have reportedly suffered blinding eye wounds from birdshot — something seen in the protests around the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.\n\nIran's semiofficial ILNA news agency reported that Tehran's Farabi Eye Hospital, the premiere clinic for eye injuries, called in “all current and retired doctors” to help those injured.\n\nWe “received accounts that the security forces were just firing relentlessly at protesters,” said Bahreini of Amnesty International.\n\n\"They’re not just targeting one or two people to create a climate of terror for people to disperse ... but just relentlessly firing at thousands of protesters and chasing after them, even as they were fleeing so that more people were just collapsing to the ground with severe gunshot wounds.”\n\nCasualties grow as crackdown intensifies\n\nFor two weeks, Iran offered no overall casualty figures. Then on Wednesday, the government said 3,117 people were killed, including 2,427 civilians and security forces. That left another 690 dead that Pourjamshidian identified as “terrorists.”\n\nThat conflicts with figures from the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which put the death toll on Saturday at 5,137, based on activists inside Iran verifying fatalities against public records and witness statements. It said 4,834 were demonstrators, 208 were government-affiliated personnel, 54 were children and 41 were civilians not participating in protests.\n\nDeath tolls in Iran have long been inflated or deflated for political reasons. But the fact that Iran's theocracy offered any death toll — and gave a number beyond any other political unrest to strike the country in the modern era — underlines the scale of what happened.\n\nIt also provides a justification for the ongoing mass arrest campaign and internet shutdown. State media report dozens to hundreds of people detained daily.\n\nPourjamshidian also gave an extensive list of vandalism from the protests and crackdown, including 750 banks, 414 government buildings, 600 ATMs and hundreds of vehicles that sustained damage.\n\nMeanwhile, uncertainty looms for Iran's theocracy over what Trump may or may not do.\n\nTraditionally, Iranians hold memorial services for their late loved ones 40 days after their deaths — meaning the country could see renewed demonstrations around Feb. 17. Online videos from Behesht-e Zahra, the massive cemetery on the outskirts of Tehran, show mourners chanting: “Death to Khamenei!”\n\nSatellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by the AP show large numbers of cars daily at Behesht-e Zahra’s southern reaches, where those killed in the demonstrations are being buried.\n\nElaheh Mohammadi, a journalist at Tehran's pro-reform newspaper Ham Mihan, recently noted it had been shut by authorities. She said journalists were working on stories about Behesht-e Zahra they weren't able to publish.\n\n“We send out a message to let people know we’re still alive,” Mohammadi wrote online. “The city smells of death.”\n\n“Hard days have passed and everyone is stunned; a whole country is in mourning, a whole country is holding back tears, a whole country has a lump in its throat.\"",

    "title": "Blades Brown, 18, reaches dream showdown with Scottie Scheffler in final round of The American Express",
    "description": "Teenager Blades Brown shot a strong 68 on Saturday at PGA West to get the chance to battle World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and AmEx champion Si Woo Kim on Sunday for title",
    "fullText": "Have you ever fathomed Tiger Woods or Rory McIlroy or Scottie Scheffler playing rock-paper-scissors with a fan at the ropes in the heat of competition? Of course not. Tiger loathed even eye contact, and Rory and Scottie offer fist bumps occasionally, but most of the great players covet trying to stay in some kind of zone.\n\nThen again, none of them had quite the youthful verve of Blades Brown, nor did they have a chance to embrace the moment while being 18 years old and contending into Sunday of a $9.2 million PGA Tour event.\n\nIn the midst of birdieing his final three holes—the last two coming at a combined 72 feet— to finish a round of four-under-par 68 in the third round of The American Express, Brown strode down to the island 17th green at the PGA West Stadium Course. When a boy not much younger than him approached the rope line and gestured to play Rock-Paper-Scissors, Brown took the bait—and kept with it as they walked through five rounds, before Blades won with a “rock.”\n\nOf course he won. That’s the kind of surreal week the recent high school graduate from Nashville is having in California’s Coachella Valley. In only his 10th PGA Tour start after making his debut here a year ago, Brown backed up his course-record 60 on the Nicklaus Course on Friday with strong round in gusty conditions on the hardest course in the three-venue rotation, and he’ll return at the Stadium on Sunday morning to compete in the final threesome with Scheffler, the World No. 1 who is gunning for his 20th career victory, and past AmEx champion Si Woo Kim.\n\nKim leads at 22 under after shooting 66 on Saturday at La Quinta Country Club, while Brown and Scheffler (68) are a shot back after Scheffler needed to make a long par putt on the 18th to reach the anchor group.\n\nAt stake for Brown is his opportunity to become the second-youngest player with an official win on the PGA Tour, while no one ever has pulled off what he could—lifting a trophy after playing eight consecutive days across two tours. Brown flew to Palm Springs on Wednesday after the final round of the Korn Ferry Tour’s event in the Bahamas, where he tied for 17th.\n\n“I’m having fun out there,” Brown said. “I’m 18 years old playing on the PGA Tour. How awesome is that? I finished high school about two weeks ago, so it’s nice to have that burden off my back. But I’m really looking forward to tomorrow.”\n\nIf Brown, who is ranked 485th in the world, is feeling any nerves, he certainly isn’t showing it. He definitely had to practice patience on Pete Dye’s challenging Stadium layout—there wasn’t going to be an eight-under start through seven holes like on Friday on the Nicklaus Course. Brown birdied Nos. 5 and 6 but bogeyed 7 and then parred eight straight holes.\n\nA chip to close range gave him a birdie at the par-5 16th, and then Brown’s putter caught fire. After nearly hitting his tee shot too long into the water at the “Aclatraz” green at 17 and engaging with that kid at the ropes, he rolled in a 25-foot birdie. At 18, Brown piped a 268-yard tee shot into the middle of the fairway and hit his approach to 43 feet. Again, he put a calm and perfect stroke on his ball for birdie. In the round, Brown made 128 feet of putts.\n\n“Hooped two putts coming in, and that was cool,” Brown said with a smile.\n\nWhat makes Brown’s performance this week particularly surprising is that after turning pro at 17 years old in late 2024, he has not been a consistent contender in tournaments. He played 14 times on the KFT last season and had two top-10s—though one of those was a T-2 in April’s Veritex Championship, where he tied for second after opening with a 61.\n\nHe made his PGA Tour debut as a pro in The AmEx last year and missed the cut. There would be four more missed weekends over another seven starts, with a pair of T-34s as Brown’s best results.\n\nAt this point, Brown is still trying to build on all of his experiences.\n\n“I think if I can take every single competitive professional tournament round and learn something from it; you just keep stacking those day after day it's going to be a really cool story,” Brown said. “So that's one thing that I tried to do is I try to learn from every round. And yeah, last year was a little unfortunate, but I learned from it. I think that's what you have to do.”\n\nScheffler, 29. has his own strong motivations to win his first AmEx. If he can snatch his 20th victory, the Texan will be the second-youngest to reach the milestone and in the second-fastest time at 151 starts. Woods tops both categories.\n\nScheffler seemingly could have the lead going into Sunday, given how how many scoring opportnities he gave hiimsel on the Stadium. But down the final stretch alone, he missed a 13-foot birdie putt at 15, an 18-foot eagle attempt at 16 and a 22-footer for birdie at 17.\n\nScheffler was ultimately fortunate to get into Sunday's final group after he missed the green from the middle of the fairway. His difficult sidehill chip motored 25 feet past the hole, but Scheffler drained the putt for par.\n\nIn his post-round interview, Kim asked with interest if he was playing with Scheffler on Sunday, and at the time it was uncertain as Scheffler finished up. It was clear that Kim, a four-time PGA Touur winner who is ranked 42nd in the world, was eager to get that draw.\n\n\"Hopefully playing with Scottie, and we can have some fun,\" Kim said. \"Just not thinking about trying to win or trying to finish, just enjoy the round. That's my goal.\"\n\nKim, 30, became the youngest winner of the Players Championship when he won in 2017, and it would take him another four years for the next victory—a one-shot triumph over Patrick Cantlay in The AmEx. Kim's last win came in the 2023 Sony Open in Hawaii.",

    "fullText": "Over the past two years, WWE and TNA Wrestling have gradually strengthened their professional relationship, so much so that a long-term partnership was formally inked in January 2025. Through it, TNA stars such as Frankie Kazarian have been able to appear on WWE programming, while \"WWE NXT\" talents have returned the favor with a number of outings in TNA. On a recent edition of \"Two Man Power Trip,\" Kazarian weighed in on the ongoing partnership.\n\n\"It's been beneficial, that goes without saying, for us, and I think it's been beneficial for NXT,\" he said. \"A lot of those guys that come up in that system, they learn what WWE wants to teach them, which is their way of doing television and matches and all that. Coming to TNA, they get kind of a different taste. It's a bit looser, a lot more freedom when it comes to promos and stuff. There's a little bit less micromanagement, so it's really cool for them to see that side of it.\n\n\"For me, all the stuff I've been able to do at NXT last year, I had a blast,\" he continued. \"They really treated me great. They rolled out the red carpet for me. It was cool just to be part of that crossover.\"\n\nIn Kazarian's case, he has wrestled for \"NXT\" on two occasions, the latest of which saw him and three other TNA men — Moose, Mike Santana, and Leon Slater — defeated four of \"NXT's\" top talents in a Survivor Series-style match in October. Months before that, Kazarian made his \"NXT\" debut in a battle royal to determine the number one contender to the NXT Championship.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Two Man Power Trip\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "As Golfweek celebrates its 50th anniversary, we honor the journey from Charley Stine’s garage in Winter Haven, Florida, to becoming a global voice in golf.",
    "fullText": "I’ve often told my non-golfing friends that one of life’s greatest teases is spending an hour or two along 17-Mile Drive — that breathtaking stretch of road winding through the Monterey Peninsula. It brushes past legendary courses like Pebble Beach Golf Links, Cypress Point, Spyglass Hill, The Links at Spanish Bay, Monterey Peninsula Country Club, and Poppy Ridge.\n\nFor around 12 bucks, even those indifferent to the game can enjoy a scenic sampler of the region, leaving with a phone full of Instagram-worthy shots of some of the most stunning landscapes imaginable.\n\nBut for those of us who live to walk mist-covered fairways and strategize our way through the world’s finest golf holes, the experience is bittersweet. We leave a piece of ourselves behind, wondering if we’ll ever find the time — or the access — to check off any boxes on this nearly mythical bucket list. The slow cruise is both exhilarating and agonizing. It’s like being offered a taste of hors d'oeuvres at a Michelin-starred restaurant, only to be shown the door just as the main course begins to emerge from the kitchen.\n\nThat was exactly how I felt two decades ago, when my daily concerns revolved around the Buffalo Bills and the Sabres. I was working five nights a week as executive sports editor and lead columnist for a daily newspaper, and two more as a weekend sports anchor on the local ABC affiliate. It was a hectic, uneasy existence, shaped by a city and its struggling franchises — post-Jim Kelly, pre-Josh Allen — when the Bills were barely a blip on the national sports radar.\n\nYet every summer, my personal 17-Mile Drive would resurface. The Porter Cup rolled through town, bringing the world’s top amateur golfers to Niagara Falls Country Club. I’d mingle with rising stars like Rickie Fowler, Dustin Johnson, Jason Kokrak, Colt Knost, Gary Woodland, and more. The event took over Lewiston, N.Y., the small village where I resided. A friend who hosted players built an indoor hitting bay just for Adam Scott. One rain delay gave me unexpected hours with Billy Horschel, who walked me through the finer points of his game. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson had come through just before my time, and Max Homa and Justin Thomas followed after I’d moved on.\n\nIt was a delicious dive into a world I didn’t experience for most of the year, and when the entire circus left town after a post-tournament party in the backyard of a friend, I was always left wondering what it would be like to follow these young stars each week.\n\nBut while the golfers were the main attraction for fans, my eyes each summer turned to Ron Balicki.\n\nBorn to a family in public housing in Connecticut, Balicki spent time in Arkansas, but eventually found his way to Florida at a time when the golf scene was rapidly ramping up, and after a dozen years at the daily newspaper near Destin, he was named Golfweek’s first managing editor in 1983. While others might have used that as a means to focus solely on the pros, Balicki eventually worked his way back into the game’s grassroots, becoming a legendary college and amateur reporter.\n\nWhen Balicki died in 2014, Golfweek’s then managing editor Jeff Babineau (who has also since passed) penned these incredible paragraphs:\n\nBalicki was an ambassador, serving as Golfweek’s introductory calling card and first handshake to promising amateurs and college players. He not only got to know players, but grew close with their families, too, forging lifelong friendships. Phil Mickelson called him from Doral a few weeks ago to thank Ron for his integrity. When amateur Rickie Fowler decided that he was turning pro in 2009, he stopped mid-practice round and made the one call he knew he needed to make, phoning Balicki.\n\nHis span covering the college game dated to the powerhouse teams of Coach Dave Williams at the University of Houston in the 1980s, and he wrote a great deal about the Stanford teams of the mid-90s that included a rising star named Tiger Woods. Every young American champion of the last three decades who has risen through the amateur ranks – from Scott Verplank to Davis Love III to Mickelson to Justin Leonard to Woods to Ryan Moore to Fowler – was anointed somewhere along his early path with a story carrying a Ron Balicki byline. For years, before the Internet rolled around, he’d even keep his own stats and scribble out Golfweek’s weekly college and amateur rankings by hand on tall, yellow legal pads.\n\nRon Balicki’s story is foundational to Golfweek’s existence — not just for what he contributed to the game, but for how he did it. He was revered not for bravado, but for depth of knowledge. His legacy is built on longevity, expertise, and humility — not bombast.\n\nAs Golfweek celebrates its 50th anniversary, we honor the journey from Charley Stine’s garage in Winter Haven, Florida, to becoming a global voice in golf. Originally printed on paper, Golfweek was the lunchpail-toting publication that mirrored Balicki’s ground-up approach — building trust with players and fans alike. As Curtis Strange recently told me, “We read all the golf publications, but we couldn’t wait to get to Golfweek — to see the stats from every amateur event and compare ourselves with other players. We had to have it.”\n\nFive decades later, the spirit of Balicki, Babineau, Stine, and others who shaped this publication lives on. It’s reflected in Cameron Jourdan’s extensive amateur golf coverage, Jason Lusk’s deep dives into courses, David Dusek’s exhaustive equipment testing, and Eamon Lynch’s incisive columns. And while Beth Ann Nichols and Adam Schupak lead our extensive pro tour coverage, Golfweek remains committed to celebrating the entire game — not just when the purses are biggest.\n\nThese relationships endure. I was reminded of that at this year’s Valero Texas Open, when Brian Harman lit up recalling his 2007 Porter Cup win — a record-setting performance that still tops the event's all-time leaderboard. Or when I heard a touching story from the family who housed Horschel during his amateur days near my hometown. Soon after the family patriarch passed away, Horschel won the 2014 FedEx Cup, a moment that changed his career’s trajectory. Yet he found the time to quickly text them a photo of the trophy, adding, “This one’s for your dad.”\n\nGolfweek’s 50th anniversary isn’t just a milestone — it’s a tribute to the relationships, stories, and spirit that have defined the publication for half a century. And it’s a promise that those values will continue to guide us into the next.\n\nTim Schmitt is the managing editor of Golfweek, and has just two of the 17-Mile Drive courses crossed off his list.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Golfweek at 50: Relationships still matter",

Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals.",

    "fullText": "In today’s CEO Daily: Diane Brady wraps up a week at Davos.\n\nThe big story: Trump sues Dimon and JPMorgan.\n\nThe markets: Mixed globally, with U.S. futures edging down.\n\nPlus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune.\n\nGood morning. When BlackRock CEO Larry Fink became co-chair of the World Economic Forum last year, he called up U.S. President Donald Trump and asked him to come speak, which he did. Fink also called Scott Galloway, an author, podcaster and NYU Stern marketing professor who has a very different view of what will make America great. As Galloway told me last night at our annual Fortune Global Leadership Dinner: “Larry Fink called me and said, ‘I want you to come.’ That was more than enough.”\n\nWith all the focus at WEF on heads of state—I even joined a media scrum after Trump’s meeting with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky—I thought I’d bring you some insights from my conversation with Galloway. (I first met Galloway in 2009 as a fellow mentor at the Kairos Summit organized by then Wharton student Ankur Jain, who went on to found Bilt Group.)\n\nGalloway last attended WEF in 1999. “The call sign of America back then was consumerism; it was more cooperation, alliances. Now, I feel the American brand is chaos, corruption, and coercion,” he said. “America has been the operating system of the world … There’s just a sense of unease … In 1999, we said ‘we want more,’ now we want to make sure things don’t get worse.” He praised Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech as the best of the week. “All 27 member EU states should have been sitting behind him,” Galloway said. “Right now, it’s like Germany and the 26 dwarves.”\n\nIn soliciting both Galloway and Trump to come to Davos, Fink understands the power of WEF in bringing opposing world views under one roof. I heard Saudi Tourism Minister HE Ahmed Al-Khateeb compare notes with Switzerland Tourism CEO Martin Nydegger, saw Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick chat with random people in the hall, including me, and witnessed dozens of global leaders find areas of commonality at our dinners and lunches. (That’s why I also appreciated having Deloitte, Aon, PMI, Toptal, and Workday sponsor editorial gatherings that let us create our own village greens.)\n\nOn Monday, I moderated a CEO salon to discuss the results of the 2026 Edelman Trust Barometer, in which 70% of this year’s respondents expressed an “insular” mindset; they don’t want to talk to, work for, or even be in the same space with anyone who doesn’t share their world view. Richard Edelman told me CEOs need to urgently address the sense of grievance that’s consuming the business world.",

    "fullText": "Do I have the flu or Covid? Why do I wake up feeling tired? What is causing the pain in my chest? For more than two decades, typing medical questions into the world’s most popular search engine has served up a list of links to websites with the answers. Google those health queries today and the response will likely be written by artificial intelligence.\n\nSundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, first set out the company’s plans to enmesh AI into its search engine at its annual conference in Mountain View, California, in May 2024. Starting that month, he said, US users would see a new feature, AI Overviews, which would provide information summaries above traditional search results. The change marked the biggest shake-up of Google’s core product in a quarter of a century. By July 2025, the technology had expanded to more than 200 countries in 40 languages, with 2 billion people served AI Overviews each month.\n\nWith the rapid rollout of AI Overviews, Google is racing to protect its traditional search business, which generates about $200bn (£147bn) a year, before upstart AI rivals can derail it. “We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace,” Pichai said last July. AI Overviews in particular were “performing well”, he added.\n\nBut overviews carry risks, experts say. They use generative AI to provide snapshots of information about a topic or question, adding conversational answers above the traditional search results in the blink of an eye. They can cite sources, but do not necessarily know when that source is incorrect.\n\nWithin weeks of the feature launching in the US, users encountered untruths across a range of subjects. One AI Overview said Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president, graduated from college in 2005. Elizabeth Reid, Google’s head of search, responded to criticism in a blog post. She conceded that “in a small number of cases”, AI Overviews had misinterpreted language on web pages and presented inaccurate information. “At the scale of the web, with billions of queries coming in every day, there are bound to be some oddities and errors,” she wrote.\n\nBut when those questions are about health, accuracy and context are essential and non-negotiable, experts say. Google is facing mounting scrutiny of its AI Overviews for medical queries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information.\n\nThe company says AI Overviews are “reliable”. But the Guardian found some medical summaries served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. In one case, which experts said was “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people who had serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. What AI Overviews said was normal could vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result and not bothering to attend follow-up appointments.\n\nAI Overviews about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nGoogle initially sought to downplay the Guardian’s findings. From what its own clinicians could assess, the company said, the AI Overviews that alarmed experts linked to reputable sources and recommended seeking expert advice. “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a spokesperson said.\n\nWithin days, however, the company removed some of the AI Overviews for health queries flagged by the Guardian. “We do not comment on individual removals within search,” a spokesperson said. “In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nWhile experts welcomed the removal of some AI summaries for health queries, many remain worried. “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health,” says Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity.\n\n“There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information,” adds Sue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals.\n\nA new study has prompted more concerns. When researchers analysed the responses to more than 50,000 health-related searches in Germany to see which sources AI Overviews rely on most, one result stood out immediately. The single most cited domain was YouTube.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg, board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nIn medicine, it is not only where answers come from that matter, or their level of accuracy, but how they are presented to users, experts say. “With AI Overviews, users no longer encounter a range of sources that they can compare and critically assess,” says Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher in AI, health and law at the University of Basel. “Instead, they are presented with a single, confident, AI-generated answer that exhibits medical authority.\n\n“This means that the system does not merely reflect health information online, but actively restructures it. When that response is built on sources never designed to meet medical standards, such as YouTube videos, this creates a new form of unregulated medical authority online.”\n\nGoogle says AI Overviews are built to surface information backed up by top web results, and include links to web content that supports the information presented in the summary. People can use these links to dig deeper on a topic, the company told the Guardian.\n\nBut the single blocks of text in AI Overviews, combining health information from multiple sources, can cause confusion, says Nicole Gross, an associate professor in business and society at the National College of Ireland.\n\n“Once the AI summary appears, users are much less likely to research further, which means that they are deprived of the opportunity to critically evaluate and compare information, or even deploy their common sense when it comes to health-related issues.”\n\nExperts have raised other concerns with the Guardian. Even if and when AI Overviews do provide accurate facts about a specific medical topic, they may not distinguish between strong evidence from randomised trials and weaker evidence from observational studies, they say. Some also miss important caveats about that evidence, they add.\n\nHaving such claims listed next to one another in an AI Overview may also give the impression that some are better established than they really are. Answers can also change as AI Overviews evolve, even when the science hasn’t shifted. “That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough,” says Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity.\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that links included in AI Overviews were dynamic and changed based on the information that was most relevant, helpful and timely for a given search. If AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed some context, the company would use these errors to improve its systems, and also take action when appropriate, it said.\n\nThe biggest worry is that bogus and dangerous medical information or advice in AI Overviews “ends up getting translated into the everyday practices, routines and life of a patient, even in adapted forms”, says Gross. “In healthcare, this can turn into a matter of life and death.”",

    "fullText": "Second one-day international, R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo\n\nSri Lanka 219 (49.3 overs): Asalanka 45 (64); Root 2-13, Overton 2-21\n\nEngland 223-5 (46.2 overs): Root 75 (90), Brook 42 (75); De Silva 2-37\n\nEngland won by five wickets; Series level at 1-1\n\nJoe Root made a measured 75 as England pulled off a comfortable run chase to beat Sri Lanka by five wickets in the second one-day international to square the three-match series.\n\nSri Lanka posted a relatively modest 219 after England's spinners had turned the screw on a surface which offered appreciable turn.\n\nCharith Asalanka top-scored for Sri Lanka, striking just one boundary in his 64-ball 45, while Dhananjaya de Silva chipped in with 40 on a day where strike-rates were largely an afterthought.\n\nVeteran leg-spinner Adil Rashid bowled the most impressively for England as he finished with economical figures of 2-34 from his 10 overs while Root's two overs at the end yielded 2-13.\n\nRoot's patience at the crease, deft footwork and reading of spin made him the linchpin of England's chase and once he settled in, Sri Lanka found it difficult to know where to bowl to him.\n\nEngland's all-time leading Test run-scorer shared stands of 68 with Ben Duckett, who made 39, and 81 with fellow Yorkshireman Harry Brook which broke the back of the reply.\n\nRoot's innings had been chanceless until a yorker from Asitha Fernando hit him on the pad as he attempted to flick the ball off his toes.\n\nHe reviewed the decision to give him out lbw, but the ball-tracking technology came down in Sri Lanka's favour and he was out on umpire's call.\n\nThat left Brook and Jos Buttler to get the 42 runs required and nerves probably jangled when the England skipper misjudged a sweep on 42 and was lbw to Jeffrey Vandersay.\n\nBut Buttler (33* off 21 balls) put his foot on the accelerator to get England over the line with 22 balls to spare to wrap up their first win in 12 ODIs away from home.\n\nBrook criticises 'worst ever' pitch after ODI win\n\nEngland level ODI series against Sri Lanka - as it happened\n\nWith opener Zak Crawley absent with a knee injury, England experimented with Rehan Ahmed at the top of the order.\n\nIt was not without precedent in domestic cricket. In his sole T20 innings in the role he made 49 runs off 32 balls, while his first-class record is reasonable. In four innings, he has 203 runs at an average of 67.7 with one century and one half-century.\n\nAhmed looked relatively composed in Colombo but whether 13 off 18 balls has done enough to persuade England coach Brendon McCullum it is an experiment worth persisting with remains to be seen.\n\nDuckett still looked like a man trying to find his way back into form during an unconvincing innings off 52 balls.\n\nBut it was Root, like that favoured old pair of slippers or warm winter jumper, who provided the reassuring comfort in England's middle order as he crafted a peerless knock.\n\nThere were some fluent strokes to the boundary for four but he eschewed the flamboyant during a more a familiar tale of accumulation - just as it has been for most of his career.\n\nOver the course of this innings, Root went past 3,500 runs in singles in ODI cricket. His non-boundary strike-rate of 59.95 is actually the best for any batter in ODI history.\n\nOn this metric, Root sits above two ODI greats in AB de Villiers (59.23) and Virat Kohli (58.10).\n\nThose low-risk dabs and flicks, nudges and nurdles, were valuable to England on a pitch which required a batter to play the percentages.\n\nRoot once again shows no signs of stopping. Appreciate him while he's doing his thing.\n\nMost of the spin from England during the Ashes came via their off-the-field briefings as they attempted to massage the narrative of a winter tour of discontent.\n\nOn a pitch which ragged at the R Premadasa Stadium, however, it was the degrees of turn offered by the ball which provided the focus on this occasion.\n\nIn ODIs since the start of 2024, this stadium has seen an average turn of 2.93 degrees. In the 23 bowling innings here in this timeframe, England's degree of turn today was the fourth-most at this venue.\n\nEngland managed 3.15 degrees of spin in the first ODI but it was 3.62 here - a 15% increase - which Brook, to his credit, astutely realised was the best way to winkle wickets.\n\nThere were 40.3 overs bowled by spinners which was the most by any England bowling attack in an ODI. The previous record was 36 overs, back in March 1985 in a 50-over match against Pakistan in Sharjah.\n\nIt was also the first time in an ODI England have used six different spinners.\n\nRashid's leg-breaks were the most masterful as he finished with an economy of 3.40 claiming the key top-order wickets of Sri Lanka opener Pathum Nissanka and captain Asalanka.\n\nBut he was well supported by a phalanx of twirlers - offies from Will Jacks and Root, leggies from Ahmed plus Jacob Bethell's left-arm orthodox.\n\nFive different spinners picked up a wicket - the joint-most in an ODI innings by a team and first by England.\n\nThe seven wickets which fell to spin was the second most by an England attack in an ODI, bettered only by eight against West Indies at North Sound in 2014.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Brenna Huckaby lost her leg to cancer when she was 14 years old. Then she discovered snowboarding, and it opened her entire world.",
    "fullText": "If we could ski down a mountain, then when we got home, we were able to conquer everyday life things.\n\nAt the time, Brenna Huckaby didn’t fully realize what the idea behind that rehabilitative trip to Utah would mean to her.\n\nShe had been diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, and lost her right leg at 14. To that point, conquering everyday things had meant wearing her prosthetic leg consistently.\n\nBut the trip, sponsored by her hospital, which sent Huckaby and kids who lost mobility from osteosarcoma to the slopes, opened up her world.\n\n\"I fell in love with it immediately,\" she tells USA TODAY Sports. \"It was the first sport that I had found just not only (an) incredible challenge, but also this fear and this knowing that I could do it, and I wanted to do it.\"\n\nHuckaby, now 30, became an American Paralympic snowboarder who will once again be competing at the Olympics, this time at Milano Cortina. She won gold and bronze at Beijing in 2022.\n\nHave you ever taken the time to think about what sports, especially your favorite sport, means to you?\n\nWe caught up with Huckaby, who would also become the first Paralympian to appear in the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated and is now a sports mom, about how sports can give us the confidence to take on life’s biggest challenges.\n\nIf we set a goal, and we push ourselves, we can reap their benefits at no matter what level we achieve.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nHuckaby spoke to USA TODAY Sports on behalf of Hershey’s for the “It’s Your Happy Place” campaign. Athletes partnered with the chocolate and candy company to showcase how happiness is not only found in winning, but sweet, everyday moments.\n\nThose moments, she says, \"don’t have to be big and explosive.\" The small ones can matter the most.\n\n\"I feel like that's been my main focus the last eight years,\" she says. \"How can I enjoy the process, enjoy the journey, not just the destination? And I feel like that's way easier said than done. I've learned that taking time to pause, to slow down, to be in the moment, that's how I have found happiness, presence, gratitude, all the things that make me feel good. It’s been in those tiny moments throughout the day.\"\n\nAs young athletes (and parents), if we take the time to reflect on what we’re doing as we race to our different sports events, we can improve our awareness. Huckaby’s sport, she says, is mostly mental, and that part of her game helps her push through the excruciatingly physical parts.\n\n\"I feel like I don't make progress and grow unless I am mentally present and in a good headspace to learn,\" she says.  \"I would say the sooner that you can take moments to reflect on – whether it's your training in the gym or a practice that you had – what was hard, what was good, what do you want to improve on, and what did it teach you about yourself? When you can start practicing that, it makes the things that you've learned so much easier.\n\n\"Then you're able to see those moments of growth and (be) like, 'Wow, like I'm so glad that I learned that. And I'm so glad I pushed through that because I've got this thing that I'm dealing with at home and I know that I can take the mindsets from sport and apply it here.'\"\n\nReflection has helped Huckaby realize she performs her best when she’s calm. She works with a sports psychologist to help her channel her strength to high stakes situations.\n\nDo you remember the instance where you either discovered your favorite sport or realized it was the one you love most?\n\nHuckaby, who has two older brothers (Jordan and Jeremy), loved to jump around as a little girl. Jeremy, her middle brother, and her parents were really into martial arts, which she tried. Her instructor pulled her parents (Jeff and Kristie) aside and told them, \"You need to put her in gymnastics.\"\n\n\"What I loved the most was learning how to do flips in the gym and that's what my martial arts teachers would just teach me because that was all I could stay focused for,\" she says. \"So my parents listened and also they were tired of me doing cartwheels in the house and stuff, and they thought it was a way to save their TV.\"\n\nHuckaby's cancer, which led to the amputation, ended her gymnastics career. But, Huckaby says, she thought about how she loved moving her body and chasing adrenaline.\n\n\"When snowboarding came to me, 'I was like, this is it,'\" Huckaby says.\n\nShe moved to Utah, about a year after the hospital-led trip with her mom, who worked as a nurse there. The rest of the family stayed at their home in Louisiana, and Kristie moved back home when her daughter graduated high school.\n\n\"It gave me opportunity to just heal from cancer through snowboarding,\" Huckaby says. \"Sports (is) such a great way to understand life in the way that it challenges you and the way that you intimately get to know who you are.\n\n\"You gain so much confidence in your body and what your body's capable of. So during cancer, I never really questioned that I could handle it. I put myself in extreme situations through gymnastics training that I knew that I could handle what was to come.\n\n\"I think now as I've been doing this at a professional level for so long, I've learned, 'How do I put that more into my everyday life so that I'm not just an athlete?'\"\n\nHuckaby says she doesn’t so much balance her life, but embraces what’s important to her through every season.\n\nWhen she’s home, she trains vigorously but finds family time every day with her husband, Tristan Klegg, and young school-aged daughters, Lilah and Sloan. Klegg, a former snowboard cross athlete, realizes he sometimes needs to be at home with the girls at times over being with his wife. But they interact daily.\n\n\"He takes care of our kids while I'm away and when I'm training and (is) such a big support, making sure that we win, right?\" she says. \"It's a team effort for sure.\n\n\"I'm in the gym in the offseason three to five days a week,\" she says, \"and I say three to five because we're human. It's life, you know? So the ideal, the perfect, is five. The reality is usually three, and during that period, you're going really hard. And so those off days are really important. And then between snowboard season and gym season, we have two weeks off. We are encouraged to have fun and move our body in ways that feel good, but it doesn't have to be intense. It's just, 'Take time off.'\n\n“And then I usually give myself a fall break. I know that it's good for my mental health. So usually as Halloween starts rolling around, I'm less intense and then I crank back up (in) November, and then most of December and then (the) holidays, I give myself permission to just chill. Because I know it's about to get serious after Christmas.\n\n\"It's (about) finding a rhythm, but I absolutely rest.\"\n\nLilah and Sloan, Huckaby’s daughters, like skateboarding, wakeboarding, wake surfing and other action sports near their home in Montana.\n\nLilah, her older daughter, has tried gymnastics and does aerial silks, which Huckaby describes as art-based body movements.\n\n\"We're active,\" she says. \"That's where we're trying to shine. I don't ever want them to think anything has just been given to me and easy. Of course, there are moments that it looks easy and it's because of all the decades of work that I've put in on my body and then my mind. And so things look like they come together naturally, but, I love the phrase, 'An overnight success was not built overnight.' It was built, you know, a decade before, just quietly working.\n\n\"Like yesterday, I did not want to go to the gym. It was my third day of two-a-days and I was just like, 'I don't want to go.' And they saw that, and I got up and I went.\"\n\nBut Huckaby also never wants her daughters to think that she’s fearless. She has been scared many times, whether it's during training, free riding or competing.\n\n“But I'm brave, and I do it anyway, and I do it scared, and I trust my training, and I trust myself, and I hope that they learn to do that for themselves,\" she says.\n\nHuckaby was horrified, she says, when Sports Illustrated approached her to pose for its 2018 swimsuit edition. She thought she wasn’t confident enough to put herself out in the world in that way.\n\n\"Then I just thought about my 14-year-old self who had just lost her leg and was bald at the time and just felt unbeautiful and unworthy, and I remembered that she deserved to be represented in a way that she wanted to, and to be seen as someone who could be beautiful and could be lovable. And so I wanted to give that to her, and I'm so proud of myself for doing that.\"\n\nIn a similar way, we sometimes have to put ourselves, or our kids, out there for our first big competition. It’s a risk, for sure, but then that rush of adrenaline can come, the one you only get from sports.\n\n\"Bet on yourself,\" Huckaby says, \"because you're worth investing in. If you want it, go for it. If you feel like you have what it takes and you love what you're doing, go out there and give yourself the time to do it and the opportunity to do it because that's what matters more than when you got into your sport. It’s never too late.\"\n\nWe don’t need to have it all figured out. We might just need more perspective on what we’re doing, and what we’re spending.\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "description": "The International Football Association Board plan to introduce a couple of major refereeing changes at this summer’s World Cup, according to a report.Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty ImagesThe Internatio...",
    "fullText": "The International Football Association Board (IFAB) held their annual business meeting earlier this week, and they approved a few ideas for implementation at the World Cup this summer.\n\nMany of the changes focus on timewasting, with the BBC reporting that IFAB plan to introduce a countdown for goal-kicks and throw-ins, similar to the countdown that currently exists when goalkeepers have the ball in their hands.\n\nJust like with the current rule, if a player fails to put the ball back into play before the countdown ends, possession will switch to the opponent. Goal-kicks will become corners, a throw-in for one team will become a throw-in for the other. But it’s unclear exactly how long the countdown will last.\n\nIn another rule change, substituted players must leave the pitch in 10 seconds, otherwise their replacement won’t be able to come on immediately and the team making the sub will have to temporarily play with 10 players.\n\nA third change is that players who leave the field with an injury will also have to stay off for an extended period. Again, it’s not yet clear exactly how long, with the Premier League currently requiring a 30-second absence and the MLS requiring two minutes.\n\nThe last major changes are to VAR. Firstly, all corners will be reviewed by VAR at the World Cup, with IFAB believing the checks will almost always be complete before the kick is taken.\n\nSecondly, VAR can overturn a second yellow card if one is clearly incorrectly awarded (but it can’t recommend giving a second yellow if the referee doesn’t award one on-field).\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case that all of these changes will make it into domestic football next season. The VAR system itself was introduced at the 2018 World Cup, but it wasn’t brought in by the Premier League until 2019/20.\n\nBut any changes that work well on football’s biggest stage will undoubtedly lead to calls for the Premier League to implement them too.",

    "title": "Genetic Data from over 20k U.S. Children Misused for 'Race Science'",
    "description": "The National Institutes of Health failed to protect brain scans that an international group of fringe researchers used to argue for the intellectual superiority of white people.",
    "fullText": "Genetic researchers were seeking children for an ambitious, federally funded project to track brain development — a study that they told families could yield invaluable discoveries about DNA’s impact on behavior and disease.\n\nThey also promised that the children’s sensitive data would be closely guarded in the decade-long study, which got underway in 2015. Promotional materials included a cartoon of a Black child saying it felt good knowing that “scientists are taking steps to keep my information safe.”\n\nThe scientists did not keep it safe.\n\nA group of fringe researchers thwarted safeguards at the National Institutes of Health and gained access to data from thousands of children. The researchers have used it to produce at least 16 papers purporting to find biological evidence for differences in intelligence between races, ranking ethnicities by I.Q. scores and suggesting Black people earn less because they are not very smart.\n\nMainstream geneticists have rejected their work as biased and unscientific. Yet by relying on genetic and other personal data from the prominent project, known as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, the researchers gave their theories an air of analytical rigor.\n\nMembers of the research group were ineligible to obtain data from the ABCD project. But one of them gained access through an American professor who was already being investigated by the N.I.H. over his handling of another child brain study.\n\nTheir papers have provided fodder for racist posts on social media and white nationalist message boards that have been viewed millions of times. Some of the papers are cited by A.I. bots like ChatGPT and Grok in response to queries about race and intelligence. On the social media platform X, Grok has referred users to the research more than two dozen times this month alone.\n\n“It’s evil,” said Dr. Terry L. Jernigan, national co-director of the ABCD Study and a neuropsychologist at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s not just that the science is faulty, but it’s being used to advance an unethical agenda.”\n\nThe misuse of the children’s data has validated longstanding concerns that hundreds of thousands of Americans’ genetic information held by the N.I.H. could fall into the wrong hands. The agency grants widespread access to stimulate new medical discoveries. But critics say the N.I.H. has failed to address the risks that the data, even with personally identifiable details removed, could be misused in unethical research, for commercial purposes or by foreign adversaries.\n\nAt least 63 times since 2007, data from some of the 28 human genomic repositories that the N.I.H. controls was improperly released to researchers, used for unapproved purposes or made vulnerable to theft, according to government records reviewed by The New York Times. In dozens of cases, the N.I.H. suspended researchers’ access and demanded that compromised data be destroyed, but the agency relies heavily on good-faith pledges of compliance.\n\nThe misuse of the data for so-called race science is not the only example of a security failure involving the ABCD Study.\n\nThe Times learned that in 2024, the same data was improperly obtained by an unidentified researcher in China. The data is not allowed to be shared with people in adversarial countries that could use it for blackmail, spy recruitment or military purposes. But the researcher evaded that prohibition by faking an affiliation with an American university, according to a former N.I.H. official and Dr. Jernigan, who said the agency informed her of the incident.\n\nThere has been no official public accounting of how the N.I.H. lost control of the children’s genetic information. The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2022 reported on the mishandling of data from another child brain study by the same American professor, Bryan J. Pesta, who also obtained the ABCD information. But details about the subsequent loss and abuse of the ABCD data have not been previously reported.\n\nToday, the data continues to be twisted to advance an ideological agenda.\n\nWhen Elon Musk invited X users last June to post politically incorrect “divisive facts” on the social network, one of Dr. Pesta’s collaborators — Jordan Lasker, who often writes about race and intelligence under the name Crémieux — replied with a criticism of affirmative action and said white people had bigger brains than Black people. The post, viewed 670,000 times, included a chart that purported to support his claim about brain size and cited the ABCD Study as its data source.\n\nThe conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza said on X in 2023 that studies showed that Black people, “who are the rock-solid base of the Democratic Party, have the lowest IQ of any ethnic group.” As evidence, he reposted another chart by Mr. Lasker based on ABCD data about American 10-year-olds.\n\nScientists said the unauthorized use of the data underscored the need for stronger controls. Several families in the ABCD Study said in interviews that they were not told about the misuse of the information and never would have agreed to participate had they known it could be used to promote racial division.\n\nKevin Bird, a geneticist who complained to the N.I.H. about Dr. Pesta, said the data was made vulnerable because “our scientific institutions sort of assume good faith in people.”\n\n“There needs to be an acknowledgment that there are bad-faith researchers,” he said. “The rules and regulations need to catch up with that.”\n\nIn a statement, Lyric Jorgenson, associate director of science policy at the N.I.H., said the agency had taken steps to protect the ABCD Study. It has introduced a new online portal requiring users to complete training on responsible data use and to “pass a knowledge test prior to accessing the data.”\n\nIn response to the fraudulent access by a Chinese researcher, she said, the N.I.H. “made enhancements that will prevent this type of incident” from happening again.\n\n“N.I.H. has a longstanding commitment to make the results of N.I.H.-funded research available,” she said, noting that it has approved more than 92,000 access requests since 2007. “At the same time, N.I.H. takes the protection of all human data very seriously and has numerous safeguards in place.”\n\nBut the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, reported last April that the N.I.H. did not have the resources to properly monitor all the downloads of genetic data and “may be missing violations that go unreported by researchers.”\n\nThe data that Dr. Pesta obtained came from two studies. In the nationwide ABCD Study, more than 11,000 children underwent regular M.R.I.s and clinical tests and had DNA samples taken from their blood or saliva. In a separate study, known as the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania collected similar information from about 9,500 children.\n\nData from the projects has generated hundreds of papers on, among other things, the effects of social media on mental health, genetic links to addiction and the causes of sleep disorders.\n\nThe data is maintained by the N.I.H. To gain access, researchers must be tenure-track professors or senior scientists with authorization from their institutions. They also must detail what they plan to do with the information. The N.I.H. can reject proposals that fall outside its guidelines.\n\nThe agency discourages “stigmatizing research” that could promote “negative stereotypes” or cause “social detriment.” That is, in part, a nod to eugenics, a discredited field of research asserting that certain races, usually white Europeans, are genetically superior. Such ideas — and the pseudoscientific studies that support them — have been used to justify violence, including by the gunman who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo in 2022.\n\nIn April 2018, Dr. Pesta, who at the time was a management professor at Cleveland State University, submitted a proposal to the N.I.H. He said he was researching differences in brain size and cognitive abilities in men and women and wanted access to data from the Philadelphia study.\n\nEmails unearthed in a lawsuit that Dr. Pesta later brought against the university show that he had been working with a group of race researchers who coached him on how to apply for access. One of them was John G.R. Fuerst, a graduate student from North Carolina. In a March 2018 email, he told Dr. Pesta that focusing on gender differences would be “a sneaky way” to get the data to also study disparities in intelligence between races — a topic the group believed the N.I.H. would not greenlight.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nThough Dr. Pesta later submitted updates on further research he wanted to do, none explicitly described the group’s true intentions, according to court records. The legal filings also show that another group member, Emil O.W. Kirkegaard, a right-wing blogger in Denmark, suggested Dr. Pesta submit misleading proposals to gain access to additional data sets.\n\n“I reckon that if we mask the nature of the study with usual medical terms, one can ‘get away with’ a lot,” Mr. Kirkegaard wrote in an email. “Getting samples for analyses that one doesn’t publish (to preserve your reputation!) are still useful because they allow us to validate our beliefs privately.”\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Pesta denied misleading the N.I.H. and defended his work. “I am not a eugenicist,” he said.\n\nDr. Pesta’s collaborators had a history of scrounging for data to support their fringe theories and of using unreliable methodologies.\n\nIn a 2023 paper, Mr. Fuerst tried to rank the intelligence of children across ethnic groups. But the sample size for the vast majority of groups was far too small to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\nEthnic/National group N ▼ Black African 59 Asian Indian 53 Other Asian 52 Black Caribbean 51 Filipino 51 N. Africa & Mid. East 47 White & Asian Indian 44 Native American 39 Dominican 38 Korean & Japanese 33 Other Cuban 30 White & Pacific Islander 25 Vietnamese 24 Pacific Islander 17\n\nThe paper also invented a category, “USA Black,” excluding Black children with Hispanic or white heritage and an immigrant parent or grandparent. Furthermore, the race of participants was self-reported, a potentially inconsistent gauge of ancestry.\n\nEthnic/National group Definition Pacific Islander not Hispanic & not White & Pacific Islander USA Black not Hispanic & not White & Black & non-immigrant family Vietnamese not Hispanic & not White & Vietnamese\n\nMr. Kirkegaard has published dozens of pieces in Mankind Quarterly, a journal known for pushing race science. He has studied penis sizes by race and once looked for correlations between intelligence and first names, concluding that people with “non-western Muslim names” had lower I.Q.s. Authorities in Britain blocked Mr. Kirkegaard and his European colleagues from the country’s repository of genetic data because they were “not bona fide researchers,” The Guardian reported in 2024.\n\nAnother member of Dr. Pesta’s group was Mr. Lasker, whose frequent posts online mix data analysis with ideological barbs. He dismissed Supreme Court Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor as “clearly incompetent” affirmative-action hires. (During the campaign for New York City mayor, Mr. Lasker also shared hacked data with The Times showing that Zohran Mamdani had identified as “Black or African American” on a college application.)\n\nTo finance their research, Dr. Pesta and Mr. Fuerst, the North Carolina graduate student, set up a foundation that received tens of thousands of dollars from the Pioneer Fund, which has a history of promoting eugenics-related research and race science. The fund’s president at the time once wrote approvingly about the idea of “phasing out” incompetent cultures by withholding foreign aid and banning migrants “of low genetic quality.”\n\nThe N.I.H. approved Dr. Pesta’s access to the Philadelphia data, which he and Mr. Fuerst analyzed on a computer in Dr. Pesta’s home, according to a transcript of his interview with university investigators. Dr. Pesta also told them that he had uploaded the data, without N.I.H. approval, to a foreign DNA lab to try to determine the skin color of children in the study.\n\nIn August 2019, Dr. Pesta, Mr. Fuerst, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Lasker produced an analysis of the Philadelphia data. Their paper — which appeared in Psych, an online journal that Dr. Pesta edited — had nothing to do with gender differences and brain size, the topic for which Dr. Pesta had initially obtained the data. Instead, it declared that among people of mixed race, those with greater European ancestry were more intelligent, and that genes were probably the reason.\n\n“These results provide support for a hereditarian model,” they wrote.\n\nThe “hereditarian model” is the belief that intelligence is largely inherited and not a result of environmental factors. Race science broadens the theory across ancestral groups, asserting that people with a European background tend to perform better than African Americans on I.Q. tests because they are innately smarter, a view embraced by white supremacists.\n\nThis runs counter to the scientific consensus that any correlation between a complex trait like intelligence and genes, let alone social constructs like race, is not the same as causation.\n\nResearch has found that the environment in which people are raised can affect their cognitive abilities. In the United States, for example, any serious analysis must consider how Black people endured centuries of slavery and racial discrimination and how they today face disproportionately high poverty rates and a lack of quality education and health care.\n\nBut Dr. Pesta and his colleagues did not focus on that.\n\nThe authors of this paper admitted that the only socioeconomic information available in the Philadelphia data was the education levels of the children’s parents. Their study didn't consider factors like family income and employment that can affect racial I.Q. gaps.\n\n2.2. Parental Socioeconomic Status\n\nOnly paternal and maternal education were available to us as measures of SES. We coded parental education as the average of each, both z-scored first. When data were only available from one parent this value was used. The final score was then z-scored again.\n\nThe Philadelphia data did not include information on skin, eye or hair color of the children, so Dr. Pesta tried to predict those traits by uploading the genetic data to an unapproved, foreign DNA lab — contributing to sanctions against him from the N.I.H.\n\n2.5. Skin, Hair, and Eye Color\n\nThe data did not include measures of appearance, so we opted to impute these based on genotypes. We used the HIrisPlex-S web application to do this. This application was developed by the U.S. Department of Justice for use in forensic investigations. It imputes skin, hair, and eye color probabilities with a high degree of accuracy based on 41 SNPs (with overlapping variants; 6 for eye color, 22 for hair color, and 36 for skin color).\n\nDr. Pesta said in the interview that his research was scientifically sound and intended to improve the lives of Black people by determining the cause of I.Q. gaps. Because “I.Q. test scores strongly predict human well-being, and African Americans are on the short end of every well-being stick, I think it’s an important problem,” he said.\n\nMr. Fuerst, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Lasker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTheir 2019 paper caused a commotion, with scientists criticizing it for discounting possible nongenetic explanations for the I.Q. gap. Alexander Gusev, a geneticist at Harvard University who has written about the “weaponization of genomic data,” said such an approach was “playacting at doing science.”\n\n“The goal seems to be just to dig through the data and find something that matches a hypothesis about some difference in African Americans versus whites, and then report it without seriously considering any possible caveats,” he said.\n\nDr. Hakon Hakonarson, a geneticist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, was the co-leader of the study whose data Dr. Pesta used. When the N.I.H. informed him of Dr. Pesta’s paper, Dr. Hakonarson was outraged, saying its conclusions were not supported by the underlying data.\n\n“It’s most unfortunate that the data you submit in good faith gets abused in this sort of way,” Dr. Hakonarson said.\n\nIn September 2019, a month after the paper’s publication, the N.I.H. ordered Dr. Pesta to “immediately cease all work” with the Philadelphia data and began an investigation into his use of it. But about a year later, while the agency was still investigating, it approved Dr. Pesta’s request for the ABCD data. (The N.I.H. did not respond to a question about why.)\n\nIn 2021, before Dr. Pesta published anything based on the ABCD Study, the N.I.H. accused him of misconduct with the Philadelphia data and suspended his access to its repositories for three years. It was the most severe penalty the agency had ever issued. Cleveland State fired him the following year.\n\nDr. Pesta told university investigators that he had destroyed the data as instructed by the N.I.H., but he could not say for certain whether Mr. Fuerst had made a copy from the computer in Dr. Pesta’s home. He said he had distanced himself from Mr. Fuerst, who had “gone a little bit rogue.”\n\nMr. Fuerst and his colleagues have continued to cite the ABCD data. In 2024, for example, they published a book that compiled many of their papers and mentioned the ABCD Study about 200 times. Mr. Fuerst’s co-authors have included other people ineligible to access the data, such as a professor at a state university in Russia and a freelance researcher in China who has publicly acknowledged having “no formal credentials” in intelligence research.\n\nThe papers provide fuel for more forays into race science. Invoking their own previous analyses of the child brain studies, Dr. Pesta, Mr. Kirkegaard and Mr. Fuerst have produced new papers suggesting that Black people earn less than white people because they are less intelligent.\n\nOne of those papers, in turn, was cited in a Substack article last April asserting that Black people’s supposed lack of intelligence was the source of the racial income gap. The article was picked up by an online magazine with tens of thousands of viewers.\n\nAnother paper, coauthored by Mr. Kirkegaard, was limited by what he acknowledged were small sample sizes and a lack of nongenetic data. Those shortcomings did not stop him from trumpeting the findings online as proof that “genetic ancestry, not social race, explains observed gaps in social status.”\n\nThe scientists leading the ABCD Study decided not to tell participants that their data had been misused for race research.\n\nParents and their children — who are now adults nearing the end of the decade-long study — reacted with surprise and dismay when The Times told them what had happened. They said they deserved to learn about it from the study’s organizers.\n\nScientists said they chose not to inform the families because they believed doing so could cause more harm than good.\n\n“We have struggled with the decision,” said Angela Laird at Florida International University, who helps run the ABCD Study in South Florida.\n\nMany of her study participants are Black and Hispanic and “are really the targets of these racist studies,” Dr. Laird said. “I do believe that if we sat our families down and read them the studies, they would be upset — and in many cases, that is likely an understatement.”\n\nThe organizers of the Philadelphia study didn’t tell families, either. Dr. Hakonarson said that because children’s identities weren’t disclosed, informing parents “was not something that was felt to be needed.”\n\nWhile some scientists have pushed the N.I.H. to limit how sensitive genetic data can be used in research, there is little indication the Trump administration agrees — and there are signs it is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nAdam Candeub, the top lawyer at the Federal Communications Commission, wrote a law review article in 2024 criticizing the N.I.H.’s discouragement of stigmatizing research. He compared it to the persecution of Galileo.\n\n“A liberal society should support the search for truth,” Mr. Candeub wrote, “regardless of how uncomfortable and unsettling that truth turns out to be.”\n\nDr. Pesta has claimed that he faced such persecution. He sued Cleveland State for wrongful termination, saying he was a victim of cancel culture. A federal judge dismissed his lawsuit. He ruled that Dr. Pesta was fired “because of his own misconduct” with the restricted data, not the content of his research. A federal appeals court affirmed the decision in November.\n\nStill, Dr. Pesta and his fellow race researchers have reason for optimism. The pendulum of public policy, Dr. Pesta said, “is swinging in terms of acceptance of even asking the questions.”\n\nA few days after President Trump won the 2024 election, Mr. Kirkegaard happily noted on his website that incoming Vice President JD Vance followed compatriots like Mr. Lasker on social media. His post featured an image of a red “Make Science Great Again” hat.\n\nWithin weeks of Mr. Trump taking office, the N.I.H. made a little-noticed revision to the guidelines on access to a large genetic database. Its description of what constituted stigmatizing research no longer included any reference to skin color, ancestry and ethnicity.\n\nProduced by Tina Zhou and Rumsey Taylor.",

    "description": "The partnership with the tech giant speaks to a push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind",
    "fullText": "Partnership with tech giant speaks to push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind\n\nIn this World Cup year, Fifa has come out of the blocks quickly. In the past few weeks any number of initiatives have been announced or activated, from a data partnership with Opta to facilitate more betting, to the Fifa Pass for speeding up visa applications for the US this summer, to the unveiling of the official Lego World Cup trophy. Among the ever-expanding list is an intriguing deal with TikTok, a partnership that will give digital creators front-row seats at the 104-match tournament.\n\nIn Fifa language its partnership with the short-form video platform will make “the most inclusive event in football history … even more accessible”. According to TikTok’s global head of content, James Stafford, it will bring fans “closer to the action in ways they can’t get anywhere else”. It plans to do so by granting an unspecified number of online personalities behind-the-scenes access, giving them archive and highlights footage to use in their content and, in return, requesting an avalanche of posts that will make the World Cup inescapable for TikTok users.\n\nIn choosing TikTok as its preferred platform Fifa is catching up with the times. The use of creators, also known as influencers, is increasingly essential for any consumer business. The NFL has integrated creators (quick definition: online personalities who make their living from posting on social media) into coverage of the Super Bowl since the turn of the decade. But the full possibilities of the creator economy are only beginning to be explored by sports organisations.\n\nLast summer the streaming company Dazn built its own creator network for Fifa’s Club World Cup. It enlisted as many as 50 creators to post videos that built excitement around the event, be they behind-the-scenes tours, interviews with players and coaches or stunts such as racing to see who could make it to the Chelsea v Palmeiras game on time.\n\n“It was a new tournament and we wanted to hit every lever we possibly could to generate awareness in as many places as possible, particularly with a younger audience,” says Joe Caporoso, the president of Team Whistle, a Dazn-owned company that specialises in digital strategy. “We searched through people who had strong organic followings on places like Instagram and TikTok, and who had a history of a high volume of posting consistency around not just the sport of soccer, but also the culture of it. We wanted to make sure we had people and creators who spoke authentically and were not shy about showing everything that goes on around the game.”\n\nFrom there, Caporoso’s team laid out a campaign that defined the amount of content creators were expected to generate. A group of editors and content programmers made sure each post was optimised for maximum exposure and liaised with creators to make sure no potential talking point or key moment was missed. Dazn and Whistle tracked the performance of each post, monitored the traffic that went back to Dazn’s coverage, and discussed the outcomes with TikTok.\n\nThis is a degree of oversight materially higher than that of, say, the BBC over Gary Lineker at the last European Championship. It gives a clue to one reason why creators are coming to the fore in sports coverage. Not only are they generally younger, part of a demographic sports leaders are anxious to attract, not only are they trusted by their audience due to a perceived authenticity, but creators are comfortable working in a media environment where the demands of the client come first. Their productivity can be off the charts. They perform, they shoot, they edit, they strike promotional deals, they post regularly and often. They are, in Caporoso’s words, “one-person companies”.\n\nTikTok says the Club World Cup creator platform drove more than 500,000 fans to Dazn’s service and that 90% of fans take “at least one off-platform action” after viewing sports content on their app. Fifa says its creator platform is designed for similar purposes, such as directing new viewers to its match coverage, but it could perform other functions too. It could be a new revenue stream, for example, with Fifa taking a cut from the advertising revenue generated on TikTok through the deal. It could be a way of expanding the reach of sponsorship deals Fifa has elsewhere. It establishes a relationship with a tech giant who may yet be tempted into paying for broadcast rights more broadly. Finally, the new platform could also provide a means for shaping the way the World Cup is talked about.\n\nInstead of allowing the post-match debate or attention between matchdays to be channeled by media companies, a creator platform deal keeps sports organisers in the conversation. “It’s a way for them to become a partner and to have their say, a bit of their say, in how their material is presented on second screens,” says François Godard of the media research company Enders Analysis. Creators offer the possibility of drumming up enthusiasm should interest begin to wane, but also keeping discussion away from topics that might be problematic. When Dazn secured an interview with Donald Trump before the Club World Cup final, it asked Emily Austin, from its roster of creators, to conduct it. A Maga enthusiast and marketer of Trump Derangement Syndrome merchandise, she flattered the US president and Fifa while celebrating the success of the tournament.\n\nCreators present an efficient and effective way of reaching audiences with a defined message. Godard, however, is sceptical of how useful they might be in driving audience growth for sport. “In our data, we see that the viewership of traditional TV by the 16-to-34 age group has collapsed over the past 10 years, but not in sports,” he says. “That’s because sports is unique. It’s live, and there’s no alternative.”\n\nReports in the US have suggested the picture is complicated somewhat by traditional broadcasters having acquired the rights Fifa wants to share with influencers. According to the publication Puck, TikTok would need a sublicensing deal with the broadcaster Fox, an arrangement yet to be struck. In the UK the BBC and ITV jointly hold rights to linear and digital broadcasts. The BBC said it would not comment on rights negotiations.\n\nGodard believes that instead the platform is a play to develop new places where Fifa may ultimately sell its rights, even as it extends the offering on its Fifa+ broadcast platform (thanks to a new deal with Dazn). Whatever the outcome, it may be just that creators have the power to disrupt the media environment that has made Fifa decide to embrace them.",

    "description": "An analysis of long-run performance for the GTP challengers ahead of the 2026 Rolex 24 at Daytona International Speedway",
    "fullText": "After three practice sessions at the Rolex 24, the world looks very different at the start of the 2026 IMSA SportsCar Championship season than it did last weekend at the \"Roar\" pre-season test. There are new favorites in both the GTP and GTD Pro classes.\n\nAs with the Roar, we analyzed all times in the GTP class that were under 1:40 minutes and calculated the average. It should be noted that there have been no changes to the Balance of Performance (BoP) since the pre-test.\n\nTake a look at the following individual results for the three free practice sessions:\n\nThe result of the third free practice session in particular should be treated with caution, as there were three interruptions with red flags.\n\nLet's now look at all three sessions combined. If we take all laps under 1:40 minutes and calculate the average, we get the following order:\n\n1. MSR-Acura #60 - 1:37.530 (43 laps under 1:40)\n\n2. AXR-Cadillac #31 - 1:37.812 (70)\n\n3. Penske-Porsche #6 - 1:37.838 (69)\n\n4. Penske-Porsche #7 - 1:37.848 (76)\n\n5. WTR-Cadillac #10 - 1:38.012 (68)\n\n6. WTR-Cadillac #40 - 1:38.031 (60)\n\n7. MSR-Acura #93 - 1:38.065 (53)\n\n9. JDC-Miller-Porsche #85 - 1:38.214 (84)\n\n10. WRT-BMW #25 - 1:38.261 (33)\n\n11. Thor-Aston-Martin #23 - 1:38.613 (52)\n\nThe Meyer Shank Acura #60 (Blomqvist/Braun/Dixon/Allmendinger) is suddenly the fastest car in the field by a relatively clear margin. Does that suddenly make Acura the favorite?\n\nRenger van der Zande from the sister #93 Acura firmly denies the narrative that they are the favorites: \"Honestly, not really. I think we have a very good car for qualifying. But I don't think we have the fastest car in the race, and that worries me. I think Cadillac and Porsche are in the best position. Hopefully I'm wrong.\"\n\nThe competition laughed at such statements. \"They're the world champions at playing down their chances,\" said one individual from the Porsche camp. And Cadillac also has the Honda luxury brand on its radar. On the other hand, Acura's argument is supported by the fact that both ARX-06s have completed comparatively few laps under 1:40 minutes.\n\nSpeaking of Cadillac: the Action Express Cadillac #31 (Aitken/Bamber/Vesti/Zilisch) finished just ahead of the two factory Porsches on average. The two Cadillac V-Series.R cars from Wayne Taylor Racing follow behind, while the Meyer-Shank Acura #93 (van der Zande/Yelloly/Palou/Ohta) fielded by HRC is likely to have completed a different program than the #60.\n\nBMW M Team WRT boss Vosse: ‘Give us time’ with IMSA program\n\nThere are worries at BMW. WRT's debut as a GTP team was marked by alarm for a long time. The car didn't make it into the window, the major aero update didn't seem to work properly, and the drivers were unhappy with the handling.\n\nBut in the very last practice session, a trick was pulled off that at least gives the WRT camp some hope. However, it is doubtful that this will be enough to close a gap of well over half a second.\n\nWRT is still enjoying support from the WEC crew on the operational side at the IMSA opener. This is only logical given the winter break in the world championship. WRT team boss Vincent Vosse asks for a little patience in an interview with Motorsport-Total.com:\n\n\"If you compare us to the US teams, we are complete rookies. We are starting from scratch. Of course, we bring experience [from the WEC] with us and have some new recruits in the team who were already active in IMSA last year. But all of that has to come together and work. This is our first race, so please give us some time.\"\n\nBut how much patience will BMW have? In the fourth year of the LMDh program, success is a must. \"The question is not how much time we need,\" Vosse interjects. \"The question is: 'What do we need?' And that's a multitude of things that also have to be brought together.\" Vosse knows what he's talking about; after all, WRT is the benchmark in GT3 racing.\n\nAnd Aston Martin? The situation has not improved since the pre-test. \"Daytona is a very special track. We can't take much from Le Mans either, because that's a special track in its own right.\"\n\nLet's take another look at the improvements compared to last week's pre-test.\n\n1. MSR-Acura #60 - 1.004 seconds faster than at the \"Roar\"\n\n9. Thor-Aston Martin #23 - 0.317\n\n10. JDC-Miller-Porsche #85 - 0.253\n\nOn average, the GTP cars improved by around four tenths of a second. Aston Martin only managed a jump of 0.317 seconds on average across all lap times under 1:40 minutes.\n\nThe improvement was also minimal for Porsche. All three 963s are below the median improvement. The biggest jump was made by the #6 Penske-Porsche (L. Vanthoor/Estre/Campbell) with 0.353 seconds.\n\nAt Cadillac, Action Express Racing improved significantly more than the two V-Series.R entries from Wayne Taylor Racing. However, Acura made the biggest leap. There could be many reasons for this from improvements in the setup to sandbagging in the pre-season test, or several other factors.\n\nThe race will be particularly exciting due to two factors that also interact with each other: the new Michelin tires and the weather.\n\nThe new generation of slicks with their spectacular appearance are said to impress above all with their improved warm-up behavior, but also bring improvements in terms of durability. Jack Aitken, who had put the #31 Cadillac on pole before being penalized, said when asked by Motorsport.com that the differences were not that great, at least in qualifying.\n\nThe weather forecast is spectacular with temperatures approaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit predicted for Sunday. Even for Florida, this is exceptionally high for January, and the race could be one of the warmest in history.\n\nThis means that the soft tires will only be used briefly during the night, if at all. Michelin has allowed a window from 5 p.m. to 10 a.m. for the use of soft tires, which is larger than in previous years. But the temperatures significantly narrow this window.\n\nAnd this is where Acura's concern comes into play. Van der Zande: \"We tend to put a little more strain on the tires than Porsche and Cadillac when accelerating out of hairpin turns. That makes it more difficult for us in longer stints.\" And high temperatures don't help either. But a yellow phase in the last hour might...\"\n\nRexy vs. Grello: The Porsche icons prepare to face off in Rolex 24\n\n2016 Rolex 24: Remembering the thrilling Corvette photo finish\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump gives. And he takes away.\n\nOffended by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's increasingly assertive posture toward the U.S., Trump revoked an invitation to join his Board of Peace. Many Western allies are suspicious of the organization, which is chaired by Trump and was initially formed to focus on maintaining the ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas but has grown into something skeptics fear could rival the United Nations.\n\nAppearing at the World Economic Forum, Trump spoke of imposing tariffs on Switzerland — which he ultimately lowered — because the country's leader “rubbed me the wrong way” during a phone call. Before shelving sweeping tariffs on multiple European countries, Trump pressed Denmark to “say yes” to the U.S. push to control Greenland “and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember,” he said, imperiling the NATO alliance.\n\nOver his decades in public life, Trump has never been one for niceties. But even by his standards, the tumult of the past week stood out because it crystallized his determination to erase the rules-based order that has governed U.S. foreign policy — and by extension most of the Western world — since World War II.\n\nThe president and his supporters have dismissed that approach as inefficient, overly focused on compromise and unresponsive to the needs of people contending with rapid economic change. But in its place, Trump is advancing a system that is poorly understood and could prove far less stable, driven by the whims of a single, often mercurial, leader who regularly demonstrates that personal flattery or animus can shape his decisions.\n\nReturning to the U.S. from Davos, home to the World Economic Forum, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said the phrase she heard “over and over” was that “we are entering this new world order” as she described a sense of confusion among allies.\n\n“It may be you just had a bad telephone call with the president and now you're going to have tariffs directed at you,” she told reporters. “This lack of stability and reliability, I think, is causing what were traditionally reliable trade partners to be saying to other countries, ‘Hey, maybe you and I should talk because I’m not sure about what’s going on with the United States.’”\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing is hardly surprising for someone who accepted his first Republican presidential nomination in 2016 by declaring that “I alone can fix” the nation's problems. As he settles into his second term with a far more confident demeanor than his first, he has delighted supporters with his to-the-victor -goes-the-spoils style.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former adviser, recently told the Atlantic that Trump is pursuing a “maximalist strategy” and that he must keep going “until you meet resistance.”\n\n“And we haven’t met any resistance,” Bannon said.\n\nThat's certainly true in Washington, where the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to check Trump's impulses. But leaders of other countries, who have spent much of Trump's administration trying to find ways to work with him, are increasingly vocal.\n\nCarney is quickly emerging as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. Speaking in Davos ahead of Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.”\n\n“In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: to compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact,” he continued. “We should not allow the rise of hard powers to blind us to the fact that the power of legitimacy, integrity, and rules will remain strong — if we choose to wield it together.”\n\nTrump did not take kindly to those remarks, responding with threats in Davos before yanking the Board of Peace invitation.\n\n“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump said. “Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nCarney, however, was unbowed, speaking of Canada as “an example to a world at sea” as he crafted a potential template for other world leaders navigating a new era.\n\n“We can show that another way is possible, that the arc of history isn’t destined to be warped toward authoritarianism and exclusion,” he said in a speech before a cabinet retreat in Quebec City.\n\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer blasted Trump on Friday for “insulting and frankly appalling” comments in which he expressed doubt that NATO would support the U.S. if requested. The president seemingly ignored that the only time Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty, which requires all member countries to help another member under threat, was invoked was after the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.\n\nReferring to non-US troops, Trump told Fox Business Network, “You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that, and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.”\n\nStarmer, noting the 457 British personnel who died and those with life-long injuries, said he will “never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country.” Denmark, which Trump has belittled as “ungrateful” for U.S. protection during World War II, had the highest per capita death toll among coalition forces in Afghanistan.\n\nHis tactics have raised fears that Trump is imposing long-term damage on the U.S. standing in the world and encouraging countries to rethink their alliances and deepen their ties with China. Carney already traveled there earlier this month to meet with President Xi Jinping.\n\n“China’s leadership watched an American president fight with allies, insult world leaders, and engage in bizarre antics, and thought to themselves — this is nothing but good for us,” Jake Sullivan, former President Joe Biden's national security adviser, said in an email.\n\nThe administration is showing no sign of backing down. In a social media post referring to Canada's ties with Beijing, Trump said China “will eat them up.” And the Pentagon released a defense strategy late Friday telling allies to handle their own security.\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, was in Davos and participated in a bipartisan delegation to Denmark with Murkowski that was intended to show unity amid Trump's bid for Greenland. Recalling his conversations with other leaders, he told reporters on Friday that Trump has shown he only backs down when countries like China “showed toughness and a resiliency.”\n\n“Those who were accommodating and who negotiated in good faith, like the EU, which did not impose retaliatory tariffs, seemed to have not won any of his respect,” Coons said. “They can reach their own conclusions, but it would seem to me that trying to find a way to accommodate him when the foundation of his demands about Greenland is unhinged … seem to me to suggest a course of action.”",

    "fullText": "The world of football witnessed another curious episode last Thursday (22).\n\nCoach Lúcio Flávio, who had arrived at Goiatuba with hopes of reviving the team in the 2026 Campeonato Goiano, requested to leave the club after leading the squad for just one round (four days of work).\n\nThe 46-year-old coach released a video announcing his departure and stating that he had accepted a new job offer — he was announced at Uberlândia, in Minas Gerais.\n\nA former midfielder who emerged at Paraná in the late 1990s, Lúcio Flávio played for major clubs in Brazilian football, such as Internacional, São Paulo, Coritiba, Atlético-MG, Vitória, and Santos.\n\nHowever, the club with which he is most closely identified is Botafogo, where he played between 2007 and 2008 and then again from 2009 to 2010.\n\nRetired from the pitch since 2017, Lúcio Flávio began his coaching career as an assistant at Paraná the following year.\n\nHe later served as assistant and interim coach at Botafogo between 2020 and 2023. The young coach also had stints at Aparecidense, São Joseense, and Brasiliense before arriving at Goiatuba at the start of the Goianão.\n\nAt Goiatuba, the team’s situation in the 2026 Campeonato Goiano was already difficult before Lúcio Flávio’s arrival.\n\nThe “Azulão do Sul” started the state championship with another coach, Augusto Fassina, who was dismissed after three winless matches.\n\nLúcio Flávio led the team in just one match, and with only one point on the table, the club remains at the bottom of the competition. The team still has four games ahead to try to escape relegation and dream of a spot among the top eight in the state championship.\n\nMeanwhile, Uberlândia is also going through a tough time. Before the coach’s arrival, the “Verdão” had two losses and two draws in four matches, sitting at the bottom of Group A in the Campeonato Mineiro.\n\nIn four games, the team has yet to win, suffered a 5-0 thrashing by Cruzeiro, and faces challenges ahead as they try to climb out of last place in their group in the state championship.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Trinity Rodman has been called a generational talent. Not necessarily because she is the best in the world — three-time Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmati is still at the top of that list — but because of what she offers as a whole.\n\nFrom her signature, defense-splitting “Trin Spin” move on the field to her entertaining and profitable presence off it, keeping Rodman in the National Women’s Soccer League was so crucial to the current trajectory of women’s soccer in America that the league changed its rules to ensure it happened.\n\nThe reality is that Rodman could have walked away. The 23-year-old’s previous contract with the Washington Spirit ended on Dec. 31. She had options from Europe, including from Chelsea, which has been willing to splash some cash on U.S. players. But she stuck it out with her team and her city, even after a previous agreement vetoed by the league sparked arguments about the NWSL’s salary-cap rules.\n\nRodman was rewarded for that loyalty with one of the biggest salaries in women’s soccer history. She will take home more than $2 million a year for the next three years, benefitting from a change in league rules to allow such spending.\n\n“Getting drafted here and developing and maturing and learning and failing at Spirit and in D.C., it’s become so much of my legacy and my story. But on top of that, I still feel like there’s so much more I have to give and so much more that I want to do,” Rodman said during her contract signing ceremony on Thursday.\n\nMany will claim credit for finally ending the mind-boggling saga around keeping the superstar in the league, but the rich soccer community in Washington, D.C., should not go overlooked. Thursday was a welcome reminder of the anomaly that is women’s soccer, where the love of the game can still sometimes outweigh balance sheets.\n\nOwner Michele Kang’s willingness to pay a player what she’s worth and Rodman’s persistence in demanding nothing less were only successful when paired with the growing relationship between the team and its fans.\n\nTo understand how that connection became so strong — and how it might be emulated elsewhere — you have to go back to the beginning.\n\nThe Spirit selected Rodman No. 2 in the 2021 draft. At the time, Kang, who now owns professional women’s teams on three continents, was only a minority investor. While there was plenty of excitement around the young prospect, whose surname was already synonymous with championships in another sport thanks to her father, soccer took a backseat to off-field issues months ahead of the postseason.\n\nIn September 2021, the Spirit fired head coach Richie Burke following allegations of emotional and verbal harassment. Shortly after, the Spirit had to forfeit two games for violating the league’s COVID-19 policy. Majority owner Steve Baldwin, who was accused of allowing Burke to quietly step away rather than force a more public vetting of the allegations surrounding his coach, battled with Kang for control of the team. Kang called for Baldwin to step down and sell his shares to her.\n\nWithout protection from the front office, the drama seeped into the players’ day-to-day work, and they eventually called for Baldwin to sell his stake in the team to Kang. Following the COVID forfeits, the team lost just twice in the last 13 games and won the club’s first NWSL Championship. Rodman, for her part, won rookie of the year.\n\nBaldwin eventually agreed to sell for $35 million, more than seven times the team’s valuation at the time. However, it wasn’t until March 30, 2022, that Kang was finally able to gain control of the club.\n\nLeaders such as midfielder Andi Sullivan and goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury, who consistently fielded questions about the off-field obstacles, are still key parts of the team’s leadership in 2026. That matters. The fans who stuck by the players matter, too.\n\nThe Spirit’s home, Audi Field, has earned the name “Rowdy Audi” after three seasons of record attendance, which reached an average of 10,866 in 2023, 13,940 in 2024 and 15,110 in 2025. With sellouts becoming commonplace, it’s easy to forget that before 2023, the Spirit spent many home games at small venues more than an hour outside the city, sometimes with less than 10,000-seat capacity.\n\n“The fan base, the stadium, you can’t (compare) — even other NWSL teams (don’t) get these amount of fans,” Rodman said. “I feel it, and you see it with all the interactions I have. I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”\n\nIn 2021, the players rallied around each other, and the fans rallied around the players. In 2025, that support has grown by the thousands. Rodman is without a doubt part of that growth, and she bears that responsibility openly.\n\nAfter the Spirit defeated Racing Louisville in the 2025 NWSL quarterfinals, Rodman sprinted to the wall of supporters to celebrate. It had been her first game back since a minor MCL sprain kept her out of the previous playoff match and regular-season finale. Likely to the dismay of a nearby athletic trainer, Rodman hopped into the stands alongside teammate Esme Morgan and waved the supporters’ massive flag to erupting cheers. She made a similar show of respect after the team’s semifinal win over the Portland Thorns, their final home game of the season. The win helped Washington reach its second final in as many years.\n\nThat moment illustrated the importance of the community the Spirit have created.\n\nFive years ago, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe were the names synonymous with soccer in America and women’s soccer as a whole. Now, Rodman has taken that crown, even if she spent much of last year sidelined by injuries. In all, she played 17 games and scored five goals. Yet when she came on the field in the NWSL Championship, PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. reached its loudest decibel level of the night.\n\nThe 23-year-old Olympic gold medalist has endured seven club coaches, multiple home venues and new ownership. Throughout it all, she’s helped build a soccer power.\n\nKang and other team executives made clear last Thursday how much those fans matter. They brought up an elementary school student and Spirit supporter named Emma to deliver Rodman’s new contract. Rodman embraced Emma — and her pink box braids that mirrored Rodman’s iconic look from the 2024 Olympics — and talked about how she wants to use her extended time with the Spirit to give back to the youth in D.C.\n\nCynically, it could be seen as a marketing move to sell more tickets. With private equity and skyrocketing valuations becoming a bigger part of the women’s game, not every gesture can be taken at face value. Kang, who owns London City Lioness in England and OL Lyonnes in France, is among the owners whose motives have been questioned. Women’s soccer has gone overlooked and mistreated for so long that scar tissue remains.\n\nHowever, Thursday showed what happens when the community aspect of women’s soccer is not just embraced, but invested in.\n\n“I can’t think about the Washington Spirit without her,” Kang said. “I hope she can’t think about her career without Washington Spirit.”\n\nRodman could have walked away. Instead, she made it abundantly clear that she wanted to stay, for the team, the fans and herself.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nUS Women's national team, Washington Spirit, NWSL, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Teenager Blades Brown fired a spectacular 12-under par 60 to join world number one Scottie Scheffler atop the leaderboard after two rounds of the PGA Tour American Express in La Quinta, California, on Friday.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Tennessee just missed out on a 59 when his birdie putt at his final hole slipped by on the right side.\n\n\"I'm so stoked to have shot 60 on the PGA Tour,\" Brown said, acknowledging that nerves \"absolutely\" kicked in over the final three holes.\n\nHe had made a dazzling start on the Nicklaus Tournament course, one of three in use over the first three rounds of the event.\n\nBrown, who made his pro debut at La Quinta last year, teed off on 10 and was eight under through his first seven holes thanks to an eagle and six birdies.\n\nAfter a birdie at the second he strung together three more at the fourth, fifth and sixth to reach 12-under for the day.\n\nHe couldn't capitalize on the par-five seventh, settling for a par after his second shot found the rough.\n\nAfter a par at the eighth he had one more chance at the 16th sub-60 round ever on the PGA Tour at the par-four ninth, where a mammoth drive and a crisp wedge left him a birdie look from inside seven feet that he couldn't convert.\n\n\"I saw my spot just a little before the hole,\" he said. \"I got a great read off David Ford. He dripped it in there and it went right dead center. So I was thinking, OK, maybe just a little outside right edge.\n\n\"Unfortunately it didn't go in, but I'm really happy with the outcome I had today.\"\n\nIt was the continuation of a whirlwind week for Brown, who finished tied for 17th in the Korn Ferry developmental tour event in the Bahamas on Wednesday, then, with a sponsor's exemption to play in La Quinta, made his way to California in time to tee it up on Thursday.\n\nHe goes into the weekend tied on 17-under 127 with Scheffler, who had eight birdies in his eight-under 64 on the Nicklaus Tournament course.\n\nScheffler is making his season debut after a 2025 campaign that included two major titles among his six wins.\n\nThrilled to have his name next to Scheffler's atop the leaderboard, Brown wasn't getting ahead of himself.\n\n\"We're halfway there. We've got a lot of golf to go,\" he said, adding that his next order of business would be getting some rest.\n\n\"I'm going to go take a nap,\" Brown said.\n\nThe leading duo were one stroke clear of South Korean Kim Si-Woo, who posted a 65 on the tougher Stadium Course for a 16-under total of 128.\n\nIt was a further stroke back to South Korea's Kim Seong-hyeon and American Matt McCarty.\n\nAmerican Andrew Putnam also flirted with a 59 before settling for a 12-under 60 on the La Quinta course that left him 12-under for the tournament.",

    "fullText": "Lawmakers and military families denounced President Donald Trump’s shocking remarks denigrating NATO troops who were injured and died fighting for the U.S. in Afghanistan after the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Trump questioned whether NATO “will be there if we ever need them.”\n\n“We’ve never needed them,” he told Maria Bartiromo. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, little off the front lines. But we’ve been very good to Europe and to many other countries.”\n\nHis message sparked outrage in the U.K., which sent more than 150,000 troops to Afghanistan in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nThe British contingency, which, after the U.S., was the second largest of the campaign, lost 457 soldiers, while thousands more were injured.\n\n“They were absolutely on the front lines,” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died in Afghanistan when he was 18, told The Mirror. “And to ignore that because, let’s face it, Trump isn’t particularly hot on history… He is so out of touch with the reality, and what it costs in human life. He has no compassion whatsoever for anyone who doesn’t serve him.”\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries in Afghanistan in 2006, said Trump’s latest comments were “the ultimate insult.”\n\nStarmer’s official spokesperson pointed out that the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the only time NATO has invoked Article 5, the alliance’s collective defense principle that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, The Telegraph reported.\n\n“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato allies was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Starmer’s spokesperson said of the soldiers who were wounded and killed. “The president was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops.”\n\nStarmer later called Trump’s comments about NATO troops “insulting and frankly appalling.”\n\n“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\nStarmer said Trump should apologize for the comments.\n\nEven the Conservative Party blasted Trump’s remarks, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch calling them “absolutely appalling” and “disgraceful,” according to The Telegraph.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States,” according to ABC.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president’s dumping on NATO troops was reminiscent of his previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during WWI were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nIn December, he struggled to muster much sympathy for the families of Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.",

Many of the posts appeared in his feed twice in a row.\n\nTrump, 79, began his posting spree by claiming he had helped to save TikTok by announcing the Chinese social media company would now operate in the U.S. under a majority American-owned joint venture.\n\nRepublican megadonor Larry Ellison’s company Oracle will hold a 15 percent stake in TikTok U.S. Ellison, a close friend of Trump, will also steer Oracle’s “retraining” of TikTok’s trademark algorithm.\n\n“It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”\n\nIronically, Trump had tried to ban TikTok in 2020, citing national security fears, but used the Chinese-owned app to broaden his appeal with younger voters during his 2024 election campaign.\n\nTrump’s dump of posts covered everything from a trailer for wife Melania’s Amazon documentary to reposting video from Fox News and Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nThere were also clips of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and uploaded PDF printouts of a NewsMax cover story on Trump from December.\n\nThe president also shared negative posts towards his political foes, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHis feed was also filled with doubled-up posts about the 2020 election being stolen, clips from UFC boss Dana White, and claims that he is having success with his handling of the American economy—despite polls suggesting otherwise.\n\nHe also shared content from a fan account dedicated to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Unfortunately for Trump, one of the posts read “American is back!!!” rather than “America is back!!!”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s post-midnight Truth Social onslaught follows an earlier social media frenzy from Europe. He spent more than an hour firing off posts attacking his critics and sharing gushing posts after the embarrassment of world leaders snubbing his “Board of Peace” signing ceremony.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nHe included more conspiracy theories about the 2020 election fraud as well as questionable claims about ICE being allowed to use force against Minnesota protesters.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has completely misunderstood what global warming means in a bonkers post on social media.\n\nThe U.S. is facing a potentially historically cold period, with the eastern two-thirds of the country expected to experience sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall, which could cause major disruption. For the president, that is proof enough that “global warming” is a hoax.\n\n“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States,” he said on Truth Social. “Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain—WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”\n\nIt is not entirely clear who he meant by “Environmental Insurrectionists.”\n\nThe world’s most powerful man has repeatedly shown he is apprehensive about the existence of climate change, championing fossil fuel policies and peddling conspiracy theories, despite an overwhelming body of scientific evidence that it poses a real and imminent threat.\n\nIt has long been public knowledge that the now-relegated term global warming does not mean that cold temperatures will not occur, but rather that the average temperature inside the Earth’s atmosphere will be higher, disrupting delicate environmental balances.\n\nThe term is now instead regarded as merely a part of the wider phenomenon of climate change.\n\nCold landmasses and warm waters in the Arctic are stretching the polar vortex, dragging cold air further south. When that cold air meets warm, moist southern air, it could cause heavy snow, PBS reports.\n\nOn its website, the American Red Cross said, “Winters are getting warmer and shorter because of the climate crisis. But, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, heavier snowfalls are more likely to occur,” the Guardian reports.\n\nThe BBC reports that “cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York,” could be blanketed with snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the weather could “pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin.”\n\nThe storm is expected to reach as far west as New Mexico, with around 230 million people staring down the barrel of 20-degree temperatures as state governors declare emergencies across the country.\n\nTrump’s disregard for the environment is well-documented. On his first day back in the Oval Office last year, he gave an executive order called “Putting people over fish,” where he disregarded the endangered delta smelt as “an essentially worthless fish,” and demanded water from their habitat be taken to fight fires hundreds of miles away.\n\nHe has also waged a long-running war on wind turbines, claiming “windmills” are making whales crazy and killing bald eagles, a point he illustrated on social media by posting a picture of a dead falcon in Israel.\n\nIn September, he gave a speech to the United Nations, where he said climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”\n\nDuring the same speech, he said, “I have a little standing order in the White House,” he said. “Never use the word ‘coal’. Only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal’. Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”",

The OpenAI Foundation committed $25 billion to AI resilience and curing diseases. The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative is refocusing most of its philanthropic spending on AI projects to “cure all disease.” The White House launched the Genesis Mission, a “national effort to unleash a new age of AI‑accelerated innovation and discovery.” Philanthropies and government officials are asking us for more ideas about where this money should be directed.\n\nThis is a momentous opportunity, and how well these funds are spent will depend both on the quality of available ideas and on teams being ready to implement them.\n\nThat’s why The Launch Sequence is transitioning into a rolling effort to:\n\nThe output of The Launch Sequence will be a collection of thoroughly vetted, detailed project plans for philanthropists to fund or for policymakers to implement.7\n\nWe’re excited to announce our official Advisory Panel for the project, including:\n\nWe are seeking initial short pitches (around 200–400 words) that address one of the three focus areas of this RFP: accelerating science, strengthening security, and adapting institutions. See “Ideas we are interested in” at the bottom of this post for full descriptions of these focus areas.\n\nWe are interested in projects that are particularly important to achieve in light of rapid advances in AI. This means that the capabilities of advanced AI — or the changes such capabilities will bring — should be a key part of either the problem or the solution.8 If you are unsure if a proposal is in-scope, we encourage you to submit it anyway.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of the kinds of project ideas we’re excited about can be found at the bottom of this post. You can also see the project ideas we’ve already published on our website: ifp.org/launch.\n\nWe welcome pitches from two broad groups of contributors:\n\nWe are especially interested in pitches from people who would consider implementing their proposal themselves.10 This is not a requirement; we are also interested in hearing from strategists, researchers, and domain experts who can articulate what technologies or projects should exist, even if they are not the ones to build them. We also offer a $1,000 bounty for successful referrals — if you know someone who might be interested in being an author, please share this page with them and ask them to include your name in the application form. If their proposal is accepted, you’ll receive the bounty.\n\nWe expect authoring full Launch Sequence project plans to take 8–14 weeks from accepted pitch to published piece, involving several stages of writing, receiving feedback from IFP and input from external experts, and refining your full project plan.\n\nIFP is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and will have no claim over any IP related to your idea, nor ownership of any resulting companies. We aim to accelerate authors and builders.\n\nIf you have an idea, we want to hear it. You can learn more and submit an idea via the form below.\n\nThis is a rolling RFP with no submission deadline, but we encourage you to submit a pitch early (within the next few weeks), as we will prioritize early submissions and start reviewing immediately.\n\nQuestions? Email launch.sequence@ifp.org\n\nWe are interested in rapidly building what we need to prepare for a world with advanced AI so that we can fully reap AI’s benefits while managing its new threats. Such an agenda will include a wide-ranging set of projects, including creating companies, tools, technologies, institutions, research streams, resources, and public policies.\n\nWe will only consider projects that address a market failure (or policy gap) and will therefore not be built by default, or not quickly enough. The three core categories where we expect these issues to surface are in accelerating science, strengthening security, and adapting key institutions.\n\nThe lists below are not meant to be exhaustive. Instead, they are meant to illustrate the kinds of projects that we would be excited to support. We encourage you to submit pitches for projects whether or not they are listed below.\n\nWhat resources, technologies, or institutions will scientists need to unlock breakthroughs with AI and other emerging technologies, and which aren’t being created fast enough through market forces or traditional grant funding?\n\nAI promises to transform how science is done. But leveraging AI advances for breakthroughs requires more than capable models. It requires infrastructure, institutions, and resources that no single lab or company has an incentive to build: shared datasets, standardized protocols, access to physical experimentation capacity, and new modes of peer review and validation. Traditional grant funding moves too slowly and often rewards the wrong things; private industry optimizes for what can become profitable, not what will most advance scientific progress. Without targeted investment and effort by the US government and philanthropies, scientific bottlenecks will limit AI-accelerated discovery even as the models improve. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nHealth and biology. The highest ambition for AI may be to generate cures to inherited and infectious diseases. But even as AI companies pursue this goal, their efforts alone are unlikely to fully accomplish it: biology is immensely complex, wet lab work is messy and reliant on tacit knowledge, and treatments require extensive clinical trials and regulation before they can even start to be distributed to patients. And even if current technologies eventually scale to this lofty goal, delays, even on the order of years, will have massive life-altering costs for billions of people and avoidable suffering at scale. Moving faster, even to achieve the same outcome, can save millions of lives.\n\nWe are interested in proposals that offer ways to speed up biological research, decrease the time between a treatment’s discovery and its real-world availability, or create the policy entrepreneurship needed to massively improve healthspan around the world.\n\nNovel infrastructure for the scientific process. AI tools are being developed to increase productivity in every industry, science included. However, while commercial interests are rapidly building AI tools for materials or drug discovery, efforts to improve the basic scientific process have received comparatively less attention. We are interested in “horizontal” infrastructure that improves the scientific process itself across fields. Projects to build better tooling for natural and physical sciences include:\n\nMetascience. Scientists spend a great deal of time on the work that surrounds the research enterprise — developing systems to durably maintain and share data, writing and reviewing proposals, and interacting with their supporting and partner institutions. Each of these areas of work is already being transformed by AI, but conventional grants and institutions are slow to catch up. Efforts to reimagine how institutions should adapt to the age of AI include:\n\nOther potential directions. The above categories are non-exhaustive. We would also like to receive proposals for other scientific research directions, such as physics, chemistry, or ecology, or proposals that direct other unmet needs in the research, development, and innovation ecosystem.\n\nWhat tools, technologies, or institutions can we build to ensure rapid AI advances do not undermine national security or public safety?\n\nAI technologies are dual-use. The same capabilities that automate cyberdefense can automate cyberattacks; and the tools that accelerate progress in the life sciences may also reduce the barriers to engineer biological weapons. Furthermore, the transformative potential of AI raises the stakes of geopolitical competition, and strengthens the ability of state and non-state actors to cause widespread and asymmetric harm. No one actor bears these risks, requiring targeted philanthropic and government action to ensure that defenses can scale alongside AI capabilities. We are particularly interested in achieving a world in which defensive technologies are structurally advantaged, such that attacks are quickly detected and contained. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nCyber defense. The integration of AI into cyber and cyber-physical systems introduces a broad range of vulnerabilities that hinder AI adoption and increase the attack surface for critical infrastructure. Moreover, AI is already increasing the speed and scale of cyber attacks. By proactively investing in security and leveraging AI for defense, we can enhance our resilience. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nBiological defense. Advances in AI and biotechnology are removing barriers to the development and design of biological weapons, which could cause millions of deaths and trillions in economic damage. How can we prevent the worst outcomes without slowing down beneficial research? Potential projects in this space include:\n\nVerification and evaluation. AI challenges traditional technology-policy frameworks because it lacks many of the typical characteristics they address, like concrete physical forms, easily isolated components, and straightforward version control. To mitigate these problems, we need new methods for the verification of pertinent AI system characteristics (e.g., proving that certain data was used to train a model) and the measurement science of AI system capabilities and propensities (e.g., determining whether a benchmark accurately the risk-relevant properties it claims to). At the same time, these methods will not be effective if they leak or extract other critical information from the systems they are probing. Well-designed and privacy-preserving tools of this kind can enable a world in which governments can trust industry to manage this technology, and nations can credibly signal that their AI capabilities do not pose threats to international security. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nAlignment and control. AI systems demonstrate sophisticated, unintended behaviors as well as the capacity to evade human oversight. As AI agents take on more and more consequential tasks and play a greater role in our personal lives, the risks from alignment and control failures increase. These dangers could compound significantly as coding agents become more integral to AI development. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nOther potential directions. The former categories are not an exhaustive list of ideas we are interested in. Some other promising areas we would like to receive proposals for include:\n\nWhat tools, technologies, organizations, or policies are needed to help society adapt to rapid AI-driven change while preserving human agency, individual freedoms, and democratic institutions?\n\nThe development of advanced AI would alter the very foundations of social and economic life. Translating AI’s potential into widespread flourishing requires forward-looking institutions12 and infrastructure — technological, organizational, and governmental — that can establish shared facts, coordinate at scale, and make rapid, well-informed decisions. Yet most existing systems were not built for the speed and complexity that AI enables, and markets lack the incentives to update some of these systems for this new reality. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nIncreasing state capacity. Governments are slow-moving institutions, but it is imperative for them to respond quickly and competently to rapid AI progress. In a world of rapidly advancing AI, the US government has a crucial role to play as an enforcer of law and order, provider of public goods, and the R&D lab of the world.\n\nEpistemic integrity. AI dramatically lowers the cost of generating large volumes of apparently high-quality content, straining our ability to distinguish facts from fiction or propaganda. However, new infrastructure designed to establish ground truths, incorporate a variety of viewpoints in well-organized discussions, and analyze large amounts of data can create a more dynamic marketplace of ideas than ever before. We should be wary of interventions that give any one person, company, or interest group the power to adjudicate what is true and what isn’t — distributed solutions like Community Notes could instead provide less-brittle alternatives. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nCoordination. The costs of coordination — identifying counterparties, becoming informed, negotiating priorities and agreements, and ensuring adherence to terms — mean that many mutually beneficial agreements between people in the world never actually get made. Likewise, the cost of coordination hinders many individuals’ ability to participate in the governance decisions that affect their lives. AI could greatly reduce the costs of coordination, enabling individuals to reach positive-sum outcomes and directly participate in governance at unprecedented scale.\n\nBuilding resources to maintain human agency. In recent history, people have maintained economic and political power because they were needed as workers, taxpayers, soldiers, and voters whose cooperation institutions depended on. As advanced AI automates increasingly large parts of the economy, the risk goes beyond broad unemployment — it’s that as people lose economic leverage, their institutional leverage will suffer too. If institutions can function without broad human participation, they may become less responsive to human needs. Markets and governments will likely produce some tools for adaptation, but may do so unevenly or too slowly to keep pace with AI progress. We’re interested in projects that help people maintain economic relevance and institutional leverage even as advanced AI automates large parts of the workforce.\n\nWe believe this effort is critical, but we are unsure as to what the most promising proposals in this area may be. Proposals in this category should make an especially strong case for why markets or other institutions won’t provide the solution fast enough by default. Possible proposals in this area include concrete programs to help people rapidly adapt their skills; human-in-the-loop tooling to enable workers to efficiently supervise, direct, and collaborate with AI systems at machine speed; and benefits-sharing programs or policies to ensure the broad automation of labor benefits the general population.\n\nOther potential directions. The above categories are not an exhaustive list of ideas we are interested in. Some other promising areas we would like to receive proposals for include:\n\nAcknowledgements: Thank you to Gaurav Sett, Non-Resident Fellow at IFP, for closely consulting on this piece.\n\nMore details under “Who should submit a pitch?”\n\nAI could unlock treatments to the most debilitating human diseases. But some of these fundamental breakthroughs will lack clear commercial incentives or face other barriers. If AI greatly accelerates science, unaddressed bottlenecks will become especially acute, and proactively eliminating these bottlenecks will become especially important.\n\nAI could unlock treatments to the most debilitating human diseases. But some of these fundamental breakthroughs will lack clear commercial incentives or face other barriers. If AI greatly accelerates science, unaddressed bottlenecks will become especially acute, and proactively eliminating these bottlenecks will become especially important.\n\nWe also submitted these proposals to the American Science Acceleration Project RFI, bound them into a beautiful book, and are sending copies to all 535 offices in Congress.\n\nSubmissions to the FDA for drug approval, which collectively form one of the most exhaustive repositories of real-world scientific practice and regulatory negotiation ever assembled, and thus a rich resource for AI to be trained on.\n\nWhile the original Launch Sequence proposals were primarily aimed at the US government, we’re broadening our focus to include projects that can move forward just with philanthropic support. Given our new focus on providing shovel-ready ideas for funders, we will dedicate many more resources to vetting and refining project proposals than we did in the past.\n\nStill, the US government can play a powerful role in implementing many proposals at scale, and we are excited to support proposals that require or benefit from government action.\n\nThis should be interpreted broadly, for example: a pitch for an organization to manufacture next-gen personal protective equipment (PPE) to increase society’s resilience against pandemics would be in scope. This is because future AI may democratize access to the knowledge and tools needed to create engineered viruses, thus increasing our baseline pandemic risk.\n\nExamples with links to existing Launch Sequence project plans:\n\n1. Cases where AI creates/worsens a problem (e.g., biosecurity, offensive cybersecurity, AI sleeper agents, securing AI model weights)\n\n2. Cases where AI can be/support the solution (e.g., automating scientific replication, pathogen detection via metagenomics and ML, AI-powered code refactoring)\n\n3. Cases where AI makes something newly feasible, which will not be done fast enough by default (connectome mapping, self-driving labs)\n\nNote: You will be eligible for this bounty if: (1) we first learn about a particular project idea based on your pitch, and (2) you selected “I just want to submit an idea” in the application form, and (3) we then publish a full project plan based on your initial pitch.\n\nWe will ultimately determine whether we had already considered a project idea, or whether your pitch was the first time we encountered it. Only one person will be eligible for the “idea scout bounty” for every piece we publish.\n\nIf you're proposing a new research group or institution, we are excited to help accelerate the potential founder. If you're proposing a government program, we are excited to make the right connections and help the author make it happen.\n\nWe’ll aim to respond to initial pitches within a few weeks of submission, to allow time for us to investigate the area and consult with our advisors and domain experts.\n\n“Institutions” in this RFP should be interpreted broadly, as “the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic, and social interaction.”",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO and SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) founder Elon Musk said at this year's World Economic Form (WEF) that humanoid robots will eventually outnumber humans.\n\nRobinhood chief investment officer Stephanie Guild, Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferré, and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma joins Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss Musk's bullish claims on robotics.\n\nCheck out Musk's comments on humanoid robots and Tesla's robotaxi, and watch his full WEF interview.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid.\n\nFor my question of the day, I am sticking with the man Elon Musk. I really enjoyed his talk at Davos and found what he said on humanoid robots quite interesting.\n\nMy prediction is there'll be there'll be more robots than people. Probably sometime next year. I'd say that by the by the end of next year, I I think uh we'd be selling humanoid robots uh to the public.\n\nA new Gartner report this week sheds light on what's coming on the humanoid front potentially. Through 2028, uh less than 100 companies will progress humanoid robot proofs of concept beyond experimentation with fewer than 20 companies going live in production for supply chain and manufacturing use cases. My question is this, should we believe humanoids will be the next great investment opportunity. After all, there is an AI component to these bots. Stephanie, what say you?\n\nAh, it's from a personal perspective, it's a little bit scary. I have to say, but um, it is something that we have been considering in Robin Hood strategies, for example, where we haven't necessarily been looking for companies to invest in that have humanoids in their, uh, you know, in their pipeline, but we have been investing in companies that will provide the eyes and the ears for robots because even if it doesn't end up being a humanoid, I do think this concept of automation replacing humans in some way shape\n\nor form is not going away. That's going to be a growing concept. Um, and so that's where we've been focusing.\n\nAnd as I don't know why I think this, but I think you'd be an earlier uh an early adopter of one of these humanoids in your house.\n\nI would definitely be an earlier adopter.\n\nSee, I know. See, you work with someone long enough, you kind of just know, you know.\n\nMaybe for the yard. But not right now. Oh, for sure, for for everything in the house. Uh, yeah, can the humanoid clean? Oh, sure.\n\nAnd your Costco pizzas. It can make those Costco pizzas for you.\n\nCan can they cook for me? Yeah, of course. Uh I'd be a huge early adopter for humanoid robots and also the robot taxis as well. Uh but look, this year and next year and going forward, it is uh we are starting to see sort of the merging of machinery which has been around, but also now you're adding on the AI layer, the intelligence layer. And that is what's most exciting when talking about humanoid robots in in the future.\n\nAll right, so I got it right with Ines. Brooke, I'm going to guess that you're a little skeptical on the on these humanoids.\n\nBrian, I'm the youngest here and I'm skeptical. I don't think I'd want one of these in my house.\n\nYeah, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.\n\nI think certainly for sure, when when you think about uh the future where this is going. Elon Musk is pretty convincing. He was saying that a lot of his parent- a lot of his friends rather have elderly parents. This was in the conversation at Davos with Larry Fink. A lot of his uh friends have elderly parents and he believes that these humanoid robots will help to take care of an aging population. I thought that was an interesting point. I personally, I love interpersonal relationships. I love, you know, talking to people. I love being the one to sort of\n\njump in. And so I I will say, I'm not bought yet, but if this is anything like uh how Disney Channel's uh The Smart House went, then we're in for something certainly that might be a little scary here. And so, I'm a bit skeptical here, Brian.\n\nAll right, well I will leave it on this. I know my mom is a big opening bid watcher each day. Mom, I will say this to you right to the camera. I'm going to buy one of these robots early to take care of you at some point because look, not to be mean, I I just don't have the time. Sorry mom.",

    "description": "“The limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have.\n\nIn a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models.\n\n“I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.”\n\nThe U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech.\n\nTwo massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators.\n\n“We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.”\n\nDuring his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve.\n\nJust as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks.",

    "fullText": "Kristalina Georgieva says research suggests 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected, with many entry-level roles wiped out\n\nArtificial intelligence will be a “tsunami hitting the labour market”, with young people worst affected, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned the World Economic Forum on Friday.\n\nKristalina Georgieva told delegates in Davos that the IMF’s own research suggested there would be a big transformation of demand for skills, as the technology becomes increasingly widespread.\n\n“We expect over the next years, in advanced economies, 60% of jobs to be affected by AI, either enhanced or eliminated or transformed – 40% globally,” she said. “This is like a tsunami hitting the labour market.”\n\nShe suggested that in advanced economies, one in 10 jobs had already been “enhanced” by AI, tending to boost these workers’ pay, with knock-on benefits for the local economy.\n\nMeanwhile people whose jobs were not directly changed by artificial intelligence risked being squeezed, she said, with their pay potentially falling without a productivity boost from AI.\n\n“So the middle class, inevitably, is going to be affected,” Georgieva predicted.\n\nShe said her greatest fear was that AI was insufficiently regulated. “This is moving so fast, and yet we don’t know how to make it safe. We don’t know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it,” she said.\n\nMuch of the debate at the annual meeting of the business and political elite in the Swiss ski resort this week has been hijacked by Donald Trump’s on-off tariff threats over the future of Greenland.\n\nBut many delegates were also keen to highlight the risks and benefits of AI. Christy Hoffman, general secretary of the UNI global union, told the Guardian: “It’s just a basic premise that the point of AI, on the business side, is to increase productivity, therefore lower costs – which will be cutting jobs.”\n\n“I think it’s time to come to terms with that disruption – and how to manage that disruption,” she said, calling for the productivity benefits to be distributed fairly across the economy.\n\n“We want to share in the gains. We’re not going to stop AI, nor do we want to even try – but we don’t want it to just roll over us.” She called on employers to discuss the role of AI tools with workers and their representatives before introducing them.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, warned that AI could lose its “social permission” to compete for resources such as energy, for example, if it failed to generate benefits beyond a few powerful tech firms – such as the rapid development of effective new drugs.\n\nGeorgieva was speaking on a panel alongside the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who warned that the AI boom could be hampered by growing mistrust between rival economies, as the US throws up tariff barriers.\n\n“We are dependent on each other,” she said, pointing out that AI was capital intensive, energy intensive and data intensive. If countries did not work cooperatively and “define the new rules of the game,” she said, there would be less capital and less data. “We are in a bind, lets face it,” she said.\n\nLagarde also sounded the alarm about widening global inequality, highlighting the “disparity that is getting deeper and bigger”.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, urged delegates to face up to a permanent “rupture” in the global economic order, and band together in the face of erratic US trade policy.\n\nBut Lagarde said she was less gloomy. “I’m not exactly on the same page as Mark,” she said. “I’m not sure that we should be talking about rupture. I think we should be talking about alternatives.”",

A lot is promised, but not enough is delivered.”\n\nGoretti brought down thousands of power, phone and broadband lines and caused countless trees to fall, including one that crushed the caravan of 50-year-old James Southey and killed him.\n\nFor days, many hundreds of people were left without power, water or both, but while those services have been restored, communication links in some places remain down a fortnight on. In a world where reliable online connections are needed for everything from health consultations to banking, it makes life very difficult.\n\n“It’s like we’re forgotten,” said Elaine Claxton, 70, an actor, as she pointed to the wires still broken and dangling next to a giant fallen tree on the lane leading to her home in Cucurrian. She has no broadband, no landline and the mobile signal is unreliable at best. Staying in touch with frail family members a few miles away has been fraught.\n\nHer sister, Shelley Claxton, 63, an animal trainer, said places such as Cucurrian were resilient. “When you’re as remote as we are, you have to be, but I think this storm shows us we need to do something different. Nature is whipping up more and more storms and we need to find ways of adapting to that.”\n\nOn the Lizard peninsula, the southernmost point of the British mainland, Sam Kirby, 53, described how the communication breakdown led to difficulties in working as a digital marketing consultant and in her volunteer role as a coastguard rescue officer.\n\nHer old-style copper landline meant the coastguard station officer could – just about – contact her by phone, but without broadband, working was challenging.\n\n“I had to go full digital nomad, which included time working in a supermarket car park with the car heater on, in the library, and basically perching anywhere I could to find wifi,” she said.\n\n“We’re constantly being told by those pushing Cornwall as a place to work that we’ve got to trade nationally or internationally, that we have the best broadband in the country, that we’re a booming digital economy. It’s hard to boom digitally when you can’t even get a text message out.”\n\nKirby and the people of Cucurrian are angry that Openreach, which builds and maintains the UK’s largest broadband network, has not restored services more quickly.\n\nThere is concern that the continuing switch from copper phone lines to full-fibre broadband makes them more vulnerable. “If this happens again next year, we won’t even have the copper landline so won’t have any link out at all,” said Kirby.\n\nIt is not just remote communities that have been hit. Karen Bennett, 72, lives close to Penzance town centre but a pine tree brought down a pole there, cutting off her broadband.\n\nA new pole has been put up but the broadband hasn’t returned, making her work as chair of the twinning association forging links between Penzance and the French town of Concarneau difficult. “We’ve had to find ways of working around it,” she said. “It’s frustrating. We still don’t know when the broadband will be back.”\n\nThese are interesting political and cultural times in Cornwall. The UK government has indicated that it will explore a bespoke devolution deal for Cornwall, possibly giving it more control over transport, housing and economic development.\n\nThis week the Cornish language – Kernewek – was officially recognised under part three of the European charter for regional or minority languages, which gives it greater protection and status.\n\nBut the loss of power, water and the continuing communications issues have made many Cornish people question whether the rest of the UK cares enough about the far-west of Britain, when it is not holidaying or visiting second homes there.\n\nLoveday Jenkin, a leading member of the political party Mebyon Kernow, which campaigns for greater self-government for Cornwall, said Goretti had exposed weaknesses in its infrastructure.\n\n“It shows Cornwall should have more devolved resilience money,” Jenkin said. “People want to treat Cornwall as a holiday playground. They need to recognise that there are people on the ground who have to manage it but don’t have the money.”\n\nJenkin spoke as yet another storm, named Ingrid by the Portuguese national weather service, brought in strong winds and heavy rain on Friday. “I think UK government needs to recognise Cornwall as the canary in the coalmine in relation to climate change,” Jenkin said. “There will be more storms coming.”\n\nOpenreach said it could not put a figure on how many people in Cornwall were still without broadband and rejected the idea that the switch to fibre made the county more vulnerable, arguing the outages were largely down to trees falling on overhead wires or taking down poles, which affected the copper and fibre network.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Storm Goretti has caused the worst impact to our network in Cornwall in recent memory and as soon as it was safe to do so, we’ve had teams of engineers working round the clock to repair the extensive damage.\n\n“We have managed to reconnect thousands of homes and businesses, but there is more to do and we know how frustrating that is. Unfortunately, the reality is that this type of repair work – closing roads, replacing poles and overhead cables – is complex and time-consuming.”\n\nThe recovery will take a long time. Alasdair Moore, the head of estate and gardens on Tresco, one of the Isles of Scilly, which lies 30 miles (48km) off the mainland and was battered by 99mph gusts during Goretti, said the effect was devastating.\n\nTrees fell, houses were damaged and the water supply interrupted. “The scale of the clear-up is huge,” said Moore. “It will be ongoing for a few years but the way the community and the team has responded has been magnificent.”\n\nMoore said remote communities such as those huddled on Scilly and west Cornwall always got on with it and came good. “Dealing with gales is very much part of this place’s history,” he said.",

    "fullText": "While the US military has pursued ambitious technological advances, manpower remains one of its core pillars.\n\nFrom high-ranking generals to soldiers on the field, human troops remain a key way to assess the reach and power of the world's militaries.\n\nUsing data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' 2025 Military Balance report, Business Insider ranked countries by the size of their active armed forces and listed their defense budgets, based on 2024 figures.\n\nActive-duty force size is a tally of a country's uniformed troops: airmen, soldiers, sailors, special operators, and Marines. Armies, in particular, depend on size to gain and occupy ground. Militaries can also be a tool of domestic repression, a focus that undercuts its capabilities against an external foe. North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",

Not sure why polymarket made this up.\"\n\nNope. Not sure why polymarket made this up. 🤷‍♂️\n\nIt's not entirely clear where the statement came from. The Polymarket account on X frequently posts aggregated news from around the world, often without citing an original source.\n\nPolymarket did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBezos did recently speak about about the importance of real-world experience in general.\n\nIn an appearance at Italian Tech Week in November, Bezos advised young entrepreneurs to work at a company before starting their own, rather than dropping out of college like other famous founders.\n\n\"It is possible to, you know, be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college, and be a great entrepreneur,\" Bezos said. \"We have famous examples of that working: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etcetera. But these people are the exception.\"\n\n\"I always advise to young people, you know, go work at a best practices company somewhere, where you can learn a lot of basic fundamental things,\" Bezos continued. \"There's still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it. It increases your odds, in my opinion.\"\n\nBezos also worked his first job at McDonald's while in high school, and he spoke favorably about the experience in comments that appeared in the 2012 book \"Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's.\"\n\n\"You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously,\" Bezos said. \"You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald's. It's different from what you learn in school. Don't underestimate the value of that!\"\n\nElon Musk even weighed in, replying to Bezos with a reference toward President Donald Trump's famous appearance at a McDonald's during the 2024 presidential campaign, where he worked the fryer and appeared at the drive-thru window.\n\n\"Well, the President worked at McDonald's and now he's the President,\" Musk wrote.",

    "description": "Despite geopolitical upheaval, sanctions, and military action, this South American state's proven oil reserves remain colossal.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to oil-rich countries, one would usually think of Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia or Iraq. But what many do not know is that the country with the largest oil reserves in the world lies just 1,200 miles to the south of Florida — or about a three-and-a-half-hour flight across the Caribbean. This is the state of Venezuela, and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that its oil reserves are at more than 303 billion barrels, as of 2025.\n\nMost of Venezuela's oil is in the Orinoco Belt, a swathe of land north of the Orinoco River, but extracting it poses an unusual set of challenges. The country's oil infrastructure needs to be overhauled due to years of mismanagement and corruption and a history of asset seizures from private companies by the state. The country is also under U.S. sanctions, which limit its ability to sell oil overseas.\n\nVenezuela's crude oil isn't easy to process, either. Saudi Arabian and American oil fields produce light, sweet crude oil, which contains very little sulfur, and isn't corrosive to pipes and equipment. On the other hand, Venezuelan oil is much harder to process because it's mostly heavy and sour, making it harder to process crude oil into unleaded gasoline. Prof. Paasha Mahdavi of the University of California, Santa Barbara, told NPR that it's \"among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce when it comes to global warming.\"\n\nAside from Venezuela, other countries that have massive reserves include Saudi Arabia (267 billion barrels), Iran (208 billion barrels), Iraq (145 billion barrels), and the United Arab Emirates (113 billion barrels). The United States sits in the top eight, with an estimated 45 billion barrels of crude oil in reserve.\n\nOne thing that allowed the U.S. to massively increase its oil reserves and become one of the top 10 countries with the largest oil reserves is the development of fracking. Unlike traditional oil extraction techniques, which siphoned oil deposits from porous material, fracking pumps a special type of fluid deep underground to break the dense rock that holds the oil and make it easier to extract.\n\nOther nations are continually exploring to find new oil fields within their borders, and the U.S. made a new discovery in Texas in January 2026, which potentially has 1.6 billion barrels of oil. So, if there's a new substantial find or new technologies are developed to efficiently extract more oil from existing wells, then it's possible that another state can overtake Venezuela as the largest oil reserve holder in the world.",

The tour, which has multiple stops across Northern California, gives fans a chance to meet players and coaches.\n\nLee is of South Korean descent, but he was born in Nagoya, Japan, where his father, Korean baseball star Jong Beom Lee, was playing for the Chunichi Dragons, according to his MLB profile. During his introductory press conference, Lee called himself “Grandson of the Wind.” His father is known as “Son of the Wind.”\n\nLee made his debut in the majors in March 2024 after playing for the Kiwoom Heroes in Korea for seven years. Lee agreed to a six-year contract with the Giants worth $113 million in December 2023, ESPN reported, citing unnamed sources, at the time.\n\nThe Giants will begin spring training for the 2026 season in Scottsdale, Arizona, in early February.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump spent two hours on Truth Social attacking his enemies and reposting praise after world leaders ignored his “Board of Peace” ceremony in Davos.\n\nThe 79-year-old president shared almost a post a minute on Thursday, hours after his “Board of Peace” initiative at the World Economic Forum attracted a motley crew of Trump-allied leaders from the Middle East and South America.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nSubjects covered in the posting barrage include a video of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller bashing Trump’s enemies, a court victory that will allow ICE to use force against protestors in Minnesota, 2020 election fraud conspiracies, threats to sue the New York Times for publishing polls that displease him, and rants against Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith was publicly testifying before Congress about the case he had built against Donald Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election when the president wrote, “Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”\n\nThe president’s posting rampage comes at the end of a humiliating and widely criticized trip to the World Economic Forum.\n\nAfter giving a speech on Wednesday in which he intimated the U.S. could take control of Greenland, Trump met with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, who apparently talked him down. Trump walked away from the meeting claiming he’d gotten the “framework of a deal” for the United States on Greenland, but didn’t give any specifics.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump suffered a fresh humiliation at the “Board of Peace” signing party.\n\nThe White House hyped the “Board of Peace” initiative, which nations can join for a $1 billion fee, as a coalition of nations that “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”\n\nThough the White House expected representatives from 35 countries at the ceremony, fewer than 20 showed up. World leaders otherwise in attendance at Davos, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, all ignored Trump’s endeavor.\n\nTrump was left signing what critics called a MAGA-fied U.N. charter with the likes of Argentinian President Javier Milei and far-right Hungarian leader Viktor Orban.\n\nTrump called every world leader who signed onto the Board of Peace a “great friend of mine.”\n\nShortly after Trump’s posting spree concluded, his account adopted a different, more optimistic tone.\n\n“Heading back to D.C. It was an incredible time in Davos,” Trump posted at 1:45 pm. “The Greenland structure is being worked on, and will be amazing for the U.S.A., and the Board of Peace is something that the World has never seen before — Very special. So many good things happening! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.\"",

    "description": "\"We were able to get firsthand exposure to a lot of real-world scenarios.\"",
    "fullText": "A team from General Motors drove two of its pre-production electric vehicles on an epic roadtrip, collecting real-world data and even helping to solve an annoying charging snafu along the way.\n\nThe company documented the 5,000-mile-long road trip that put the Cadillac OPTIQ luxury crossover and a GMC Sierra EV pickup truck to the test. During the drive, three GM engineers gathered data on its hands-free driver assistance system, EV charging, and real-time range prediction while towing a trailer.\n\n\"We were able to get firsthand exposure to a lot of real-world scenarios, from trailering features and GPS navigation updates to Super Cruise behavior in unusual situations,\" quality engineering manager Tony Kraatz said.\n\n​​GM noted that both vehicles were equipped with advanced monitoring gear that helped the team \"find the root cause of a frustrating problem\": slow performance at one public fast-charging system. Ultimately, they discovered that the charger's software code had a typo that was slowing it down. They contacted the operator, who promptly fixed the issue.\n\nThis kind of extreme real-world testing helps improve overall performance for electric vehicles, which should be a win for greater EV adoption. According to the Department of Energy, driving an EV can help slash fuel costs, though it adds that initial costs for EVs can be greater than those of combustion engine vehicles.\n\nStill, many states offer rebates or tax credits that help offset this. For instance, New Mexico gives residents a $3,000 state tax credit when they purchase a new EV.\n\nEV users can save even more money — and avoid annoying malfunctions like the one described by GM — by charging at home instead of using public chargers. If you're interested in exploring home-charging options, Qmerit can help get you started with a Level 2 charger system. The company offers free installation estimates, too.\n\nIf you're ready for even more savings, using solar to power your home can help reduce charging costs even further. TCD's Solar Explorer has all sorts of resources and can link you up with trusted partners that could help save up to $10,000 on installation costs.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Nipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization",
    "fullText": "India is moving quickly to contain a Nipah virus outbreak in the eastern state of West Bengal after five cases were confirmed, including doctors and nurses who were infected.\n\nNearly 100 people have been asked to quarantine at home, and infected patients were being treated in hospitals in and around the capital Kolkata, according to local media reports, with one patient in a critical condition.\n\nNipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and is considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization. Experts say human infections are rare and usually occur when the virus spills over from bats, often through contaminated fruit.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this virus:\n\nNipah virus (NiV) infection most often begins with non-specific symptoms, making early detection difficult.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation period is generally believed to range from four to 21 days, though longer delays between exposure and illness have been reported in rare cases during previous outbreaks.\n\nPatients typically develop a sudden flu-like illness marked by fever, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. In some cases, respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia also occur, although the timing and severity of these symptoms can vary widely.\n\nThe most serious and defining complication of Nipah infection is inflammation of the brain, known as encephalitis. Neurological symptoms, including confusion, altered consciousness, seizures or coma, usually appear several days to weeks after the initial onset of illness.\n\nSome patients may also develop meningitis.\n\nNipah virus is associated with a high death rate, with fatality levels reported between 40 and 75 per cent depending on the outbreak and the viral strain involved.\n\nSurvivors may experience long-term neurological effects, such as persistent seizures or changes in personality, according to the UK Health Security Agency’s update.\n\nIn rare cases, encephalitis has been reported to recur months or even years after the initial infection, either due to relapse or reactivation of the virus.\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans and from person to person, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe primary natural carriers are fruit bats (Pteropus species); humans can become infected through direct contact with infected bats or other animals, or by consuming food contaminated with bat saliva, urine or faeces.\n\nHuman‑to‑human transmission has also been reported, particularly through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nNipah virus (NiV) was first identified in 1999 after an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness among pig farmers and others who had close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. The episode led to the recognition of NiV as a serious zoonotic pathogen capable of crossing from animals to humans.\n\nSince then, repeated outbreaks have been recorded in South Asia. Parts of northeast India and several districts in Bangladesh have reported cases, with Bangladesh experiencing outbreaks almost every year since 2001.\n\nIn southern India, the state of Kerala reported its first Nipah outbreak in 2018, followed by sporadic cases in subsequent years.\n\nBeyond South Asia, infections have also been reported in the Philippines, with investigations suggesting they were caused by the Nipah virus or a closely related Nipah-like strain.\n\nScientific studies have identified fruit bats as the natural reservoir of the virus. Nipah virus has been isolated from bat urine in Malaysia, and antibodies have been detected in at least 23 bat species across Asia as well as in parts of Africa, including Ghana and Madagascar.\n\nDespite this wide animal reservoir, confirmed human outbreaks have so far been limited to South and Southeast Asia, typically occurring in rural or semi-rural settings where contact between humans, bats and domestic animals is more likely, WHO says.\n\n“Human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and caregivers of infected patients,” according to WHO.\n\nThere is currently no proven, targeted treatment for Nipah virus (NiV) infection and no approved vaccine to prevent it.\n\nCare for patients remains largely supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and complications as they arise.\n\nThe virus is listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen under its Research and Development Blueprint, which identifies epidemic threats that require urgent research.\n\nFollow these essential precautions to prevent Nipah Virus infection. Stay alert, stay informed, and follow advisories issued by local health authorities.#NipahVirus #PublicHealth #HealthForAll pic.twitter.com/itTuZA18ev\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 22, 2026\n\nWith no vaccine available, preventing Nipah virus infection relies on awareness and simple protective measures, global health agencies recommend. Public health advice focuses on reducing contact with the virus, whether from bats, animals, or infected people.\n\nPreventing bat-to-human transmission: Bats are the main carriers of Nipah. People should avoid consuming raw date palm sap or fruits that might have been contaminated by bats, WHO guidelines advise.\n\nBoiling fresh date palm juice and thoroughly washing or peeling fruits can reduce risk. Any fruit showing signs of bat bites should be discarded, the health agency advises.\n\nPreventing animal-to-human transmission: People handling sick animals, their tissues, or during slaughter should wear gloves and protective clothing. Contact with infected pigs should be minimised, and pig farms in areas with fruit bats should take steps to protect feed and enclosures from bats.\n\nSymptoms of Nipah Virus in humans can range from fever and headache to respiratory distress and neurological complications.\nEarly recognition of these symptoms and timely medical care are critical to reducing severity and preventing complications.#NipahVirus #HealthAwareness… pic.twitter.com/odW9baGomD\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 20, 2026\n\nPreventing human-to-human transmission: Avoid close, unprotected contact with people infected with Nipah. Regular hand washing after caring for or visiting sick individuals is essential to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nThe 2011 film Contagion, which depicts a fast-spreading global virus, was partly inspired by real-life pathogens like the Nipah virus, a bat-borne virus first identified in Malaysia in 1999, according to global health non-profit Path’s website.\n\nNipah causes severe respiratory illness and brain inflammation (encephalitis) and can spread from animals to humans, contaminated food, or infected people.\n\nIts high fatality rate, potential for outbreaks, and lack of a vaccine made it a model for how a zoonotic virus could trigger a pandemic, which filmmakers used to shape the realistic global crisis in Contagion, Path noted.",

    "fullText": "The World Economic Forum in Davos has an unofficial dress code: neutral colors, sensible shoes, and quiet-luxury pieces built for subzero temperatures.\n\nJolie Hunt, however, doesn't follow it.\n\nThe 47-year-old founder and CEO of the communications firm Hunt & Gather, who has made more than 20 trips to the global leadership event, has turned Switzerland into her personal runway.\n\nAt this year's WEF, Hunt wore a mix of form-fitting dresses, statement heels, and designer bags — a far cry from the simple winter coat-and-boot combos seen throughout the town.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many people stop me in my tracks and say, 'I love what you're wearing,'\" Hunt told Business Insider.\n\nHer outfits have made her one of the most fashionable people you'll find in Davos as the world's elite, from business to government leaders, convene.\n\nHunt's standout fashion is on display from the moment she leaves New York City.\n\n\"I always travel in black,\" she said. \"I like a theme, and I don't like any loose ends. I'm sure I was French in a former life.\"\n\nThis year, she departed for Davos on January 18, wearing a $1,650 Balenciaga hoodie with fur trim, leather pants, and silver Givenchy sneakers. She also had two Louis Vuitton luggage pieces in hand.\n\n\"I never check a bag,\" she said. \"It's one of my super skills. I pick a theme for what I'm going to wear, down to my pajamas. Everything has a job and a purpose, so there's never any fluff.\"\n\nThis trip, she chose red as her statement color and packed shoes and accessories that complemented her chosen outfits.\n\nOne of the first she wore at Davos comprised a $3,390 printed minidress from Balmain, sheer tights, $575 Larroudé x Libertine pumps, and an Hermès bag.\n\n\"It's a black crocodile Birkin; it's very special,\" she said. \"I wouldn't usually bring it on a trip, but it matches everything, and I'm with all the masters of the universe, so I might as well bring out the big guns.\"\n\nShe wore the dress on Monday to host an event she calls the Stragglers Dinner, which brings together members of various companies and media outlets.\n\nOn Wednesday, she wore a $1,195 red Sportmax dress beneath a $3,990 Balenciaga coat, which she bought specifically for her trip to Davos.\n\nShe accessorized with her Hermès bag, knee-high boots, and sheer Saint Sass tights with the word \"killer\" printed on the thigh.\n\n\"I'm in my 'optimized for joy' part of life,\" she said. \"Maybe this comes with age and status, but I think getting a little bit older and having done this a bunch, I feel much freer in my [fashion] choices.\"\n\nShe wore the look to attend Cisco's Women in Tech breakfast, to get drinks with company executives, and to attend the Semafor Media Party, among other events.\n\nHunt was also wearing the outfit during our phone interview, during which someone stopped her to compliment the look.\n\nIn Hunt's experience, flashy outfits are uncommon at the World Economic Forum.\n\n\"Nobody wears color. It's honestly depressing,\" she said. \"You look in a room, and you don't see a single person who's not wearing navy, gray, or black — men and women.\"\n\nShe attributes that to a few things. First, the city's icy weather makes wearing heels, dresses, and other fashion pieces impractical. Second, the event is rather reserved in nature.\n\n\"For years, this was kind of a boys' club,\" Hunt said. \"Men dressed very conservatively, and I think as women became matriculated into the program, they also kept it conservative. We didn't want to ruffle too many feathers.\"\n\nWith every outfit, though, Hunt is changing that. She said her outfits bring her confidence and energy.\n\n\"In places like this, it's a little bit survival of the fittest, if I'm honest,\" she said. \"Everybody's either eyeing up your affiliation, your look, or what you can do for them. Fashion is the quickest signal that you're either intimidating, interesting, or a whole host of other things.\"",

    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

    "fullText": "Misinformation technology could be deployed at scale to disrupt 2028 US presidential election, AI researchers say\n\nPolitical leaders could soon launch swarms of human-imitating AI agents to reshape public opinion in a way that threatens to undermine democracy, a high profile group of experts in AI and online misinformation has warned.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize-winning free-speech activist Maria Ressa, and leading AI and social science researchers from Berkeley, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and Yale are among a global consortium flagging the new “disruptive threat” posed by hard-to-detect, malicious “AI swarms” infesting social media and messaging channels.\n\nA would-be autocrat could use such swarms to persuade populations to accept cancelled elections or overturn results, they said, amid predictions the technology could be deployed at scale by the time of the US presidential election in 2028.\n\nThe warnings, published today in Science, come alongside calls for coordinated global action to counter the risk, including “swarm scanners” and watermarked content to counter AI-run misinformation campaigns. Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said. “These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”\n\nOne leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.\n\nThe experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”\n\nOthers include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.\n\nTogether they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.\n\nThe threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.\n\nAs well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.\n\n“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.\n\nAnother of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”\n\nIn Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.\n\nDuring discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.\n\n“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”\n\nAmid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.\n\n“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”\n\n“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "AI evangelist Peter Kyle wants to scale up businesses, attract overseas investors and look out for UK’s poorer regions\n\nThe UK business secretary, Peter Kyle, has said he is “betting big” and “picking winners” as the government takes direct stakes in growing businesses to boost economic growth.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been talking up Britain’s prospects, Kyle said ministers were taking an “activist” approach to industrial policy.\n\nThe idea of “picking winners” is closely associated with the Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher’s attacks on Labour’s 1970s strategy and her argument that it should be the private sector that decides which companies thrive.\n\nKyle was unabashed about invoking the phrase, arguing a muscular approach could accelerate economic growth. “I want to make sure that the benefits of growth are felt quicker than is currently the case. We’re predicted to grow 1.5% this year. That is not enough.”\n\nHe highlighted the recent decision to allow the £26bn state-owned British Business Bank to buy equity stakes in companies, including the announcement last week of a £25m investment in the energy supplier Octopus’s software spin-off, Kraken.\n\n“The most potential in our economy, in the short and medium term, is scale-up companies,” Kyle said. “I was at Octopus yesterday. They’re now employing 1,500 people in their head office in London alone.\n\n“We can find other companies that are on that kind of trajectory and we can expedite their growth. Then it will create thousands of new jobs, and it will create enormous amounts of wealth, which will recycle through the economy in a really fast way.”\n\n“I am betting big. And I am picking winners,” he added. “It’s more activist. And there will be things that don’t work out, sure. But to have a healthy economy, failure leads to success.”\n\nThis week’s summit in the Swiss ski resort has been overshadowed by Donald Trump’s threat to slap tariffs on eight European countries if they stood in the way of his hopes of annexing Greenland.\n\nThe president backed away from the idea of punitive import taxes on Wednesday evening, after discussions with the secretary general of Nato, Mark Rutte, but several leaders in the Swiss ski resort have said the global economic order has irrevocably changed.\n\nKyle insisted international uncertainty was no reason not to press ahead with Labour’s agenda, highlighting the prospects of a “wave of opportunity that technology and life sciences and all these huge, huge, positive waves of innovation are going to present to us”.\n\nHe said: “If we are too intimidated by the global challenges, if we are too distracted by domestic political to and fro, then we will take our eye off the ball, and we will miss the opportunity of a lifetime, and that means real things to real people.\n\n“There will be kids growing up like me that will not end up becoming successful like I have. It’ll be communities that, at the moment, are poor, and they will never have a hope of becoming prosperous. And I won’t stand for it. I would literally do anything. And if that means betting [on] winners, and getting it wrong from time to time, I’ll take it.”\n\nAnnouncing the beefing up of the government’s “global talent taskforce” in his department, the business secretary suggested that the UK hoped to capitalise on the instability unleashed by Trump’s policies to help it attract jobs and investment.\n\n“I will suck the best talent in from wherever it exists, and talent goes both ways across the Atlantic. And I want to make sure that we have a good balance in that because for too long it’s been in one direction,” he said.\n\nHighlighting the need to attract innovators in particular, Kyle added: “America is being disruptive with tariffs, but America isn’t the most friendly place for scientific endeavour in any case at the moment. Do the maths and add up where we’re going with this. We are going out there and we’re saying: ‘Actually, we have one of the best regulatory environments in the world for life sciences, and across the board.’”\n\nKeir Starmer has taken a tough line on migration – despite pushback from some quarters in the party – promising to reduce it and condemning Boris Johnson’s administration for what the prime minister has called an “open borders experiment”.\n\nBut Kyle said he did not think public scepticism about migration extended to wealthy entrepreneurs. “People are deeply concerned about the immigration system we inherited, and the asylum system, which was overwhelmed, and was poorly administered by the Tories, and therefore broken,” he said.\n\n“I’ve never had anybody that says that people with a lot of money to invest in our country, who want to come here and create jobs, create businesses, shouldn’t be coming to do so.”\n\nHe added: “I have a taskforce that’s doing this, embedded in our global network. We can offer the world’s most talented a bespoke package to come to the UK swiftly, to embed, and then, of course, be part of a funding landscape that is bountiful.”\n\nThe 55-year-old MP for Hove and Portslade has been business secretary since Starmer’s September reshuffle, replacing Jonathan Reynolds, who had done the job for several years in opposition.\n\nKyle is politically close to the health secretary, Wes Streeting – who has been repeatedly mooted as a potential challenger to Starmer – but has been scrupulously loyal to the prime minister in public.\n\nEarlier this week, the business secretary rejected the suggestion that the UK try to negotiate a customs union with the EU, for which Streeting has signalled his support, telling the FT: “I think at the moment it would be foolish to slip towards what would be simple solutions.”\n\nKyle has dyslexia and left his state school “without any usable” qualifications, as he has put it. He made his way to university aged 25, and went on to secure a PhD, then worked in the charity sector before entering politics.\n\nIn his previous job of technology secretary, he was forced to defend his closeness to powerful tech companies. He is a regular user of the chatbot ChatGPT and an evangelist for the opportunities offered by the technology – and is often seen in the casual garb favoured by “tech bros”.\n\nSoon after taking on his current role, Kyle struck a deal with business groups and trade unions to water down the implementation of Labour’s Employment Rights Act, introducing a six-month probation period before the promised “day-tone rights” come into force.\n\nHe has continued to work closely with his successor and friend, Liz Kendall, and said he has insisted the connecting door that blocked the corridor between their two offices be opened up.\n\nAsked whether AI would cause mass layoffs as companies decide they can manage without entry-level staff – a hot topic at Davos – Kyle said: “People are anxious and it’s going to be painful and difficult because change is always painful and difficult.”\n\nKyle said Labour was ready to intervene to ensure the adoption of AI was less painful for poorer communities than the deindustrialisation of the 1980s, which cast a long shadow.\n\nHe said: “Waves of industrial change have always gone badly when governments stand on the sidelines and are not participants. And I will not allow that to happen.\n\n“As tech secretary I was negotiating deals for investment in digital infrastructure, insisting it happened in poorer parts of the country. I’m the gatekeeper into our country for a lot of investors. And if they want to come and benefit from our country, then they can contribute to it as well.”",

    "description": "Three robotics experts said humanoid robots need to move beyond flashy demos to performing tasks that are actually useful in the real world at scale.",
    "fullText": "Humanoid robots can do kung-fu and parkour. But can they make your morning coffee?\n\nAt a Davos panel on Thursday, moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, three robotics experts said humanoid robots needed to move beyond flashy demos and perform useful tasks in the real world at scale.\n\nJake Loosararian, the CEO of infrastructure startup Gecko Robotics, said that deploying robots into real-world environments was the major challenge facing the much-hyped industry.\n\n\"Deployment is the big problem right now for robotics, in terms of the ability for it to begin to make really large impacts, and for there to be a clear road map,\" said Loosararian.\n\nThe cofounder of the Pittsburgh-based company said that building reliable sources of data about the environments in which humanoid robots were operating would be critical for startups looking to move beyond flashy demos to real-world returns.\n\n\"You have to forward deploy and build your robots as close to the environment as possible. And that gives you the information and dataset that doesn't exist anywhere on the internet, anywhere on YouTube, about what these environments are like,\" Loosararian added.\n\nDaniela Rus, the director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said there was a gap between robots' ability to perform tasks in a laboratory and their ability to take on jobs traditionally done by humans in the real world.\n\n\"I can give you a robot that will fold your laundry and load your dishwasher, but it might cost you half a billion dollars,\" she said.\n\nRus said bridging that gap would require advancements in a humanoid robot's ability to perceive and manipulate the world through improved sensors and new AI models that can handle situations the robot may not have encountered before.\n\nShao Tianlan, the CEO of Chinese AI and robotics firm Mech-Mind, said that one big barrier to making humanoid robots useful in a factory environment was developing the capacity for them to learn directly from their human coworkers.\n\n\"If we want to deploy a robot, I would say demonstration is the most intuitive way to tell robots what to do. That's exactly how we humans teach others,\" he said.\n\nTianlan, who said that Mech-Mind had delivered more than 10,000 \"intelligent robots\" over the last 12 months, added that he did not believe humanoid robots needed \"Einstein-level\" intelligence to perform useful tasks, however.\n\nHe predicted that robots would take on some jobs performed by humans in controlled environments, such as in logistics and some service industries, in the next \"few hundred days.\"\n\nHumanoid robots are riding a wave of hype as companies like Tesla and Figure prepare to begin large-scale manufacturing of their machines. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made bold predictions about the company's Optimus robot, saying it could eliminate poverty and be the biggest product of all time.\n\nHowever, most humanoid robots have not yet been deployed in real-world environments. Many humanoid robot demos are staged in tightly controlled settings, and some use teleoperation, where human operators pilot the robots remotely.\n\nLoosararian called teleoperation the \"dirty little secret\" of robotics, adding that robotics companies had a responsibility to inform customers about whether their humanoid robots are operating autonomously or with human assistance.\n\n\"There's a lot of autonomy for certain tasks, but for the majority of the cases, for humanoids, it's learning in the environment, and it has to do that with teleoperation,\" Loosararian said.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk once called Davos \"boring af.\" After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him.\n\nThe billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details.\n\nMusk has previously avoided the conference, and the Tesla CEO has in the past criticized Davos and its organizing body, the World Economic Forum.\n\nAnticipation was therefore high after Musk was unexpectedly added to the schedule on Thursday morning.\n\nInterviewed by Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO and interim WEF cochair, Musk began by explaining Tesla's mission of \"abundance for all,\" largely reiterating comments he's previously made on X and in other interviews.\n\nThe world's richest man predicted that \"ubiquitous\" AI and robotics would lead to an unprecedented expansion of the global economy and ultimately render work obsolete, and predicted that \"AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively\" by 2030 or 2031.\n\n\"At a certain point, there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is there'll be more robots than people,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire did, however, share a more concrete timeline for Optimus: he expects Tesla to start selling the humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year.\n\nMusk didn't address Tesla's robotaxi rollout — another product critical to the company's future — beyond reiterating that he hoped to get approval for its Full Self-Driving technology in Europe and China next month. Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities.\n\nMuch of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months.\n\nMusk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space \"within a few years,\" adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth.\n\n\"The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,\" said Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a \"solvable problem,\" but warned that society could \"lack vibrancy\" if humans were able to live forever.\n\nMusk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements.\n\n\"I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right,\" he added.",

It's not a subtle thing,\" Musk said. \"The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body,\"\n\nBut Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives.\n\n\"You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society. Of things getting locked in place,\" he said. \"It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy, but that said, do I think we'll figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse aging? I think that's highly likely.\"\n\nMusk's surprise appearance was his first time onstage at the World Economic Forum, which he'd previously called \"boring af.\" His conversation with Fink was wide-ranging, but didn't reveal much new information.\n\nDozens of political and business leaders from across the globe gathered in Davos, Switzerland, this week to attend the World Economic Forum. The guest list included President Donald Trump, who made his case for the US to annex Greenland and the US's economic agenda during his address on Wednesday.\n\nTrump's push for Greenland has rattled European leaders and the US markets. It's also shocked Greenlanders, who have spoken against the annexation and the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" one resident said.\n\nTrump said the US would not use military force to take Greenland, but has leveraged tariffs against European countries in his campaign.\n\nThe weeklong event ends on Friday with closing remarks from WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning.",

    "fullText": "Estimate made by Center for Countering Digital Hate after Elon Musk’s AI image generation tool sparked outrage\n\nGrok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appear to depict children, according to researchers who said it “became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material”.\n\nThe estimate has been made by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) after Elon Musk’s AI image generation tool sparked international outrage when it allowed users to upload photographs of strangers and celebrities, digitally strip them to their underwear or into bikinis, put them in provocative poses and post the images on X.\n\nThe trend went viral over the new year, peaking on 2 January with 199,612 individual requests, according to analysis conducted by Peryton Intelligence, a digital intelligence company specialising in online hate.\n\nA fuller assessment of the output from the feature, from its launch on 29 December 2025 until 8 January 2026, has now been made by the CCDH. It suggests the impact of the technology may have been broader than previously thought. Public figures identified in sexualised images it analysed include Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Ice Spice, Nicki Minaj, Christina Hendricks, Millie Bobby Brown, the Swedish deputy prime minister Ebba Busch, and the former US vice-president Kamala Harris.\n\nThe feature was restricted to paid users on 9 January and further restrictions followed after the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful”. Other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, announced blocks on the AI tool.\n\nCCDH estimated that over the 11-day period, Grok was helping create sexualised images of children every 41 seconds. These included a selfie uploaded by a schoolgirl undressed by Grok, turning a “before school selfie” into an image of her in a bikini.\n\n“What we found was clear and disturbing: in that period Grok became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material,” said Imran Ahmed, CCDH’s chief executive. “Stripping a woman without their permission is sexual abuse. Throughout that period Elon was hyping the product even when it was clear to the world it was being used in this way. What Elon was ginning up was controversy, eyeballs, engagement and users. It was deeply disturbing.”\n\nHe added: “This has become a standard playbook for Silicon Valley, and in particular for social media and AI platforms. The incentives are all misaligned. They profit from this outrage. It’s not about Musk personally. This is about a system [with] perverse incentives and no minimum safeguards prescribed in law. And until regulators and lawmakers do their jobs and create a minimum expectation of safety, this will continue to happen.”\n\nX announced it had stopped its Grok feature from editing pictures of real people to show them in revealing clothes, including for premium subscribers, on 14 January.\n\nX referred to its statement from last week, which said: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.\n\n“We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking child sexual exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”",

    "fullText": "Video game publisher to cancel Prince of Persia remake and close studios after several difficult years\n\nThe video game publisher behind the Assassin’s Creed series has cancelled six projects including a remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time as it fights to stay competitive in the global gaming market.\n\nUbisoft announced a sweeping reorganisation and said it would cancel six games, sending its shares to their lowest level in more than a decade on Thursday.\n\nUbisoft is abandoning development of six titles, including a highly anticipated remake of Prince of Persia – a series that dates back to 1989 and received an ill-fated Hollywood adaptation in 2010 – and delaying a further seven. Studios in Halifax, Canada and Stockholm are being closed, with restructuring to follow in other countries, it said.\n\nAfter the announcement, Ubisoft’s shares fell by a third to their lowest level since 2011 on Thursday, valuing the company at €590m (£514m) compared with a peak of more than €10bn in the previous decade. The Paris-based company said it planned to split its operations into five creative divisions organised by genre, part of a broader attempt to sharpen focus and rein in costs after years of disappointing releases and weak results.\n\nThe company said the restructuring was driven by the competitive market for AAA games, the term for big-budget, high-profile titles such as Grand Theft Auto.\n\n“The triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,” said Ubisoft’s founder and chief executive, Yves Guillemot.\n\nHowever, Guillemot added that successful triple-A games have “more financial potential than ever”.\n\nUbisoft also blamed an “increasingly competitive market” for shooters, a key genre for the industry.\n\nLaurent Michaud, a gaming industry economist, said action adventure titles such as Prince of Persia were out of step with a market dominated currently by shooters like Fortnite and Call of Duty, cooperative adventure titles such as Peak and sports titles and multiplayer games such as those available on the Roblox platform.\n\n“The expectations of gamers are quite different to where they were 10 years ago. That’s why it’s difficult to keep in touch with an audience that has changed so much over the years.”\n\nHe added: “Ubisoft is still one of the most popular content providers in the video games industry. It has developed one of the best IP slates in the industry but even if the games are really good, it is not enough. It has to meet people’s expectations and tastes.”\n\nThe latest overhaul follows several difficult years marked by game delays, cancellations and weak execution, which have eroded investor confidence and strained the group’s finances. In November 2025, Ubisoft postponed the publication of its half-year results at the last minute, triggering a week-long suspension of trading in its shares and bonds. The company later said an accounting change had revealed a breach of the terms for its debt.",

    "fullText": "There are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced\n\nDavid Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.\n\nCurrent commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver said then in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”\n\n“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”\n\nFor decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.\n\nYet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won the Premier League just about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.\n\nConcerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double as handy instruments to write off taxes for billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.\n\nLately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.\n\nThey can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.\n\nThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rules now tweaked to merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.\n\nMore tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)\n\nCertainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.\n\nAt least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.\n\nThat’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

    "description": "Olympic legend Katie Ledecky loves training. Her workout tips make it easier to exercise to build muscle, strength, and speed like an elite athlete.",
    "fullText": "One of the most decorated Olympians of all time said that after decades of training, she's still excited to work out.\n\nKatie Ledecky has earned 14 Olympic medals (nine of them gold) for her prowess in the pool. In events like the 800-meter freestyle, she's her own biggest competition, breaking her own world records in the quest for her personal best.\n\n\"I do really love the training,\" she told Business Insider. \"And I think because I love the training, it makes it very easy to go to practice every day and really continue to strive toward these big goals that I've set for myself.\"\n\nLedecky's training plan involves long hours in the pool, of course. But her dry-land workouts incorporate a mix of high-intensity circuits and weightlifting to build muscle.\n\n\"Swimming is a full-body exercise. So upper body strength, lower body strength, core strength, mobility, all those things are important,\" Ledecky said.\n\nThe gold medalist's approach can help you get the most out of your gym time even if you're not headed for the Olympics, with simple strategies to level up your workouts.\n\nA typical workout for Ledecky includes movements like cleans, squats, deadlifts, and pull-ups that help build explosive athleticism to stay ahead in the pool.\n\n\"Things like that translate well to developing power and pushing off the wall,\" she said.\n\nNon-swimmers can benefit, too: full-body exercises are one of the most efficient ways to build muscle, since you're working arms, legs, core, and back all at once. They can also improve mobility if you're training in a full range of motion.\n\nLedecky also incorporates circuit training with bike sprints and sled pushes. These shorter bursts of high-intensity exercise are great for improving your cardio fitness when you're short on time, and are linked to better longevity.\n\nLedecky has been swimming since she was six, and competed at her first Olympics (London 2012) at age 15.\n\nSince then, she's been to the Olympics three more times, dominating at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, in Tokyo 2020, and Paris 2024. She's also held multiple World Championship titles.\n\nThe training doesn't stop between big events. To stay focused leading up to international competitions, she said her approach is all about showing up to put in the work, over and over again.\n\n\"I've just always had a goal of consistency and I take it one year at a time, one day at a time,\" Ledecky said.\n\nFor everyday athletes, it's a good reminder to find a sustainable exercise routine. Personal trainers recommend starting small and building up over time, since exercise only works if you can keep doing it long enough to see results.\n\nLedecky said one of her favorite aspects of swimming is the intensely supportive community, from the youngest athletes who start at age six to the most elite competitors.\n\n\"It's seen very much as an individual sport, but I think many swimmers would say they couldn't do it without their team. There's such great camaraderie,\" she said.\n\nThat team spirit, encouragement, and playful rivalry among friends is what keeps Ledecky going through early-morning sessions in a cold pool and long hours of hard training.\n\nA good fitness community can make a big difference for everyday athletes, too — research shows you're more likely to stick to a workout plan and get results if you find a gym buddy (or many).\n\n\"It makes the motivation piece really easy when you know that you're in it with someone else,\" Ledecky said.\n\nFor peak performance, training is only part of the equation. Resting is crucial to allow the body to build back stronger. Ledecky has been competing for over a decade, and at 28 said she needs more recovery time than before.\n\n\"When I was 15, I don't remember ever feeling tired,\" she said. \"I'm definitely making sure that I'm getting extra sleep at night and getting naps in when I can.\"\n\nThe Olympian said she prioritizes getting enough sleep and eating a balanced diet (she loves a veggie omelet and has a partnership with egg brand Eggland's Best). The basic habits work better than an elaborate or high-tech protocol, according to Ledecky.\n\n\"It's not anything too crazy or too out there,\" she said. \"It's really just the simple things I think are the most important things.\"",

    "fullText": "First one-day international, R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo\n\nSri Lanka 271-6 (50 overs): K Mendis 93 (117), Liyange 46 (53); Rashid 3-44\n\nEngland 252 (49.2 overs): Duckett 62, Root 61; Madushan 3-39\n\nSri Lanka won by 19 runs, lead three-match series 1-0\n\nEngland changed formats and opponents, yet still followed their dismal Ashes campaign with defeat by Sri Lanka in the first one-day international in Colombo.\n\nOnly two weeks after the completion of their 4-1 series defeat in Australia, England were choked by the Sri Lanka spinners on a slow, low surface.\n\nSet a taxing 272 to win thanks to 93 not out from Kusal Mendis, the tourists were given a platform by a much-needed 62 from Ben Duckett and a typically classy 61 by Joe Root.\n\nBut both were out playing sweeps to the skilful Sri Lankans, and the required rate spiralled out of England's control.\n\nThe visitors lost eight wickets for 84 runs, including Harry Brook and Jacob Bethell both stumped.\n\nJamie Overton's hitting meant 20 were needed off the final over, but his miscue to cover left England 252 all out. The margin of 19 runs made the contest look closer than it was.\n\nEngland go 1-0 down in the three-match series, having now lost their last 11 ODIs away from home.\n\nThe second match of the series is at the same ground on Saturday.\n\nIn the aftermath of a high-stakes, high-intensity Ashes series, the contrast of a low-key tour of Sri Lanka could either be a welcome change for England, or an unwanted return to the grind.\n\nFive of England's Ashes squad were in the XI in Colombo. A sixth man, Will Jacks, would have played, only to be ruled out by illness. Brydon Carse is also in the squad.\n\nThere are consequences to this ODI series and the three T20s that follow. England need ODI wins to ensure automatic qualification for the 2027 World Cup, while the T20s are preparation for the World Cup in the shortest format next month.\n\nFor head coach Brendon McCullum, wins in the white-ball format may ease some of the pressure on his position. Captain Brook needs positive results on the field to move on from the controversy of being punched by a nightclub bouncer in Wellington.\n\nConditions that demand the bowling of and batting against spin are a historical weakness for England, and the task for the Ashes players was made all the harder given the switch from the pace and bounce of Australia.\n\nAfter the criticism of their preparation down under, England had only two training sessions in Colombo – this time no fault of their own because of the tight turnaround.\n\nThey can expect plenty more spin in the coming weeks. Their challenge is to adapt and improve quickly.\n\nA target of 272 was modest by the standards of modern ODIs, but well above par at this venue – only three times have more runs been chased to win a one-dayer on this ground.\n\nZak Crawley, playing his first ODI in more than two years, was out in familiar fashion – edging a drive at a wide one for only six, before Root and Duckett gave England a chance.\n\nDuckett looked horribly out of touch, swishing and swiping. The left-hander had 21 from the first 37 balls he faced, then found rhythm after two fours in the same over. This was his highest score in any cricket since the last Test against India in July.\n\nRoot, an expert in these conditions, was sublime, finding gaps and running hard. Still, even at 129-1, England were not fully in control.\n\nDuckett was lbw reverse-sweeping the leg-spin of Jeffrey Vandersay, Root leg before conventionally sweeping the off-spin of Dhananjaya da Silva delivered from round the wicket. England fell apart.\n\nSri Lanka found increasing turn, England found ways to get out. Brook ran past Chamira Asalanka to be stumped down the leg side and Bethell – who struggled to 15 off 32 balls – was stumped between bat and pad off left-armer Dunith Wellalage.\n\nAs England faltered, they were given some hope by Rehan Ahmed's 27, until he was brilliantly caught relay-style by Wellalage at long-off. Overton clubbed 34 from 17, though a heist never seemed likely.\n\nEngland named three frontline spinners - Jacks was replaced by Ahmed – and probably needed more. Bethell only bowled three overs of his left-arm spin, Root did not bowl at all.\n\nThe 33 overs of spin delivered by England was their second-most in an ODI. Adil Rashid was superb, dropping his pace for 3-44, while Liam Dawson managed 41 dots in his 1-31.\n\nCurran also impressed with his variations. At times he was almost bowling left-arm spin, and a 49mph 'moon ball' deceived Pathum Nissanka for England's first wicket.\n\nWhen Sri Lanka were 124-4, England had the opportunity to restrict the hosts, only for Mendis and Janith Liyanage to build a crucial partnership of 88, helped by some England errors in the field.\n\nLiyanage crunched two sixes in his 46, while wicketkeeper Mendis used all his experience and nous to hold the innings together. Time and again he showed deft touches to find the boundary behind square on the off side.\n\nWith Mendis as the fulcrum, Sri Lanka found 80 runs from the final 10 overs, an acceleration that would later prove beyond England.\n\nOverton's hit-the-deck style was entirely unsuitable to the surface and he went at more than seven an over. Wellalage took him for three fours and a six in a final over that cost 23 – vital given the eventual difference between the two sides.\n\nEngland in Sri Lanka 2026 - schedule\n\nEngland captain Harry Brook: \"[The toss] proved very crucial in the end. Sri Lanka played a very good game and deserved the victory.\n\n\"We bowled really well through the middle. Spinners bowled exceptionally well. But they got hold of us in the last over - but that's part of one-day and white-ball cricket.\n\n\"They've got extremely good spinners who were able to get enough out of the surface. They challenged us in a lot of different departments.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka: \"I know that are a few areas we need to improve, especially fast bowling.\n\n\"We knew that the first 25 overs it wasn't going to spin. Suddenly I think after the 25th-30th over it started, and we bowled really well.\"\n\nWhat is Curran's ultra-slow 'moon ball' leaving batters in a spin?\n\nWright stands down as England national selector\n\nSL hold nerve to beat England despite Overton's late hitting - as it happened",
