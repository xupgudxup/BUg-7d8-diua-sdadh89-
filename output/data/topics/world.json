    "title": "WWE's John Cena Says He Was 'Apprehensive' About Breaking Ric Flair's Title Record",
    "description": "John Cena reflects on winning 17 world titles, claims he was unsure about surpassing Ric Flair's iconic championship record due to his respect for the legend.",
    "fullText": "Just three months into his farewell tour this year, John Cena captured his 17th world title when he defeated Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41, officially surpassing Ric Flair's long-standing record of 16 world championships. Cena originally tied Flair in 2017 when he finally scored a victory over AJ Styles, but for years fans questioned if WWE would allow the 48-year-old to become the sole holder of the milestone. However, Cena himself was unsure about beating Flair's record, as he outlined his respect for \"The Nature Boy\" during in an interview on \"Insight,\" and hopes to one day congratulate the performer that wins 18 world titles.\n\n\"I have been apprehensive for quite some time for that because I love Ric. Super mentor to me. Always been a great guy to me and I love him. I meant what I said in the press conference at Rumble ... I want to win 17 so I can shake the hand of the performer that wins 18. So what it meant to me personally was like, hey youngins, one of them is going to be you or you better get working because I don't want to be in the ground when 18 happens. I want to shake somebody's hand and something that's impossible is now possible. So that's what it means to me of hopefully by my actions, this is possible, and holy hell this guy wants to shake my hand when I pass it and I can't wait to do that.\"\n\nCena's Undisputed WWE Championship reign would last 105 days before he was dethroned by Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam this past August. Cena never received an opportunity to win back the gold, and instead set his sights on the Intercontinental Title, where he would defeat Dominik Mysterio and officially become a Grand Slam Champion.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

The vessel, known as Puffer Fish Blue 01, developed by China's Wuhu Shipyard and Sandianshui New Energy Technology, had been certified by the China Classification Society, a professional body for ship classification, it added.\n\n\"Their investment and efforts to build pure electric container vessels show China's increasing influence in the global shipbuilding industry,\" said Xiong Hao, assistant general ­manager at Shanghai Jump International Shipping. \"It remains to be seen whether electric vessels will be widely accepted by global container liners.\"\n\nPeople visit a model of a nuclear-powered container ship at Marintec China 2025 in Shanghai on December 2, 2025.

According to the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, 159 countries have recognized Palestine. The vast majority of the international community believes that a two-state solution is the only way to end decades of conflict.\n\nNetanyahu's government has said the international push for a Palestinian state rewards Hamas.\n\nHere are some global reactions to the Australia shooting:\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei condemned the attack: “Terrorism and the killing of people, wherever they occur, are unacceptable and must be condemned.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington strongly condemned the attack and that “Antisemitism has no place in this world.”\n\nKing Charles III said he was “appalled and saddened.” He also leads the Commonwealth, and the office of Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Sunday said Herzog had reached out to the king in September warning of an “epidemic of antisemitism” in three Commonwealth countries: Britain, Canada and Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, police in London said they would step up security at Jewish sites.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack “has left me speechless” and added that “this is an attack on our shared values. We must stop this antisemitism, here in Germany and worldwide.”\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified and that “My heart is with the Jewish community worldwide on this first day of Hannukah, a festival celebrating the miracle of peace and light vanquishing darkness.”\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the “ghastly terrorist attack” and said that “we stand in solidarity with the people of Australia in this hour of grief.”\n\nThe organization's president, Ronald Lauder, said that “No community should ever fear ​coming together to celebrate its faith, traditions, or identity,” adding: “Make no mistake, this will not break us.\"\n\n\"I’m surrounded by antisemitic graffiti constantly. I think for our community in the east (of Sydney), and as a Christian, I just want to declare I stand with the people of Israel,” Anglican pastor Matt Graham told Australian Broadcasting Corp. He said he had been conducting a service at the nearby Bondi Anglican Church when panicked people began entering to take shelter.",

    "fullText": "Paul Lim became the oldest player to win a match at the PDC World Championship as the 71-year-old claimed a stunning victory over Jeffrey de Graaf.\n\nBacked by a partisan crowd at the Alexandra Palace, the Singapore veteran claimed a 3-1 success over the Dutch-born Swede.\n\nHe beat a record held by Northern Irishman John MaGowan, who was 67 when he knocked out Chris Mason in the first round of the tournament in December 2008.\n\n\"A moment like this has kept me going for all these years,\" said Lim.\n\n\"The standard of play nowadays is not like how it was before. This tournament is the Super Bowl of darts so I would say this is a good moment.\"\n\nLim will face Luke Humphries in the second round after the 2024 world champion progressed with a 3-1 win over Ted Evetts in his opening match later on Saturday evening.\n\nHumphries had cruised into a 2-0 lead against his fellow Englishman before Evetts pinched a set back.\n\nHowever, 30-year-old Humphries regained his intensity and clinically finished out the contest with an average of 98.58, throwing eight 180s.\n\nLim, who thew the first world championship nine-darter at the BDO event at Lakeside in 1990, beat Humphries when the pair last met at the Ally Pally five years ago.\n\nOn meeting again, Humphries told Sky Sports: \"He's amazing, he's a legend. The crowd are going to be against me so it's going to be a tough game.\"\n\nLim said: \"I hope on a given day it can happen again. I never give up. He is good but he can be beaten.\"\n\nThe crowd roared on Lim, who is 72 next month, when he won the first set against De Graaf before his opponent levelled the match.\n\nLim went ahead again after a scrappy third set as De Graaf wilted while the experienced 'Singapore Slinger' held his nerve in a tense fourth, sealing victory with an average of 86.52.\n\nFive-time world championship semi-finalist Wayne Mardle said Lim was able to \"take his chances\" against De Graaf to secure an \"incredible\" win.\n\n\"If you have the desire, the passion but most of all the ability humans can achieve amazing things - and that was amazing,\" said Mardle on Sky.\n\nDe Graaf was six years old when Lim made his PDC debut 29 years ago.\n\nElsewhere, Wessel Nijman of the Netherlands eased to a 3-0 win over Czech Karel Sedlacek while Germany's Gabriel Clemens beat American Alex Spellman by the same scoreline.",

    "description": "Liverpool Lead Race for Arda Guler as Salah Future Dominates DebateLiverpool’s season has drifted into uncomfortable territory, a campaign that promised authority now defined by uncertainty. Arne Sl...",
    "fullText": "Liverpool’s season has drifted into uncomfortable territory, a campaign that promised authority now defined by uncertainty. Arne Slot arrived with ideas and conviction, yet results and performances have not matched the expectations that followed last season’s momentum. Anfield Watch have reported on growing unease around Mohamed Salah’s future and the increasing noise linking Liverpool with Real Madrid youngster Arda Guler. It reads like a club standing at a crossroads, unsure whether renewal must be accelerated or merely prepared.\n\nLiverpool were widely tipped as early pace setters, but inconsistency has dulled that edge. The forwards, usually the club’s heartbeat, have faltered. Mohamed Salah’s form has dipped and his frustration has spilled into public view after being benched, creating what can only be described as a destabilising subplot. One source describes how this reaction has fuelled speculation that Salah’s time on Merseyside could end as early as January.\n\nThe Egyptian remains an elite performer, even if recent weeks suggest fatigue or tactical discomfort. His quality, vision, and instinct still define Liverpool’s attacking identity. Yet football moves quickly. Clubs that stand still often fall behind, and the sense grows that contingency planning has already begun.\n\nThat preparation centres on Arda Guler. According to reports, Liverpool are now leading the race to sign the Turkiye international, despite interest from Arsenal and Manchester United. The appeal is clear. Guler is described as a ‘perfect fit’ due to his adaptability within an ever evolving system. Slot is reportedly a ‘fan’ of the 20 year old, while Liverpool’s scouting department are said to be ‘impressed’ by his talent.\n\nGuler’s technical control and spatial awareness speak to a player comfortable between lines, a modern attacker who could thrive in fluid structures. He would not replicate Salah directly, few could, but he represents a different solution to a similar problem, creativity where it has recently gone missing.\n\nLiverpool’s summer spending raised expectations further. Over £200 million invested in Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak was meant to transform attacking output. Instead, Dominik Szoboszlai has emerged as the most consistent contributor, a reminder that solutions do not always come with the largest price tag.\n\nThe lack of goals and invention has defined Liverpool’s struggles. Guler, with his close control and progressive passing, could address both. Whether his arrival depends entirely on Salah’s future remains unclear, but the logic behind the interest is hard to ignore.\n\nThis report lands like a jolt to the system for Liverpool supporters. There is excitement in being linked with a talent like Guler, but also deep concern about what it represents. Seeing Salah’s future openly questioned feels unsettling. He has carried this club through defining moments, and the idea of January rumours turning into reality is genuinely shocking.\n\nThere is scepticism too. Spending heavily on Wirtz and Isak only to still search for creativity feels like an admission that the rebuild has misfired. Fans expected Slot’s methods to elevate the squad, not expose gaps so quickly.\n\nAt the same time, Guler sparks anticipation. Supporters crave invention, someone who can unlock stubborn defences and lift the tempo. The thought of a fearless 20 year old stepping into a side searching for identity is exciting, but also risky. Liverpool are not a development club, they are a pressure cooker.\n\nMost of all, this feels like a moment of truth. Either Salah recommits and the squad recalibrates around him, or Liverpool turn the page faster than anyone expected. Right now, belief is mixed with anxiety, hope edged with disappointment.",

In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that the EV market share in the US would nearly halve to around 5% in the near term.\n\nBenchmark Mineral Intelligence cited the $7,500 EV tax credit ending in September as a reason for \"subdued\" sales in the US, along with the Trump administration relaxing rules for automakers designed to encourage the transition to EVs and hybrids.\n\nElon Musk's Tesla has had a rocky year in almost all of its biggest markets, but it weathered the October drop-off better than its rivals, according to separate data from Cox Automotive. The world's most valuable car company, however, is facing a race against time to avoid a second consecutive year of declining sales.\n\nOther US EV makers have been hit by slowing demand, with GM and Rivian both announcing layoffs in recent months.\n\nChina's overall EV sales were up 19%. While BYD, the country's biggest EV maker, hit a rough patch in its home market amid rising competition from local startups, it set a record for EV exports in October.\n\nGlobally, EV sales were up 21% compared to last year, the Benchmark Mineral Intelligence data showed.\n\n\"Overall, EV demand remains resilient, supported by expanding model ranges and sustained policy incentives worldwide,\" said Charles Lester, data manager for Rho Motion, the Benchmark subsidiary behind the report.",

    "fullText": "Over the last few months, we've written about where billionaires live and how the uber-rich spend their money.\n\nA new report from UBS has the answers. This year, the bank conducted its annual survey of billionaire clients on several topics, including where they plan to invest their money for 12-month and five-year periods.\n\nOptimism in the near term seems to be highest around two areas in particular compared to 2024: Western Europe and China.\n\nForty percent of respondents said they see opportunity in Western Europe over the next 12 months, up from 18% in 2024. For China, 34% of respondents see opportunity versus 11% last year.\n\nThe Asia Pacific region, excluding China, also saw an eight percentage point jump in interest, with 33% of respondents bullish.\n\nOn the flip side, North America has dipped the most in popularity. While 80% of respondents liked the region in the 2024 survey, just 63% said they did in 2025\n\nThe shifts in sentiment are due to a number of risks that worry billionaires, the primary among them being tariffs.\n\nSixty-six percent of respondents cited tariffs as one of the factors \"most likely to negatively impact the market environment over 12 months.\" That was followed by a potential major geopolitical conflict at 63%, policy uncertainty at 59%, and higher inflation at 44%.\n\n\"I do not see North America as the top investment destination, even though its markets remain deep and innovative,\" one of UBS's European clients said. \"For us, geographic concentration creates risk, and the better opportunity lies in diversification. We prefer to shift focus toward real assets, which offer more tangible value and protection in volatile or inflationary environments. Equities over bonds can make sense in the current cycle, but our approach emphasizes stability and resilience rather than short-term market moves.\"\n\nStill, while shorter-term outlooks have changed since last year, views for the next five years have generally stayed the same for most regions compared to 2024.\n\nThe report also shared which assets exactly billionaire investors plan to put their money into.\n\nPrivate, not public, equity was the most common asset where respondents said they intend to put their money over the next 12 months. Forty-nine percent said they plan to have their money in direct private equity investments.\n\nThe next most common places to invest were in hedge funds and public developed market equities, both at 43%. Emerging market public equities (37%) and private equity funds (35%) were the next most popular answers.\n\nAt the same time, respondents also showed higher intentions of pulling their money out of private equity than publicly traded stocks.\n\nExamples of funds that offer exposure to the public assets billionaire investors are most bullish on for the year ahead include the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU), iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI), the Global X Emerging Markets ex-China ETF (EMM), and the Vanguard Tax Managed Fund FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA).",

    "fullText": "The automotive world has given us incredible engineering feats, iconic designs, and moments that changed transportation forever. But alongside these achievements are puzzles that have captivated enthusiasts for decades.\n\nFrom legendary prototypes that vanished without a trace to engineering decisions that still spark heated debates, these mysteries remind us that car history isn't always written in stone.\n\nSome questions may never have definitive answers, and honestly, that's part of what makes them so fascinating to discuss over a wrench and a cold drink in the garage. The following mysteries have different endings: while some have a pretty possible answer, others still have us scratching our heads.\n\nSteve McQueen's 1968 Highland Green Mustang GT from Bullitt became one of the most famous movie cars ever, but for decades, nobody knew where it was. Two identical Mustangs were used for filming, and while one was long believed to have met its end as a battered camera car, the hero car seemingly disappeared into thin air.\n\nThe automotive community spent years hunting for it, with rumors placing it everywhere from Mexico to a Kentucky junkyard. Then in 2018, it reappeared at the Detroit Auto Show, having been quietly owned by the same family since 1974.\n\nThe owner had kept it largely original, complete with movie modifications and that iconic roar, proving that sometimes the best hiding place is simply staying quiet.\n\nPreston Tucker’s 1948 Tucker ’48 Sedan was genuinely ahead of its time, featuring a rear-mounted engine, four-wheel independent suspension, and innovative safety features that Detroit wouldn’t adopt for decades. Tucker had originally promoted disc brakes and fuel injection, but those ideas were dropped before production.\n\nBut his ambitious venture collapsed amid controversy, SEC investigations, and allegations that were later dismissed in court. While Tucker was acquitted of all fraud charges, his company was already finished, leaving only 51 cars ever produced.\n\nWhether it was a case of an innovator crushed by established industry forces or a business that simply overreached remains one of automotive history's great debates.\n\nEveryone knows the 1966 Batmobile was built from a Lincoln Futura concept car by legendary customizer George Barris, but the question of what engine actually propelled it has caused decades of confusion. The Lincoln Futura originally had a 368-cubic-inch Lincoln V8, but various sources have claimed everything from keeping the original engine to swapping in a 390 or even a 429.\n\nBarris himself gave different answers over the years, and the car underwent modifications throughout its life. Three additional Batmobiles were built for promotional tours, each potentially configured differently, further muddying the waters.\n\nFor a car that's supposed to represent cutting-edge crime-fighting technology, its actual mechanical specifications remain surprisingly mysterious.\n\nGeneral Motors' EV1, launched in 1996, was the first mass-produced electric vehicle of the modern era and developed a passionate following among its lessees. When GM abruptly canceled the program in 2003, they made the controversial decision to reclaim and crush nearly every single vehicle, despite protests from drivers who wanted to purchase them.\n\nThe company cited parts, liability, and lack of profitability as reasons, but the dramatic destruction of a functioning, beloved product seemed extreme to many. Only about 40 EV1s survived, most of them deactivated and donated to museums and universities with their powertrains disabled so they couldn’t be legally driven on public roads, although a tiny handful have been kept or made operational again under very controlled circumstances.\n\nThe whole saga spawned documentaries and conspiracy theories, making the EV1's fate one of the strangest chapters in automotive history.\n\nThere's a popular story that Enzo Ferrari viewed road car production as merely a necessary evil to finance his true passion of racing. The famous quote attributed to him suggests he built and sold road cars only because he couldn't fund his racing operation any other way.\n\nWhile this makes for a compelling narrative that certainly captures Ferrari's racing-first mentality, historians debate whether it oversimplifies a more complex business reality. Ferrari clearly prioritized racing above all else, but the company's business model required both sides to function.\n\nWhether Enzo truly saw customers as merely checkbooks for his racing dreams or understood the symbiotic relationship between the two remains open to interpretation, though his legendary indifference to customer complaints certainly supports the popular version.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Chrysler built 55 stunning turbine-powered cars and loaned them to regular families across America for real-world testing. These weren't just concepts, they were fully functional vehicles with bronze metallic paint, rotating turbine-inspired taillights, and jet engines that could run on almost anything from diesel to perfume.\n\nThe program ran from 1963 to 1966, and the cars performed surprisingly well, but Chrysler ultimately decided not to pursue production. Here's where it gets weird: of the 55 cars built, Chrysler destroyed 46 of them, mainly to avoid long-term liability and support problems with such a unique fleet in private hands (the often-repeated ‘import duties on the Italian bodies’ explanation is only part of the story), leaving just nine survivors.\n\nThose nine survivors are scattered among museums, with a few in private collections, representing one of the boldest experiments that almost changed automotive history but didn't.\n\nMazda's unwavering commitment to the rotary engine, even when it nearly bankrupted the company multiple times, remains one of automotive history's most puzzling strategic decisions. The Wankel rotary engine offered a smoother, more compact alternative to piston engines, and Mazda licensed the technology in the 1960s with genuine enthusiasm.\n\nDespite chronic issues with fuel economy, oil consumption, and emissions regulations, Mazda kept developing rotaries for decades, culminating in the legendary RX-7 and RX-8. The company invested massive resources into an engine design that most manufacturers had already abandoned as impractical.\n\nWhile enthusiasts celebrate Mazda's dedication to uniqueness and the rotary's undeniable character, it's still unclear whether this was visionary persistence or stubborn defiance of market reality.\n\nJohn DeLorean's stainless steel sports car dream became reality with substantial backing from the British government, which invested over $120 million in a factory in Northern Ireland. The deal seemed too good to be true for an unproven car company, and it was: the project collapsed amid allegations of drug trafficking in a controversial FBI sting operation.\n\nDeLorean was eventually acquitted on grounds of entrapment, but by then, the company was finished after producing only about 9,000 cars. Questions remain about the financial arrangements, government motivations, and whether the whole venture was viable from the start.\n\nThe DeLorean story has everything: innovation, government intrigue, legal drama, and ultimately, immortality through Back to the Future.\n\nMost people credit Pontiac's 1964 GTO as the first muscle car, creating the formula of stuffing a big engine into a midsize body. But Studebaker enthusiasts will quickly point out that the 1963 Avanti R3 and the 1963-64 Lark Daytona with the R2 supercharged engine came first, offering serious performance in relatively affordable packages.\n\nStudebaker was installing high-performance V8s in compact bodies before Pontiac made it famous. The debate comes down to definitions: was it about the specific formula, the marketing approach, or the cultural impact? Studebaker certainly had the hardware first, but Pontiac created the phenomenon.\n\nWhether this makes Studebaker the forgotten originator or simply an earlier experiment depends on how you define the category itself.\n\nIt's estimated that hundreds of thousands of cars were built between 1900 and 1915, yet remarkably few survive today compared to later eras. These early automobiles, often called \"brass-era\" cars for their prominent brass fixtures, have survival rates that seem impossibly low given the sheer numbers produced.\n\nMany were simply worn out and scrapped, but that doesn't fully explain where they all went. The materials were valuable during wartime scrap drives, they were considered worthless old junk long before anyone thought to preserve them, and many likely decayed in barns and fields before anyone recognized their historical value.\n\nThe few survivors command enormous prices today, making you wonder how many treasures are still hiding in forgotten corners waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe 427 Shelby Cobra has legendary performance figures that seem to vary depending on who's telling the story and which magazine you're reading. While we know the top speed, published 0-60 times range from 3.5 to 4.5 seconds, and quarter-mile times are similarly inconsistent.\n\nThe problem is that these weren't factory cars with standardized specifications; they were essentially hand-built race cars with street registration, each potentially different. Testing conditions varied wildly, some cars had race modifications, and Carroll Shelby himself was known for optimistic claims. Modern recreations and continuation cars add to the confusion by posting different numbers with modern tires and tuning.\n\nFor a car that's supposed to represent pure, raw American performance, we still can't quite pin down exactly how raw it really was.\n\nThe Pontiac Fiero suffered from one of the strangest reputation spirals in automotive history, earning a “fire hazard” label that stuck far harder than the underlying facts.\n\nEarly 1984 Fieros did experience a higher-than-normal rate of engine fires, largely due to a connecting-rod failure in the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. But contrary to the common retelling, GM didn’t solve the problem overnight—the company didn’t issue a full recall until late 1987, after several years of incidents and negative publicity. By that time, the damage to the Fiero’s image was irreversible. Ironically, once the mechanical issues were addressed, later Fieros had fire incident rates much closer to other cars of the era.\n\nAnd when Pontiac finally perfected the formula with the vastly improved 1988 suspension and upgraded powertrains, the car was already living under a cloud it couldn’t escape. The Fiero remains a case study in how early flaws—and delayed corporate responses—can overshadow genuine engineering progress.\n\nThese automotive mysteries remind us that history isn't always as clear-cut as we'd like it to be. Some puzzles stem from lost documentation, others from deliberate secrecy, and still others from the simple fact that people remember things differently over time.\n\nWhat makes these stories fascinating isn't necessarily finding definitive answers, but the conversations they spark and the detective work they inspire. The next time you're at a car show or scrolling through auction listings, remember that automotive history is still being written and rewritten.\n\nWho knows what forgotten prototype might be gathering dust in someone's garage, or what long-held belief might be overturned by newly discovered documents tomorrow.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI/SINGAPORE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Taiwan's tech-heavy stocks show few signs of slowing a rally even as AI bubble worries cast a shadow over global markets, underscoring home-grown confidence in the structural advantages in AI that foreign investors may have overlooked.\n\nTaiwan's benchmark index is poised to breach ​a record 30,000 points in 2026, investors say, extending a three-year surge that has seen the stock market nearly double as the island rides a wave of demand ‌for chips that power artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile foreign money worries about stretched AI valuations, Taiwanese investors have enthusiastically ploughed into the market.\n\nAnalysts say domestic investors are betting on Taiwan's unique position as the lynchpin of an AI supply chain, where ‌even increasing competition in the sector would only benefit Taiwanese firms, including TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.\n\nOne major focus of anxiety around AI comes from uncertainty about Nvidia's ability to sustain its market dominance, with Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) emerging as a potentially more cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nBut it's a win-win scenario for Taiwan because the island is essential to supply chains of both the GPU and TPU, the building blocks of AI computing power.\n\n\"Taiwan is a major beneficiary of the AI market,\" said Piter Yang, a fund manager of Fuh Hwa Securities Investment Trust Co, citing the ⁠advantage of Taiwan being the world's semiconductor hub.\n\nAnd for now, as ‌a promising future fuels optimism, Taiwan markets and local investors seem relatively unfazed by the AI bubble fears, just as they remain calm in the face of rising geopolitical tensions with Beijing that have often spooked foreign investors.\n\nGains in Taiwan's market have also been underpinned ‍by earnings growth, leaving it with a reasonably steady price-to-earnings ratio of 21, below that of the Nasdaq and the Nikkei, meaning the rally has not made stocks more expensive.\n\n\"We are not worried about an AI bubble,\" said Li Fang-kuo, chairman of the securities investment arm of food conglomerate Uni-President. \"We are comfortable with where the valuations stand.\"\n\nLi pointed out that several of the magnificent seven companies in the U.S. have gross ​margins of as much as 70% or higher. \"So it's not comparable to the dot-com bubble, when companies were not generating meaningful earnings.\"",

Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem, the council's co-chair, left a congressional hearing early because she said she needed to attend it.\n\n“We will not be downsizing our home, but we do have rental income of about $1,500 per month.”\n\nThe content creator, who had over 400,000 followers across multiple Instagram accounts, shared a haunting final post the day before her death\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker was hospitalized on Dec. 11 after experiencing lung discomfort at the team's practice facility",

    "description": "A tomb beneath Petra’s Treasury reveals 12 skeletons and 2,000-year-old artifacts. Archaeologists call it a rare find, unlocking secrets of the Nabataeans.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA new tomb was discovered at Petra’s Khazneh, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\n\nThe tomb’s discovery, as revealed on Discovery Channel’s “Expedition Unknown,” also included 12 skeletons from over 2,000 years ago.\n\nIn addition to being a true archaeological marvel, the ornate facade of Jordan’s ancient city of Petra has served as a backdrop in a number of movies, including “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”\n\nThe sandstone cliff faces of the ancient city of Petra (one of the New Seven Wonders of the World) have long been in the archaeological limelight. They’ve even spent time in the Hollywood limelight as the location for several scenes in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But in a recent on-screen appearance—and no offense to Harrison Ford’s iconic professor—they were the site of a very real discovery.\n\nDiscovery Channel’s popular show “Expedition Unknown” was on site to document the discovery of 12 human skeletons and artifacts dating back at least 2,000 years, which had all been long hidden beneath the famed Khazneh (or “Treasury”) in Petra. The colossal find was accomplished by a team lead by archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman.\n\nIt’s a find that, were he real, Indiana Jones would certainly be proud of.\n\n“This is a hugely rare discovery,” said Josh Gates, host of the Discovery Channel’s program, according to CNN. “In the two centuries that Petra has been investigated by archaeologists, nothing like this has been found before. Even in front of one of the most famous buildings in the world … there are still huge discoveries to be made.”\n\nCreasman, executive director of the American Center of Research, employed ground-penetrating radar to first see if it was possibile that additional tombs were located at the site. The gathered data matched up to data collected from areas where tombs had been found in the past, and the Jordan government gave the approval for excavation beneath the world-famous site.\n\nThe team was beyond pleased to see an actual tomb materialize, and truly shocked by the fact that it was full of remains and artifacts—many of the tombs at the ancient city have been found empty, picked clean long ago.\n\nAlong with the 12 sets of skeletal remains—several of the bones from which had mold, thanks to the porous sandstone allowing moisture into the space in the flood-prone area—the team found a mix of bronze, iron, and ceramic artifacts. This included one ceramic chalice tucked in the arms of one of the deceased, ironically reminiscent of the “Holy Grail” depicted in The Last Crusade. “It really was this awesome moment,” Gates said, “of history imitating art.”\n\nThe Treasury, located near the main entrance to the city, is believed to be at least 2,000 years old. It is a striking mausoleum carved into the sandstone cliffs that has long attracted tourists aplenty, but dating this iconic monument has proven difficult because of the lack of finds within the tombs.\n\n“We were hopeful to find anything that might tell us more about the ancient people and place,” Creasman said. For instance, Gates believes that the individuals buried in the newly discovered tomb show must have been of very high status because of the prime real estate used for the burial place.“Human remains,” Creasman continued, “can be a really valuable tool in that regard. The burials in this tomb are articulated, so the bones haven’t been rummaged around and moved, so that’s exceedingly rare.”\n\nDelving deeper into the remains and artifacts found in the tomb could open additional information about the Khazneh, Petra, and the lives of the Nabataeans who once inhabited the area. “I think learning who they are,” Gates said, “is really going to help unlock part of the story of the Treasury.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "The eye-watering prices for World Cup tickets were revealed on Thursday",
    "fullText": "Football fans have voiced outrage over \"scandalous\" World Cup ticket prices, prompting the Football Association (FA) to raise concerns with Fifa, though there is little optimism within English football's governing body for a reversal.\n\nThe pricing structure for members of national team travel clubs and loyalty schemes, unveiled on Thursday, includes eye-watering figures, with the cheapest ticket for the 19 July final exceeding £3,000.\n\nThe Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) has urged the FA to challenge World Cup organiser Fifa on these costs, which the FSA branded \"scandalous\" and a \"laughable insult\" to the average fan.\n\nIt is understood that the FA will formally convey fans’ discontent to Fifa through appropriate channels. However, sources close to the governing body are not hopeful that this will lead to any changes.\n\nThe FA is deeply sympathetic to England supporters, who also face significant travel and accommodation expenses. The association had no input in setting the prices and reportedly only learned of the detailed pricing plan on Thursday.\n\nIn contrast, FA bosses Mark Bullingham and Debbie Hewitt have already pledged that affordable tickets will be available for Euro 2028 – which England will co-host with the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales – and that dynamic pricing, seen in earlier rounds of World Cup ticket sales, will not be implemented.\n\nDespite this, the FA has no influence over World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and there is a prevailing sense of realism that while concerns can be voiced, Fifa is unlikely to alter its course.\n\nShould England reach the final in July, fans wishing to purchase tickets through the FA’s allocation would need to spend more than £5,000 on tickets alone to attend all matches, even for the lowest-priced category.\n\nA statement from the FSA, published on Friday morning, declared: \"We back Football Supporters Europe in calling for a halt in ticket sales and we are calling on the Football Association to work with fellow FAs to directly challenge these disgraceful prices.\"\n\nThe FSA described the prices proposed to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) as \"scandalous\" and \"a step too far for many supporters who passionately and loyally follow their national sides at home and abroad\".\n\nThe statement further criticised Fifa’s approach: \"Everything we feared about the direction in which FIFA wants to take the game was confirmed – Gianni Infantino only sees supporter loyalty as something to be exploited for profit.\n\n“This is a tournament that is supposed to be celebrated by the world, where fans of all nations come together for the love of football. Fifa have decided to make it all about the money and the elite who can afford it.\n\n“For Fifa, loyalty is not the hard-working fan travelling thousands of miles in support of their team at qualifiers around the continent. A game that should be for all is now only for those who can afford it.\"\n\nFootball Supporters Europe (FSE) estimates that fans will pay five times more to follow their team from the first game to the final at the 2026 World Cup compared to the last tournament in Qatar in 2022.\n\nTickets for the final in the participant member association (PMA) allocations begin at 4,185 US dollars (£3,130). Following England from first game to last buying the cheapest tickets would cost 7,020 US dollars (£5,250), before factoring in travel and accommodation.\n\nThe FSA also highlighted that ESTC members are being asked to pay for tickets through to the final, rather than just for the group games England are guaranteed to play.\n\n\"If England are knocked out before the final they’ll then return (the money), minus an admin fee of course. They are beyond shameless,\" the statement added.\n\nScotland fans, who have qualified for their first finals since 1998, face similarly high prices. The Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) has called on national associations to \"hold FIFA to account\" over the ticket costs.\n\nJohn MacLean, CEO of the SFSA, noted that Scottish Football Association president Mike Mulraney – recently appointed chair of FIFA’s finance committee – is ideally positioned \"to express the widespread disappointment of Scottish fans and indeed fans all around the world at ticket prices that are, in some cases, five times the cost in Qatar\".\n\nBoth the FA and Fifa have been contacted for comment.",

    "description": "A New Zealand McDonald's is located inside a decommissioned plane, and multiple restaurants have been built inside historic homes.",
    "fullText": "Some McDonald's locations go far beyond the typical drive-thru experience, offering unique and unforgettable dining settings that redefine the concept of fast food.\n\nFrom a New Zealand McDonald's located inside a decommissioned plane to multiple restaurants built inside historic homes, McDonald's has transformed iconic and unconventional spaces into mind-blowing dining locations.\n\nMany restaurants have also been modified to comply with local laws. In Sedona, Arizona, there's a McDonald's with turquoise arches instead of the iconic golden ones, designed to complement the area's natural red rock scenery. A glass-walled McDonald's restaurant in Georgia has also received an award for its impressive architecture.\n\nHere are some of the most unusual and extraordinary McDonald's restaurants around the world.\n\nIt is the oldest surviving McDonald's location in the world. It doesn't even have a drive-thru — instead, customers walk up to the restaurant's windows to place their orders.\n\nSpeedee, a chef with a hamburger for a head, appeared on the original McDonald's signs alongside the brand's logo of two interlocking golden arches.\n\nSome signs also advertised the low price of McDonald's hamburgers — just 15 cents at the time.\n\nBefore being converted into a McDonald's and McCafé restaurant, the building was known as a cultural relic that had been the residence of politician Chiang Ching-kuo for one month during the 1940s, according to CNN.\n\nCNN reported that many locals objected to the restaurant opening inside the historic building, calling it a prime example of Western commercialism invading Chinese culture.\n\nHowever, since opening in 2015, the restaurant has become somewhat of a tourist attraction, welcoming visitors from all over the world.\n\nThe restaurant opened on October 8, 1990, in Shenzhen's Special Economic Zone.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported that on its opening day, the unique McDonald's location received over 40,000 customers, despite having a maximum seating capacity of only 460. It was the first McDonald's to open in mainland China, making it a popular destination for both locals and tourists at the time.\n\nThe restaurant's roof is still adorned with the iconic golden arches to make it recognizable to passersby.\n\nAuthor and photojournalist Gary He, who has dined at over 100 McDonald's restaurants around the world, told Business Insider in 2024 that it was one of the most \"epic\" locations he has ever visited.\n\nNamed one of the \"world's coolest McDonald's\" on a sign outside the restaurant, customers can enjoy everything from a classic Big Mac to Chicken McNuggets and McCafe beverages inside the plane.\n\nVisitors to this unique McDonald's restaurant can also view the D3 plane's cockpit.\n\nThe building was originally the United Kingdom Hotel and was designed by architect James Hastie Wardrop.\n\nConstructed between 1937 and 1938, this restaurant has been called one of the most beautiful McDonald's buildings in the world.\n\nThe restaurant, which spanned two floors and was a replica of Ray Kroc's first McDonald's, was filled with music and pop-culture memorabilia.\n\nAfter the restaurant was partially demolished and modernized, the memorabilia once housed in the restaurant were added to the franchise owner's personal collection, The Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nKnown for its giant marquee featuring thousands of light bulbs, the restaurant — perhaps surprisingly — closed in 2020 not as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but rather as part of McDonald's regular review of its restaurant portfolio, a spokesperson told NBC.\n\nHowever, a new McDonald's restaurant has opened in Times Square, meaning you can still get your fix.\n\nThe restaurant, built in 1993, is situated in one of Arizona's most beautiful cities, renowned for its awe-inspiring red-rock mountains, canyon walls, and pine forests.\n\nWhile the bright yellow color of most McDonald's signs might work in other parts of the country, the turquoise color chosen by the Sedona, Arizona, location blends much better with the surrounding landscape.\n\nSedona also has strict restrictions on the height of buildings and signage, which is why the famous arches are placed lower than at most other McDonald's restaurants.\n\nOn top of the large McDonald's restaurant, which also had a play place, was a statue of a NASA astronaut holding a container of fries.\n\nRonald McDonald and the rest of the \"McDonaldland\" characters lined the walls wearing space suits and posing against a starry background.\n\nMoored slightly south of the Gateway Arch on the Mississippi River, this McDonald's was the very first McDonald's to be opened on a riverboat.\n\nIt was open for 20 years before closing in 2000.\n\nSome McDonald's locations attempt to blend in with the local buildings and are designed more sympathetically.\n\nThis McDonald's location, however, was actually built inside a preexisting colonial mansion that's more than 150 years old. Located in Freeport, a small seaside town in Maine, the building was converted into the town's only McDonald's in 1984.\n\nThe restaurant is on Rue Saint-Lazare in Paris, France. Though the building is now a McDonald's, it is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nInspired by Roswell's extraterrestrial history, the interior of the spaceship contains a space-themed play area.\n\nThough you might think patrons can stroll up the steps to enter one of the most unusual McDonald's buildings in the world, customers actually enter from a side entrance.\n\nThe giant bronze eagle, designed by Portuguese sculptor Henrique Moreira, is usually the first thing customers notice when they approach the restaurant.\n\nThe colorful window is original to the coffee shop that previously occupied the space, and it features beautiful coffee-related scenes.\n\nThe restaurant has been called the world's most beautiful McDonald's.\n\nIt was designed in accordance with building requirements from the city.\n\n\"The building is unique to any I have ever seen and it is a joy to take a break and walk to the second floor and enjoy the view while I enjoy breakfast or lunch,\" wrote one TripAdvisor user.\n\nThe \"train station\" opened in 1975, and is also occupied by a Starbucks and a Popeyes.\n\nDespite having a unique theme, the restaurant still serves up McDonald's favorites.\n\nThe building was originally an 18th-century farmhouse that was converted into a Georgian-style mansion in the 1860s.\n\nHowever, Atlas Obscura reported that the fast-food giant faced pressure from preservationists to restore the home to its former grandeur.\n\nThe town then allowed the chain to build onto the existing building to create space for a drive-thru.\n\nThe station was built in 1877 by the Eiffel Company, which also built the Eiffel Tower.\n\nLocated in downtown Batumi, this McDonald's stands out for its reflective glass exterior. Patrons eating inside the restaurant can also gaze out onto the pool of water and manicured grass surrounding the building.\n\nThis location was built in 2013 and won the award for The Best Commercial Building of 2014 by the architecture website ArchDaily.\n\nThis makes for a great photo-op or simply a beautiful sight while patrons eat their meals.\n\nResembling a ski lodge, the restaurant fits in perfectly in the mountain town and the nearby Biltmore Estate, a grand home built by George Vanderbilt in the 1890s.\n\nHowever, the inside is grander than perhaps any outside viewer could expect.\n\nThe interior is also decorated with wallpaper, pieces of art, and hanging chandeliers.\n\nLocated in Lindvallen, one of Sweden's premier ski resorts, this one-of-a-kind \"ski-thru\" McDonald's allows guests to enter the building and order their food without ever even removing their skis.\n\nGary He told Business Insider that it was the most unusual location he had ever visited.\n\n\"The air is so clean and crisp — it's like being on top of the world,\" He said. \"When I visited, it wasn't even busy. It was just me, the McSki, and the mountains. I was just hanging out and enjoying myself.\"",

    "description": "Dell is increasing its prices on December 17 amid a global memory chip supply crisis. Business Insider obtained a list of price changes.",
    "fullText": "Your company's Dell laptops are about to cost more.\n\nStarting December 17, the computer maker is set to hike prices across its commercial product lines, according to an internal list of upcoming price changes sent to staff on December 9 and seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe list outlines price hikes for Dell's commercial business — meaning its sales to corporate clients rather than individual consumers. The commercial business accounts for about 85% of Dell's annual revenue in the Client Solutions Group (CSG), the division that sells laptops and PCs, according to its latest annual results.\n\nThe company is one of the leading providers of computer hardware to US companies, and prices aren't just rising at Dell. An industry-wide shortage of memory and storage chips is driving up costs across the PC industry, affecting competitors like Lenovo and HP as well.\n\nThe soaring demand for AI infrastructure has tech companies snapping up enormous quantities of memory and storage chips, increasing competition for consumer devices.\n\nA Dell spokesperson told Business Insider that \"like others in the industry, Dell takes targeted pricing action, when necessary, while maintaining supply continuity and its commitment to customer value.\"\n\n\"Our supply chain is resilient and globally diverse. It's designed to offer the needed flexibility when navigating macroeconomic, regulatory and trade dynamics,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHow much more expensive a laptop at Dell will be next week depends on how much memory and storage you require.\n\nThe global shortages are hitting two key types of chips that are essential components in most user devices: DRAM and NAND.\n\nWhen you buy a laptop, DRAM — dynamic random-access memory — is the memory, usually 8GB to 32GB for an average customer. NAND — non-volatile flash memory — is used for SSD storage, typically around 512GB or 1TB.\n\nFrom next week, Dell Pro and Pro Max notebooks and desktops with 32GB of memory will cost between $130 and $230 more, according to the list of price changes seen by Business Insider. If opting for the top-of-the-range 128GB memory, the price is set to rise by between $520 and $765 per device.\n\nSelecting a laptop with 1 TB of storage will add to the overall cost by between $55 and $135.\n\nAn employee at Dell who works in sales said the percentage increase would be \"between 10% and 30%\" depending on the contract. They asked to remain anonymous as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment.\n\nThe price list also includes price hikes for AI laptops containing Nvidia Blackwell GPUs and individual monitors. For example, a Dell Pro 55 Plus 4K Monitor, currently listed on Dell's website at $1,349.99, will be $150 more expensive, according to the price list.\n\nAI laptops containing an Nvidia RTX PRO 500 Blackwell GPU with 6GB will become $66 more expensive, and a 24GB GPU will cost $530 more, the pricing chart shows.\n\n\"It's impacting everyone, and there's no way around it currently, so customers will just have to pay more if they want the products,\" the sales employee said.\n\nHigher prices make for a tougher sell, already a challenge for sales teams amid today's tariff-weary consumers and enterprises.\n\nDell sent an email to its \"go-to-market\" (GTM) sales staff on November 25, which Business Insider has seen, outlining the \"critical next steps\" sellers should take to prepare ahead of the increase.\n\n\"Global memory and storage supply are tightening fast,\" Dell warned GTM team members.\n\nThe price of contracts for DRAM and NAND chips has \"already risen significantly this quarter, and suppliers are signaling further increases and allocation constraints driven by AI demand,\" Dell said in the email.\n\nThe company told its sellers to \"move decisively\" ahead of the price increases to \"protect value for our customers and for Dell.\"\n\nThe email advised teams to engage with top accounts in the coming week, close deals, and plan significant opportunities and multi-quarter deals to protect the sales pipeline.\n\n\"Ordering today for future delivery DOES NOT lock in current pricing,\" Dell warned, but said that acting now would help customers stay ahead of \"significant anticipated memory increase.\"\n\nThe Dell sales employee said that there had been an initial rush to help customers buy remaining inventory, but now the situation is largely viewed as \"out of our control.\"\n\nThe employee said Dell was also absorbing some of the costs internally, through hits to margins and limiting discounts that sales staff can offer.\n\nIn the company's third-quarter earnings call on November 25, Jeff Clarke, Dell's COO and vice chairman, said the market's price increases were \"unprecedented.\"\n\n\"We have not seen costs move at the rate that we've seen,\" Clarke said. \"Demand is way ahead of supply. And as we wade our way through that, we're going to lean on the things that we've always done.\"\n\nTech companies are buying massive amounts of DRAM and NAND to power AI models and cloud services, leaving fewer chips for consumer devices.\n\nCombined with global supply-chain tensions, the explosion in demand has prompted the three companies that dominate the DRAM market — Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron — to raise their prices.\n\nDRAM prices are expected to rise 30% in the final quarter of 2025, having already increased by 50% so far this year, according to Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm.\n\n\"The entire supply chain simply can't meet the demand that is now required and that inevitably leads to these kinds of challenges,\" Bob O'Donnell, the president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research, told Business Insider.\n\nThese price increases will \"likely have a noticeable impact for all types of PCs from every PC vendor,\" said O'Donnell, adding that the supply shortage is expected to continue throughout 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Platform fighting world-leading ban on grounds it contravenes implied freedom of political communication in...",
    "fullText": "Platform fighting world-leading ban on grounds it contravenes implied freedom of political communication in constitution\n\nWill Australia’s social media ban survive a high court challenge?\n\nReddit has filed a challenge against Australia’s under-16s social media ban in the high court, lodging its case two days after implementing age restrictions on its website.\n\n The company said in a Reddit post on Friday that while it agreed with protecting people under 16, the law “has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences”.\n\nReddit said there was an “illogical patchwork” of platforms included in the ban.\n\n“As the Australian Human Rights Commission put it, ‘There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights.’”\n\nReddit argued it was a forum primarily for adults without the traditional social media features the government has “taken issue with”.\n\nReddit was challenging the law on the grounds it infringed on the implied freedom of political communication. It was also seeking to challenge whether Reddit could be considered an age-restricted social media platform under the legislation.\n\nIt said it was not seeking to challenge the law to avoid compliance, and had implemented age-assurance measures since Wednesday.\n\nThe company said the vast majority of Redditors were adults, and advertising wasn’t targeted to children under 18. The Apple app store age rating for Reddit is 17+.\n\n“Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark on actually protecting young people online,” Reddit said. “So, while we will comply with this law, we have a responsibility to share our perspective and see that it is reviewed by the courts.”\n\nReddit’s challenge is separate from one filed by New South Wales Libertarian MP John Ruddick’s Digital Freedom Project group. The next court appearance for Digital Freedom Project group is late February, and Reddit expects it will be heard sometime next year, if the high court takes up the case.\n\nProf Sarah Joseph, from Griffith university’s law school, said she believes there was a strong case against the ban.\n\n“I do believe the legislation has cut off the main source of political information for people under the age of 16, in terms of their receiving and giving information. Whilst that is not the intention of the legislation, that is one of its many effects,” she said.\n\n“Whilst other sources remain open, they operate in very different ways and do not provide the same means to communicate one’s opinions, and the same variety of opinions.”\n\nBut Joseph said she believed the high court case was more likely to fail, as with most challenges to legislation on implied freedom of communications grounds.\n\n“The freedom is engaged in most cases, but the high court goes on to find the law to be proportionate. In reality, the constitutional freedom is quite weak due to the way that it has been interpreted and applied.”\n\nA law that has the effect of reducing the overall volume of political communication in Australia will be invalid unless it is proportionate to a legitimate purpose, constitutional law professor Luke Beck wrote in the Guardian on Thursday.\n\n“[But] the social media account ban only slightly reduces the overall volume of political communication in Australia,” the Monash University academic said.\n\n“The law does not ban teenagers from using the internet or having online group chats. It’s likely that in the [Ruddick] social media account case … the government will succeed.”\n\nThe Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Reddit had argued to the eSafety commissioner in September that it should be excluded from the ban.\n\n“The sole or significant purpose of our platform is to provide knowledge-sharing in timely, context-rich conversations; interaction between end-users is simply an incidental step to enabling this primary purpose,” Reddit said in the letter obtained under freedom of information laws.\n\n“It is not in keeping with Reddit norms for users to use their real names or identities on Reddit, as communities are not centred around real-time social networking among young people.”\n\nReddit does not promote real-time presence, friend requests or activity feeds that drive ongoing engagement, the company said. It said it was committed to collecting minimal personal information from users to preserve pseudonymity on the platform.\n\nReddit was a “pseudonymous platform organised around sharing information in topic-based communities rather than personal profiles or social networks,” the platform said.\n\nThe 10 platforms the government announced were covered by the ban – Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit – had all implemented measures to comply by Wednesday.",

With nearly 90% of companies now using some form of AI in hiring, this question is top of mind for many leaders, and it tends to split them into two camps. One side believes algorithms will make hiring fairer by reducing human “bias” and “noise” in decision-making. The other warns that algorithms can reproduce and even amplify existing inequalities at scale. Both overlook a crucial reality: When AI is adopted, it reshapes what counts as fair in the first place.",

    "fullText": "The Football Association has been asked to lobby Fifa to lower the price of World Cup tickets by a leading supporters' group.\n\nThe Football Supporters' Association (FSA) says the pricing structure for next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico is \"scandalous\".\n\nIt has joined Football Supporters Europe (FSE) in demanding that the sales process is stopped so fans' groups can hold talks with world governing body Fifa over its pricing policy.\n\n\"We back Football Supporters Europe in calling for a halt in ticket sales and we are calling on the Football Association to work with fellow FAs to directly challenge these disgraceful prices,\" the FSA said in a statement.\n\n\"We call on all national associations to stand up for your supporters, without whom there would be no professional game.\"\n\nFifa, the FA and the Scottish FA are all yet to comment.\n\nBBC Sport has been told that the FA is aware that England fans are angry, and is planning to relay those concerns to Fifa.\n\nThere is a Fifa Council meeting in Doha next week, and FA Chair Debbie Hewitt will be present. Last month she said that she was opposed to dynamic ticket pricing, and has vowed that it will not be used at Euro 2028, which the UK and Ireland is hosting.\n\nDespite mounting pressure, Fifa has also not yet made any public comment on its ticket price policies.\n\nThat may change if a number of national football associations jointly raise concerns, but with the Home Nations FAs hoping to host the 2035 Women's World Cup, they (and the UK government) may also be wary of upsetting Fifa.\n\nBBC Sport has been told that Fifa is waiting to see how many people have entered the ballot, but that it is expecting strong demand.\n\nPrivately, Fifa insiders say that while tickets will seem expensive to many, the governing body has a duty to set prices with the US market in mind, grow the game around the world, and to use its revenues to develop men's, women's and youth football.\n\nFifa president Gianni Infantino has also promised to achieve record revenues, and the most lucrative sports event in history will do no harm to his re-election hopes in 2027.\n\nThe huge increase in the price of tickets was revealed on Thursday when Fifa released allocation details for the official supporters' groups of each country.\n\nAt the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, group stage fixtures all had set prices of £68.50, £164.50 or £219.\n\nBut for England v Croatia and Scotland v Brazil next year, tickets cost around £198, £373 or £523.\n\nThe cost ramps up considerably in the latter stages.\n\nQuarter-finals for all teams are £507, £757 and £1,073, with the semi-finals £686, £1,819 and £2,363.\n\nThe cheapest tickets for the final are £3,119, seven times more expensive than in Qatar.\n\nThere are no concessions across any of its tickets for children or other groups.",

    "fullText": "Goldenberry, a small, tart-sweet fruit described as a cross between a pineapple and a mango, is increasingly popular in U.S. markets for its flavor and superfood nutritional profile. However, the plant's naturally wild and unruly growth habit has made it impractical for large-scale commercial farming. This challenge has kept the highly nutritious crop, native to the Andes region of South America, trapped between its wild origins and its commercial potential, even as global demand continues to rise.\n\nResearchers at the Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI), led by Professor Joyce Van Eck, have successfully overcome this barrier using CRISPR gene editing technology. By targeting the ERECTA gene, which regulates stem length in related crops like tomatoes, the collaborative team engineered goldenberry plants that are 35% shorter than their wild relatives. This new, compact growth habit makes the plant viable for commercial agriculture, as it allows for higher planting density, eliminates the need for trellising, and simplifies maintenance and harvesting. The team successfully edited two copies of the gene, a necessary step because the goldenberry is tetraploid, meaning it contains four sets of chromosomes.\n\nThe BTI team has already secured clearance from the USDA, confirming the engineered plants are free from plant pest regulations, and is now seeking FDA approval to allow growers to begin commercial production immediately. This work serves as a powerful demonstration of how gene editing can accelerate the development of improved varieties for minor crops that have been neglected by traditional breeding programs. The successful method—which could also be applied to other underutilized crops like groundcherry and passion fruit—aims to expand dietary diversity and create new opportunities for farmers by bringing highly nutritious, farmable varieties to the global food system.\n\nBiotech Updates is a weekly newsletter of ISAAA, a not-for-profit organization.

    "fullText": "Earlier this year, the famed Kum and Go brand disappeared from the world of convenience stores, even though its former owner thought that wasn't the plan.\n\nWhen former Kum & Go CEO Kyle Krause and his family made the deal to sell their chain to Maverik, they had been led to believe that their iconic brand name would be kept.\n\nDuring the talks to sell the chain, Maverik “communicated to me that they intended to run both brands,” Krause told the Des Moines Register.\n\nThat was not what happened, as Maverik spent the 18 months after the deal closed taking the Kum & Go brand off its stores and replacing it with its own branding. Nothing in the contract prevented that from happening, but Krause, whose father founded the Kum & Go Brand in 1959, did not expect it to happen.\n\n“It’s their decision,” Krause told the newspaper of Maverik’s decision to get rid of Kum & Go. “They can choose what they do... But certainly talking to them, their intent prior to the sale was to maintain both brands.”\n\nNow, without as much fanfare or nostalgia, due to the nature of the brand, another convenience store chain name will soon disappear.\n\nAlthough it's certainly not as well-known as bigger chains like Wawa or Sheetz, Freedom Oil has a deep history and made its mark on parts of the United States.\n\n\"Freedom Oil was founded in 1948 and grew from a few neighborhood stores into a network of 27 locations throughout Illinois and Florida. The sale was a bittersweet moment remembering the journey as to how the company had grown from a couple of convenience stores to its present-day level,\" said third-generation family member Mike Owens in a press release.\n\nThe Owens family on Dec. 9 closed on the sale of its 27-store chain to Mizpah Ventures LLC, a Chicago-based company that operates convenience stores and fuel wholesale businesses in Illinois and Wisconsin, according to Owens, who had served as the president of his family's business.\n\nAll of the chain's stores will close, drop the Freedom Oil branding, and be reopened under the Mizpah name.\n\nTerry Monroe, president of American Business Brokers & Advisors, based in Fort Myers Beach, Fla., and Bill Fecht of WJF Services Inc., based in Normal, Ill., provided merger and acquisition advisory services to Freedom Oil.\n\nThose services included valuation advisory, marketing the business through a confidential process, and negotiation of the transaction.\n\nWhile Kum & Go had about 400 locations when it was sold and closed, a number of smaller convenience stores have changed hands. In 2024, Tri Star Energy acquired Cox Oil, Offen Petroleum purchased Douglass Distributing, and Par Mar Oil bought Santmyer Companies.",

    "fullText": "What started as Guillaume Broche’s personal project has been nominated for 12 Game awards, sold more than 2m copies and been praised by Emmanuel Macron as a ‘shining example of French audacity’\n\nThe record-breaking 12 nominations at the Game awards this year was beyond the wildest dreams of Guillaume Broche when he first began inking out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as a personal project while working at Ubisoft.\n\nBefore selling more than 2m copies, the narrative-driven roleplaying game with “a unique world, challenging combat and great writing” was a technical demo called We Lost. It was Broche’s appetite for risk and a few hopeful Reddit posts that would create the game’s world of Lumiere and its struggle against the Paintress.\n\n“I was doing like eight hours per day after work and not sleeping at all for a few years,” Broche says. And while he would be joined by Tom Guillermin on the programming side and Francoise Meurisse as producer, the next few members of the nascent studio – Lorien Testard, lead composer and Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, lead writer – would only come to Clair Obscur by chance, via social media.\n\nTestard, a guitar teacher at the time who had never composed or published any music commerically, was discovered by Broche on SoundCloud. “We liked the same philosophy in games,” says Testard, who had been writing music inspired by his favourite titles. Similarly, Broche found his art director, Nicholas Maxson-Francombe, through personal works he posted on ArtStation. “We are all deeply engaged in our subject areas,” says Svedberg-Yen, who says that was what bonded the team together. “If you listen to Nicolas talk about art or Lorien talk about music, it’s just something that fills our minds and our days.”\n\nSvedberg-Yen, meanwhile, had come from the world of finance. She saw Broche’s Reddit post and auditioned to not only write but also to voice some of the prototype characters of Clair Obscur, namely Maelle and Lune. Despite a deep love for video games, storytelling and a childhood engrossed in novels, Svedberg-Yen had not considered it as a career option. “It never crossed my mind as possible. As the adage goes, for Asian parents [it’s] doctors, lawyers, or finance.”\n\nWith a rudimentary team assembled under the banner of a new studio, Sandfall Interactive, they rebooted We Lost as Clair Obscur. It was there a world took shape and the gained its unmistakeable Belle Époque setting. “There’s a specificity,” Svedberg-Yens says. “I think that vision gets diluted when you’re trying to appeal to too many people.”\n\n“It’s not meant to be French propaganda,” jokes Broche, about the game’s very Gallic aesthetic. The characters yell putain and merde, there are berets and extremely scary mimes not only because it’s fun, he says, but born from a desire to make something “sincere and authentic”.\n\nSame goes for the story. Clair Obscur’s narrative drives the game forward and, as lead writer, Svedberg-Yen says it all has a “grounding and a basis in truth”.\n\n“We are all first-time writer and game developers in this sense … and so we kind of only know instinctively how write to what instinctively comes from within. And for a lot of the characters in those particular situations, to write them [you] have to really delve into the parts of my life that resonate with the situation that they’re in.”\n\nAccording to Svedberg-Yen, a conversation Broche had with his mother became core to the story’s emotional heft. When he asked her what would be the worst thing that could possibly happen, his mother responded saying it would be to lose her children. “The story deals with a lot of trauma,” she says, and that process of writing like that was often a scary process. “If people don’t like it, they don’t like you.” It was this ability to be vulnerable and open a communicative environment that Broche believes contributed to the success of the game.\n\nDespite an anxiety in the industry about the rise of AI in the development of video games, the team at Sandfall isn’t worried – especially Testard, who composed the game’s orchestral score based off the narrative beats of the game and the eponymous concept of clair obscur (or chiaroscuro), AKA the interplay of light and dark. “Music is the language of the soul,” he says. In fact, the evolution of technology like Unreal Engine 4 and the later 5, which the game runs on today, made a lot of the game possible. “More games will be 3D, because we have a lot of tools now,” says Broche, who describes the budget of his game to be on the “lower end of AA.”\n\nThe team at Sandfall have been overwhelmed by their success. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, lauded the game as “shining example of French audacity”. None of them expected the experience of Clair Obscur to resonate so deeply with so many people. “I’ve gotten a lot of very heartfelt messages from players who have experienced loss in some way and who have felt that the story helped them deal with their grief or change their relationship with grief,” Svedberg-Yen says.\n\n“What’s really cool is I’ve gotten tons of messages from creatives, writers, aspiring writers who felt creatively drained or just felt like they wanted to quit, but then the game inspired them to start again and they started creating their own art again, to start writing.”",

    "fullText": "Don't count on a college degree to land your dream job in Silicon Valley.\n\nIncreasingly, founders and tech companies are judging talent by how quickly someone can learn, adapt, and build — not on how long they spent in a lecture hall — reshaping traditional pathways into the workforce.\n\nFei-Fei Li, the Stanford computer science professor widely known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" is one example of this.\n\nIn an interview on \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" this week, she spoke about the value of a degree when it comes to hiring for her AI startup, World Labs.\n\n\"When we interview a software engineer, I personally feel the degree they have matters less to us now,\" Li said.\n\n\"Now, it's more about what have you learned, what tools do you use, how quickly can you superpower yourself in using these tools — and a lot of these are AI tools,\" she said. \"What's your mindset toward using these tools matter more to me.\"\n\nHer hiring bar has become even clearer: she won't hire software engineers who resist AI.\n\n\"At this point in 2025 — hiring at World Labs — I would not hire any software engineer who does not embrace AI collaborative software tools,\" Li said.\n\nIt's not about automating humans out of the equation, she added — it's about identifying people who can grow as fast as the technology around them.\n\n\"If you're able to use these tools, you're able to learn. You can superpower yourself better,\" she said.\n\nLi's stance is part of a broader shift playing out across Silicon Valley, where more founders and even major tech firms are openly questioning the value of higher education.\n\nPalantir's CEO, Alex Karp, has openly challenged the value of a college education, urging young entrepreneurs to skip the lecture hall and learn by doing instead — a view echoed by LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, who has said that adaptability and AI fluency now matter far more than the \"fanciest degrees.\"\n\n\"AI makes skill sets based on years of education irrelevant,\" Dan Rhoton, CEO of Hopeworks, told Business Insider. Hopeworks is a tech-training nonprofit that prepares underrepresented talent for AI-enabled jobs.\n\nAfter 13 years of preparing unemployed young adults ages 17 to 26 in Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia for tech careers, Rhoton said he has watched firsthand how AI is upending the value of a college degree.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more employers coming to us, saying, 'We used to require a bachelor's degree in this, but we don't understand why.'\"\n\nInstead, he said, employers now want a \"value proposition,\" which he said any job seeker can achieve by showing an AI-generated solution to a company's specific problems.\n\n\"This is the age of: I'm someone who's going to deliver business value,\" Rhoton said. \"Not: I have the right degree.\"",

For a full look at the new PS Plus service, take a look at our roundup of every game available in the PS Plus library.\n\nAlthough it’s been somewhat overshadowed by the games that came after it, Fallout 3 was a major turning point for the franchise. This was the first 3D Fallout game, and many of the gameplay mechanics have been celebrated in its successors. Bethesda also attracted some top-notch voice talent for this one, including Liam Neeson, who voices the father of the player’s character.\n\nAfter emerging from a Vault, players get to explore the Washington D.C. area and follow the primary and side missions to enjoy up to 100 hours or \n\nNinja Theory’s Heavenly Sword felt like it was meant to be the beginning of the next great franchise. Instead, it was a one-and-done with fantastic graphics and gameplay that put players in the role of Nariko, a woman who dares to take up the Heavenly Sword to protect her family and clan even though it will slowly overtake her body and destroy her.\n\nThe combat is fluid and a hell of a lot of fun when using the sword to take a large number of enemies on-screen. There are also a few times when players control Nariko’s closest friend, Kai, who has projectile weapons that you can aim and glide towards an enemy with the turn of a controller. This game doesn’t just deserve a modern remaster, it needs a sequel.\n\nRead our Heavenly Sword review.\n\nKonami has left the Castlevania franchise on the shelf for over a decade, and the only way to revisit the reboot, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, is by diving into it on PS Plus Premium. Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima was one of the producers for this title, which reimagined the entire Castlevania mythos and gave the gameplay the 3D makeover it needed.\n\nIn this version of the story, players take control of Gabriel Belmont, a holy warrior for the Brotherhood of Light. Gabriel’s wife, Marie, has been murdered by one of the supernatural creatures he was born to fight. But because Marie’s soul is trapped, she serves as Gabriel’s guide as he takes up a quest to not only save the world, but restore his wife to life. This is a wildly underrated title, and we need more Castlevania games like this.\n\nRead our Castlevania: Lords of Shadow review.\n\nGamers of a certain age should remember Sly Cooper, the anthropomorphic raccoon and master thief who was the main character of Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus on PlayStation 2. That game and its first two sequels--Sly 2: Band of Thieves and Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves--were remastered for PlayStation 3 as part of The Sly Collection, and they have withstood the test of time.\n\nThe original versions of the trilogy were developed by Sucker Punch before the studio went on to release Infamous and Ghost of Tsushima. You’ll recognize the DNA of those games by the way Sly moves on rooftops and the way he utilizes stealth to remain undetected. Now, someone just needs to pull off a heist so Sly can get the comeback he deserves.\n\nWhile Arkham Origins game may not have been helmed by Rocksteady Games, developer Warner Bros. Montreal still did an admirable job with this prequel. Featuring all the combat, stealth, and detective work you'd expect from a Batman game, this Arkham title hit all three bat-nails on the bat-heads.\n\nRead our Batman Arkham Origins review.\n\nDecades after they were first released, the Devil May Cry games--yes, even the controversial second one--still stand tall as excellent action romps. Demonic hordes, stylish combat, and a protagonist with a devil-may-care attitude are just some of the reasons why Capcom's classic trilogy deserves a revisit. We recommend playing them in order, but if time is an issue, Devil May Cry 3 holds up better than its predecessors.\n\nRead our Devil May Cry HD Collection review.\n\nA cult-classic Japanese tactics series, you can grab several Disgaea games on PS Plus and feel what it's like to deliver ridiculous numbers of damage, forge relationships, and master exotic weapons within the fantasy frame of these titles. Just the Disgaea games alone offer hundreds of hours of compelling PS3 streaming content.\n\nA technical achievement at the time, The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion's open-world design was nothing short of stunning when it first released in 2006. 16 years later, the game is still a treat, with its in-your-face swords and sorcery action, excellent voice-acting, and dark fantasy tale centered around a Daedra invasion.\n\nRead our The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion review.\n\nBefore it was developing an underrated Devil May Cry reboot or the Senua's Saga series, developer Ninja Theory was making a name for itself with Enslaved. A new take on the classic tale, Enslaved pivots from ancient China to the far future for a thrilling tale of action in a robot post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nRead our Enslaved: Odyssey to the West review.\n\nFallout 3 brought the Bethesda series into a new dimension, but Obsidian Entertainment's spin-off is arguably the most well-remembered entry in the series. The gameplay was largely the same, but the extra improvements, incredible characters, and a fascinating new region made this Fallout the gold standard of the post-apocalyptic franchise. Fallout 3 is also on PS Plus Premium, and it's still worth playing, too.\n\nRead our Fallout New Vegas review.\n\nLiving up to its name, FEAR was part first-person shooter and part psychological horror that combined to create an effective package of high-caliber thrills. Everything from the sound design to the atmospheric levels was a showcase of how to give your audience multiple heart attacks, and even with several sequels, the first FEAR is still the cold standard for terror.\n\nThe original Greek adventures that set a new benchmark for games with brutal combat and quick-time events, the first two God of War games are fascinating throwbacks to the past that introduced the world to Kratos and his undying rage. The HD versions of these PS2 classics are still a treat to play in 2022.\n\nWhile there certainly wasn't a shortage of official PGA games during the PS3 era, but Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational was easily the best arcade golf game on the console. Originally released on the PS Vita, this port spruced up the product and made it feel even better with PS Move features that put you right in the game. Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds is also available to stream on PS Plus, so if you get bored of the courses in World Invitational, there's plenty more golfing fun to be had in Out of Bounds.\n\nRead our Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational review.\n\nIn an era where the PS2 was home to a regular influx of hit games, Ico stood out from the pack with its more tranquil puzzle gameplay and novel storytelling methods. Fast-forward a few years into the future, and an HD remaster brought all of that magic back in a new light.\n\nBefore it was developing an incredible samurai sandbox in Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch was known as the Infamous studio for good reason. An absolute power fantasy trip with fascinating consequences depending on your morality, the Infamous games still make for electrifying entertainment.\n\nReleased at a time when Mega Man had been absent from home consoles for years, the ninth and tenth installments in the series showed that the Blue Bomber hadn't lost his charm during his hiatus. Challenging and colorful, these Mega Man games were some of the best that the franchise had to offer. They captured the nostalgia of early Mega Man games by replicating the pixelated visuals while taking advantage of modern advancements in technology.\n\nThe fourth time was the charm for the Motorstorm series, as Apocalypse upped the ante with its rich selection of vehicles, well-designed tracks, and destructible environments that made each race a nail-biting sprint across hostile terrain.\n\nRead our Motorstorm: Apocalypse review.\n\nShinobi style cranked up to the maximum, Ryu Hayabusa's PS3 adventures were nothing short of effortlessly cool action mixed with devastating difficult gameplay. The Sigma games are harder than a freshly forged kunai, but they're still rewarding to play.\n\nRead our Ninja Gaiden Sigma review.\n\nVisually striking, PixelJunk Eden's Encore edition is a strange but fascinating game of platforming mixed with gardening. Sometimes serene, sometimes intense when the timer starts counting down; the lush visuals, distinct score, and surreal maneuverability makes for an unforgettable game.\n\nRead our PixelJunk Eden Encore review.\n\nPuppeteering might be the creepiest form of entertainment ever devised, but in the hands of SCE Japan, it's a medium that packs charm and imagination into a package of pure charm. Throw in some wonderful platforming, epic boss battles, and a killer soundtrack, and you've got a winner right here.\n\nA great Ratchet and Clank game is pure digital comfort food, and these two titles were simply delicious to dig into. Charming, witty, and full of great level design, PS Plus has a one-two punch of nostalgic fun waiting to be experienced in this pair of games. There are a couple other Ratchet games available to stream, but this pair keeps the traditional Ratchet & Clank gameplay.\n\nRead our Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus review.\n\nTaking a detour from the Grand Theft Auto series into wild west territory, Red Dead Redemption will amaze you with its cowboy sandbox and break your heart with its story. The standalone expansion, Undead Nightmare, is also plenty of fun as it adds a zombie mode that turns the entire game upside down.\n\nRead our Red Dead Redemption review.\n\nBefore the remake arrives, dive into Resident Evil 4 and marvel at how the series underwent a massive shift in tone and style. The controls might take some getting used to, but the rest of the game puts a terrific action spin on Resident Evil's trademark undead horror.\n\nRead our Resident Evil 4 review.\n\nThe final chapter in the Resistance saga is all action, alien devastation, and peak FPS fun from its era. Toss in some stomach-churning terror and a story that constantly increases in tension, and you'll be on the edge of your seat from the main menu through to the end credits.\n\nWhen Sam and Max made their return, it was nothing short of triumphant at the time. Reborn with a fancy new 3D aesthetic and 4D humor, these collections are perfect examples of hilarious storytelling and ingenious puzzles.\n\nRead our Sam and Max: Beyond Time and Space review.\n\nIf you ever wondered what would happen if Michael Bay decided to make a racing game, then Split/Second is your answer to that question. A solid arcade-style racing game, the real attention-grabber here was a selection of tracks that featured explosive turns and plenty of mayhem in every single race.\n\nThe tale of Darth Vader's secret apprentice may have been expunged from Star Wars continuity, but back then, these games were massively ambitious entries that sought to flesh out the years between the prequel and original trilogies. Living up to its name, the Force truly was unleashed in Starkiller's adventures across a galaxy far, far away.\n\nRead our Star Wars: The Force Unleashed review.\n\nStill revered as one of the most influential fighting games of all time, Street Fighter II also set a standard with several enhanced versions of the game that would be released over the years. Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is that legendary game at its best, packed with a great roster of characters, well-oiled fighting mechanics, and plenty of modern touches.\n\nRead our Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nFor a change of pace, grab a quick stream of the delightful puzzle-punching Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix. It's cute, captivating, and still plays like a dream.\n\nRead our Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix review.\n\nIn the mood for a dual-stick spaceship game that lets you see wonderfully colorful worlds as you turn enemy vessels into an explosive collection of pixels? Super Stardust HD has you covered with this stylish blast from the past.\n\nRead our Super Stardust HD review.\n\nPlatforming action starring a small blob might not sound too enticing, but this little gelatinous fellow combined magnetic traversal with relaxing puzzles and comfortable levels to explore. Two games, two adventures that can easily be enjoyed over a weekend.\n\nRead our Tales from Space: About a Blob review.\n\nEasily the weirdest title on this list, Tokyo Jungle is an examination of what life would be like for our beloved pets if humanity decided to just vanish off the face of the planet one day. It's a flawed gem, but one that sparkles with its absurd ideas and lively world.\n\nRevived for a new generation, Firaxis' XCOM was a welcome sight for anyone who felt that The Bureau had derailed the XCOM name. Pure tactical action and layered squad-building, this XCOM modernized the series for a new audience while keeping veterans engaged with its strategic content.\n\nRead our XCOM Enemy Within review.",

    "fullText": "Darts players who NEED to earn/defend prize money at 2026 PDC World Championship originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAt the 2026 PDC Darts World Championship, a new prize money system will be introduced, with a prize pot that is 2x larger than last year's event.\n\nIn form players defending little money will look to take advantage of players defending a lot or players struggling to get results.\n\nHere are the players who need to perform well at Ally Pally.\n\nMORE: 2026 PDC Darts World Championship: Draw, schedule, format and prize money\n\nCross has slowly slipped down the standings, as he hasn't won a lot of games recently.\n\nHe's defending £100,000 from his semifinal appearance in 2024, meaning he could slip well outside the top-20.\n\nHis performances recently suggest that this could become a reality for 'Voltage.'\n\nDobey is in much less danger than Cross, but it would be helpful if he could defend the £50,000 that he'll be losing from his quarterfinal appearance in 2024.\n\nHe's made at least the quarterfinals in each of the last three WCs, so if he follows that trend, he will be fine.\n\nIn terms of making a last-minute run at the Premier League or ensuring that he stays in the top-16 on the order of merit, his result at this event will play a large role in that.\n\nA tie with Cam Crabtree or Andrew Gilding in the second round could be the first serious threat Dobey faces if he advances.\n\nThis one might come as a surprise, but Bunting needs to put together a good performance at a major.\n\nHe did just that last year, but since then, he hasn't followed it up with any memorable event campaigns.\n\nBunting is defending £35,000, which doesn't seem like much, but there are plenty of players behind him in the top-10 that can make a push to pass him for his #4 spot, at this event.\n\nThat would take away his ability to auto-qualify for the Premier League and would likely mean he won't return to the league in 2026.\n\nAnderson is coming off a disappointing tournament last year, losing in the second round.\n\nHe'll be defending a fourth-round finish from 2024, but more importantly, he needs to pick up prize money at one of the few events he's playing at, as he plays in fewer tournaments at this stage of his career.\n\nHe doesn't need to pick up a lot, but it will be helpful if he wants to continue to be seeded at certain events, as well as stay in the top-16.\n\nMORE: Predicting the PDC 2026 Premier League of Darts lineup\n\n2025 was a rough year for Heta after he was given pretty high expectations.\n\nHe's defending a fourth-round run from 2024, but has a lot of players looking to pass him and displace him out of the top-16 on the Main OoM.\n\nFor a player who plays a lot of the Pro Tour, this would force him to start playing on Fridays on the European Tour, something he hasn't done in quite some time.\n\nI chose to put these two names together because they are both in similar positions.\n\nBoth players have done very little at majors or tournaments in general in 2025 and are in danger of dropping down the rankings.\n\nChisnall will be defending more WC money, as he made the quarterfinals in 2024 and De Decker only made the second round in 2024, but they must get back on track with some wins.\n\nDimitri took a break from the Tour this year and was featured in very few events.\n\nAs we approach the middle months of 2026, it will become crunch time for Van den Bergh, as he defends big campaigns from 2024, including his UK Open win and his semifinal run at the World Grand Prix.\n\nIt's been a few years since he had a quality run at Ally Pally, so it would help him in several ways to win at least a couple of games this year.\n\nSmith has also played less on Tour this year and has lost a lot of prize money from some of his past titles.\n\nHe's in danger of dropping out of the top 32, and he'll defend a fourth-round finish from 2024.\n\nIf Smith's injuries continue to hurt his performances, it will make events like this vital for him to get good results.\n\nCullen will fall out of the top 32 if he gets knocked out early, which is likely with the draw he was given.\n\nHe's defending a fourth-round finish from 2024, and there'll be a handful of players behind him on the order of merit that are playing well entering the event and will be defending little to no money from 2024.\n\nWilliams' big semifinal run in 2024 will finally hit its two-year anniversary at this event, so he will drop significantly if he doesn't follow it up.\n\nWilliams is a talented player who could be headed for outside the top-40 on the Main OoM.\n\nEvery nine-darter at the PDC Darts World Championship\n\nEvery Ricky Evans PDC World Darts Championship walk-on entrance\n\nEvery darts player who's qualified for the 2026 PDC World Championship\n\nEvery American qualifier playing at the 2026 PDC Darts World Championship",

    "fullText": "Flipping and spinning on a studio floor, 17-year-old Royal is a star in China's breakdancing scene and aiming for gold at the World Championships in Japan this week.\n\nRoyal, real name Guo Pu, shot to fame when she won both the youth and adult Asian Championships in June.\n\nShe is part of a growing Chinese force in breakdancing, which combines acrobatic floor moves, footwork and rhythmic expression to hip-hop or funk and was included as an Olympic sport for the first time at Paris 2024.\n\n\"At first my grandmother would not let me dance breaking because back then, breaking's reputation truly was not very good,\" Royal told AFP at the studio where she trains in her hometown of Pingyi, in the eastern province of Shandong.\n\n\"But after I achieved some results, she stopped saying anything,\" she smiled.\n\nHaving already won the youth world title in August, Royal will compete alongside other \"B-girls\" and \"B-boys\" at the adult World Championships taking place Friday and Saturday in Fukuoka, Japan, the country which has long dominated the sport.\n\n\"I want to win that gold medal for China and show the world that Chinese breaking is getting cooler and cooler,\" she said.\n\nAs a youngster, \"my mother signed me up for all kinds of extracurricular classes, such as playing instruments, then Chinese dance\", Royal said.\n\n\"I also participated in a local children's artistic show for the Chinese New Year. That's when coach Mike saw me.\"\n\nMike, whose real name is Li Shilong, told AFP \"she immediately impressed me\".\n\n\"During her performance I saw a light in her eyes... It was a kind of light that shows a real passion, a real drive for dance and for art.\n\n\"I felt that this girl might have been born for breaking.\"\n\nRoyal has now put school on hold to dedicate her time entirely to dancing.\n\nLike other top athletes in China, she will benefit from easier access to university thanks to her sporting achievements.\n\nRoyal describes herself as \"not very talkative\" and still \"pretty nervous before competitions\", but says she is able to \"open up\" on stage.\n\nIn addition to her Asian and world titles, Royal won gold at this year's World Games -- a top competition for non-Olympic sports.\n\nShe has developed a healthy rivalry with fellow Chinese breakdancer Liu Qingyi, known as \"671\", who won bronze at the Paris Games.\n\nThe country's next generation of breakdancers looks promising, with China winning five out of six medals at the youth World Championships in August.\n\n\"In four years, China has gone from being unknown in the world of breakdancing to ranking among the world's top three and is now seen as the future of breaking,\" Mounir Biba, a 13-time world champion and head coach of the Chinese team, told AFP.\n\n\"There is talent, there is a lot of potential. There are a lot of young dancers in China,\" he said, adding that financial support from the government was helping the sport grow.\n\nHaving breakdancing in the Olympics has encouraged the surge of interest in China, according to coach Mike.\n\n\"Once a discipline is officially recognised as a sport in China it's developed very intensively,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities see an opportunity to win international honours while parents, reassured by breakdancing's new respectability, are more willing to let their children practise it.\n\nThe Chinese DanceSport Federation now organises numerous competitions, Mike said, while funds are allocated to training facilities.\n\nThe only downside, according to the coach, is that some Chinese dancers do not necessarily fully understand the culture of breakdancing, which originated in New York in the 1970s.\n\n\"The (skill) difficulty level in China is exceptionally high. However, the understanding of dance and the depth of exploration into dance artistry remains insufficient,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"This is an area where we need to learn from Western nations,\" Mike said.\n\n\"Breakdancing, and other street dance styles... their essence is innovation. I believe that by understanding the core of this culture, Chinese children will become more creative.\"\n\nRoyal is keen to push the sport's creativity.\n\n\"I really want to inspire the next generation of B-girls,\" she said.\n\n\"By passing on the history and the culture of breaking, and developing a style of breaking that's unique to girls.\"",

Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs.\n\nNow, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.\n\nBroche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were \"a lot of arguments\" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.\n\nGameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the game's tremendous success?\n\nBroche: I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, \"Is this real?\" or, \"Can you believe that?\" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.\n\nAs I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a \"less is more\" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.\n\nWe always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain \"less is more\" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more \"real\" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.\n\nFor the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.\n\nI've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or \"good\" ending to the game?\n\nThat’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the \"good\" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear \"good\" or \"bad\" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.\n\nMany sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?\n\nActually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.\n\nOne major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!\n\nWhether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. The Game Awards airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "fullText": "The main ticket ballot for next summer's World Cup in North America opens on Thursday.\n\nIt's the first opportunity for fans to secure tickets since the draw was made and the full match schedule announced last week.\n\nFifa's pricing model has been criticised, with Football Supporters Europe warning of \"record high prices\" and \"huge financial risks\" to follow their teams.\n\nFrom an earlier phase, the price of tickets ranged from £45 to £5,915.\n\nSo what do we know about the tournament's controversial ticketing operation - and how can you secure tickets?\n\nFrom 16:00 GMT on Thursday, fans can apply for tickets on Fifa's website for the matches of their choice.\n\nEach household can request up to four tickets per match and a maximum of 40 across the tournament.\n\nThe application window runs until 13 January 2026. There is no advantage to applying early - all fixtures remain available throughout the entire period.\n\nOnce the window closes, Fifa will run a lottery to decide which applications are successful.\n\nFans will be notified by email in February and, if they have been allocated tickets, will be charged automatically.\n\nDynamic pricing - or \"variable pricing\" as Fifa calls it - will be used in some phases of World Cup ticket sales.\n\nHowever, the governing body has confirmed that it will not apply during the main ballot. The price you see at the start of the window will be the same at the end.\n\nPrices will still be set based on expected demand for each fixture, with high-profile games likely to cost more.\n\nFor now, Fifa hasn't published any official price lists. It is expected people will know the price of tickets they ballot for on Thursday when it opens.\n\nAt present, the best guide we have comes from fans who tracked prices during the earlier sale phase.\n\nFifa has promoted Category 4 tickets as \"an accessible entry point to the tournament\".\n\nBut their stadium maps suggest the amount of Category 4 seating is extremely limited, and Football Supporters Europe said \"their very existence is still subject to caution\".\n\nIn most venues, the bulk of the seating appears to fall into the more expensive Category 1 and 2 sections.\n\nEach participating nation receives 8% of the tickets for its matches to distribute to its own supporters.\n\nFor England and Scotland, these will be made available to members of the England Supporters Travel Club and the Scotland Supporters Club. Both groups will receive an email with an access code for a Fifa portal, where they can apply from 15 December to 13 January.\n\nThese tickets are allocated via a ballot weighted towards members with the highest loyalty points.\n\nPrices are likely to be in line with the main ballot, but FA allocation tickets cannot be resold.\n\nAllocations for teams that progress through the play-offs are expected be released after those ties are completed in March.\n\nFifa has created its own official platform where fans can resell tickets bought through other phases of the ticketing process.\n\nSellers can list at whatever price they choose, and Fifa takes a 15% fee from both the seller and the buyer.\n\nFifa says these fees are \"aligned with North American industry trends across various sports\" and insists all revenue will be \"reinvested to fuel the growth of the game\".\n\nIt has also warned supporters against using unofficial resale sites, saying tickets bought elsewhere \"may be subject to cancellation without notice\".\n\nOn the unofficial secondary market, the cheapest tickets for England and Scotland's group games are already listed at more than £450.\n\nFans looking for guaranteed tickets - and not concerned about cost - can opt for official hospitality packages.\n\nThese typically cost thousands of pounds and include premium seating, lounge access and upmarket dining.\n\nThe most exclusive option is Platinum Access. Pricing for this tier is only available on request and details are sparse, although promotional material does feature an image of a private jet.\n\nCloser to the tournament, any remaining ticket inventory will be released on a first-come, first-served basis, operating much like a standard online ticket sale.\n\nThis phase is expected to utilise dynamic or variable pricing, though unlike other industries, Fifa will manually alter prices based on demand rather than using an algorithm.\n\n\"Your ticket is not a visa,\" said United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month.\n\nIndeed, simply being a ticket holder does not guarantee entry to any of the host countries, Canada, Mexico or the US.\n\nFans planning to travel to the US should apply for either the Visa Waiver Programme (commonly known as an ESTA) or a Visitor Visa (B1/B2) depending on their nationality. UK citizens are normally eligible for an ESTA.\n\nCanada requires most visitors to obtain a visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), while Mexico offers visa-free entry to many nationalities, including UK travellers.\n\nUS embassies are giving priority appointments to World Cup ticket holders but are still encouraging fans to apply as soon as possible.\n\nIt is unclear how ticket holders from countries whose citizens are mostly banned from travelling to the US will fare.\n\nSeveral members of the Iranian delegation were refused entry to the country for the World Cup draw last week.",
