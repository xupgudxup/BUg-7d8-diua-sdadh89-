    "fullText": "Darts players who NEED to earn/defend prize money at 2026 PDC World Championship originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAt the 2026 PDC Darts World Championship, a new prize money system will be introduced, with a prize pot that is 2x larger than last year's event.\n\nIn form players defending little money will look to take advantage of players defending a lot or players struggling to get results.\n\nHere are the players who need to perform well at Ally Pally.\n\nMORE: 2026 PDC Darts World Championship: Draw, schedule, format and prize money\n\nCross has slowly slipped down the standings, as he hasn't won a lot of games recently.\n\nHe's defending £100,000 from his semifinal appearance in 2024, meaning he could slip well outside the top-20.\n\nHis performances recently suggest that this could become a reality for 'Voltage.'\n\nDobey is in much less danger than Cross, but it would be helpful if he could defend the £50,000 that he'll be losing from his quarterfinal appearance in 2024.\n\nHe's made at least the quarterfinals in each of the last three WCs, so if he follows that trend, he will be fine.\n\nIn terms of making a last-minute run at the Premier League or ensuring that he stays in the top-16 on the order of merit, his result at this event will play a large role in that.\n\nA tie with Cam Crabtree or Andrew Gilding in the second round could be the first serious threat Dobey faces if he advances.\n\nThis one might come as a surprise, but Bunting needs to put together a good performance at a major.\n\nHe did just that last year, but since then, he hasn't followed it up with any memorable event campaigns.\n\nBunting is defending £35,000, which doesn't seem like much, but there are plenty of players behind him in the top-10 that can make a push to pass him for his #4 spot, at this event.\n\nThat would take away his ability to auto-qualify for the Premier League and would likely mean he won't return to the league in 2026.\n\nAnderson is coming off a disappointing tournament last year, losing in the second round.\n\nHe'll be defending a fourth-round finish from 2024, but more importantly, he needs to pick up prize money at one of the few events he's playing at, as he plays in fewer tournaments at this stage of his career.\n\nHe doesn't need to pick up a lot, but it will be helpful if he wants to continue to be seeded at certain events, as well as stay in the top-16.\n\nMORE: Predicting the PDC 2026 Premier League of Darts lineup\n\n2025 was a rough year for Heta after he was given pretty high expectations.\n\nHe's defending a fourth-round run from 2024, but has a lot of players looking to pass him and displace him out of the top-16 on the Main OoM.\n\nFor a player who plays a lot of the Pro Tour, this would force him to start playing on Fridays on the European Tour, something he hasn't done in quite some time.\n\nI chose to put these two names together because they are both in similar positions.\n\nBoth players have done very little at majors or tournaments in general in 2025 and are in danger of dropping down the rankings.\n\nChisnall will be defending more WC money, as he made the quarterfinals in 2024 and De Decker only made the second round in 2024, but they must get back on track with some wins.\n\nDimitri took a break from the Tour this year and was featured in very few events.\n\nAs we approach the middle months of 2026, it will become crunch time for Van den Bergh, as he defends big campaigns from 2024, including his UK Open win and his semifinal run at the World Grand Prix.\n\nIt's been a few years since he had a quality run at Ally Pally, so it would help him in several ways to win at least a couple of games this year.\n\nSmith has also played less on Tour this year and has lost a lot of prize money from some of his past titles.\n\nHe's in danger of dropping out of the top 32, and he'll defend a fourth-round finish from 2024.\n\nIf Smith's injuries continue to hurt his performances, it will make events like this vital for him to get good results.\n\nCullen will fall out of the top 32 if he gets knocked out early, which is likely with the draw he was given.\n\nHe's defending a fourth-round finish from 2024, and there'll be a handful of players behind him on the order of merit that are playing well entering the event and will be defending little to no money from 2024.\n\nWilliams' big semifinal run in 2024 will finally hit its two-year anniversary at this event, so he will drop significantly if he doesn't follow it up.\n\nWilliams is a talented player who could be headed for outside the top-40 on the Main OoM.\n\nEvery nine-darter at the PDC Darts World Championship\n\nEvery Ricky Evans PDC World Darts Championship walk-on entrance\n\nEvery darts player who's qualified for the 2026 PDC World Championship\n\nEvery American qualifier playing at the 2026 PDC Darts World Championship",

    "fullText": "Flipping and spinning on a studio floor, 17-year-old Royal is a star in China's breakdancing scene and aiming for gold at the World Championships in Japan this week.\n\nRoyal, real name Guo Pu, shot to fame when she won both the youth and adult Asian Championships in June.\n\nShe is part of a growing Chinese force in breakdancing, which combines acrobatic floor moves, footwork and rhythmic expression to hip-hop or funk and was included as an Olympic sport for the first time at Paris 2024.\n\n\"At first my grandmother would not let me dance breaking because back then, breaking's reputation truly was not very good,\" Royal told AFP at the studio where she trains in her hometown of Pingyi, in the eastern province of Shandong.\n\n\"But after I achieved some results, she stopped saying anything,\" she smiled.\n\nHaving already won the youth world title in August, Royal will compete alongside other \"B-girls\" and \"B-boys\" at the adult World Championships taking place Friday and Saturday in Fukuoka, Japan, the country which has long dominated the sport.\n\n\"I want to win that gold medal for China and show the world that Chinese breaking is getting cooler and cooler,\" she said.\n\nAs a youngster, \"my mother signed me up for all kinds of extracurricular classes, such as playing instruments, then Chinese dance\", Royal said.\n\n\"I also participated in a local children's artistic show for the Chinese New Year. That's when coach Mike saw me.\"\n\nMike, whose real name is Li Shilong, told AFP \"she immediately impressed me\".\n\n\"During her performance I saw a light in her eyes... It was a kind of light that shows a real passion, a real drive for dance and for art.\n\n\"I felt that this girl might have been born for breaking.\"\n\nRoyal has now put school on hold to dedicate her time entirely to dancing.\n\nLike other top athletes in China, she will benefit from easier access to university thanks to her sporting achievements.\n\nRoyal describes herself as \"not very talkative\" and still \"pretty nervous before competitions\", but says she is able to \"open up\" on stage.\n\nIn addition to her Asian and world titles, Royal won gold at this year's World Games -- a top competition for non-Olympic sports.\n\nShe has developed a healthy rivalry with fellow Chinese breakdancer Liu Qingyi, known as \"671\", who won bronze at the Paris Games.\n\nThe country's next generation of breakdancers looks promising, with China winning five out of six medals at the youth World Championships in August.\n\n\"In four years, China has gone from being unknown in the world of breakdancing to ranking among the world's top three and is now seen as the future of breaking,\" Mounir Biba, a 13-time world champion and head coach of the Chinese team, told AFP.\n\n\"There is talent, there is a lot of potential. There are a lot of young dancers in China,\" he said, adding that financial support from the government was helping the sport grow.\n\nHaving breakdancing in the Olympics has encouraged the surge of interest in China, according to coach Mike.\n\n\"Once a discipline is officially recognised as a sport in China it's developed very intensively,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities see an opportunity to win international honours while parents, reassured by breakdancing's new respectability, are more willing to let their children practise it.\n\nThe Chinese DanceSport Federation now organises numerous competitions, Mike said, while funds are allocated to training facilities.\n\nThe only downside, according to the coach, is that some Chinese dancers do not necessarily fully understand the culture of breakdancing, which originated in New York in the 1970s.\n\n\"The (skill) difficulty level in China is exceptionally high. However, the understanding of dance and the depth of exploration into dance artistry remains insufficient,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"This is an area where we need to learn from Western nations,\" Mike said.\n\n\"Breakdancing, and other street dance styles... their essence is innovation. I believe that by understanding the core of this culture, Chinese children will become more creative.\"\n\nRoyal is keen to push the sport's creativity.\n\n\"I really want to inspire the next generation of B-girls,\" she said.\n\n\"By passing on the history and the culture of breaking, and developing a style of breaking that's unique to girls.\"",

    "fullText": "\"Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story,\" Expedition 33 creative director Guillaume Broche told GameSpot.\n\n on December 10, 2025 at 10:53AM PST\n\nThe Game Awards are just around the corner, and while this time of year is surely exciting for all the nominees--and those of us eager for new game announcements--this year, there is one studio in particular that has more reason than any to celebrate: Sandfall Interactive.\n\nEarlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs.\n\nNow, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.\n\nBroche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were \"a lot of arguments\" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.\n\nGameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the game's tremendous success?\n\nBroche: I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, \"Is this real?\" or, \"Can you believe that?\" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.\n\nAs I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a \"less is more\" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.\n\nWe always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain \"less is more\" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more \"real\" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.\n\nFor the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.\n\nI've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or \"good\" ending to the game?\n\nThat’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the \"good\" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear \"good\" or \"bad\" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.\n\nMany sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?\n\nActually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.\n\nOne major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!\n\nWhether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. The Game Awards airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "description": "The main ticket ballot for next summer's World Cup in North America opens on Thursday with 'record high' prices for fans.",
    "fullText": "The main ticket ballot for next summer's World Cup in North America opens on Thursday.\n\nIt's the first opportunity for fans to secure tickets since the draw was made and the full match schedule announced last week.\n\nFifa's pricing model has been criticised, with Football Supporters Europe warning of \"record high prices\" and \"huge financial risks\" to follow their teams.\n\nFrom an earlier phase, the price of tickets ranged from £45 to £5,915.\n\nSo what do we know about the tournament's controversial ticketing operation - and how can you secure tickets?\n\nFrom 16:00 GMT on Thursday, fans can apply for tickets on Fifa's website for the matches of their choice.\n\nEach household can request up to four tickets per match and a maximum of 40 across the tournament.\n\nThe application window runs until 13 January 2026. There is no advantage to applying early - all fixtures remain available throughout the entire period.\n\nOnce the window closes, Fifa will run a lottery to decide which applications are successful.\n\nFans will be notified by email in February and, if they have been allocated tickets, will be charged automatically.\n\nDynamic pricing - or \"variable pricing\" as Fifa calls it - will be used in some phases of World Cup ticket sales.\n\nHowever, the governing body has confirmed that it will not apply during the main ballot. The price you see at the start of the window will be the same at the end.\n\nPrices will still be set based on expected demand for each fixture, with high-profile games likely to cost more.\n\nFor now, Fifa hasn't published any official price lists. It is expected people will know the price of tickets they ballot for on Thursday when it opens.\n\nAt present, the best guide we have comes from fans who tracked prices during the earlier sale phase.\n\nFifa has promoted Category 4 tickets as \"an accessible entry point to the tournament\".\n\nBut their stadium maps suggest the amount of Category 4 seating is extremely limited, and Football Supporters Europe said \"their very existence is still subject to caution\".\n\nIn most venues, the bulk of the seating appears to fall into the more expensive Category 1 and 2 sections.\n\nEach participating nation receives 8% of the tickets for its matches to distribute to its own supporters.\n\nFor England and Scotland, these will be made available to members of the England Supporters Travel Club and the Scotland Supporters Club. Both groups will receive an email with an access code for a Fifa portal, where they can apply from 15 December to 13 January.\n\nThese tickets are allocated via a ballot weighted towards members with the highest loyalty points.\n\nPrices are likely to be in line with the main ballot, but FA allocation tickets cannot be resold.\n\nAllocations for teams that progress through the play-offs are expected be released after those ties are completed in March.\n\nFifa has created its own official platform where fans can resell tickets bought through other phases of the ticketing process.\n\nSellers can list at whatever price they choose, and Fifa takes a 15% fee from both the seller and the buyer.\n\nFifa says these fees are \"aligned with North American industry trends across various sports\" and insists all revenue will be \"reinvested to fuel the growth of the game\".\n\nIt has also warned supporters against using unofficial resale sites, saying tickets bought elsewhere \"may be subject to cancellation without notice\".\n\nOn the unofficial secondary market, the cheapest tickets for England and Scotland's group games are already listed at more than £450.\n\nFans looking for guaranteed tickets - and not concerned about cost - can opt for official hospitality packages.\n\nThese typically cost thousands of pounds and include premium seating, lounge access and upmarket dining.\n\nThe most exclusive option is Platinum Access. Pricing for this tier is only available on request and details are sparse, although promotional material does feature an image of a private jet.\n\nCloser to the tournament, any remaining ticket inventory will be released on a first-come, first-served basis, operating much like a standard online ticket sale.\n\nThis phase is expected to utilise dynamic or variable pricing, though unlike other industries, Fifa will manually alter prices based on demand rather than using an algorithm.\n\n\"Your ticket is not a visa,\" said United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month.\n\nIndeed, simply being a ticket holder does not guarantee entry to any of the host countries, Canada, Mexico or the US.\n\nFans planning to travel to the US should apply for either the Visa Waiver Programme (commonly known as an ESTA) or a Visitor Visa (B1/B2) depending on their nationality. UK citizens are normally eligible for an ESTA.\n\nCanada requires most visitors to obtain a visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), while Mexico offers visa-free entry to many nationalities, including UK travellers.\n\nUS embassies are giving priority appointments to World Cup ticket holders but are still encouraging fans to apply as soon as possible.\n\nIt is unclear how ticket holders from countries whose citizens are mostly banned from travelling to the US will fare.\n\nSeveral members of the Iranian delegation were refused entry to the country for the World Cup draw last week.",

    "fullText": "World War II wasn’t just fought by men and women on the front lines, it was also defined by the machines they rode, drove, and sailed into history. From towering cannons that shook the earth to massive battleships that seemed unsinkable, these vehicles weren’t just tools of war, they were icons of an era.\n\nThey carried with them the hopes of nations, the fears of enemies, and the awe of anyone who ever laid eyes on them. Today, long after their thunder has faded, these machines remain unforgettable, living on in movies, documentaries, and the collective memory of a world that witnessed the most intense conflict in history.\n\nWe’ve gathered a dozen of the most iconic, the ones that left the biggest dents not just in the battlefield, but in the imagination of generations.\n\nDuring World War II, the Germans unveiled one of the most jaw-dropping superweapons ever constructed: the Schwerer Gustav. This massive railway gun wasn’t just a piece of artillery; it was a rolling symbol of intimidation and ambition. Imagine a weapon so large it had to be transported in pieces, assembled on specially laid tracks, and required a small army of men just to operate.\n\nIts sheer presence turned heads wherever it was moved, a physical reminder of how far nations were willing to push the limits of engineering in the pursuit of victory. The Gustav wasn’t practical in the traditional sense; it was slow to move, exposed to air attack, and required enormous logistical support, but it did manage to fire upon fortified positions with shells the size of small cars. When it thundered, the earth shook, and even those far from the battlefield could feel its echo.\n\nAccording to History.com, the Japanese battleship Yamato has become a near-legend of World War II, a floating fortress that seemed almost too big to be real. Launched as the pride of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Yamato was designed to outgun anything that floated, carrying massive guns that could rain destruction over distances unimaginable for most ships of the time.\n\nBut its story is just as much about symbolism as it is about firepower. Japan built Yamato as a statement, a declaration that it would never be overshadowed on the high seas. When it sailed, it carried the weight of a nation’s pride, and its silhouette on the horizon inspired awe and dread in equal measure. Life aboard the ship was like living inside a steel city, and sailors felt both honored and burdened to serve on what was considered the ultimate warship. Yet Yamato’s greatness was undercut by the changing tides of war, where air power proved deadlier than naval guns.\n\nThe German battleship Bismarck was the terror of the Atlantic, a warship that embodied Germany’s determination to dominate the seas. When it set out, Allied sailors whispered its name with dread, knowing its guns could sink even the strongest battleships.\n\nIts most infamous moment came when it destroyed HMS Hood, Britain’s pride, in a clash that shocked the world. But this triumph only fueled the Allies’ obsession with bringing Bismarck down, sparking one of the most relentless hunts in naval history. The chase ended with the Bismarck crippled and sunk, a dramatic downfall that proved even legends could be cornered.\n\nThe Tiger I was more than just a tank; it was a monster of steel that rolled into battle like something out of a nightmare. German crews felt nearly unstoppable inside their armor, and Allied soldiers often spoke of Tigers with a mix of fear and respect.\n\nAlthough not the most numerous tank of the war, it became a symbol of German engineering and battlefield dominance. Its reputation was so fearsome that sometimes troops believed Tigers were present even when they weren’t. Stories of its invincibility spread faster than the tanks themselves, creating an aura that magnified its true impact.\n\nThe American Sherman tank wasn’t the most powerful or flashy, but it became the backbone of Allied ground forces. What made the Sherman iconic wasn’t unmatched strength, but its reliability and sheer numbers.\n\nThese tanks rolled across Europe in endless waves, a constant presence that wore down German defenses. Soldiers trusted the Sherman to get them where they needed to go, even if it wasn’t invincible against heavier armor. Its role in supporting infantry and keeping pressure on enemy positions was vital. The Sherman also carried symbolic weight as a machine that embodied America’s industrial might, producing vehicles faster than the enemy could destroy them.\n\nThe Soviet T-34 is often hailed as the tank that saved Russia, a machine built for resilience above all else. It was designed to fight in mud, snow, and harsh conditions that would have crippled more delicate machines.\n\nSoviet crews praised its toughness and mobility, and German soldiers learned to fear its sudden appearances. Unlike the Tigers, the T-34 wasn’t about prestige, it was about practicality and overwhelming numbers. It became the spearhead of massive offensives, pushing the Red Army deeper into enemy lines. Its silhouette is instantly recognizable, embodying the Soviet determination to endure and strike back.\n\nNicknamed “The Big E,” the USS Enterprise was the heart of the U.S. Navy’s carrier force during World War II. It fought in nearly every major battle in the Pacific, becoming a constant thorn in Japan’s side.\n\nSailors considered it a lucky ship, as it survived countless close calls and kept coming back stronger. Its aircraft struck decisive blows at battles like Midway, proving the aircraft carrier had replaced the battleship as the true ruler of the seas. Enterprise carried not just planes, but the morale of the Navy itself, a floating symbol of American resilience.\n\nThe British Lancaster bomber was the heavy hitter of the Royal Air Force, a night predator that struck deep into enemy territory. With its long wings and bomb bays, it could carry massive payloads and was trusted for the most dangerous missions.\n\nCrews often flew under moonlight and cloud cover, facing flak and fighters while keeping steady toward their targets. Perhaps its most famous mission was the daring “Dambusters” raid, which became a legend of ingenuity and courage. For many, the Lancaster represented Britain’s determination to hit back despite heavy losses.\n\nThe humble Jeep may not look as glamorous as a battleship or bomber, but it became one of the most beloved vehicles of the war. It was everywhere, carrying troops, hauling supplies, even serving as makeshift ambulances.\n\nSoldiers adored it for its toughness and simplicity, able to keep running through mud, sand, and rough terrain. The Jeep wasn’t about firepower, but about mobility, giving armies the ability to move fast and adapt. Its squat, boxy shape became instantly recognizable wherever Allied forces went.\n\nWhile not as intimidating as the Tiger, the Panzer IV was the true workhorse of Germany’s armored divisions. It fought in every theater of the war, proving versatile and adaptable to countless roles.\n\nGerman commanders relied on it heavily, knowing they could field it in large numbers. Its reputation wasn’t built on invincibility, but on consistency; it was always there, pushing the front lines forward. For Allied troops, facing a Panzer IV meant dealing with a determined and capable opponent.\n\nFew aircraft of World War II were as infamous as the Stuka dive bomber, its screaming sirens designed to terrify those below. German propaganda made the Stuka into a symbol of Blitzkrieg, a machine that delivered both destruction and dread.\n\nIts steep dive attacks were precise and shocking, leaving soldiers scrambling for cover. Early in the war, it seemed unstoppable, carving paths for advancing German forces. But as the skies grew more dangerous with Allied fighters, the Stuka became vulnerable.\n\nThe Soviet Katyusha rocket launcher was nicknamed “Stalin’s Organ” for the howling sound it made when firing. Mounted on trucks, it unleashed barrages of rockets that blanketed enemy positions in chaos.\n\nSoldiers described the experience as terrifying, both for those launching and those receiving the fire. Unlike traditional artillery, Katyushas could quickly move, strike, and vanish before counterattacks. Their power wasn’t in precision but in overwhelming force that rattled entire sectors.\n\nThe war ended generations ago, but the silhouettes of these machines are still etched in our minds. Whether it was the terrifying scream of a Stuka diving, the steady rumble of a Sherman column, or the towering presence of a battleship at sea, each one told a story larger than life.\n\nThese vehicles were characters in the grand part of history, and their stories remind us how innovation, ambition, and courage collided in a time of global upheaval. Today, we look back not to glorify war, but to understand how these machines became lasting legends. They are reminders of humanity’s power to build, to endure, and to remember. The steel has rusted, but the legends live on.",

    "description": "Since 1901, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarding global strides in peace-making. The 2025 ceremony took place today.",
    "fullText": "It's been 124 years since the first Nobel Peace Prize was handed out to one of the cofounders of the Red Cross and the founder of the first French Peace Society.\n\nSince then, activists, politicians, diplomats, authors, humanitarian organizations, and political prisoners from across the world have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThis year's winner, María Corina Machado, is the leader of the democracy movement in Venezuela, which is under autocratic rule. Her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa, attended the ceremony in Oslo on Wednesday and accepted on Machado's behalf.\n\nHere's who has won the Nobel Peace Prize every year it has been awarded, from 1901 to 2025.\n\nShelby Slauer and Melina Glusac contributed to a prior version of this article.\n\nDunant and Passy split the very first Nobel Peace Prize between the two of them.\n\nDunant won for founding the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863. Passy received the honor for founding the first French Peace Society (Société Française pour l'arbitrage entre nations) in 1878.\n\nDucommun mainly won for his work at the International Peace Bureau, at which he served as the honorary secretary-general, but the Nobel Prize website states that, in his spare time, he \"prepared programs for international peace congresses, published resolutions, and corresponded with promoters of peace.\"\n\nGobat won \"for his efforts to bring popularly elected representatives from various countries together at meetings and congresses.\" He also knew Ducommun well — when he died, Gobat took over as the secretary-general for the International Peace Bureau.\n\nCremer was nicknamed the \"Master of Arbitration,\" which is why he received the award. Through his work with the International Arbitration League, he sought to solve conflicts through discussion, not war.\n\nThe Institute of International Law, a nongovernmental organization based in Belgium, received the 1904 Nobel Peace Prize due to its success in persuading countries to use arbitration to deal with conflict, and for convincing countries to accept the rules of law during wartime.\n\nVon Suttner was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. She won for her work with the Austrian Peace Society, which she established in 1891. She also wrote one of the most influential anti-war novels, \"Lay Down Your Arms,\" in 1889.\n\nRoosevelt was the first American (and first statesman) to win the award, which he received for negotiating peace treaties in the Russo-Japanese War, ensuring its end in 1905, and resolving a dispute with Mexico using arbitration.\n\nMoneta founded the Lombard Association for Peace and Arbitration in 1887, which believed in disarmament. He also edited the newspaper Il Secolo, which regularly called for pacifism.\n\nRenault was a professor of international law. He spoke at numerous conferences, including two peace conferences at The Hague, where he solidified his place as a prominent figure in the arbitration movement. Renault was also the French government's advisor in foreign policy and international law.\n\nArnoldson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to reconcile Norway and Sweden. He also founded the Swedish Peace and Arbitration League.\n\nBajer founded the Danish Interparliamentary Group in 1891 and was a lifelong believer in peace and arbitration. He's also been credited with laying the groundwork for the International Peace Bureau.\n\nBeernaert won the Nobel Peace Prize for \"inter-parliamentary work and [appearances] at the international peace conferences at the Hague in 1899 and 1907.\" He was also the prime minister of Belgium from 1884 to 1894.\n\nD'Estournelles also won the prize in 1909. He was the founder and president of a French parliamentary group for voluntary arbitration, and the founder of the Committee for the Defense of National Interests and International Conciliation.\n\nThe International Peace Bureau is a Swiss organization that \"campaigned for disarmament and for the use of mediation and arbitration in the solution of international disputes.\" It's still active today with 300 member organizations in 70 countries.\n\nAsser co-founded the Institute of International Law, the first organization to win the Nobel Peace Prize. But it was \"his work in the field of private law\" that was most important to his win.\n\nFried co-founded the German Peace Society and founded Die Friedenswarte, a German peace publication.\n\nRoot was both the US secretary of war and secretary of state. He was also the first president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nRoot was awarded the prize \"for having pursued the aim that conflicts between states must be resolved by arbitration.\"\n\nLa Fontaine was the first socialist to win the prize — he won for being the \"effective leader of the peace movement in Europe.\" He was president of the International Peace Bureau and \"organized a world conference for international organizations,\" whose purpose was to \"create 'an intellectual parliament' for humanity.\"\n\nThe Red Cross was the only recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize during World War I. It won because it \"undertook the tremendous task of trying to protect the rights of the many prisoners of war on all sides, including their right to establish contacts with their families.\"\n\nWilson won the prize for founding the League of Nations, which was a dream many previous winners had shared.\n\nEx-secretary of state and former president of the French parliament, Bourgeois was a major figure in the development of the League of Nations. It was his passion project to see an international court established at The Hague, which he saw through.\n\nBranting was \"a leading figure in the struggle for equal rights and social justice in Sweden\" and a strong supporter of the League of Nations.\n\nLange was also the secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and went on to become part of the Nobel Committee in 1934.\n\nIn 1922, Nansen was appointed the first High Commissioner for Refugees, putting him in charge of the exchange of 400,000 prisoners of war. His work on their behalf, as well as on behalf of many starving refugees, won him the prize.\n\nChamberlain received his prize for his work on the Locarno Pact, an agreement that saw Germany, France, Belgium, Great Britain, and Italy guarantee peace in western Europe.\n\nUS Vice President Dawes, on the other hand, won for \"having contributed to reducing the tension between Germany and France after the First World War.\"\n\nBriand, a professor and founder of the League for Human Rights, and Stresmann, ex-high chancellor and foreign minister, split the award — they both won for their work on the Locarno Pact, which helped ease tension between France and Germany after World War I.\n\nFrench foreign minister Buisson and German professor Quidde,  who later became president of the German Peace Society, split the prize evenly — they received it for their contributions to the reconciliation of France and Germany after World War I.\n\nUS Secretary of State Kellogg received the prize for his part in initiating the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, an international agreement that had signatory states promising not to use war to resolve disputes.\n\nSöderblom was the first clergyman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. The archbishop and former theology professor is credited with moving the Universal Conference on Life and Work forward, which worked to fight nationalism, racism, and the oppression of minorities.\n\nAddams, an American known as the \"mother\" of social work, received the honor for founding the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and for being an outspoken opponent of entering World War I.\n\nButler, an American philosopher and diplomat, as well as president of Columbia University and president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, won for \"his efforts to strengthen international law and the International Court at the Hague,\" as well as his support of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928.\n\nAngell remains the only Nobel Peace Prize winner to have won for writing a book — he wrote \"The Great Illusion,\" which explored the relationship between war and any potential national or economic advantage it may bring about. He was also celebrated for his work as an educator and for his support of the League of Nations.\n\nBritish politician Henderson earned the prize for his work with the League of Nations, specifically for being \"one of the principal architects behind the organization's disarmament conference.\"\n\nOssietzky's win was inherently political — the German pacifist was arrested for treason when he reported that Germany was secretly rearming itself, explicitly going against the Treaty of Versailles. Part of the international campaign to get him released was awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nLamas, an Argentine academic and politician, won the prize for three main reasons.\n\nFirst, he deserves much of the credit for Argentina's joining the League of Nations. Second, he was important in the League's \"condemnation of Italy's war on Ethiopia.\" Lastly, he was honored for his contributions to peace between Paraguay and Bolivia after the Chaco War.\n\nEnglish statesman Cecil won the prize for his work with the League of Nations. He was integral to the formation of the organization's rules.\n\nThe Nansen International Office for Refugees won the prize for its work with aiding refugees, specifically for its work with Armenian refugees who were driven out of Turkey.\n\nThe organization won 16 years after their namesake, Fridtjof Nansen won as an individual.\n\nThe Red Cross won its second Nobel Peace Prize for service during World War II.\n\nHull, known as the longest-serving secretary of state — he held the position for 11 years — won the prize for his work as the \"father of the United Nations,\" an organization that was founded after World War II.\n\nMott was the head of the Young Men's Christian Association (the YMCA) and won for contributing \"to the creation of a peace-promoting religious brotherhood across national boundaries.\"\n\nBalch, an American economist and sociologist known for tackling social issues such as poverty, child labor, and immigration, became a Nobel Laureate for leading the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.\n\nThe US, however, saw her as a \"dangerous radical.\"\n\nThese two Quaker organizations shared the prize. They both carried out humanitarian work during World War I and II, but their 1947 win was the \"Nobel Committee's recognition both of pioneering work in the international peace movement and of humanitarian work carried out without regard for race or nationality.\"\n\nOrr was president of both the National Peace Council and the World Union of Peace Organizations, and in 1945, he was elected the director-general of the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization).\n\nBunche, an academic and diplomat, was the first African-American person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. He won it for \"having arranged a cease-fire between Israelis and Arabs during the war, which followed the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.\"\n\nJouhaux, the French trade union leader, joined the elite Nobel Laureate club for his \"work for social equality and Franco-German reconciliation.\"\n\nWriter and physician Schweitzer earned the award for founding Lambaréné, a missionary hospital, in the African country of Gabon with his wife.\n\nThe Marshall Plan is what won Marshall, the former US Secretary of State, this honor. The Marshall Plan was the US's response to the widespread devastation of World War II in Western Europe — it provided more than $15 billion to finance rebuilding projects.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) received the prize in 1954, four years after the creation of the UNHCR. The organization was honored for its work with refugees after World War II, the cause for which it was originally created.\n\nPearson received the prize when, as Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, he found a solution to the Suez Crisis.\n\nGreat Britain, France, and Israel launched an attack on Egypt in 1956 in an effort to remove its president, without informing the United States, and Pearson won support to send a United Nations Emergency Force to separate the groups.\n\nPire, a Belgian Dominican friar, received the prize for his work with refugees in Europe. Throughout the 1950s, he set up villages of small houses for European refugees and founded an organization in 1957 that undertook development projects in other parts of the world.\n\nWhen World War I began, Noel-Baker, a British politician and diplomat, was convinced the private armaments industry was largely responsible for the outbreak of war.

These derelict machines have been scattered all over the world of Viewros, and some of them are quite hard to find. Still, if you manage to stumble upon these contraptions, then you're in for a treat. That's because they automatically reveal all items and upgrades in a particular zone.\n\nOur guide has all the details that you need. But, before we continue, we need to remind you that Scout Bots can only be activated once you've unlocked the Thunder Shot ability several hours into the campaign. Upon zapping a Scout Bot, scan it to mark the remaining items on your map.\n\nSub-zone: Ancient Path - This machine is in the middle of the clearing next to several red plants.\n\nSub-zone: Tower 2 Generator - You're likely to spot this Scout Bot in Metroid Prime 4 while exploring the Volt Forge. Later in the game, once you get the Thunder Shot, you could just take a shortcut to reach it.\n\nSub-zone: Snowfield - This machine is fairly hard to miss. You'll see it as you approach the large open Snowfield, which is also where you end up fighting dozens of wolves. Oh, and don't forget to grab the Shot Expansion in a small nook behind the debris. Use your Fire Shot to melt the ice.\n\nSub-zone: Lava Lake Bridge - Upon arriving at the massive lake of scorching hot lava, mount up on your Vi-O-La and go to the opposite end along the right-hand side. The derelict contraption is near some tether points.\n\nSub-zone: Main Shaft Level 3 - Found just after the last save point before the boss' chamber. When you see the giant Griever cocoon, look to your left near the doorway.\n\nSub-zone: N/A - This particular Scout Bot can be found just north of the entrance to Volt Forge. Use your psionic powers to make the purple platforms materialize. Then, hop over to the opposite landmass. Note that this particular Scout Bot reveals various items that are in underground shrines, as well as those that are given to you by Tokabi at his campsites.\n\nThat does it for our guide on where to find all Scout Bots in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. These drones ought to make exploration a lot easier since you'll be able to see several goodies on your map. If you need clearer directions, you can take a look at our articles about Energy Tanks, Shot Expansions, Missile Expansions, Psychic Power Bomb Expansions, and Mech Parts.\n\nVenture forth across the endless dunes of Viewros and delve deeper into long-forgotten alien facilities.

More than 9 million Australians use Pinterest each month.\n\nWednesday’s report found searches for 1980s luxury soared by 225%, “Scotland Highlands aesthetic” by 465% and “the poet aesthetic” by 175%. “Poetcore” – a key trend for Gen Z and millennials - takes its inspiration from the bookish: turtlenecks, fountain pens, satchels and ties.\n\nDriven by Gen Z and millennials, lace will be in, according to the data, including in doily, bandana and makeup form – as will khaki, field jackets and pleated trousers, aka the “paleontologist aesthetic”.\n\nThey’ll also be working an intergalactic “aliencore aesthetic”.\n\nFor Gen Z and millennials, travel will be adrenaline-seeking; for baby boomers, it will be to places that are “mystical” and “ethereal”. Searches for “Faroe Island aesthetic” almost doubled.\n\nPinterest predicts boomer and Gen X food trends to be cruciferous, with kimchi, dumplings and golumpki soup all raising the cabbage’s status. A younger trend for a “gummy bears aesthetic” goes beyond sweets and into makeup products and rubberised nail art.\n\nAnd “niche perfume collection” is having its moment in the sun, as are “perfume layering combinations”.\n\nPinterest said there was a theme uniting trends as disparate as masquerades and operas, dragonfly wing-patterned nails and animal-inspired outfits, forecasting a move towards individuality and away from imitation.\n\nMelinda Petrunoff, the managing director for Pinterest ANZ, told Guardian Australia that “people are craving comfort, authenticity and grounded optimism in a world that feels increasingly fast and often noisy”.\n\n“What’s driving this is a desire for individuality and self-preservation – people are moving towards curating rather than copying, choosing to engage with what truly resonates with them instead of chasing every viral moment,” she said.\n\n“We’re moving away from one-size-fits-all aesthetics and endless trend cycles that leave people feeling overwhelmed and disconnected.”",

    "title": "There’s Likely No Way Back For Russia’s An-22 Turboprop Heavy Transports After Fatal Crash",
    "description": "The An-22 that crashed was reportedly the last airworthy example of what was once the world’s heaviest aircraft.",
    "fullText": "A Russian military Antonov An-22 Cock heavy transport aircraft crashed in the Ivanovo region, around 125 miles northeast of Moscow today, killing the entire crew. The incident is notable especially for the fact that the Soviet-era plane had been widely reported as retired, roughly 18 months ago. Exactly why the aircraft was still flying is unclear, but it does raise some questions about the overall status of the Russian Aerospace Forces’ transport arm.\n\nAccording to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the country’s main federal investigating authority, the turboprop-powered airlifter went down near the village of Ivankovo. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the An-22 breaking apart in mid-air, with parts of the fuselage falling into a reservoir near the village. A video posted to social media purportedly shows a salvage team removing fragments of the aircraft from the Uvodskoye Reservoir.\n\nThe Investigative Committee of Russia has so far not disclosed how many people were on board, although the state-run TASS news agency puts the number at seven, and unconfirmed reports on social media provide names for each.\n\nRussian state media quoted the Russian Ministry of Defense as saying that the An-22 was undergoing a test flight “following repairs” when it crashed, suggesting it was in the process of being returned to service.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that search crews were deployed to the crash site and an investigation was opened into the accident.\n\nCiting anonymous sources, the Kommersant business newspaper reported that the accident was likely caused by a technical malfunction.\n\nBack in August of last year, there were unconfirmed reports that Russia had finally ceased operations of its An-22 fleet altogether. At this time, it was suggested that the last example, registration number RF-09309, built in 1974, was flown from its home base of Migalovo in the Tver region of western Russia, to Yekaterinburg in the Ural Federal District on August 16, 2024. It was expected to be put on permanent display at the military museum in Verkhnyaya Pyshma. However, no An-22 is visible in recent satellite imagery of the collection, suggesting those plans may have changed.\n\nFrom August 16. \n\nFinal flight of Antei RF-09309 #14245D. Russia is retiring their An-22s. This one is slated to become part of a museum. \n\nPic by Artyom Kuzhlev pic.twitter.com/nvbO3BQjGZ\n\n— Evergreen Intel (@vcdgf555) August 24, 2024\n\nPotentially, RF-09309 is the same aircraft that crashed today, or it could have been one of the other four An-22s that were reportedly still active with the Russian Aerospace Forces’ 196th Military Transport Aviation Regiment as of June 2024.\n\nAt that point, Gen. Vladimir Venediktov, the commander of Military Transport Aviation, told Russia’s state-owned VGTRK broadcaster that the An-22 was headed for retirement before the end of that year.\n\nThat the An-22 survived that long, let alone that an example was still flying as of today, is somewhat remarkable.\n\nAs you can read about in detail here, the An-22 was designed and built by the Antonov company based in Kyiv, in what was then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The prototype flew on February 27, 1965, at which point it was the world’s heaviest aircraft.\n\nIn common with the Tupolev Tu-95 Bear bomber, the An-22 was powered by four huge Kuznetsov NK-12MA turboprops, each rated at more than 14,805 horsepower and driving eight-blade contra-rotating propellers, more than 20 feet in diameter.\n\nThe powerplant gave the An-22 a distinctive mechanical roar, as heard in the video below.\n\nIn all, 68 An-22s were completed, including two prototypes, between 1966 and 1976.\n\nService entry with the Soviet military was in January 1969, and the aircraft was especially valued for its ability to accommodate outsized loads.\n\nUp to more than 132,000 pounds of cargo could be carried. Alternatively, the An-22’s cargo hold had space for 151 paratroopers or 292 standard troops, carried on two decks. However, the main cargo hold was not pressurized, except for a forward cabin with seating for 29 personnel.\n\nItems of cargo included complete missile systems, as well as large and heavy military vehicles, via the large loading ramp at the rear. The aircraft could also operate from austere airfields if required.\n\nHowever, the Russian military chose to keep the An-22, even in limited numbers, since it was cheaper to operate than the An-124, but had a much bigger hold than the Ilyushin Il-76 Candid.\n\nPlans to modernize the surviving An-22s failed, however, with the result that the active Russian Aerospace Forces’ fleet dwindled to five.\n\nA sixth was still operated by the Antonov Design Bureau in Kyiv until it was reportedly damaged beyond repair during fighting at Hostomel Airport at the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion.\n\nThe fact that at least one An-22 was apparently being prepared to return to active service with the Russian Aerospace Forces appears to paint a bleak picture of its air transport arm.\n\nWhile it still operates significant numbers of Il-76s, in terms of heavy transports, Russia has also failed to reinstate production of the An-124. The main problem has been a lack of suitable engines — the original D-18T turbofan is manufactured by Motor Sich at its plant in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. Meanwhile, Motor Sich is also the only company capable of overhauling these engines, reducing the availability of the Russian An-124 fleet. This factor also may have driven the An-22’s planned return to service.\n\nPlans to develop an all-new, all-Russian successor to the Ukrainian-designed An-124 have so far also failed to materialize.\n\nOverall, the Russian transport aircraft fleet is aging fast, and this may also have contributed to other recent accidents.\n\nIn July of this year, a civilian-operated Antonov An-24 Coke twin-turboprop regional airliner crashed near Tynda in the Amur region of eastern Russia. All 42 passengers and six crew members on board died. The aircraft, long obsolete, had been manufactured in 1976.\n\nIn the same month, two people were killed after an An-2 Colt utility transport crashed in southern Russia’s Krasnodar region. The An-2 was first flown in 1947, and the Soviet Union and Russia have collectively failed to develop a suitable successor for a type that remains in widespread use.\n\nThere have also been other Russian transport aircraft losses that may or may not be connected to the conflict in Ukraine, as well as pinpoint attacks on these aircraft by long-range Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\nAt the same time, the fleet, in general, is likely suffering from the effects of sanctions, especially when it comes to readiness levels.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine still raging, the Russian military’s demand for heavy-lift air transport is only going to continue. Whatever the reason for today’s crash, it is a blow to the Russian Aerospace Forces. Apart from the slim possibility that a contractor might try and obtain the remaining aircraft to exploit their unique capabilities, it seems altogether unlikely that the An-22 will find a way back into regular service after this latest incident.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "\"Germany invading Britain is always the funniest one to me. They could have smashed the RAF into oblivion and still not been able to invade. They quite literally did not have the boats to make a contested large-scale landing. They were gonna try and use river barges to do it. Good luck with that.\"\n\n\"Some of my countrymen even suggest that it would have been better if we were fully colonized by the Japanese, believing it would have made the people more disciplined. Others still hold on to the Japanese propaganda of the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' or 'Asia for the Asians.'\"\n\n\"The really interesting thing about this idea is that it's come in since the war. In the war, with people from the political cartoonists to even Churchill himself in his most famous speech, brought up the fact that we, the British, were supported massively by the Empire.\"\n\n\"The American submarine campaign completely crippled, then outright suffocated Japan, dropping their shipping tonnage to only a fraction of what it once was by the end of the war, whereas U-boat crews were annihilated with a casualty rate of around 75%, atrocious and irreplaceable losses which led to the Kriegsmarine being a complete nonfactor in the war by 1944.\"\n\n\"The Germans invaded the USSR with more horses than trucks.\"\n\nHulton Archive / Getty Images, Bettmann / Getty Images\n\n\"For those who don't know, the British claimed carrots were one of the reasons German planes got shot down at night. It was, in reality, the invention and use of radar.\"\n\n\"The Sherman tank had one of the highest crew survival rates at the time as well. For example, American tanks had spring-loaded hatches, whereas German tanks didn't, meaning you had to open the hatch using brute force and sheer strength alone, something you don't want to do if you're wounded and trying to escape a burning tank.\"\n\n\"I was going to add that one. But I will say, the Soviets highly depended on American lend-lease early on, and I'm not convinced they beat back the Germans without that help.\"\n\n\"Fundamentally, this is true, though. American aid is essentially what won the war. Britain would never have been defeated, but Britain wouldn't have ever gone on any meaningful offensive without American aid and support. The USSR needed American aid to survive. Whilst the USSR did the heavy lifting in terms of casualties, it was the Western Allies who destroyed the means of German production.

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine, European Union leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s economic and military needs for the next two years, one way or another. Ukraine is desperate and needs the money by early 2026.\n\nAt a summit next week, the 27 EU leaders will weigh whether to use tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help meet Ukraine’s requirements, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion).\n\nSuch a move has never been done before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries' money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.\n\nBelgium, where most of the assets are held, is the main opponent of the plan. It’s fearful that Russia will strike back, either through the courts or in more nefarious ways. A series of drone incidents near airports and military bases last month suggested that the Kremlin was already doing so, but those responsible were never publicly identified.\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision.\n\nEU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the scheme as “theft.”\n\nTwo plans have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.\n\nPlan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany of Europe’s major economies are cash strapped and mired in debt. But Russia’s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat to the bloc. Intelligence assessments suggest that Putin could launch a war elsewhere in three to five years should he defeat Ukraine.\n\nThe assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, estimates that 210 billion ($244 billion) euros worth of frozen assets are currently held in Europe. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.\n\nThere are political advantages too. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all, meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.\n\nOver the last year, Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. A new and stridently nationalist leader in the Czech Republic could further complicate the decision.\n\nAvoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.\n\nDetails of the reparations loan\n\nUnveiling her plan on Dec. 4, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027, for a total of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.\n\nDue to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. They’ve generated interest — some 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) this year, Euroclear says — which is already being used to fund a Group of Seven loan plan for Ukraine.\n\nUnder the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.\n\nThe commission insists that there is no “theft,” as Russia has claimed, because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.\n\nOnce Putin pays war reparations, Ukraine would repay the EU, the EU would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank.\n\nImportantly for Belgium, the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so.\n\nBut the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission's reparations loan plan was made public, Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that it “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks.”\n\nPrévot said Belgium — a strong backer of Ukraine that has provided military and financial support — feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.\n\n“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return,” he said.\n\nIn an interview with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF last week, Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also said that court action could not be ruled out should the EU oblige the clearinghouse to transfer its Russian assets.",

    "fullText": "Paul Pogba has moved into the sport of camel racing after investing in Saudi Arabia-based team Al Haboob.\n\nThe Monaco midfielder has become a shareholder and ambassador for Al Haboob - the world's first professional camel racing team competing across the United Arab Emirates and the Gulf.\n\nPogba, 32, told BBC Sport: \"I've watched my fair share of [camel] races on YouTube and spent time doing research in my spare time trying to understand the techniques and strategies.\n\n\"And what stood out to me is how much dedication it takes from everyone involved. At the end of the day, sport is sport. It demands heart, sacrifice and teamwork.\"\n\nCamel racing is a traditional sport which is particularly popular in the Middle East.\n\nPogba set to make first appearance since doping ban\n\nWhy Monaco have gambled on 'wildcard' Pogba\n\n\"People might not realise it, but sport always connects in some way,\" added Frenchman Pogba.\n\n\"Whether it's football, camel racing, boxing - the foundations are similar. You need determination, you need focus, you need discipline and grit. That's what makes champions at the end of the day.\"\n\nPogba, who became the world's most expensive player when he joined Manchester United from Juventus in 2016 for £89m, added: \"Being the world's most expensive footballer was an honour, but it also came with a lot of hard work, pressure and responsibility.\n\n\"Owning the world's most expensive camel one day would be a beautiful full-circle moment - something fun, something meaningful and something that excites me. Maybe one day we make it happen.\"\n\nAl Haboob, founded by entrepreneurs Omar Almaeena and Safwan Modir, is the world's first modern camel racing team to compete internationally.\n\n\"Paul's involvement is transformational,\" said Almaeena.\n\n\"His influence, leadership, and passion for cultural storytelling reflect exactly what Al Haboob stands for. This partnership is about more than racing; it is about sharing a heritage that deserves global recognition.\"\n\nPogba made his long-awaited return to professional football on 22 November after coming on as a late substitute in Monaco's 4-1 Ligue 1 defeat by Rennes.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup winner had not played since featuring for Juventus against Empoli in September 2023, following an original four-year doping ban, that was cut to 18 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).\n\nPogba maintained it was a mistake and he was given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Italy’s failure to qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup inevitably sparked plenty of debate across this once-proud footballing nation.\n\nLosing home and away to Norway consigned Italy to the play-offs and left them facing the prospect of missing out on the tournament for the third consecutive time.\n\nHead coach Gennaro Gattuso inevitably resorted to deflection tactics towards the end of European qualifying, bemoaning the revised system that seemingly favors other continents.\n\n“In my day, the best group runners-up went straight to the World Cup, now the rules have changed,” Gattuso said.\n\n“Italy’s record of six wins? You’d have to ask the people who make the groups and the rules. In 1990 and 1994, there were two African teams, now there are nine. It’s not a controversy, but there are difficulties, and we know it well.\n\n“If we look at South America, where six out of 10 teams go directly to the World Cup and the seventh heads into a play-off with a team from Oceania, that does give you regrets and a certain sadness. That is the disappointment. The system needs to change in Europe.”\n\nPutting aside the fact there are some factual inaccuracies in Gattuso’s comments, the 2020 European champions have only themselves to blame for their current situation.\n\nItaly were the top seeds in a relatively easy group, yet failed to get the job done. However, you flower it up, losing to Norway by a combined 7-1 scoreline is unacceptable.\n\nThe decision to appoint Gattuso to replace Luciano Spalletti looked questionable when it was announced, and subsequent events have done little to dispel that notion.\n\nGattuso was a fine player – a combative midfielder who helped AC Milan win the Champions League twice and Italy lift their last World Cup trophy in 2006.\n\nHowever, his managerial record at club level was hugely underwhelming and Italy’s decision to place him in charge may yet have a catastrophic ending.\n\n“When I heard Gattuso was online it just seemed to demonstrate the giant collapse of Italy,” Italian football journalist Mina Rzouki told the Euro Leagues podcast.\n\n“There were so many clips going around on social media about that Italy team just before they won the World Cup and you are talking about Paolo Maldini, [Fabio] Cannavaro, [Alessandro] Nesta, [Francesco] Totti, [Alessandro] Del Piero and it was just an embarrassment of riches.\n\n“Now when you look at Italy over the last few seasons, even though they won the Euros, there was just a fall – but the one thing you could rely on was that Italy created these great coaches. Yet none of these great coaches were called up or have succeeded.”\n\nPlay-off draw offers Italy hope\n\nItaly’s hopes of progressing to the World Cup were boosted after they were handed a relatively favorable draw in the play-offs.\n\nThey will host Northern Ireland in the semi-final, with the winners of that game visiting either Wales or Bosnia & Herzegovina in the final.\n\nThe last four tie against Northern Ireland should hold little fear for Italy. They suffered defeats at Germany and Slovakia in the group stage and generally don’t travel too well.\n\nHaving won seven and drawn three of their previous 11 meetings, Italy have little to fear from a team ranked 69th in the latest FIFA rankings.\n\nOn paper, Wales are the biggest threat to Italy. They are ranked 32nd in the world and are generally tough to beat on their own patch.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that they have never defeated Bosnia & Herzegovina in four previous attempts. The visitors will fancy their chances of enhancing that record.\n\nUltimately, given that Italy are currently ranked 12th in the world, they should be able to successfully navigate through the play-offs.\n\nThey have lost just twice to Wales in ten previous meetings and once to Bosnia & Herzegovina in six matches. If Italy fail to progress, they have no excuses.\n\nWhile suggesting that Italy could mount a challenge for the World Cup next summer is a little fanciful, stranger things have happened in football.\n\nThey demonstrated their credentials by winning the 2020 European Championship title and can draw inspiration from what they achieved on that occasion.\n\nAside from Spain and France, none of the other so-called main contenders for the World Cup are significantly better than Italy.\n\nIf they safely navigate the play-offs and land a favorable draw next summer, Italy are perfectly capable of making a deep run in the tournament.",

    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — The Red Sox don’t anticipate ace Garrett Crochet or star rookie Roman Anthony participating in the World Baseball Classic in the spring. Regardless, Boston will be well-represented in the tournament.\n\nIn addition to reliever Garrett Whitlock, who will pitch for Team USA, there are many other Boston players expected to participate, according to manager Alex Cora and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow. Outfielders Jarren Duran (Mexico) is committed and Ceddanne Rafaela (Netherlands) and Wilyer Abreu (Venezuela) appear likely to join him. Reliever Jovani Morán will pitch for Puerto Rico. There are plenty of players in the “maybe” category, too, including Marcelo Mayer (Mexico), Aroldis Chapman (Great Britain) and Brayan Bello (Dominican Republic)\n\nCatcher Carlos Narváez (Venezuela) and designated hitter Masataka Yoshida (Japan) are unlikely to suit up in the tournament considering the injuries they dealt with in 2025.\n\nCora, who played twice for Puerto Rico and served as the island’s general manager in 2017, said the Red Sox encourage all their players to participate if it makes sense for them to do so. The tournament, which will be played from March 5-17, will pull players out of spring training.\n\n“I love the tournament,” Cora said. “There’s some injury factor, and stuff happens. But it can happen in Houston. It can happen in Miami and Puerto Rico. It can happen in Fort Myers. But they have to play baseball.”\n\nCora said Crochet decided not to represent Team USA because his of his 2025 workload, which surpassed 200 innings. Narváez had offseason knee surgery and will be re-assessed in camp. Whitlock, Duran, Rafaela and Abreu all ended the season healthy and should be able to participate with no restrictions. Situations involving other players are more complicated.\n\nOne such case is Mayer, who after missing the last two months of the season with a wrist injury, will be looking to compete for a starting infield spot in camp. He has expressed his interest in suiting up for Mexico but is not yet committed because he’s recovering from surgery.\n\n“There’s certain rules within the tournament as far as injured players and insurance and surgeries and all that. So we’ll see where we’re at,” Cora said. “I know when we went to Monterrey, when he left Monterrey, he was like, ‘I want to play in the tournament.’ So we’ll see where we’re at. They’re kind of, like, 50/50, Mexico, understanding that he had surgery and there’s other stuff that comes up with the whole thing.\n\n“It’s complicated, to be honest with you. But if he gets cleared, from our standpoint, if he wants to do it, we’re OK with it.”\n\nBello, who pitched a career-high 166 ⅔ innings in the regular season, wants to pitch for the Dominican Republic but the team will be careful with his build-up to the season.\n\n“He’s potentially a candidate but also there will be conversations there,” Breslow said. “The last couple years, he has come into spring training a little bit behind so that’s something who we want to make sure we’re sensitive to.”\n\nChapman, who re-signed with the Red Sox in September toward the end of an All-Star first season in Boston, is leaning toward pitching for Great Britain, though his paperwork has not yet been finalized, in part because it has been hard to access records from the Cuban government. Chapman is eligible to pitch for Great Britain because of his Jamaican heritage, which makes him eligible for British citizenship and therefore, participation in the tournament.\n\nRed Sox landed the perfect pitcher last winter; Finding the perfect hitter is proving considerably harder | Sean McAdam\n\nRed Sox trade rumors: Boston exploring deal for Rangers All-Star (report)\n\nWhat we’re hearing on Red Sox at Winter Meetings Day 2: Pete Alonso meeting & more\n\nRed Sox have new challenge for Wilyer Abreu in ‘26: ‘He has earned the right,’ says Craig Breslow\n\nAs Boston Red Sox pursue Alex Bregman, Alex Cora explains ‘less is more’",

Despite a Club World Cup win and a top 4 finish last year, as well as an overall bright start to this campaign, there are a lot of doubters about the Italian coach.\n\nChelsea icon Gianfranco Zola speaking on the pitch at Stamford Bridge.\n\nOne person who isn’t in any doubt about him is club legend Gianfranco Zola. He claims he saw the coach’s talent before he had even come to Stamford Bridge.\n\n“I didn’t know him personally before he came to Chelsea, but I had followed what he did at Leicester and could see that we were dealing with a serious coach,” Zola said.\n\n“He’s worked with and for [Arrigo] Sacchi, Manuel Pellegrini, [Pep] Guardiola. He’s had an excellent grounding.”\n\nThere are a lot of positives about Maresca which nobody can dispute – he seems to have a lot of respect from the players and as Zola says, he’s got a great background in terms of people he’s worked under.\n\nHowever many Blues fans still aren’t delighted with the football he has his teams playing, and there are other gripes about his rotation policy and team selection in general. There’s also a sense he doesn’t get the best out of our star player, Cole Palmer.\n\nIt will be very interesting to see how feelings change through the course of the coach’s second year in charge.\n\nChelsea’s social media silence over one player this week was very notable – it doesn’t look like things are getting sorted out in this case anytime soon.\n\nChelsea managed to get a player into the Premier League team of the week in the week just gone – but it’s not the sort of player you want to see in there.

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin asserted only a year ago that no power can ban Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) regardless of what happens to the dollar. While many saw it as a message to the West on international sanctions, the country has taken targeted steps to open its economy to the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nDuring an investment conference in Moscow on Dec. 4, 2024, Putin argued that the influence of the dollar on the global economy was waning, paving the way for the growth of other instruments.\n\n“For instance – Bitcoin. Who can prohibit its use? No one,” Putin said. “Or the use of other electronic ways of settlement. No one can ban the use of them.”\n\nPutin added that the new instruments would “continue developing” regardless of what happens to the dollar.\n\nDon’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nShortly after these comments, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed that Russian companies have started using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for cross-border transactions, described as a response to trade disruptions from sanctions imposed after the Ukraine war.\n\nThe minister said that it was possible to use the Bitcoin mined in Russia in foreign trade.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Putin greenlighted Bitcoin mining in the country earlier that year. He previously rejected the central bank's proposal to ban cryptocurrencies in 2022, arguing that the country possesses \"competitive advantages\" in the field of mining.\n\nIn accordance with Putin’s directives, the central bank proposed in March of this year to allow a limited number of “highly qualified” Russian investors to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies under a new three-year experimental legal regime.\n\nThe bank maintained that it still doesn’t see cryptocurrency as a means of payment and proposed a ban on all cryptocurrency transactions between Russian residents outside the experimental regime.\n\nSee Also: Fast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nHowever, recent developments suggest attempts to expand cryptocurrency access for Russians. Bank of Russia First Deputy Governor Vladimir Chistyukhin said that rules should be eased beyond the “extremely narrow” category of qualified investors, given the sanctions in place, according to a Cryptopolitan report.",

    "description": "Tuesday was a good day to be Kyle Schwarber.",
    "fullText": "Tuesday was a good day to be Kyle Schwarber.\n\nThe Philadelphia slugger agreed to a five-year, $150 million contract to remain with the Phillies. And he was announced as one of four new players selected to USA's World Baseball Classic team.\n\nUSA Baseball announced Tuesday that Schwarber, Orioles shortstop Gunnar Henderson, Brewers second baseman Brice Turang and Dodgers catcher Will Smith will join a WBC roster that's already laden with MLB stars.\n\nAaron Judge, Cal Raleigh, Paul Skenes and Bobby Witt Jr. are among the players previously selected to play for Team USA in the international competition that will commence in March. Judge will serve as captain in his first WBC appearance.\n\nJudge is a three-time MVP. Skenes is a unanimous Cy Young Winner. And Schwarber and Raleigh were both MVP finalists in 2025.\n\nUSA Baseball announced the new additions via multiple social media posts, including one featuring Schwarber's 10-pitch at-bat in the 2023 WBC championship game vs. Japan that ended with a solo home run to cut Japan's lead to 3-2.\n\nPitch 4: Foul.\nPitch 5: Foul.\nPitch 6: Foul.\nPitch 7: Foul.\nPitch 8: Foul.\nPitch 9: Foul.\nPitch 10: SCHWARBOMB 💣 pic.twitter.com/WQt7V4Jjte\n\n— USA Baseball (@USABaseball) December 9, 2025\n\nBut Schwarber's blast wasn't enough to propel USA to victory. Against a Japan team that sent out Shohei Ohtani as its closer, USA didn't score again as Japan secured a 3-2 victory to win the WBC.\n\nOhtani will be playing for Japan again in March, fresh off securing his fourth MLB MVP award in five seasons. And Japan will be seeking its fourth championship after winning three of the five previous WBCs (2006, 2009, 2023).\n\nThe Dominican Repbulic won in 2013. And USA will be seeking its second title after winning in 2017.\n\nHere's what USA's roster looks like so far, with more additions to come:\n\nPaul Skenes, SP, Pittsburgh Pirates \nMatthew Boyd, SP, Chicago Cubs\n\nCal Raleigh, C, Seattle Mariners \nWill Smith, C, Los Angeles Dodgers\nBrice Turang, 2B, Milwaukee Brewers \nBobby Witt Jr., SS, Kansas City Royals \nGunnar Henderson, SS, Baltimore Orioles \nAaron Judge, OF, New York Yankees \nCorbin Carroll, OF, Arizona Diamondbacks \nPete Crow-Armstrong, OF, Chicago Cubs \nKyle Schwarber, DH, Philadelphia Phillies",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had no time to hold a traditional news conference during a whirlwind, 36-hour trip across Europe this week, so he improvised.\n\nFor the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, Zelenskyy — who usually takes reporters’ questions in person while trotting the globe — communicated with the news media via group chat. While flying between London and Brussels, he answered a long list of questions from Ukrainian and international reporters, relaying audio clips on WhatsApp.\n\nHis chosen mode of communication was, if not unprecedented, at the very least extremely rare for a world leader.\n\nThe low drone of the aircraft blended with his hoarse, tired-sounding voice, yet his message cut through clearly: Amid uncertain negotiations to end the war, Ukraine, he said, cannot surrender land.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories,” he said in a crackling message late Monday. “According to the law, we don’t have such a right … and to be frank, we don’t have a moral right either.”\n\nWith the outlook for negotiations changing by the day, Zelenskyy’s team set out on a jam-packed schedule to shore up support in Europe.\n\nZelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nA key issue being discussed is whether Ukraine should cede Russian‑occupied territory in return for security guarantees, but the talks have been complicated by uncertainty about the Trump administration’s commitment to European security.\n\nSince the start of the war, Zelenskyy has shown a desire to communicate in real-time in whatever way is necessary.\n\nWhen Kyiv came under siege shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Zelenskyy tried to reassure the public through what appeared to be a cellphone video with three top officials — perhaps his best-known address.\n\n“We are all here,” he said at the time. “Our soldiers are here, the citizens of our country are all here protecting our independence, and we are going to continue to do so.”\n\nSince then, Zelenskyy has made frequent communication a strategic priority in a sleep-defying cycle of video messages, remote speeches to Western parliaments and conferences, late-night posts and high-security public appearances.\n\nMonday night’s WhatsApp exchange wound down as his plane landed in Brussels, just before he was whisked into his next round of meetings.\n\nHe asked reporters: “How did you like this format? If it works for you, then when we have the opportunity, we’ll share our thoughts and decisions this way again.”\n\nIt didn't take long. By Tuesday evening, Zelenskyy had sent reporters more audio messages on WhatsApp to explain how talks to end the war were proceeding with its Western allies.",

    "description": "Oil prices stumbled in 2025 on weaker demand and surging supply. One of the world's biggest commodities firms says the dynamic will worsen in 2026.",
    "fullText": "The long-predicted \"super glut\" of oil is expected to hit energy markets in 2026.\n\nTrafigura, one of the world's biggest commodities trading firms, said it believes the oil market will see a flood of new supply at a time when the demand outlook is softening globally.\n\n\"If we look at what is driving the expectations of that super glut, it's hard to see how we don't get there,\" Saad Rahim, the chief economist at Trafigura, said in a video posted with the firm's annual financial results on Tuesday.\n\nThere are two things that feed into the expected glut of crude next year, Rahim said:\n\nThe crude market has already been feeling the effects of the supply-demand imbalance this year. Apart from a brief blip during the Israel-Iran conflict over the summer, oil prices have been trending lower all year. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $62 a barrel on Tuesday, down 18% year-to-date. West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $58 a barrel, down 19% year-to-date.\n\n\"Whether it's a glut or a super glut, it's really hard to get away from that,\" he added, though he noted that factors like tighter sanctions and decreased production among OPEC nations and the US could help with the supply outlook.\n\nIf China, one of the world's largest oil consumers, were to slow its oil purchases, that could be another factor that could usher in the supply glut, he added.\n\nThe firm's view tracks with what other forecasters see for the oil market next year, some of whom have floated the possibility of a supply glut in the past.\n\nIn its November report, the International Energy Agency said it expected the world's oil supply to surge by over 3 million barrels a day in 2026 while demand growth remains \"modest by historical standards.\" The agency added that the balance of the market looked \"increasingly askew.\"",

    "fullText": "UN GEO report says ending this harm key to global transformation required ‘before collapse becomes inevitable’\n\nThe unsustainable production of food and fossil fuels causes $5bn (£3.8bn) of environmental damage per hour, according to a major UN report.\n\nEnding this harm was a key part of the global transformation of governance, economics and finance required “before collapse becomes inevitable”, the experts said.\n\nThe Global Environment Outlook (GEO) report, which is produced by 200 researchers for the UN Environment Programme, said the climate crisis, destruction of nature and pollution could no longer be seen as simply environmental crises.\n\n“They are all undermining our economy, food security, water security, human health and they are also [national] security issues, leading to conflict in many parts of the world,” said Prof Robert Watson, the co-chair of the assessment.\n\nAll the environmental crises were worsening as the global population grows and required more food and energy, most of which was produced in ways that pollute the planet and destroy the natural world, the experts said. A sustainable world was possible, they said, but required political courage.\n\n“This is an urgent call to transform our human systems now before collapse becomes inevitable,” said Prof Edgar Gutiérrez-Espeleta, another co-chair and the former environment minister in Costa Rica.\n\n“The science is good. The solutions are known. What is required is the courage to act at the scale and speed that history demands,” he said, adding that the window for action was “rapidly narrowing”.\n\nThe experts acknowledged that the geopolitical situation today was difficult, with the US under Donald Trump, some other countries and corporate vested interests working to block or reverse environmental action. Watson, a former chair of leading international climate and biodiversity science groups, said: “The public have got to demand that they want a sustainable future for their children and their grandchildren. Most governments do try and respond.”\n\nThe GEO report is comprehensive – 1,100 pages this year – and is usually accompanied by a summary for policymakers, which is agreed by all the world’s countries. However, strong objections by countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Turkey and Argentina to references to fossil fuels, plastics, reduced meat in diets and other issues meant no agreement was reached this time.\n\nA statement made by the UK on behalf of 28 countries said: “We witnessed diversion attempts to question the scientific nature of this process. Our delegations fully respect every state’s right to safeguard their country’s national interests and rights, but science is not negotiable.”\n\nThe GEO report emphasised that the costs of action were much less than the costs of inaction in the long term, and estimated the benefits from climate action alone would be worth $20tn a year by 2070 and $100tn by 2100. “We need visionary countries and private sector [companies] to recognise they will make more profit by addressing these issues rather than ignoring them,” Watson said.\n\nThe report contained several “critical truths”, Gutiérrez-Espeleta said: environmental crises were political and security emergencies, threatening the social ties that held societies together. Today’s governments and economic systems were failing humanity and financial reform was the cornerstone of transformation, he said: “Environmental policy must become the backbone of national security, social justice, and economic strategy.”\n\nOne of the biggest issues was the $45tn a year in environmental damage caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, and the pollution and destruction of nature caused by industrial agriculture, the report said. The food system carried the largest costs, at $20tn, with transport at $13tn and fossil-fuel powered electricity at $12tn.\n\nThese costs – called externalities by economists – must be priced into energy and food to reflect their real price and shift consumers towards greener choices, Watson said: “So we need social safety nets. We need to make sure that the poorest in society are not harmed by an increase in costs.”\n\nThe report suggests measures such as a universal basic income, taxes on meat and subsidies for healthy, plant-based foods.\n\nThere were also about $1.5tn in environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, food and mining, the report said. These needed to be removed or repurposed, it added. Watson noted that wind and solar energy was cheaper in many places but held back by vested interests in fossil fuel.\n\nThe climate crisis may be even worse than thought, he said: “We are likely to be underestimating the magnitude of climate change”, with global heating probably at the high end of the projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nRemoving fossil fuel subsidies could cut emissions by a third, the report said.",

Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza since the war began more than two years ago, except for rare, brief visits supervised by the military, such as this one.",
    "fullText": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — One by one, the soldiers squeezed through a narrow entrance to a tunnel in southern Gaza. Inside a dark hallway, some bowed their heads to avoid hitting the low ceiling, while watching their step as they walked over or around jagged concrete, crushed plastic bottles and tattered mattresses.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military took journalists into Rafah — the city at Gaza's southernmost point that troops seized last year and largely flattened — as the 2-month-old Israel-Hamas ceasefire reaches a critical point. Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza since the war began more than two years ago, except for rare, brief visits supervised by the military, such as this one.\n\nSoldiers escorted journalists inside a tunnel, which they said was one of Hamas' most significant and complex underground routes, connecting cities in the embattled territory and used by top Hamas commanders. Israel said Hamas had kept the body of a hostage in the underground passage: Hadar Goldin, a 23-year-old soldier who was killed in Gaza more than a decade ago and whose remains had been held there.\n\nHamas returned Goldin's body last month as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in the war triggered by the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds taken hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which operates under the Hamas-run government. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says roughly half the dead have been women and children.\n\nIsrael and Hamas are on the cusp of finishing the first phase of the truce, which mandated the return of all hostages, living and dead, in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel. The body of just one more hostage remains to be returned.\n\nMediators warn the second phase will be far more challenging since it includes thornier issues, such as disarming Hamas and Israel’s withdrawal from the strip. Israel currently controls more than half of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to travel to Washington this month to discuss those next steps with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nPiles of rubble line Rafah's roads\n\nLast year, Israel launched a major operation in Rafah, where many Palestinians had sought refuge from offensives elsewhere. Heavy fighting left much of the city in ruins and displaced nearly one million Palestinians. This year, when the military largely had control of the city, it systematically demolished most of the buildings that remained standing, according to satellite photos.\n\nTroops also took control of and shut the vital Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only gateway to the outside world that was not controlled by Israel.\n\nIsrael said Rafah was Hamas’ last major stronghold and key to dismantling the group’s military capabilities, a major war aim.\n\nOn the drive around Rafah on Monday, towers of mangled concrete, wires and twisted metal lined the roads, with few buildings still standing and none unscathed. Remnants of people's lives were scattered the ground: a foam mattress, towels and a book explaining the Quran.\n\nLast week, Israel said it was ready to reopen the Rafah crossing but only for people to leave the strip. Egypt and many Palestinians fear that once people leave, they won't be allowed to return. They say Israel is obligated to open the crossing in both directions.\n\nIsrael has said that entry into Gaza would not be permitted until Israel receives all hostages remaining in the strip.\n\nThe tunnel that journalists were escorted through runs beneath what was once a densely populated residential neighborhood, under a United Nations compound and mosques. Today, Rafah is a ghost town. Underground, journalists picked their way around dangling cables and uneven concrete slabs covered in sand.\n\nThe army says the tunnel is more than 7 kilometers (4 miles) long and up to 25 meters (82 feet) deep and was used for storing weapons as well as long-term stays. It said top Hamas commanders were there during the war, including Mohammed Sinwar — who was believed to have run Hamas’ armed wing and was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who helped mastermind the Oct. 7 attack. Israel has said it has killed both of them.\n\n“What we see right here is a perfect example of what Hamas did with all the money and the equipment that was brought into Gaza throughout the years,\" said Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. \"Hamas took it and built an incredible city underground for the purposes of terror and holding bodies of hostages.”\n\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of siphoning off money for military purposes. While Hamas says the Palestinians are an occupied people and have a right to resist, the group also has a civilian arm and ran a government that provided services such as health care, a police force and education.\n\nThe army hasn’t decided what to do with the tunnel. It could seal it with concrete, explode it or hold it for intelligence purposes among other options.\n\nSince the ceasefire began, three soldiers have been killed in clashes with about 200 Hamas militants that Israeli and Egyptian officials say remain underground in Israeli-held territory.\n\nHamas has said communication with its remaining units in Rafah has been cut off for months and that it was not responsible for any incidents occurring in those areas.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have accused each other of repeated violations of the deal during the first phase. Israel has accused Hamas of dragging out the hostage returns, while Palestinian health officials say over 370 Palestinians have been killed in continued Israeli strikes since the ceasefire took effect.\n\nEditor's Note: This article was submitted for review by Israel’s military censor, which made no changes.",

    "fullText": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — What’s the secret to winning a seven-a-side tournament when $2 million dollars is on the line?\n\n“Be brave,” San Diego Wave midfielder Gia Corley said after her club won the second World Sevens Football competition on Sunday evening, beating Tigres 3-0 to cap off an impressive campaign. The Wave went undefeated in their ascent to the podium, scoring a total of 14 goals and conceding three. Corley was awarded Breakout Player of the tournament.\n\nHer advice was as simple as the Wave were flamboyant in the latest iteration of the three-day, seven-vs-seven tournament.\n\nFollowing the inaugural event in Portugal this May that featured all European teams, this World Sevens was an exaltation of its greatest strength: the communion of cultures not only across countries but continents, with an invitation to bring their own style of play into close quarters. The Wave play in the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) in the U.S., but their World Sevens roster featured players who also represent Germany, Sweden, Brazil, France, Canada, Colombia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n“If I wanted to play in the Champions League, I’d have to play for a European team. You’re never going to see a U.S. team or South American team play in that format,” said former England Lioness and WSL player Anita Asante, who serves on the World Sevens advisory board, before the start of the tournament.\n\n“Whereas so many more teams can participate and bring their own cultural elements to this experience as well and open up a whole new fanbase and fun experience because now everyone gets to see what it’s like.”\n\n“From South American teams and their style — and the evolution of the playing styles and trends as well that we don’t always get to see because we sometimes get really centered in one sort of format or one place in the world that we’re experiencing the game from,” she continued. “So just opening up that whole lens as well has been really powerful for the players and us.”\n\nSince its inception last year, when Gotham FC minority owner Jennifer Mackesy and her husband, Scott, made a personal commitment to sourcing $100million over five years, World Sevens has been marketed as a service for the social-media-obsessed. Soccer’s typical 90-minute matches have been chopped down to half an hour, the fields are split in two (the World Sevens pitch is roughly half the size of a traditional, FIFA-regulated field ), and there are rolling substitutions and no offside rule.\n\nThere’s an irony to this approach: the tighter parameters result in an abundance of flashy, shareable clips on TikTok and Instagram, but witnessing the tournament in person turns mindless scrolling into a liability. In fact, try to avoid blinking at all during World Sevens altogether — you could miss what makes it special.\n\nTake, for instance, the game-winning goal that Brazilian club Flamengo scored against the NWSL shield-winning Kansas City Current in the tournament’s opening match. Cristiane, a 40-year-old Brazilian forward with two decades of global success, received a ball off a throw-in with her hip and flicked it with her heel to assist Glaucia, who twerked to celebrate the goal.\n\n“It’s a fast-paced game, but it’s my style of game,” Glaucia told The Athletic after that match. “Using my talents of ball control and getting into the game, playing as a team, and just enjoying ourselves.”\n\nFlamengo’s flair wasn’t only in their attack. They were the only team in the competition to occasionally employ an outfield player as their ’keeper when they were hunting for a goal.\n\nWhen they were down 2-1 against AFC Toronto of the newly formed Northern Super League (NSL) with 45 seconds to go on Saturday, defender Monalisa Belem, playing as ’keeper for Vivi Holzel, dribbled the ball into their attacking half and shot a low, driven ball on frame. Toronto were unable to clear it and conceded an equalizer.\n\n“We did what we could,” Holzel said of Monalisa’s keeper swap, a knowing smile spread across her face. “In Brazil, we train a lot in futsal, so they are used to (it).”\n\nFlamengo won that game on penalties, which are played sudden-death style at World Sevens (as opposed to a best-of-five format). After the final whistle, the Brazilian side celebrated as if the $2 million had already hit their bank accounts, spraying their water bottles and dancing with supporters on the sidelines.\n\n“Today we won. We don’t know the next game, so we are enjoying every step to make this happen because the competition is like that,” Holzel said. “We have to enjoy.”\n\nStaying present and loose appears to be another ingredient to the secret sauce of World Sevens.\n\nThe players with standout performances were those for whom World Sevens looked like a return to simpler times, when mistakes were welcomed as opportunities to discover something new, improvisation was rewarded, and personality on the pitch was seen as an enhancement rather than a hindrance.\n\nFew embodied that more than Tigres winger Maria Sanchez, who won the Golden Boot and Golden Ball award with six goals and two assists.\n\n“I grew up playing with boys playing small-sided (games) for hours, so I think a tournament like this suits me very well and it takes me back to my childhood days,” Sanchez said Saturday.\n\nFor others, the fast pace and fluidity required more adjustment, and the film from the first World Sevens and its all-European lineup could only help so much.\n\n“We used a lot of the video for the structure and a little bit of the tactics, but I think we knew this was gonna be a different style of play,” San Diego Wave assistant coach Becki Tweed said of the team’s preparation. “When you see the South American teams play, they’re really smart in how they use their body, they have really good knowledge of space, and I think those are the things that vary a little bit from the European game.”\n\nThe requirements of the small-sided tournament also enlightened the coaching staff to their own roster. “Which is fun, because you think you know them until you put them in a new challenge,” Tweed added.\n\nThe format also exposed some teams that struggled to loosen up on the pitch. The Current, despite their superlative season in the NWSL, failed to advance from the group stage against Flamengo, Toronto, and Tigres. Star players like league MVP Temwa Chawinga, Michelle Cooper, and Claire Hutton were absent either due to injury or the need for rest, and were replaced by academy players.\n\nThe World Sevens organizers built off the success of their first event earlier this year, but they also had to account for key differences.\n\nIn May, the competition took place in Estoril, Portugal, in the days leading up to the Champions League final just 30 minutes away in Lisbon. Fans needed only to extend their trip by a few days to enjoy both. This time around, not only was World Sevens without the proximity of a major competition to drum up support and publicity, but it wound up competing with Art Basel in Miami and Inter Miami’s MLS Cup final (which they hosted) for attention that weekend. Attendance on Friday was scant but peaked on Saturday when each team played twice.\n\nIn the first edition, the fan zone and field were in two different places, preventing an easy flow of traffic between matches. That issue was resolved at Beyond Bancard Stadium, but the foosball tables, sign-making stations, and World Sevens-branded claw machines were lonely throughout the weekend as many of the kids in attendance were competing in the Rising Sevens youth tournament behind the stadium.\n\nBut for whatever World Sevens Football lost in the marketing department, it recovered in the passion that emanated across Beyond Bancard stadium in Fort Lauderdale from those who did show up. Deportivo Cali supporters saved the weekend. Dozens traveled from across Florida, the U.S., and even Colombia just to support their team. Clad in green and white, they flooded the stadium and filled it with percussion, chants, and songs, often drowning out the music coming out of the speakers from the DJ booth.\n\n“We’re going to make them feel like home, like this is home,” said Jose Luis, 40, who traveled to Fort Lauderdale from Cali, Colombia. “That’s why you see us shouting. I have no voice anymore. That’s our purpose. It’s 35 minutes.”\n\nCali narrowly missed a place in the knockout stage with a 1-0 loss to Club America, but midfielder Kelly Ibarguen told The Athletic on Saturday following their victory over Uruguayan side Nacional that they felt the energy of their supporters on the pitch.\n\n“We always approach things with great joy and happiness, and having the fans behind us is truly a source of pride for us. They’ve supported us in Argentina in every tournament we’ve played in,” she said.\n\nThe prize money sweetened the experience, and this time all teams brought something home.\n\nThe Wave claimed $2 million, Tigres earned $1 as finalists, and Club America were awarded $700,000 as the third place team. Flamengo, who came in fourth, got $500,000, and the remaining four teams were given $200,000 each.\n\nMoney is always nice, and earning large sums for two or three days of work is a rare opportunity in the women’s game. But U.S. women’s national team legend and player advisory board member Tobin Heath is looking even further at what World Sevens is building.\n\n“Life is about mirroring,” Heath said. “That, to me, is how women’s football has been developed. It’s been developed around every single men’s competition, then the women’s competition follows. And what has happened because of that is our culture, women’s football culture, has been completely eliminated when it comes to actually showcasing our uniqueness in the market of sports. Because we just act like the version of football that we’re playing in, this is the first time that there’s nothing for us to mirror against.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nKansas City Current, San Diego Wave, NWSL, Women's Soccer\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Accounts held by users under 16 must be removed on apps that include TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and Threads under ban\n\nHow is Australia’s social media ban affecting you and your family?\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nAustralia has enacted a world-first ban on social media for users aged under 16, causing millions of children and teenagers to lose access to their accounts.\n\nFacebook, Instagram, Threads, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and TikTok are expected to have taken steps from Wednesday to remove accounts held by users under 16 years of age in Australia, and prevent those teens from registering new accounts.\n\nPlatforms that do not comply risk fines of up to $49.5m.\n\nThere have been some teething problems with the ban’s implementation. Guardian Australia has received several reports of those under 16 passing the facial age assurance tests, but the government has flagged it is not expecting the ban will be perfect from day one.\n\nAll listed platforms apart from X had confirmed by Tuesday they would comply with the ban. The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said it had recently had a conversation with X about how it would comply, but the company had not communicated its policy to users.\n\nBluesky, an X alternative, announced on Tuesday it would also ban under-16s, despite eSafety assessing the platform as “low risk” due to its small user base of 50,000 in Australia.\n\nChildren had spent the past few weeks undertaking age assurance checks, swapping phone numbers and preparing for their accounts to be deactivated.\n\nThe Australian chief executive and co-founder of the age assurance service k-ID, Kieran Donovan, said his service had conducted hundreds of thousands of age checks in the past few weeks. The k-ID service was being used by Snapchat among others.\n\nParents of children affected by the ban shared a spectrum of views on the policy. One parent told the Guardian their 15-year-old daughter was “very distressed” because “all her 14 to 15-year-old friends have been age verified as 18 by Snapchat”. Since she had been identified as under 16, they feared “her friends will keep using Snapchat to talk and organise social events and she will be left out”.\n\nAnother parent said the ban had forced him to teach his child how to break the law. “I’ve shown her how VPNs work and other methods on bypassing age restrictions,” he said. “I’ve had to set her up with her own adult YouTube account and have assisted her in bypassing TikTok’s age-estimation and will keep doing so each time it asks.”\n\nOthers said the ban “can’t come quickly enough”. One parent said their daughter was “completely addicted” to social media and the ban “provides us with a support framework to keep her off these platforms”.\n\nThe Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in an opinion piece on Sunday: “From the beginning, we’ve acknowledged this process won’t be 100% perfect. But the message this law sends will be 100% clear … Australia sets the legal drinking age at 18 because our society recognises the ­benefits to the individual and the community of such an ­approach.\n\n“The fact that teenagers occasionally find a way to have a drink doesn’t diminish the value of having a clear, ­national standard.”\n\nPolling has consistently shown that two-thirds of voters support raising the minimum age for social media to 16. The opposition, including leader Sussan Ley, have recently voiced alarm about the ban, despite waving the legislation through parliament and the former Liberal leader Peter Dutton championing it.\n\nThe ban has garnered worldwide attention, with several nations indicating they will adopt a ban of their own, including Malaysia, Denmark and Norway. The European Union passed a resolution to adopt similar restrictions, while a spokesperson for the British government told Reuters it was “closely monitoring Australia’s approach to age restrictions”.\n\nInman Grant told the Guardian that from Thursday, she would be sending notices to the platforms covered by the ban to find out how the implementation was progressing.\n\nQuestions included “how many accounts [they’ve] deactivated or removed, what challenges they’re finding, how they’re preventing recidivism and preventing circumvention, whether or not their abuse or reporting abuse and the appeals processes are working as planned”, she said.\n\nAlbanese said the information gathered in this process would be made public.\n\nThe regulator would need to assess whether platforms were taking reasonable steps. If they were not, it could take that platform to court to seek fines.\n\nThere would be an independent evaluation of the ban conducted by an academic advisory group examining the short-term, medium-term and longer-term impacts of the ban.\n\n“It will look at the benefits over time, but also the unintended consequences,” Inman Grant said.\n\n“Everything from are sleeping? Are they interacting or are they actually getting out on the sports fields? Are they reading books? Are they taking less medication like antidepressants? Are their Naplan scores improving over time?” Inman Grant said.\n\nPotential unintended consequences to be investigated included whether children were moving on to “darker areas of the internet”, learning how to bypass the bans through VPNs, or moving on to other platforms, she said.\n\nTeens on Snapchat affected by the ban had been publicly sharing their mobile numbers in their profiles ahead of their accounts being shut down.\n\nA spokesperson for Snapchat said the platform understood under-16s were disappointed by the ban but “would strongly encourage any teens using Snapchat not to publicly share their personal contact information”.\n\nInman Grant said she had sent notices to 15 companies not initially included in the ban, asking them to self-assess whether they should be.\n\nYope and Lemon8, which shot up the app store rankings as teens looked for alternatives, were among those contacted.",

    "description": "The firm has been a longtime backer of big-name private companies such as OpenAI and TikTok parent ByteDance.",
    "fullText": "Tiger Global's latest private investment fund will raise substantially less money than its predecessors from 2021 and 2022, but the $50 billion asset manager isn't worried.\n\nThe firm is expected to raise close to $2 billion for PIP 17, a person familiar with the manager told Business Insider.\n\nThat's a fraction of what PIP 14 and PIP 15 raised and aligns more closely to PIP 16, which closed in early 2024 with $2.2 billion in assets after aiming initially for $6 billion.\n\nWhile smaller fundraises typically coincide with a decline in investor interest, Tiger Global is confident that the size of the new fund will be a benefit for those who do decide to invest.\n\n\"Over our history, we have also found that smaller, more concentrated funds have been correlated with our strongest returns,\" the firm wrote in a letter to prospective investors that was seen by Business Insider.\n\nTiger Global declined to comment.\n\nThe first 10 private funds, the letter states, all raised less than $3 billion each, made fewer than 50 investments on average, and \"generated a 34% gross IRR and a 23% net IRR and made distributions exceeding investor commitments.\n\n\"We believe funds in this size range afford us significant benefits, particularly with respect to the impact midsize investments can make,\" the letter reads.\n\nIn other words, Tiger Global's aggressive venture style from 2020 through 2022, when the firm led fundraising rounds seemingly every week and raised increasingly larger funds, has been replaced with one that is closer to what the firm built its business on. The manager previously wrote to investors earlier this year about how it reworked its risk systems following a 56% loss in its public-equity flagship hedge fund and compared the firm's bounce-back from that loss to golfer Rory McIlroy's Masters win.\n\nThe most recent private fund, PIP 16, has already reaped some of the benefits of the style focused on \"high-conviction\" bets. The fund has invested 70% of its assets across 25 companies, the letter states, with the 10 largest investments accounting for three-quarters of that total.\n\nAmong those big bets are some of the world's prominent artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI and Waymo.\n\n\"We have remained incredibly disciplined and selective\" when investing PIP 16, the firm wrote, and plan to continue that with PIP 17, which will hold its first close on March 18 next year. The new fund is the latest example of Tiger Global and its peers' renewed interest in private markets.\n\n\"This approach is opportunistic, guided by bottom-up, company-level underwriting, and informed by our deep research and cumulative insights,\" the letter states.\n\n\"To accomplish this, PIP 17 may have a pace of deployment spanning several years. With time on our side and an accelerated pace of innovation, we intend to remain patient — waiting for attractive opportunities to make high-conviction investments.\"",

And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,\" Jena said.\n\nAt the same time, children watching adult content online \"has a very bad effect\".\n\nAt a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia's move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have \"great benefits\" in India too.\n\nIn the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.\n\n\"Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,\" she said of the ban.\n\nAnother teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: \"I'm 15 so for me the ban would definitely come into effect. I can't really imagine giving it up completely.\n\n\"A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.\"\n\nAn AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.\n\nRazak is not in favour of a ban. \"It's really stupid, honestly,\" although \"there's not really much we can do as 16-year-olds\" if governments decide to act, she said.\n\nThe families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so \"it's going to be so much harder to talk to them\".\n\nAlso in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia's were \"a bit harsh\" and hard to enforce.\n\n\"We can use VPN. We can easily bypass the security and easily make new accounts,\" he said.\n\n- Lagos: 'We were born with it' -\n\nAt a Nigerian high school, Mitchelle Okinedo is revising for exams, checking over her hand-written notes. In the classroom -- where phones are banned -- students in uniform sit at separate desks.\n\n\"I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,\" Okinedo said.\n\nEven so, \"we were born with it\", the 15-year-old added. \"And I don't think it's something I want to stop.\"\n\nHer mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents \"don't have time to monitor their children all day\".\n\n- Mexico City: 'Express yourself' -\n\nYoung Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.\n\nWithout it, \"I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn't really have a good way to spend my time,\" she said.\n\nSantiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.\n\n\"Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,\" said Rojas.\n\nBut \"there are many kidnappings that begin online\" and \"younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable\".\n\n- Sydney: 'Not going to have any impact' -\n\nIn Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go.\n\n\"I don't think the government really knows what they're doing and I don't think it's going to have any impact on children of Australia,\" said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.\n\nBut his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children \"have better, more authentic relationships\".\n\n\"They'll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Six contenders have been shortlisted for the award, which will be presented during the live show on BBC One on Thursday, 18 December.\n\nThe 2024 World Sport Star award was won by Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis.\n\nBelow you can vote for your favourite - and find out more about the contenders.\n\nSpain midfielder Caldentey enjoyed a stellar first season in English football, with her performances instrumental in Arsenal's march to Champions League glory, beating her former club Barcelona in the final.\n\nAfter scoring 19 goals in 41 appearances for the Gunners in her first season, Caldentey was named the Professional Footballers' Association women's player of the year and the Women's Super League player of the year.\n\nCaldentey scored in the Women's Euro 2025 final, which Spain narrowly lost to England on penalties.\n\nThe 29-year-old was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or award, missing out to compatriot Aitana Bonmati, and was also included in Uefa's Champions League team of the year.\n\nThe making of Spain and Arsenal's humble magician\n\nArsenal's Caldentey wins WSL player of year award\n\nSport: Boxing Country: United States\n\nCrawford cemented his status as one of the greatest boxers in history by becoming the first male fighter to be undisputed champion across three weight divisions in the four-belt era.\n\nThe 38-year-old had to go up two weight classes to face the great Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez at super-middleweight, but secured a unanimous decision in front of a fiercely pro-Mexican crowd in Las Vegas.\n\nIn claiming the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO and The Ring belts, the American extended his professional record to 42 straight victories - the past 20 of which have been world title fights.\n\nHowever, Crawford was stripped of the WBC belt earlier in December, with president Mauricio Sulaiman claiming the American did not pay sanctioning fees.\n\n'Crawford conquers Canelo to become the face of boxing'\n\nHistory-maker Crawford stuns Canelo in Vegas\n\nSport: Athletics Country: Sweden\n\nIn 2025, Sweden's Duplantis once again soared above his rivals to capture a third pole vault World Championship gold.\n\nIn doing so, he set yet another world record of 6.30m - his fourth of this year alone - and the 14th of his remarkable career.\n\nHe also retained his indoor world title - meaning he has won eight successive golds in major global competitions - and won all 16 of his events to become the first male pole vaulter in modern history to go undefeated for two successive years.\n\nIn November, the 26-year-old was named men's world athlete of the year for a third time.\n\nDuplantis gets 14th world record & third world title\n\nThe making of Mondo: How Duplantis is reaching new heights\n\nSport: Athletics Country: United States\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone, the greatest female 400m hurdler of all time, made the switch to the 400m flat at the World Athletics Championships this year, but the result remained the same as she became the first athlete to claim career world titles in both disciplines.\n\nHer time of 47.78 seconds was the second fastest in history and she came close to breaking a world record that has stood since 1985.\n\nThe 26-year-old is undefeated across both distances for two years.\n\nShe added another gold in the 4x400m relay in Tokyo and was named the women's world athlete of the year.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone wins 400m gold with second fastest time in history\n\nDuplantis & McLaughlin-Levrone named world athletes of year\n\nOn the LA Dodgers' march towards retaining their World Series title, Japanese superstar Ohtani produced one of the greatest individual performances in Major League Baseball history.\n\nThe rare 'two-way' player, who operates as both a pitcher and a hitter, smashed three home runs and struck out 10 batters against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThat made him the first pitcher since 1942 to hit three home runs in the same game.\n\nThe 31-year-old was named as one of baseball's Most Valuable Players for the third straight year, and the fourth time overall, moving him into second on the all-time list.\n\nOhtani wins fourth Major League MVP award\n\nOhtani rewrites history to send Dodgers to World Series\n\nSalah, the 'Egyptian King', scored 29 Premier League goals and broke a host of records as he helped Liverpool to a record-equalling 20th top-flight title in the 2024-25 season.\n\nHe became the first player to win the Golden Boot, the Playmaker award for most assists and the Premier League player of the season award in the same campaign. He was also named as the PFA men's player of the year for a record third time and collected a third Football Writers' footballer of the year award.\n\nThe 33-year-old became the highest-scoring overseas player in Premier League history, overtaking Sergio Aguero's mark of 184.\n\nSalah has scored five goals in 18 appearances for Liverpool so far this season, and on Saturday said he felt like he had been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club and that his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down.\n\n'The hunger makes me want more' - Salah wins third PFA award",

    "fullText": "BENGALURU, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Amnesty International has said India's review of a telecom industry proposal to mandate always-on satellite ​location tracking on phones for better lawful surveillance was \"deeply concerning\" and puts data ‌of human rights defenders at risk.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long pushed telecoms companies to give ‌more precise locations of individuals under investigation.\n\nThe telecoms operators say the best way to achieve this would be for the government to order smartphone manufacturers to permanently enable location tracking on phones. Reuters reported on Friday that the government is reviewing that proposal.\n\nThe discussions are ⁠being privately opposed by big ‌smartphone firms Apple, Google and Samsung, due to privacy and security concerns.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Amnesty International said location data can ‍be \"incredibly revealing\" and can expose personal and professional connections, such as the confidential sources who meet journalists or human rights groups.\n\n\"This is deeply concerning. At a time where surveillance scandals are a ​mushrooming global threat, states should be working on improving their practices and safeguards, not ‌forcing people to reveal yet more sensitive data,\" Amnesty said.\n\nIndia's IT and home ministries, which are reviewing the plan, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday about the backlash.\n\nAmnesty has in the past denounced India's surveillance practices including alleged use of Pegasus spyware to target journalists and activists -- allegations Modi's government has repeatedly denied.\n\nA fierce ⁠privacy debate erupted in India last week after ​Reuters first reported another confidential directive from the ​government to preload a state-run cyber safety app on all smartphones. India was forced to revoke the order following outcry from activists and politicians ‍over fears of snooping.\n\n\"Why ⁠are we out to convert India into a 'Surveillance State'?\" Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said on X, criticising the proposal to track phone locations.\n\nA large ⁠number of Indian users on X joined Surjewala and other privacy activists to condemn the plan, with ‌one user framing it as turning phones into \"digital ankle monitors\".",

Symptoms typically appear three to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, and most people recover within a week.\n\nCdc Reports 19Th Cruise Ship Norovirus Outbreak This Year, Affecting Passengers And Crew\n\nIn severe cases, some may experience severe joint pain lasting months or even years while others \"may require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage and death,\" according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAccording to an Oct. 3 notice from WHO, there have been 445,000 suspected and confirmed cases of chikungunya and 155 deaths worldwide between January and September 2025.\n\nIn Bangladesh, WHO reported 700 suspected chikungunya cases in the capital, Dhaka, between January and September 2025, citing the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research.\n\nCdc Warns Of 'Enhanced' Virus Risk For Travelers Amid Outbreak Spread By Mosquitoes\n\nAs of late September, a total of 16,000 locally transmitted chikungunya cases have been confirmed in Guangdong Province, China, marking the largest documented outbreak of the disease in the country to date.\n\nBetween January and late September, 34 confirmed cases of chikungunya were reported in Cuba, and public health interventions have been implemented to contain the outbreak.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, a total of 150 confirmed chikungunya cases were reported between Jan. 1 and the second week of March 2025, WHO said, adding that cases reportedly peaked in June.\n\nThe CDC warned that Americans traveling to Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand may also face an increased risk of chikungunya infection, even if no outbreak is currently reported.\n\nThe U.S. has not seen any locally acquired chikungunya cases in its states or territories since 2019.\n\nOriginal article",

Only employees nominated by their superiors for “exemplary service” were awarded the $10,000 bonus.\n\nThe TSA employs over 50,000 transportation security officers out of its approximate 65,000 total employees.\n\nThe DHS did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

From July, Combs will embark on a tour of Europe and the UK. The My Kinda Saturday Night tour is scheduled to wrap up on August 2 in London.\n\n*Indicates an event that Luke Combs will be performing at in addition to other artists.\n\nOriginal tickets for the My Kinda Saturday Night tour went on presale on October 15, followed by general sale on October 17, with tickets available for purchase on Ticketmaster. As of writing, all dates still have limited availability for original tickets, and can still be purchased on Ticketmaster.\n\nTickets are also available for purchase from verified resale vendor sites such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. Many popular tour stops, such as Las Vegas, have limited remaining seating options; in such cases, you may find more ideal options on resale sites instead.\n\nWith shows still having yet to sell out, ticket prices between the original and resale options are somewhat similar, with resale options leaning slightly more affordable for certain dates. Original standard ticket prices vary depending on the venue and location, but currently tend to fall within the average range of $100 to just over $300. Many locations even offer pit options under $300 (Knoxville and South Bend, for example), which is very reasonable compared to other artists whose pit tickets can easily exceed $1,000.\n\nAs of writing, for the resale option, Vivid Seats has prices ever so slightly below those of StubHub, with the most affordable options ranging from $71 for the May 2 tour stop in Knoxville to $176 for the May 30 tour stop in Montreal. StubHub ranges from $79 for the same Knoxville show to $244 for the Green Bay performance on May 16. The biggest difference right now is that Vivid Seats has fewer international location options, which is somewhat common for the site in general.\n\nLuke Combs has a guest appearance at Alan Jackson’s event in Nashville on June 27, and prices for this are considerably higher than his own headlining tour’s stops. This is due to the event being large, with several artists performing.\n\nThere are no VIP packages for The My Kind Of Saturday Night tour available for purchase on Ticketmaster.\n\nSeveral artists have been confirmed to join Luke Combs on his upcoming 2026 world tour. For North American shows, Dierks Bentley, Ty Myers, The Castellows, and Thelma & James have been tapped as supporting artists. Europe will continue to see Ty Myers and the Castellows perform, with The Script also joining them for shows in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Ireland. The Teskey Brothers have been announced as an opening act for the Edinburgh show, and Thomas Rhett will also be supporting the London concert.\n\nThe My Kinda Saturday Night tour has 10 international dates currently scheduled. The tour will head to Sweden in July, followed by shows in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland, and will conclude in the UK with five performances in Edinburgh and London.\n\nLuke Combs is an American country singer from North Carolina who first emerged on the scene in 2014 with his debut EP, “The Way She Rides”. He has since gone on to win several Billboard Music and Country Music awards, and also has his own polarized sunglasses and hat company called Blue Otter Polarized. Luke Combs married Nicole Hocking in 2020.",

It’s easy to dismiss it as stress from an employee under pressure or mistake it for burnout. But it’s neither. Overwhelm is an exhausting—and often invisible—tipping point when the stressors you face begin to exceed your perceived ability to cope with them. Overwhelm can surge suddenly and unpredictably.",

I think I got lost after the first 20 minutes and I think I came back to it about five hours later,\" the former Liverpool and Manchester City forward joked.\n\n\"I always have that on my mind. Just get there first. We've got to get there first but, if that is the case, then we [Marsch and Bellamy] will definitely have a nice conversation before that as well.\n\n\"I've got nothing against that guy, by the way, I think he's got something against the world.

    "description": "Lando Norris has joined an illustrious sporting club, and is only just getting going at the very peak of F1, writes Andrew Benson.",
    "fullText": "With his first Formula 1 world championship, Lando Norris joins an illustrious sporting club.\n\nOnly 35 drivers in the 75-year history of the sport have won the F1 title, and 11 of them - by far the largest number from a single country - are, like Norris, from the UK.\n\nAll of them are different, wrote larger or smaller chapters in the history of the sport. From Lewis Hamilton, the most successful driver of all time, with seven titles and 105 wins, to the one-time winners such as Mike Hawthorn, John Surtees, James Hunt and Damon Hill - who, like Jenson Button, was in Abu Dhabi to watch Norris secure his crown.\n\nOn Sunday night in Yas Marina, the game everyone who watches and enjoys sport likes to play had already started. Where does this achievement stand in the annals? How good is Norris?\n\nIn truth, this starts as a soon as a sportsperson arrives on the scene, especially when it's apparent they are heading for the top. And it has always been clear that Norris was. His level of talent and pace have always marked him out as a future world champion.\n\nFrom there, in F1, as in all elite sport, it's about fine margins, not just how fast a driver is, but how consistently they can achieve their best level, how few mistakes they make on the way.\n\nAnd Norris, although already seven seasons into his F1 career, is only just getting going at the very peak of the sport.\n\nHe has had an absolutely competitive car only for a season and a half, a very good one only for a year more than that. And at 26, he has many more years of running at the front to come. His story, the assessment of his standing, is in its early stages.\n\nThis year, Norris has gone toe to toe with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, acknowledged widely as the finest driver of his generation, the one who most consistently takes his equipment to the very edge of the possible.\n\nNorris has won that battle, by two points over the Dutchman, and 13 over his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, after a season that has ebbed and flowed between the three of them.\n\nAnd Norris knows what's coming now.\n\n\"I hate ever having to try and compare myself to other people,\" he said on Sunday night. \"This is all for you guys to decide, whether someone's better than someone else or not.\n\n\"All I try and do every weekend is the best of what I can. But then you decide 'he's better than him, or he's got a worse car and he's doing better'. Write what you like, decide what you like.\n\n\"I certainly feel like at moments I've driven better than I feel like other people can. And I feel like I drove at a level I don't think other people can match.\n\n\"But have I also made my mistakes? Have I made more mistakes than other people at times? Yes. Is there stuff Max could do better at times than me? Yes. Do I believe he's unbeatable? No.\n\n\"But you also don't know, do you? It's hard to know.\n\n\"Like, they also struggled with the car in the mid part of the season. They've had an incredible second half of the season.\n\n\"They took advantage of the fact we had two of us fighting for a world championship. He really made the most of that, and Max drove like he is a four-time world champion. And I'm very happy that I got to race against him and try to prove myself against him.\"",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Campaign urges PM to show independence from US and push to rein in development of superintelligence\n\nMore than 100 UK parliamentarians are calling on the government to introduce binding regulations on the most powerful AI systems as concern grows that ministers are moving too slowly to create safeguards in the face of lobbying from the technology industry.\n\nA former AI minister and defence secretary are part of a cross-party group of Westminster MPs, peers and elected members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures demanding stricter controls on frontier systems, citing fears superintelligent AI “would compromise national and global security”.\n\nThe push for tougher regulation is being coordinated by a nonprofit organisation called Control AI whose backers include the co-founder of Skype, Jaan Tallinn. It is calling on Keir Starmer to show independence from Donald Trump’s White House, which opposes the regulation of AI. One of the “godfathers” of the technology, Yoshua Bengio, recently said it was less regulated than a sandwich.\n\nThe campaigners include the Labour peer and former defence secretary Des Browne, who said superintelligent AI “would be the most perilous technological development since we gained the ability to wage nuclear war”. He said only international cooperation “can prevent a reckless race for advantage that could imperil us all”.\n\nThe Conservative peer and former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said that “even while very significant and senior figures in AI are blowing the whistle, governments are miles behind the AI companies and are leaving them to pursue its development with virtually no regulation”.\n\nBritain hosted an AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023, which concluded there was “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional” from the most advanced AI systems. It set up the AI Safety Institute, now called the AI Security Institute, which has become an internationally respected body. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on the summit’s call to address risks through international cooperation.\n\nGoldsmith said the UK should “resume its global leadership on AI security by championing an international agreement to prohibit the development of superintelligence until we know what we are dealing with and how to contain it”.\n\nThe calls for state intervention in the AI race come after one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI scientists told the Guardian humanity would have to decide by 2030 whether to take the “ultimate risk” of letting AI systems train themselves to become more powerful. Jared Kaplan, the co-founder and chief scientist at frontier AI company Anthropic, said: “We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like: Oh, wow, AI is a big deal.”\n\nLabour’s programme set out in July 2024 said it would legislate “to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models”. But no bill has been published and the government has faced White House pressure not to inhibit commercial AI development, mostly pioneered by US firms.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI is already regulated in the UK, with a range of existing rules already in place. We have been clear on the need to ensure the UK and its laws are ready for the challenges and opportunities AI will bring and that position has not changed.”\n\nThe bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who is backing the Control AI campaign, called for an independent AI watchdog to scrutinise public sector use and for AI companies to be required to meet minimum testing standards before releasing new models.\n\n“There are all kinds of risks and the government doesn’t seem to have adopted a precautionary principle,” he said. “At the moment there are significant risks: the mental health of children and adults, the environmental costs and other big risks in terms of the alignment of generalised AI and [the question of] what is good for humanity. The government seems to be moving away from regulation.”\n\nThe UK’s first AI minister under Rishi Sunak, Jonathan Berry, said the time was coming when binding regulations should be applied to models that present existential risks. He said rules should be global and would create tripwires so if AI models reached a certain power their makers would have to show they had been tested, designed with off switches and were capable of being retrained.\n\n“International frontier AI safety has not gone on in leaps and bounds as we had hoped,” he said. He cited recent cases of chatbots being involved in encouraging suicides, people using them as therapists and believing they are gods. “The risks, now, are very serious and we need to be constantly on our guard,” he said.\n\nThe chief executive of Control AI, Andrea Miotti, criticised the current “timid approach” and said: “There has been a lot of lobbying from the UK and US. AI companies are lobbying governments in the UK and US to stall regulation arguing it is premature and would crush innovation. Some of these are the same companies who say AIs could destroy humanity.”\n\nHe said the speed with which AI technology was advancing meant mandatory standards could be needed in the next one or two years.",
