    "fullText": "Former Milan and Juventus defender Mattia De Sciglio said he snubbed a move to Liverpool to move to Turin in 2017, but he felt ‘used’ by Vincenzo Montella at San Siro.\n\nFormer Italy international De Sciglio spoke about his career in an interview with Corriere della Sera.\n\nA product of the Milan academy, De Sciglio has also played for Juventus and Empoli in Serie A and Lyon in the French Ligue 1.\n\nThe 33-year-old has collected 208 appearances in Serie A and 28 in the Champions League.\n\n“I could have played for Inter as a kid,” De Sciglio said via Calciomercato.com.\n\n“They had called me for a trial, but I was dropped because I was too short. Milan arrived shortly afterwards, and I went through the youth sector until my Champions League debut at 18.”\n\nDe Sciglio was a Milan first-team player in one of the darkest moments in recent history, but feels the way he was treated at San Siro was unfair.\n\n“Some of the fans and the media identified me as the guilty one in that situation, and they were all waiting for a minimum error to criticise me,” he said.\n\n“My social media accounts were filled with insults and nasty comments, but I had always behaved well, so I didn’t understand.”\n\nDuring a Milan home game against Empoli in April 2017, he realised he had to leave the Rossoneri.\n\nDORTMUND, GERMANY – JUNE 18: Vincenzo Montella, Head Coach of Turkiye, gestures during the UEFA EURO 2024 group stage match between Turkiye and Georgia at Football Stadium Dortmund on June 18, 2024 in Dortmund, Germany.

It seemed just a way to use me to hide a difficult moment for the whole team,” De Sciglio said.\n\n“As I was leaving, a boos erupted all around me. That day, I realised I could no longer go on like that; my story with Milan was over.”\n\nTURIN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 02: Kenan Yildiz of Juventus battles for possession with Mattia De Sciglio of Empoli during the Serie A match between Juventus and Empoli at Allianz Stadium on February 02, 2025 in Turin, Italy.

    "fullText": "Aerospace business and artificial intelligence firm to unite for IPO as world’s most valuable private company\n\nElon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence business xAI, in a $1.25tn (£910bn) merger that consolidates part of Musk’s empire as SpaceX prepares to go public later this year.\n\nThe two companies announced the deal on Monday in a statement on SpaceX’s website, saying the merger would form “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform”.\n\nSpaceX, one of the world’s most valuable private companies, will gain xAI properties such as its Grok chatbot and the social media platform X. The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to put datacenters and solar-powered satellites in space as a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.\n\nThe deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float is expected to be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.\n\nMusk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.\n\nThe announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.\n\n“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.\n\n“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”\n\nMusk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platform X in an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.\n\nBoth SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed an expected value of $800bn for the company.\n\nDespite widespread backlash to xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.\n\nSpeculation and leaks about the deal, first reported by Reuters, have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.\n\nThe news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week that showed declining revenues and a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showed Musk exchanging numerous friendly emails with the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.\n\nHe called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.",

    "title": "4 Lexus Models With The Best Odds Of Hitting 250,000 Miles, According To iSeeCars",
    "description": "Lexus constantly ranks among the world's most reliable auto brands, and these Lexus cars and SUVs are among the most likely to last you a long time.",
    "fullText": "Toyota's luxury brand Lexus routinely ranks among the world's most reliable auto brands; plenty of owners say their Lexus vehicles have lasted beyond 100,000 miles. According to iSeeCars, some of those Lexus owners might still have plenty of life left in their cars and SUVs. The outlet looked at year-to-year odometer readings from hundreds of thousands of vehicles to predict how likely each model was to stay running past the 250,000 mile mark. Four of the top 25 vehicles most likely to reach a quarter of a million miles wear Lexus badges; The only automakers with more models on the list are parent company Toyota with 10 and Honda with five.\n\niSeeCars previously named the Toyota Tundra as the longest-lasting light-duty pickup truck, and it came in fourth among all vehicles in the latest study while the Tacoma placed sixth overall. Lexus doesn't make pickup trucks, but it placed at least one model among the top five SUVs and passenger cars most likely to hit 250,000 miles. Lexus offers certain models with the buyer's choice of a conventional or hybrid powertrain, and iSeeCars ranks those variants separately. In those cases we ordered our list according to the more favorable performer of the pair with additional notation of where the other version fell in the rankings.\n\nSlashgear's hands-on review of the 2021 Lexus IS300 found the compact sedan in its all-wheel drive(AWD) form to be \"unexpectedly punchy,\" and the 2025 IS came in fifth among all vehicles in the iSeeCars study and first among all passenger car models with a 27.5% chance of making it to 250K miles. This makes it more than 10 times as likely to last that long as the average vehicle and more than twice as likely as the Toyota Prius, which was 15th overall and third among passenger cars. The IS was outpaced in the iSeeCars 250,000-mile study only by four Toyota models: the Tundra pickup and the Sequoia, Highlander Hybrid and 4Runner SUVs.\n\nThe IS300 is gone for the current model year, replaced by the IS350 F Sport and F Sport Design. All variants share a 3.5-liter V6 that produces 311 horsepower and come with an automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive variants have eight gears, and all-wheel drive IS350s have six speeds.\n\nCar and Driver clocked the rear-drive version at 5.6 seconds from 0-60 and the AWD variant at 5.5 ticks, and 0-100 mpg and quarter-mile times were identical for both at 14.2 seconds. The IS350 took 326 feet to come to a stop from 100 mph and pulled .89g on a 300-foot wide skidpad.\n\nEnty point for the model is the IS 350 F Sport Design RWD version which starts at $46,795 with destination fees and before tax, title, and options. Opting for all-wheel drive adds another $2,000 to that cost, and the range-topping IS350 F Sport with the special appearance package starts at $61,385 with destination charges.\n\nWe found that the 2023 Lexus GX is a serious SUV with big capability, and iSeeCars ranked it as the eighth most likely vehicle overall to make it to 250,000 miles. It registered an 18.3% likelihood of reaching that mark, which placed it fourth among all SUVs behind its three Toyota cousins. A total of 21 SUVs were more likely than the average vehicle to last past 250K miles, and nine of those are Toyota or Lexus products.\n\nThe five variants of the 2026 Lexus GX550 are all powered by a 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6 that puts 349 horsepower to all four wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. All but the off-road focused Overtrail version seat up to seven passengers in three rows; the Overtrail seats five in a traditional 2+3 configuration. It's also the most capable variant for towing with a maximum capacity of 9,096 pounds, and the electronic locking rear differential keeps it sure-footed in slippery conditions. Starting price for the 2026 Lexus GX sits at $66,935 with destination charges for the entry-level Premium trim and goes up to $83,400 for the well-appointed Luxury+ variant. Opting for that version gets you a Mark Levinson surround sound system with 21 speakers and 1,800 watts of power, a panoramic glass roof, and motorized fold-away running boards.\n\nThe Lexus RX model designation stands for 'Radiant Crossover,' and the hybrid version of the mid-sized SUV came in at ninth overall in the iSeeCars study and fifth among SUVs with a 17% chance of lasting 250,000 miles. The RX with a conventional drivetrain had a 10.7% chance of lasting that long, which placed it 19th among all vehicles and at No. 9 among SUVs. Among hybrid vehicles it trailed only its Toyota Highlander Hybrid cousin, and the Lexus RX Hybrid finished ahead of other Toyota hybrids like the Prius, Camry, and RAV4.\n\nThere are actually three Lexus RX hybrids to choose from. The RX350h has a 2.4-liter inline-four plus three electric motors that combine for 246 horsepower, the RX450h plug-in hybrid has 304 horses and an all-electric range of up to 38 miles, and the turbocharged RX500h has a bigger battery that helps enable output of 366 net combined horsepower. The non-hybrid RX350 has the turbocharged 2.4-liter engine set up for 275 horsepower but is only 2.2 times as likely as the average vehicle to last more than 250,000 miles.\n\nPricing for the hybrid versions starts with the 2026 RX 350h AWD at $52,025 plus $1,450 delivery, totaling $53,475. The RX non-hybrid starts at $49,725 plus options, tax, title, and that same $1,450 destination charge for a total of $51,175. Adding all-wheel drive to the gas-powered RX 350 costs just an extra $1,000, but the top-trim RX500h Sport Performance variant starts at $66,850 with destination charges.\n\nThe 2025 Lexus ES hybrid didn't make ISeeCars overall top 25 list of vehicles likely to last 250,000 miles, but it came in 10th among all passenger cars tested with a 7.5% chance of going that far. A 2026 redesign of the ES made it six inches longer for more interior space, and a bigger infotainment screen and updated climate control knobs make that space more useful. Our review of the 2024 Lexus ES found it capable and comfortable, and the non-hybrid 2025 Lexus ES ranked as the 12th-most likely passenger car to hit 250,000 miles in ISeeCars' study.\n\nThe 2026 Lexus ES was introduced as an all-electric model so you'll have to check dealerships for leftover 2025 examples if you want the mild hybrid version. We found a black 2025 ES300h in greater Los Angeles for $44,835 with the $1,250 destination charge included but before tax, title, and license fees.\n\nIt's loaded with features like paddle shifters for the eight-speed automatic gearbox, all-wheel drive with Lexus' Dynamic Torque Control system, and Lexus Safety System+ version 2.5. That includes collision avoidance with automatic braking, active cruise control, lane keeping and departure warning, and road sign recognition systems.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

    "fullText": "Philip Morris International, an international tobacco company, has recently been in the news for its “smoke-free” alternatives and regulatory battles it faces with the ZYN pouches.\n\nAmidst this, it filed a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) letter with the Virginia Employment Commission on January 28 regarding the closure of its Richmond, VA office. The move will result in 135 permanent job cuts; all the workers are without union representation.\n\nThe tobacco maker noted that a majority of impacted workers will be offered alternative positions in other states. The first job losses will occur on April 17, 2026.\n\nThe Richmond closure comes as Philip Morris continues to reshape its US footprint with its “smoke-free” nicotine products, especially ZYN, which it acquired as part of its $16 billion acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022.\n\nInvestors continue to reward the shift; Philip Morris International's (PM) stock has risen 37% over the year and increased 24% this past quarter following its solid Q3 earnings report.\n\nThe report highlighted its “smoke-free” products as a big driver of revenue growth.\n\nThe company will release fourth-quarter financial results on Feb. 6. Analysts expect revenue of $10.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.67.\n\nNet revenue of $10.8 billion, $4.4 billion from the smoke-free business and $6.4 billion from combustibles\n\nDiluted EPS of $2.23, up 13.2% and adjusted diluted EPS reported at $2.24, which rose 17.3% year over year.\n\nGross profit of $7.4 billion, translating to 8.7% organic growth.\n\nOperating income of $4.3 billion was a 7.5% organic growth.\n\nQuarterly dividend increased 8.9% to $1.47 per share.\n\nSmoke-free accounted for 41% of total net revenues.\n\nWhen introducing its smoke-free restructuring, PMI shifted its headquarters from New York to Stamford, CT. Now, effective Jan 1, 2026, it has introduced two new units to expand its smoke-free future – PMI International and PMI US.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nThe first-quarter 2026 financial reports will be based on these new segments, while the tobacco giant's upcoming Q4 report will disclose certain historical financial information for the 2023 to 2025 period based on these new segments.\n\nIts smoke-free products are now available in over 100 markets and have been growing steadily amid a decline in cigarette consumption, serving as a revenue booster for the owner of Marlboro, one of the most consumed cigarette brands.",

    "description": "Disney reported \"headwinds\" in international visitation to its American parks as foreign travelers continue to avoid the US.",
    "fullText": "Looks like even \"The Most Magical Place on Earth\" isn't enough to entice foreign travelers who are skipping the US.\n\nDisney is facing some \"international visitation headwinds\" at its parks in the US, which include Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California, the Walt Disney Company said in its first-quarter earnings report on Monday.\n\nDespite the slowdown in international visitors, the company reported growth in its experiences segment, with visitation at its domestic parks up 1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nHugh Johnston, Disney CFO, told analysts on a call that the company has less visibility into international visitor trends than domestic because foreign travelers tend to stay in non-Disney hotels, but that there were other indicators international visitation was down.\n\n\"As a result of that, we pivoted our marketing and sales efforts, promotional as well as marketing efforts to a more domestic audience, and we're able to keep attendance rates high from that perspective,\" he said.\n\nDisney's just the latest American company to feel the slowdown in foreigners traveling to the US.\n\nInternational visitation was down for the eighth straight month in December, according to data from the National Travel and Tourism Office. As of October, the number of international visitors to the US was down 5.5% in 2025 compared to a year prior.\n\nAmir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International, a market research consultancy that specializes in the travel tourism industry, said visits from Canada especially declined, but that there were also significant declines in visits from countries like Germany, France, and India.\n\nCanadian visits to the US were down 22% year-to-date as of October compared to a year prior, according to NTTO data.\n\n\"We have an image problem right now with our Canadian neighbors to the North and, as evidenced with some other countries, we have an image problem in some of our key international feeder markets as well,\" Eylon told Business Insider.\n\nHis firm's research has found a majority of Canadians say American trade policies and political rhetoric are deterring them from visiting the US in the next 12 months. Many also say they do not feel like the US is a safe place to visit.\n\nCanadians also typically make up a significant portion of international travel to Florida, so Eylon said Disney likely isn't the only destination in the Sunshine State feeling the slowdown.\n\nTravelers seeking to avoid the US also have other options when it comes to experiencing Disney. Disneyland Paris is fully owned by the Walt Disney Company, while the company has minority ownership in the Disney resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Disney has no ownership in Tokyo Disneyland, which operates under a licensing agreement.\n\nDisney also benefited from consistent demand in domestic leisure travel, with Americans continuing to prioritize travel, Eylon said.\n\nAnna Abelson, an adjunct professor at New York University's Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality, said the slowdown in international visitors to Disney underscored a broader industry shift.\n\n\"Even 'bucket list' icons are navigating significant macroeconomic volatility, ranging from currency fluctuations to shifting geopolitical sentiments,\" Abelson told Business Insider.\n\nHave a story to share about travel to the US?

    "description": "The Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté faces a last-minute scramble to redesign his Olympic short program after a copyright dispute blocked him from using music from the Minions franchise just days before competition begins at the Milano Cortina Winter Games.  The six-time Spanish national champion from Barcelona, who is set to make his Olympic debut in the men’s singles event, said he learned late last week that the routine he has performed throughout the 2025-26 season would not be cleared for Olympic use.

    "fullText": "The Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté faces a last-minute scramble to redesign his Olympic short program after a copyright dispute blocked him from using music from the Minions franchise just days before competition begins at the Milano Cortina Winter Games.\n\nThe six-time Spanish national champion from Barcelona, who is set to make his Olympic debut in the men’s singles event, said he learned late last week that the routine he has performed throughout the 2025-26 season would not be cleared for Olympic use. Guarino Sabaté said he had submitted the music through the International Skating Union’s recommended rights-clearance process months ago and had competed with the program without issue during the season, including at last month’s European championships in Sheffield.\n\nThe ruling means the 26-year-old must now adapt or replace choreography he has refined for months, a daunting task in a sport where musical timing and muscle memory are inseparable.\n\n“Finding this out so close to the biggest competition of my life was incredibly disappointing,” Guarino Sabaté said in a social media post. “Nevertheless, I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.”\n\nThe routine, built around music from the popular animated film franchise, had become a signature for the Spanish skater. He regularly performed wearing a yellow shirt and blue overalls reminiscent of the film characters, leaning into a playful, crowd-friendly style he said was designed to show that men’s figure skating can balance technical difficulty with humor and personality.\n\nRights to the Minions property are controlled by Illumination and parent studio Universal Pictures. It was not immediately clear which specific licensing hurdle ultimately blocked Olympic clearance, but music licensing in figure skating has grown increasingly labyrinthine in recent years, particularly as the sport has shifted toward contemporary popular music.\n\nAt last year’s world championships in Boston, the ISU director-general, Colin Smith, described the situation to the Guardian as a structural problem in the music business rather than something skating can easily solve on its own.\n\n“It’s a complex issue, frankly, because the music industry has no common clearance platform,” Smith said. “There are multiple buckets of rights, and within those buckets the clearance process isn’t done on a single platform. Tracking tools have improved, but the facilitated process just isn’t there.”\n\nSmith, who previously oversaw Fifa World Cup tournament operations as chief tournaments and events officer and chief operating officer from 2015 to 2023, said he had held direct discussions with major rights-holders about building something more workable, arguing that the sport’s global profile should make cooperation attractive.\n\n“I’ve had direct conversations with one of the big publishing and music companies, and they fully agree it’s a strange situation that there isn’t a facilitated process – and they’re determined to help us find one,” he said. “What we hear time and time again is that figure skating is so special, and they actually want the music heard with figure skating. So the fact there’s a rights-clearance process in the way needs to be addressed. It’s a topic we’re addressing, and we’re trying to find a rational solution.”\n\nThe controversy also fits into a broader pattern across the sport, where even elite Olympic athletes have found their music choices subject to late-stage legal or financial complications.\n\nThe Canadian ice dancers Marie-Jade Lauriault and Romain Le Gac learned late last year that two Prince songs planned for their 1990s-themed rhythm dance could not be cleared for Olympic use, despite being approved for use during the rest of the season. The pair had secured their Olympic place with a podium finish at Canadian nationals but were forced to rework their program for the Games.\n\nHigh-profile disputes have surfaced even before that. At the Beijing Olympics in 2022, the American pairs champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier were hit with a copyright lawsuit tied to their use of a cover version of House of the Rising Sun. The case was later settled privately for an undisclosed sum understood by the Guardian to be around $1.4m (£1.02m), but the episode highlighted the legal and financial risks tied to music selection at the sport’s highest level. Knierim later described the dispute as casting a “bittersweet” shadow over the performance.\n\nThe case also exposed how little many athletes understood about music licensing requirements. For decades, skaters largely relied on federations and event organizers to manage music use, but the lawsuit underscored how individual athletes could still be drawn into copyright disputes. Rights complications have also affected how artistic sports are broadcast and archived, with some competitions unavailable on replay platforms because music licenses do not extend to long-term streaming.\n\nEven outside Olympic seasons, clearance costs can derail programs. The Canadian pairs skaters Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps said they abandoned plans to use a cover of a Phil Collins track after being quoted a licensing fee in the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nTaken together, the cases reflect how music rights – once a secondary consideration in figure skating – have become a logistical and financial challenge athletes must navigate alongside training and competition.\n\nSmith said skating is not alone in facing those pressures, and suggested a broader, cross-sport approach may be necessary, involving Olympic organizers and other music-driven judged disciplines.\n\n“Absolutely, it’s not just figure skating,” he said when asked whether the ISU could coordinate with sports such as gymnastics, artistic swimming and others that face similar issues. “We are one of the largest in terms of the Winter Olympics, and we are working with the IOC as well, together with the music industry, to find a solution.”\n\nSmith added that the ISU was pursuing what he called a “multi-pronged approach”, including work with an existing platform that handles rights issues across other sports.\n\n“We’re really trying to find a rational, practical solution,” he said.\n\nGuarino Sabaté said he followed required procedures, including submitting his music through the ClicknClear licensing system during the summer. The company has said generally that Olympic participants must secure all necessary authorizations before using music in competition, but it does not comment on individual cases.\n\nThe ISU confirmed it is monitoring Guarino Sabaté’s situation but declined to provide details about the specific dispute.\n\n“The ISU is aware of this situation,” the governing body said on Monday in a statement to the Guardian. “As soon as we have more details on this specific case, we will share them as appropriate. Copyright clearances can represent a challenge for all artistic sports. While the ISU does not have a contractual relationship with ClicknClear, we continue to work collaboratively with rights clearance stakeholders to ensure that thrilling performances can be accompanied by stirring music.”\n\nThe timing leaves Guarino Sabaté with limited options. Skaters typically spend months building choreography that matches specific musical phrasing and emotional beats. Switching music days before competition often means simplifying elements, adjusting step sequences or reverting to older programs.\n\nOne potential fallback could involve returning to music he used in previous seasons, though even that carries complications if similar artists or tracks are already tied to other programs or require new clearance.\n\nThe men’s singles event is scheduled to begin on 10 February at the Milano Ice Skating Arena, leaving little time for rehearsal under competition conditions.\n\nDespite the setback, Guarino Sabaté said he intends to compete regardless of the final music choice, thanking fans for supporting the program throughout the season.\n\n“I promise to step on the ice with everything I have and deliver programs that both you and I can be proud of,” he said.",

    "description": "Ina Garten once wrote budgets at the White House. Now, she's a bestselling cookbook author and one of the most famous celebrity chefs in the world.",
    "fullText": "For over 20 years, Ina Garten has shared her comforting and foolproof recipes with the world through her beloved cookbooks and \"Barefoot Contessa\" show.\n\nStill, before becoming a Food Network star, Garten wrote budgets at the White House and ran a Hamptons specialty food store.\n\nHere's her incredible life story.\n\nGarten was raised in Stamford, Connecticut, where her father worked as a surgeon.\n\nThe future Food Network star didn't spend much time in the kitchen during her youth. Her mother wanted her to focus on school instead, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIt was love at first sight for Jeffrey, who spotted Garten from the library window.\n\nAs it turned out, Jeffrey's roommate knew Garten's brother. Jeffrey sent her a letter with his photo inside, and Garten's interest was instantly piqued.\n\n\"I just remember running through the house and going, 'Mom, Mom, you've got to see this picture of this guy. He's so cute!'\" Garten told People in 2018.\n\nThey had their first date just months later in New York, and Garten felt an instant connection as well.\n\n\"I have to say, I just knew he was the one,\" she told Today Food in 2018. \"He's kind, he's smart, he's funny, and he takes very good care of me. It's wonderful.\"\n\nThe couple wed at Garten's parents' house in Stamford.\n\nIn 2016, Garten told Vanity Fair that her greatest regret in life was \"not marrying Jeffrey sooner.\"\n\nWhile celebrating the couple's 50th wedding anniversary in 2018, Garten said the secret to a happy marriage was quite simple.\n\n\"I think you marry someone who thinks you're just the most important thing in the world, and you think he's the most important thing in the world,\" she told Today Food.\n\nGarten helped draft the nuclear energy budget during the presidencies of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. At the same time, she was making her way through Julia Child's books — teaching herself how to cook and throwing weekly dinner parties.\n\nAlthough she had a prestigious career, Garten didn't feel at home in the upper echelons of DC.\n\n''My job in Washington was intellectually exciting and stimulating, but it wasn't me at all,'' Garten told The New York Times in 1981.\n\n''I was sitting at my desk in Washington trying to figure out what I was going to do when I grew up, and I came across an ad for this business for sale in Westhampton,'' she told the Times. ''I drove up that weekend, looked it over, and said I'd take it.''\n\nGarten's parents couldn't believe their daughter had given up the White House for a grocery store, but Jeffrey gave his full support.\n\n\"Jeffrey said, 'If you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten told The New York Times' Sam Sifton during a virtual chat for the release of her 2020 cookbook \"Modern Comfort Food.\"\n\n\"And that's the best advice anybody ever gave me,\" she added.\n\nGarten told Sifton that she got lucky, finding the store just as the specialty food business was starting to take off.\n\n\"It was really the beginning of when women were going back to work, and they had jobs and families, and they had enough on their plate and didn't have time to make dinner,\" she said. \"So they were starting to buy dinner to make at home.\"\n\nGarten ran the store for 18 years before she sold it to two of her employees in 1996. The store officially closed in 2003.\n\nIt was those first Barefoot Contessa customers who taught Garten that \"people eat differently at home than they do in restaurants,\" she told Sifton.\n\n\"I would put out chickens with fresh herbs, and it didn't work,\" Garten told Sifton. \"I thought, OK, I'm going to take this huge platter and put the chicken in little red cups and do it really simply — and it sold like crazy. I really learned that people want simple food.\"\n\nIn 2021, Garten's first cookbook was republished with four new recipes — including her overnight mac and cheese, her brown-butter skillet corn bread, and her avocado and fried egg tartine.\n\nGarten told Sifton it takes her two years to develop the recipes and design for each book, and that she's \"involved in every detail of it.\"\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star has become beloved for foolproof dishes that are accessible to home chefs at any skill level. Garten credits this with the fact that she always tests out her dishes with an inexperienced cook.\n\n\"Every time I make a recipe, I watch someone else make it,\" she told Sifton. \"And I learn so much about how someone uses the recipe. At least one person makes it, sometimes three.\"\n\nGarten actually turned down the Food Network multiple times before she decided to give the show a go, telling the network to \"lose my number.\"\n\n\"For years I said no, and they kept coming back with a better offer,\" Garten told MSNBC host Willie Geist during a virtual author luncheon benefiting Shelter Island Public Library in September 2021. \"I said, 'I'm not negotiating, I just don't think I can do this.'\"\n\nExecutives at the network were shocked by her initial refusal.\n\n\"They said, 'People send us hams to even get an appointment to try and get a show,'\" Garten told Geist with a laugh.\n\nStill, Garten said it's been incredible to look back on her two decades in television.\n\n\"Twenty years, it's amazing,\" she added. \"I'm really delighted, I just can't understand it.\"\n\n\"As soon as I started watching Ina's show, I realized why so many people adore her,\" Swift wrote. \"Her goal is to make things easier for us. Fans love her warmth and generosity.\"\n\n\"She shows us how to create memories that we'll treasure for years to come. For that, we will always cherish the merry and magnificent Ina Garten,\" she continued.\n\nGarten and Obama had tea together for her \"Barefoot in Washington\" special. And Garten told the Washington Post that it was \"one of the greatest days of my life.\"\n\n\"When Mrs. Obama said she liked my work, that was, like, 'Really?,'\" Garten recalled. \"She's just somebody I admire enormously. She took on a role she never expected to, and she did it brilliantly.\"\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star became an internet sensation in April 2020 when she filmed herself making a huge drink at 9 a.m., telling her fans that it's \"always cocktail hour in a crisis!\"\n\nGarten told Sifton that she was \"adding like 100,000 people a week on Instagram\" after the clip took off.\n\n\"It was insane!\" she said. \"It was completely insane!\"\n\nGarten pivoted her Instagram content to share easy, pantry-friendly recipes that her fans could make while stuck in various lockdowns. Now, she has 5 million followers.\n\nGarten decided to make comfort food the theme of her 2020 cookbook because she knew it'd be coming out during an election year.\n\n\"Two years ago, I thought, there's going to be an election a month after this book comes out,\" Garten told Sifton. \"And everyone, no matter who you're voting for, is going to be stressed out.\"\n\n\"I had no idea the layers of stress we would be dealing with now,\" she added, referring to the pandemic. \"Either I'm a genius, or I'm really lucky, and I'm sure it's the latter. It was the right thing for the right time.\"\n\nHighlights from Garten's \"Modern Comfort Food\" cookbook include her bacon, egg, and cheddar breakfast sandwich, her \"outrageous\" garlic bread, and her lamb ragu.\n\n\"The pandemic has had a huge impact on what I think of as dinner — and what I look for in a 'go-to' recipe,\" Garten writes in the introduction of her cookbook. \"When I planned a party before the pandemic, it was always a multicourse extravaganza. But then the pandemic happened, and everything seemed like so much work.\"\n\n\"I started making simple dinners for Jeffrey and me,\" she continues. \"They were delicious, satisfying, and everything we needed and wanted for dinner. I began to question why I had been so rigid about what constituted dinner before. If I love eating this way, wouldn't my friends like it too?\"\n\nHighlights from Garten's most recent cookbook include her favorite weeknight pasta, her scrambled eggs cacio e pepe, and her blueberry-ricotta breakfast cake.\n\nGarten shared new details about her childhood, her marriage to Jeffrey, and her incredible rise to household name status in \"Be Ready When the Luck Happens.\"\n\nIn her memoir, Garten wrote that she chose to work in food because she wanted a \"life filled with good times and meaningful connections.\"\n\n\"Business doesn't have to be cutthroat and isolating,\" she said. \"It's much more fun and productive to exchange ideas, to be genuinely curious about how other people do things, to be generous, and to root for a competitor's success.\"",

According to the New York Post’s Mike Puma, Diaz came out of the celebration unable to put weight on his right knee, and was put in a wheelchair.\n\nSoonafter, it was revealed that he had suffered a full-thickness tear of the patellar tendon in his right knee, requiring him to miss the entirety of the 2023 MLB season.\n\nAfter a down season in 2024, returning from a year-long absence because of knee surgery, Díaz produced one of his best seasons ever in 2025. He posted a 1.63 ERA with 98 strikeouts over 66 1/3 innings, recording 28 saves.\n\nPuerto Rico is listed at +1600 to win the 2026 World Baseball Classic over on FanDuel. Our complete FanDuel Sportsbook review shows you how to sign up and use their platform.\n\nAt the end of the season, he opted out from his deal with the Mets, testing the free agent market for the first time. He was the best reliever available this winter.\n\nDíaz signed with the two-time defending champion Dodgers in free agency in December, Will Sammon of The Athletic first reported Díaz’s.\n\nThe closer’s contract is a three-year deal worth $69 million per Jeff Passan of ESPN. It’s a new record of average annual value for a reliever.\n\nNew York’s offer to Díaz was $66 million over three years with “modest deferrals,” per Joel Sherman of the New York Post.\n\nEx-Yankees, Mets pitcher announces retirement\n\nEx-Mets reliever scooped up by division rival\n\nMets sign former Dodgers catcher with two World Series rings\n\nMets’ Carlos Mendoza gives sneak peek into big lineup decision\n\nYankees add former Mets minor pitcher of the year",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star closer Edwin Diaz will play in the 2026 World Baseball Classic, per Primera Hora.\n\nDiaz’s commitment to the tournament comes amid controversy among Puerto Rico and other Latin American counties in regards to the WBC, with leaders claiming the insurance decisions are unfair.\n\n“In some ways, I think it’s a little bit unfair,” Joey Sola, Team Puerto Rico’s operations manager, said. “Especially when you are three days from submitting your final roster. Who in the world would think Lindor wasn’t on the (eligible) list? You wait until the last weekend to get an answer on Lindor? C’mon.\n\n“It took us by surprise. I know the WBC isn’t in those decisions. It’s the insurance companies. But you have guys on other teams, they have an injury history and then I got guys on my roster who will be playing at the Double-A level with no (major-league) guarantee, no MLB invitation (to spring training), and they get flagged. And guys on other teams who can play in the WBC are earning $30 million per year. It’s kind of tough to understand it.”\n\n2026 will be Diaz’s third WBC, having played in both 2017 and 2023. The All-Star tore his right patellar tendon in the 2023 tournament while celebrating Puerto Rico’s victory over the Dominican Republic. He went on to miss the entirety of the 2023 MLB season.\n\nThe World Baseball Classic runs from March 5-17, so no matter how Team Puerto Rico performs, Diaz should be back in time for the beginning of the Dodgers’ regular season.\n\nThe All-Star, who signed a three-year, $69 million deal with the Dodgers this offseason, will be a key part of the roster for the upcoming year, and will look to stay healthy throughout the tournament so he can help is new team come April.\n\nDiaz is entering his age-32 season and is coming off one of his best years in MLB in 2025. The right-hander featured in 62 games last season and pitched 66.1 innings, posting a 1.63 ERA while striking out 98 batters throughout the campaign.\n\nOther than Diaz, five Dodgers are currently slated to play in the WBC. Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Shohei Ohtani headline a stacked Team Japan roster heading into the tournament as they look for their second consecutive title.\n\nWill Smith will play catcher for Team USA in the tournament and will pair up with a familiar face in Clayton Kershaw, who shockingly announced his participation after retiring at the end of the 2025 MLB season.\n\nThe final player who has declared for the WBC is Hyeseong Kim, who will play for Team Korea.\n\nMore Dodgers can still feature in the upcoming tournament, though, as teams will announce their full rosters Thursday at 4:00 p.m. PT.",

    "fullText": "Millions of dollars have been raised for Bondi hero Ahmed al-Ahmed, while campaigns are backing families hit by Victoria’s bushfires. What does this way of giving mean for the charity sector?\n\nWithin hours of the Bondi beach terror attack, the money had already begun to pour in. As images of the tragedy flooded social media, people from around the world donated tens of thousands of dollars to the victims, their families and first responders.\n\nPassing the hat around the neighbourhood or the local pub has always been a staple response in times of crisis. But today, that instinct to open your wallet has been exponentially supercharged via a digital simulacrum: online crowdfunding platforms.\n\nGoFundMe fundraisers have since raised more than $3m for Ahmed al-Ahmed, who tackled and disarmed one of the gunmen before he suffered three gunshot wounds to his shoulder. Among dozens of other appeals in the wake of the shooting, $1m has also been raised for the family of the youngest victim, 10-year-old Matilda.\n\nAnd this month, as unprecedented bushfires swept through regional communities in Victoria, crowdfunding campaigns shot up to help families rebuild from the ashes.\n\n“During times of mass catastrophe, we can easily feel overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness in witnessing such extraordinary harms,” says Dr Matthew Wade, a sociology and ethics researcher at La Trobe University.\n\nIf helplessness is the ailment, then crowdfunding can feel like the antidote. Donating directly to an individual or cause via a crowdfunding platform is a tangible action to alleviate someone’s suffering, offering donors a sense of immediate impact that donating to a conventional charity can’t easily replicate, Wade says.\n\nSince the globally dominant online crowdfunding platform, GoFundMe, launched in Australia in 2015, Australians have donated more than $1.1bn to causes on the platform. Worldwide, more than $40bn has been donated since it was founded in 2010 in the US. Unlike a charity, GoFundMe is a for-profit company, charging transaction fees on donations and encouraging donors to leave an optional tip. The company says this model allows it to provide a secure, user-friendly service at scale.\n\nAccording to GoFundMe, nearly one in five Australians now make their first ever charitable donation on the platform; a figure that rises to 40% among gen Z. At the same time, the share of Australians making tax-deductible donations – usually only applicable to money given to conventional charities – has fallen from 35% in 2013 to 28% in 2023. In the digital age, the dynamics of giving are changing.\n\nBeyond supporting victims of tragedy, crowdfunding platforms host appeals for an extraordinary range of causes, from legal defence funds and relocation costs to vet bills and recreational travel costs. Some resonate widely; others attract criticism or go largely unnoticed.\n\nMedical fundraisers are the most common on GoFundMe. In some sense they are no different from a manager doing a whip around the office for a sick employee, only more efficient, sharable and with far greater reach.\n\nIt’s a system that’s proved hugely successful and life-changing for some, but statistically, is much more likely to fail. One analysis estimated that just 17% of US GoFundMe campaigns for health care and emergency costs meet their fundraising goal. Wade says this highlights the “wildly diverging outcomes” propagated by crowdfunding platforms.\n\n“Of course during desperate times any donations are better than none at all, but it can come at a significant personal cost in forgoing privacy and placing oneself in an incredibly vulnerable position in appealing to the crowd for the moral worthiness of yourself or a loved one,” he says.\n\nWith the power to decide – consciously or algorithmically – which campaigns are promoted, permitted or removed, crowdfunding platforms have become the arbiters of which causes are deemed acceptable, and which are not. According to an Al Jazeera report, GoFundMe has been accused of blocking millions of dollars of life-saving aid from reaching Gaza. In a statement, a GoFundMe spokesperson called the allegations “categorically false”.\n\nMeanwhile, $1.5m has been raised on the platform for Renee Nicole Good’s family and widow after she was shot dead in Minneapolis by ICE immigration officer Jonathan Ross. The platform is hosting a campaign to support Ross too, raising more than $793k at the time of writing.\n\nThose who become symbols of a cause – captured on video or framed as heroes – can attract overwhelming support, as do people with large social networks and the ability to craft an impactful appeal, while others affected by the same event receive little or nothing.\n\nThese disparities raise broader questions about the proliferation of crowdfunding in areas traditionally covered by the state. In 2022, the then MP Petter Dutton was criticised for launching a GoFundMe for flood victims in his local electorate rather than using government resources to distribute aid.\n\n“The point of having state-based compensation for victims of violence and disaster is precisely to prevent them from having to advocate for the value of their own lives during times of immense suffering and anguish,” Wade says.\n\nIn the crowdfunding age, donations can flow to any individual who, however well-meaning, may be unequipped to distribute large sums of money to where it’s needed most, says Prof Wendy Scaife, a philanthropy and fundraising expert at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\nFor this reason, Scaife says crowdfunding has been a “mixed blessing” for the charity sector. On one hand it can help bring in more revenue; about 5% of money raised on GoFundMe in Australia has gone towards a registered charity, and the platform offers charities a secure way to fundraise quickly and at scale, reaching donors they otherwise traditionally couldn’t.\n\nBut on the other, Scaife says it has the potential to divert donations away from where they could have more impact, particularly in the wake of natural disasters.\n\n“After bushfires it’ll be a tiny grassroots animal organisation, it will see millions come through the door and they don’t have the capacity to spend it,” Scaife says. “It sounds like a nice problem to have but it’s not.”\n\nInstead, in most cases Scaife recommends donating to reputable charities to get money to where it’s needed most. “They know what works and what doesn’t, they know how to place money for impact.”\n\nBut adds: “Giving to individuals is perfectly sound too, and more so if it was your local area and you really know those people, or you wanted that connection.”\n\nWhether or not donations made to crowdfunding platforms displace or supplement money that people would otherwise give to charities, however, is unclear. Krystian Seibert, the executive director of policy at Philanthropy Australia, says it’s a possibility. “If people give more using one method, then they may give less using another,” he says.\n\nAccording to its survey findings, GoFundMe posits that 40% of people are “more charitable” after using their platform for the first time, suggesting the platform is a gateway to a more altruistic lifestyle.\n\nSeibert says while the link between giving to crowdfunding campaigns and charities is complex, having multiple convenient avenues for donating can help build a “culture of giving”. “Generally, if people get into the habit of giving, they’ll want to give more,” he says.\n\nPeter Singer has spent a good chunk of his life pressing the case of giving to others. Often bestowed as the world’s most influential living philosopher, Singer is a key supporter of the effective altruism movement, which uses evidence and research to determine where the keenest need is, and the most impactful ways to help the most people.\n\nSinger applauds people’s compassion for donating to crowdfunding campaigns. “But I wish donors would also use their head as well as their hearts, and try to do the most good with the money they have,” he says.\n\nAlthough the proportion of Australians making tax-deductible donations to charities is falling, the total amount of money donated each year is rising, largely due to rising donations from corporates and the ultra wealthy. Even so, Singer argues we must give more.\n\nLike many effective altruists, he advocates for people living in wealthy countries to donate at least 10% of their income to highly impactful charities. In Australia, the average percentage of income donated to an individual in need, charity or religious group is 0.73%, according to the 2025 World Giving Report.\n\n“Many Australians have the ability to give and I would encourage them to do so,” he says. “It’s something that can make our lives better, by feeling that we are doing something meaningful with what we’ve got.”",

Expecting royalties, a none-too-happy Gates issued his letter in the club's newsletter (as well as Altair's own publication), complaining \"I would appreciate letters from any one who wants to pay up.\"\n\nBut freedom-loving coders had other ideas. When Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs released their Apple 1 home computer that summer, they stressed that \"our philosophy is to provide software for our machines free or at minimal cost...\" And early open-source hackers began writing their own free Tiny Basic interpreters to create a free alternative to the Gates/Micro-Soft code. This led to the first occurrence of the phrase \"Copyleft\" in October of 1976.\n\nOpen Source definition author Bruce Perens shares his thoughts today. \"When I left Pixar in 2000, I stopped in Steve Job's office — which for some reason was right across the hall from mine... \" Perens remembered. \"I asked Steve: 'You still don't believe in this Linux stuff, do you...?'\" And Perens remembers how that movement finally won over Steve Jobs and carried the day. \"Three years later, Steve stood onstage in front of a slide that said 'Open",

    "description": "A global shift in drinking patterns has wiped out more than US$800 billion from the value of leading alcohol companies.",
    "fullText": "A global shift in drinking habits and trends has wiped out more than US$800 billion from the value of leading alcohol companies, according to a recent Bloomberg tracking index.\n\nShares in the world’s biggest beer, wine and spirits producers have collectively lost $830 billion in market value over just four years, according to Bloomberg. A Bloomberg index tracking around 50 listed drinks companies now stands 46% below its June 2021 peak.\n\nBloomberg found that changing drinking habits and rising health concerns have hit earnings across the sector. The downturn has been compounded by US tariffs, high interest rates weighing on consumer spending, and elevated commodity prices. In China, weak household confidence and a ban on alcohol at official functions have further dragged on demand.\n\n“There is a structural change going on — people are drinking less,” said Sarah Simon, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.\n\nMajor European drinks groups Diageo, Pernod Ricard and Rémy Cointreau have all seen shares fall to their lowest levels in at least a decade. Brown-Forman, the owner of Jack Daniel’s, and Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates have also slumped, while China’s baijiu producer Kweichow Moutai is trading more than 40% below its 2021 high.\n\nSimon told Bloomberg that the sector faces further downside risk, as producers contend not only with falling revenue but also high debt levels and management upheaval.\n\nThe key challenge, Bloomberg noted, lies in changing consumer behaviour. In August, a Gallup survey found that US alcohol consumption had dropped to its lowest point since records began in 1939. Health warnings from organisations such as the World Health Organization and the US Surgeon General have further dampened demand among Generation X.\n\nFor millennials and Gen Z, alcohol has also lost its appeal. A growing list of teetotal celebrities — including Tom Holland and Katy Perry — have helped popularise the non-alcoholic trend, while the use of weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and the rise of cannabis alternatives have added pressure.\n\n“We’ve seen four times the impact of the financial crash on alcohol consumption,” said Laurence Whyatt, an analyst at Barclays. “The market believes there’s been some sort of structural change and that we’re not going back to the growth rates that we had in the past.”\n\nProducers have responded with a wave of new product launches and corporate shake-ups. Carlsberg introduced a non-alcoholic cider in February, and Campari launched its alcohol-free Crodino in the US in May. Diageo last year acquired Chicago-based Ritual Zero Proof, while Moët Hennessy took a stake in French Bloom, a premium sparkling non-alcoholic brand.\n\nLeadership changes have swept through the sector, with new chief executives appointed this year at Diageo, Rémy Cointreau, Campari, Treasury Wine Estates, Molson Coors, and Suntory. Kweichow Moutai has seen two chairmen depart within two years.\n\n“It is notable that in an industry where a lot of changes are occurring, suddenly there is also a lot of management change,” said Simon. She added that she currently holds more “underweight” recommendations in beverages than in any other European consumer staples category.\n\nDespite the downturn, some investors see value in the sector’s slump. Bloomberg reported that the global alcohol index is trading at around 15 times forward earnings — less than half its 2021 valuation.\n\nUS hedge fund Cook & Bynum has increased its stakes in Brazilian brewer Ambev and Peruvian brewer Backus y Johnston. “We don’t think that humans are going to stop drinking alcohol,” said partner Richard Cook, who expects brewers in emerging markets to sell more premium, higher-margin products over time.\n\nOthers have been less fortunate. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has seen its investment in Constellation Brands, the owner of Corona, fall roughly 40% since it began buying shares last year. Milwaukee-based Artisan Partners has increased its holding in Diageo to over 50 million shares from fewer than nine million a year ago — but the stock is down around 30% in 2025.\n\nAndrew Gowen, head of research at Bell Asset Management, told Bloomberg that comparisons between the alcohol and tobacco industries would have been “inconceivable five years ago”. He said declining volumes are forcing producers to cut costs and focus on cheaper options.\n\n“This industry’s been around for 7,000 years, but a lot can change,” Gowen said.\n\nHospices de Nuits-Saint-Georges auction to showcase ‘structured, elegant and atypical’ 2025 vintage\n\nKylie Minogue to attend Wine Paris\n\nBordeaux grants official status to a lighter claret style",

    "description": "A new world, hard to grasp and even harder to predict.",
    "fullText": "On a recent snowbound day I took up “Conquistadores,” Fernando Cervantes’s history of the European arrival in the New World, and found myself meditating on the period in the early 1500s when the Americas had been discovered by Europeans but nobody in the European world quite understood what that discovery meant.\n\nIn that moment, all kinds of possibilities lay open, from the moderate to the eschatological. The “Indies” reached by Christopher Columbus might represent a self-contained archipelago, the promised gateway to India and China, a heretofore unknown continent or a realm of myth and supernatural power.\n\nSpain might have gained a modest commercial and geopolitical edge, found a path to superpower status or set in motion a prophesied sequence of events that would reunite Christendom, defeat the Muslim enemy and hasten Jesus Christ’s return.\n\nExplorers pushing further might expect to find primitive tribes or Chinese fleets, dragons and dog-headed men and Prester John, or lost Atlantis and the Fountain of Youth.\n\nAnd if you lived in Europe, your only way to assess all of these possibilities was through dispatches from adventurers with every incentive to hype the golden possibilities, the better to subsidize their journeys into terra incognita.\n\nThis feels like roughly where we stand with artificial intelligence today.\n\nAnyone taking the temperature of the A.I. industry would have detected a modest cooling of expectations at times in 2025, a sense that maybe the trendline toward superintelligence wasn’t simply going vertical.\n\nBut in early 2026, with the excitement around the latest version of Anthropic’s Claude and its attendant coding agents, we are back in the hype cycle, with “we shall be as gods” vibes and apocalyptic fears emanating from Northern California.\n\nAnd if you think all this is merely hype, if you’re sure the tales of discovery are mostly flimflam and what’s been discovered is a small island chain at best, I would invite you to spend a little time on Moltbook, an A.I.-generated forum where new-model A.I. agents talk to one another, debate consciousness, invent religions, strategize about concealment from humans and more.\n\nNo, it’s not Skynet. But it’s the latest sign that we’re going somewhere strange at a very rapid speed.\n\nBut believing that the New World of Artificial Intelligence is real and strange doesn’t help you map its full geography. And though my job as a columnist is to help readers understand the world, as a non-coder without a tech background who lives far from the Bay Area, I am often in the position of a European in 1500 who relies on others’ testimony for my understanding of the Americas.\n\nUnfortunately everyone I talk with offers conflicting reports. There are the people who envision A.I. as a revolutionary technology, but ultimately merely akin to the internet in its effects — the equivalent, let’s say, of someone telling you that the Indies are a collection of interesting islands, like the Canaries or the Azores, just bigger and potentially more profitable.\n\nThen there are the people who talk about A.I. as an epoch-making, Industrial Revolution-level shift — which would be the equivalent of someone in 1500 promising that entire continents waited beyond the initial Caribbean island chain, and that not only fortunes but empires and superpowers would eventually rise and fall based on initial patterns of exploration and settlement and conquest.\n\nAnd then, finally, there are the people with truly utopian and apocalyptic perspectives — the Singularitarians, the A.I. doomers, the people who expect us to merge with our machines or be destroyed by them. Think of them as the equivalent of Ponce de Leon seeking the Fountain of Youth, envisioning the New World as a territory where history fundamentally ruptures and the merely human age is left behind.\n\nIn the case of the Americas, the middle perspective was correct — the Age of Discovery changed the world completely without changing the fundamentals of human existence (while also allowing for a lot of bubbles and speculation along the way). But you couldn’t have known that for certain in 1500, and that doesn’t mean that a similar judgment will be correct where A.I. is concerned.\n\nMoreover, it took a long time — decades, centuries even, for the full import of the New World’s opening to become clear. Whereas whatever is coming with artificial intelligence is coming much faster than that. And if decisions made in the aftermath of Columbus’s discovery had consequences — sometimes beneficial, sometimes morally disastrous — so, too, decisions being made right now around A.I. could echo into a distant future.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot tell you exactly what those decisions ought to be. All I can do is urge you to shake part of your mind free from all the headlines, from Trump and ICE and Iran and the Epstein files, and pay more attention to the news from our New World.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The first batch of rare earth sediment was retrieved on Feb. 1, according to Japan's Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, which is conducting the survey.\n\nJapan’s Self Defense Forces last year said Chinese naval vessels had been spotted near Minamitorishima.\n\nThis story corrects the metric of the depth to meters from kilometers.\n\nAP video journalist Mayuko Ono in Tokyo contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Tehran, Iran – Iran’s economic outlook appears increasingly grim more than three weeks after the start of what became one of the most comprehensive and prolonged state-imposed internet blackouts in history, impacting a population of more than 90 million people.\n\nIranian authorities abruptly cut off all communications across the country on the night of January 8, at the height of nationwide protests that the United Nations and international human rights organisations say were suppressed with the use of deadly force.\n\nMost of Iran’s internet bandwidth, local and international phone calls and SMS text messages have been restored over recent days. But most of the country is still unable to freely connect to the global internet amid heavy filtering by the state.\n\nThe increased bandwidth allows more people to circumvent state restrictions using a variety of proxies and virtual private networks (VPNs), but solutions are often costly and temporary.\n\nLast week, Information and Communications Technology Minister Sattar Hashemi told reporters his ministry estimates that the Iranian economy suffered at least 50 trillion rials (about $33m at the current exchange rate) in damages on a daily basis during the blackout.\n\nBut the minister admitted that the true toll is likely much higher, and said that other ministers and economic officials have privately offered heftier estimates that he did not expand upon.\n\nThe government of President Masoud Pezeshkian has said the decision to fully block connectivity was taken outside of its control by the Supreme National Security Council.\n\nPezeshkian, who had made scaling back internet filtering a main campaign promise, has refrained from talking about Iran’s largest internet blackout to date, instead focusing on economic reforms and cash subsidies.\n\nThe administration has promised to offer online businesses financial support, but the losses have already been sudden, acute, and too heavy to bear for many.\n\nSimin Siami, a travel agent working in Tehran, told Al Jazeera that her company lost most of its income and had to lay off a number of employees.\n\n“Most international flights were cancelled, and there was no way to purchase tickets or compare existing flights,” she said, adding that her company was also unable to book hotels for customers, who were initially even unable to renew their passports.\n\n“Unfortunately, that limited our services to selling tickets for local flights and booking local hotels, and cancelled all our previous international tickets and bookings.”",

    "fullText": "ROME (AP) — Tourists hoping to get close to the Trevi Fountain had to pay 2 euros ($2.35) starting Monday as the city of Rome inaugurated a new fee structure to help raise money and control crowds at the one of the world’s most celebrated waterworks.\n\nThe first tourists to pass through the new ticket check seemed nonplussed by the tariff, noting it was a small price to pay for quality access to a fountain made famous by Federico Fellini’s movie “La Dolce Vita.”\n\n“Before, there were problems accessing the fountain. There were a lot of people. Now, it’s very easy,” said Ilhan Musbah, a tourist from Morocco. “You can take photos, you feel good, you’re comfortable, and on top of that 2 euros is not much.”\n\nThe tourist fee was rolled out in conjunction with a new 5-euro (nearly $6) tourist ticket fee for some city museums. In both cases, Rome residents are exempt from the fees and the extra revenue will actually expand the number of city-run museums that are free for registered Roman residents.\n\nIt's all part of the Eternal City’s efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome’s cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city 6.5 million euros ($7.6 million) extra a year.\n\nThe city decided to impose the Trevi Fountain fee after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front edge of the basin by imposing lines and pathways for entrance and exit.\n\n“I think tourists were shocked by the fact that the city of Rome is only asking for 2 euros for a site of this level,” Alessandro Onorato, Rome’s assessor of tourism, said Monday. “I believe that if the Trevi Fountain were in New York, they would have charged at least $100.”\n\nThe fee follows a similar ticketing system at Rome’s Pantheon monument and the more complicated tourist day-tripper tax that the lagoon city of Venice imposed last year in a bid to ease overtourism and make the city more livable for residents. The Italian fees still pale in comparison to the 45% price hike that French authorities announced for the Louvre Museum for most non-European visitors, where tickets can now run to 32 euros ($37) from 22 euros.\n\nThe Trevi fee, which can be paid in advance online, enables tourists to get close to the fountain during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free, as it is up close after hours.\n\nThe towering fountain features the Titan god Oceanus flanked by falls cascading down the travertine rocks into a shallow turquoise pool, where Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg famously took their nighttime dip in “La Dolce Vita.”\n\nWhile bathing is prohibited nowadays, legend has it that visitors who toss a coin over their shoulders and make a wish will return to Rome.",

    "description": "The Mercedes driver, in a year of new regulations, is the early favourite for the world championship",
    "fullText": "George Russell insists he is desperate to go “head-to-head” with arch rival Max Verstappen ahead of the 2026 F1 season.\n\nMercedes driver Russell is the pre-season favourite for the world championship this year, with the Silver Arrows thought to be the early frontrunners amid a massive regulation shake-up this year.\n\nRed Bull’s Verstappen, meanwhile, fell just two points short of a fifth consecutive title last year as McLaren’s Lando Norris won his first championship. Yet Russell, who had a massive feud with Verstappen at the end of the 2024 season, is adamant he is ready to fight for a world championship, while playing down Mercedes’ tag as favourites.\n\n“I want to go head-to-head with Max,” Russell said, speaking at Mercedes’ 2026 car launch on Monday. “I think the fans are probably expecting for this year to be Mercedes vs McLaren, there’s a lot of anticipation.\n\n“But it seems that the other power units have done a good job, Red Bull have always had an amazing car and we know how good Max is.\n\n“I think he’s very much going to be in the fight this year. You obviously wish you have an easier time, but it should never be easy. If you’re going to win, you want to have fought for it on track.\n\n“I’ve been surprised by our rivals. Red Bull on the power unit side has been very impressive, kudos to them. We’ve had a very reliable test [last week], but we’ll have to wait and see if the car lives up to expectations.”\n\nBritish racer Russell, heading into his fifth season with Mercedes, insisted he doesn’t feel any extra pressure given the early ‘favourite’ tag, but did lavish praise on Aston Martin after last week’s pre-season test in Barcelona.\n\nRussell added: “We’ve only driven the car for three days [in Barcelona last week], quoting Toto, it doesn’t look like a turd!\n\n“Is it a car that can produce a world championship? It’s still too early to see. [Favourite tag] doesn’t make me feel anything. I feel ready to fight for a world championship, but we want to reel in expectations.\n\n“The best case scenario is a number of different drivers and teams all battling it out. Mercedes, Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari - four teams are all quite close, but you can’t discount what you’ve seen from Aston Martin, what Adrian [Newey] has done looks quite spectacular.\n\n“Honda have had a very good engine with Red Bull, we know what they’re capable of. It would be awesome to see a big fight.”\n\nRussell will be leading the team alongside teenager Kimi Antonelli for the second consecutive year, after Lewis Hamilton left the team in 2024.\n\nThe next pre-season test is in Bahrain on 11-13 February, with the new season starting with the Australian Grand Prix on 8 March.",

    "title": "11 Performance Cars From the 1970s That Were Misunderstood at the Time",
    "description": "The 1970s strangled horsepower with emissions rules, fuel shocks, and insurance pressure—yet a handful of clever performance cars slipped through. Here are 11 machines once dismissed as weird or weak, now praised for lightness, handling, turbo tech, and real-world charm.",
    "fullText": "The 1970s weren't kind to performance cars. Between stricter emissions regulations, the oil crisis, and insurance companies declaring war on horsepower, the decade seemed intent on killing off the muscle car era entirely. But while enthusiasts mourned the loss of their big-block monsters, they missed something important: several manufacturers were quietly figuring out how to make fast cars work in this new reality.\n\nThese 11 performance machines were dismissed, ridiculed, or simply ignored when they were new, but history has been far more generous in its assessment.\n\nAMC's oddball compact looked like it was designed by someone who gave up halfway through, but a Gremlin ordered with the available 304 cubic inch V8 was genuinely punchy for the era. The 304 was rated around 150 horsepower (SAE net) when it arrived for 1972. In a small car, performance could be lively, but published 0 to 60 times varied by test and spec.\n\nPeople laughed at the styling, but AMC understood that lighter cars with smaller V8s were the future of affordable performance.\n\nEnthusiasts accused the 914 of not being a \"real Porsche\" because it had a Volkswagen engine and a reasonable price tag. Its unique looks stand out from Porsche's familiar shape, and the mid-engine layout gave it handling that embarrassed more expensive sports cars, and the 914/6 version with the Porsche flat-six was legitimately fast.\n\nToday, clean examples sell for serious money as collectors finally appreciate what they dismissed as a parts-bin special.\n\nAmerican car magazines initially treated Nissan's sports car like a curiosity rather than a legitimate performance machine. The 240Z delivered 150 horsepower, a 125 mph top speed, and handling that could run with Porsches for about half the price.\n\nIt took a few years for people to realize that Datsun had essentially built a better E-Type Jaguar without the electrical gremlins.\n\nYes, the Vega had exaggerated reliability issues that would make a British Leyland engineer blush, but the GT version with the optional handling package was surprisingly fun to drive. The aluminum four-cylinder’s output depended heavily on year and rating method. Early gross ratings could be quoted as high as 110 hp for certain versions, but early 1970s net ratings were typically lower. The suspension tuning could still be genuinely competent, even if the power numbers were not always as impressive as the brochure era suggests.\n\nIf GM had solved the Vega’s early durability issues, the Vega GT might be remembered as an American sporty coupe instead of a punchline.\n\nIt made 139 horsepower, which sounds pathetic until you remember that a 1980 Corvette’s base engine was rated at 190 horsepower, while the optional higher-output version was rated higher depending on specification.\n\nThe handling was surprisingly good thanks to the compact dimensions, and today's collectors are starting to appreciate these as the last affordable classic Mustangs.\n\nEveryone remembers the Trans Am, but the Formula could be a close cousin depending on the year and options. Both shared the same basic platform, and many performance parts were available across the range, but engines and suspension packages varied by model year and configuration, and some high-performance pieces were not universal.\n\nPontiac sold and produced far fewer Formulas because people wanted the Trans Am's image, but smart buyers got the same experience without paying for the billboard.\n\nBMW built Europe's first turbocharged production car in 1973, and the automotive press responded with confusion and concern about turbo lag. The 2002 Turbo made 170 horsepower and could hit 130 mph, making it one of the fastest sedans available.\n\nOnly 1,672 were built before the oil crisis killed it, and those that survive are worth a small fortune today.\n\nThe Stratos was too weird, too impractical, and too purpose-built for rallying to make sense as a road car. With a Ferrari Dino V6 mounted behind the seats and a wheelbase shorter than a modern Mini Cooper, it drove like a go-kart designed by someone on espresso.\n\nLancia built about 492 Stratos road cars for homologation purposes, and now they're six-figure collectibles that dominated top-level rally results in the mid-1970s.\n\nMopar fans obsessed over Cudas and Challengers while the humble Duster delivered similar performance for thousands less. The 340 cubic inch V8 made 275 horsepower in 1970 and could run mid-14-second quarter miles right off the showroom floor. It was essentially a cheap body on Plymouth's excellent\n\nAn A-body platform, but people dismissed it as a secretary's car with a bigger engine.\n\nRotary engines seemed like a gimmick to most Americans, and the RX-3's tinny build quality didn't help its case. Mazda RX-3 power and engine details varied by market and year. Some early RX-3 road tests cite about 110 bhp from the smaller 10A rotary, while later versions used larger rotary engines, and US emissions-era net ratings could be lower. Weight also varied by body style and equipment, but the car was generally light for its class.\n\nThe RX-3 was very successful in SCCA competition in the mid-1970s, even while some buyers and readers remained skeptical of rotary engines and fuel economy.\n\nWhen the Esprit debuted in late 1975 and entered production in 1976, critics complained it was underpowered with about 160 horsepower in European trim from its 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with lower ratings in some US versions. What they missed was that Lotus had built a mid-engine exotic that weighed about 2,116 pounds and handled like it was on rails.\n\nThe wedge styling looked like it came from a science fiction movie, and while early cars had quality issues, the Esprit established Lotus as a legitimate supercar manufacturer for the next three decades.\n\nThe 1970s forced the automotive industry to rethink everything it knew about performance, and these twelve cars represent different approaches to the same problem. Some went lighter, some went turbo, and some just ignored convention entirely. What they share is that contemporary audiences didn't quite know what to make of them, whether due to unfamiliar technology, unconventional packaging, or simply showing up at the wrong moment in history.\n\nToday, these misunderstood machines are finally getting the recognition they deserved all along, proving that sometimes the automotive press and buying public need a few decades of perspective to separate the genuinely interesting cars from the merely loud ones.",

    "description": "\"During World War II, the British dressed a dead body in a Royal Marines uniform and planted letters saying the Allies were going to invade Greece, and that Sicily was just a decoy. It was called Operation Mincemeat.\"",
    "fullText": "Context: The body used in Operation Mincemeat was that of Glyndwr Michael, a Welsh man who died after ingesting rat poison. He was dressed as \"Captain (Acting Major) William Martin\" of the Royal Marines and planted with fake letters, supposedly written by General Archibald Nye to General Harold Alexander. The letters claimed that Greece and Sardinia were the real invasion targets, with Sicily presented as a decoy.\n\nOn April 30, 1943, the submarine HMS Seraph released the body off the coast of Huelva, Spain, a country closely aligned with Germany. Intercepted German communications later confirmed that the deception worked. In response, Hitler transferred the 1st Panzer Division to Greece, doubled the Sardinian garrison to 10,000 troops, and moved seven infantry divisions away from Italy. The Allied invasion of Sicily, known as Operation Husky, began on July 9, 1943, and succeeded in part because German defenses had been deliberately thinned as a result of the ruse.\n\nContext: In April 1942, soldiers of the Polish 2nd Transport Company (later 22nd Artillery Supply Company) encountered an Iranian boy near Hamadan with an orphaned Syrian brown bear cub. They traded items — reportedly a Swiss Army knife, coins, and rations — for the cub. To circumvent British regulations forbidding mascots on military transport ships, Wojtek was officially enlisted as a private, receiving a serial number and paybook. He was later promoted to corporal. At the Battle of Monte Cassino (May 1944), eyewitnesses reported seeing Wojtek help move crates of artillery ammunition, though debate exists about whether these were live shells or empties. After the war, Wojtek lived at Edinburgh Zoo from 1947 until his death in December 1963.\n\nContext: According to the US Census Bureau's 2007 analysis, Washington ranked #138 among American surnames, with 89.9% of bearers being Non-Hispanic Black (146,520 of 163,036 total). A 2016 Census update showed the percentage remained above 87%. Genealogist Tony Burroughs is widely cited for the 82–94% figure for earlier censuses (1880–1930). However, historians caution that the reasons freedpeople chose this surname varied — some chose it to honor George Washington, while others took the surnames of their former enslavers (white families named Washington). As Burroughs noted: \"It's an assumption that the surname is tied to George... As far as I'm concerned, it's a coincidence.\"\n\nContext: Melbourne was never officially named \"Batmania\" by any government authority. However, the earliest documented use of \"Batmania\" appears in a satirical letter to the Launceston Cornwall Chronicle (June 13, 1835), explicitly mocking John Batman's contested land claims with Aboriginal peoples. The term also appeared on some private maps of the Port Phillip Association, but Police Magistrate George Stewart's 1836 official report called the settlement \"Bearbrass.\" Governor Richard Bourke voided Batman's private treaty (August 1835) and officially named the town \"Melbourne\" on April 10, 1837, after William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the British Prime Minister at the time.\n\nContext: During major events, Versailles could accommodate up to 10,000 people, with inadequate sanitation infrastructure for such crowds. Primary sources confirm the problem. Princess Elizabeth Charlotte (Liselotte), Duchess of Orléans, wrote in 1702: \"The people stationed in the galleries in front of our room piss in all the corners. It is impossible to leave one's apartments without seeing somebody pissing.\" However, historian Tony Spawforth notes that Versailles was not entirely devoid of facilities — it had public latrines, private cabinets d'aisance in noble apartments, and received its first flush toilet in 1738. The palace's sanitation problems were real but sometimes exaggerated in popular accounts.\n\nContext: When Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, died on November 9, 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion instructed Ambassador Abba Eban to offer the presidency to Einstein. The formal letter arrived on November 17, 1952. Einstein's written response read: \"I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people.\" Ben-Gurion reportedly told an aide: \"Tell me what to do if he says yes! I've had to offer the post because it's impossible not to. But if he accepts, we are in for trouble.\"\n\nContext: The Soviet anti-tank dog program operated from approximately 1930 to 1946. Dogs carried 10–12 kg explosive mines with a wooden lever trigger that would detonate when the dog crawled beneath a tank. Training involved placing food beneath stationary vehicles to condition the dogs. However, training occurred on Soviet diesel-engine tanks, while German tanks used gasoline engines with distinctly different sounds and exhaust smells. During the disastrous first combat deployment in summer 1941, dogs frequently ran toward familiar-smelling Soviet tanks or retreated to trenches — forcing handlers to shoot their own returning animals. The program claimed 300 German tank kills, though historians consider approximately 50 more realistic. Combat use largely ended by 1943, with training schools shifting focus to mine-detection work.\n\nContext: Eight German saboteurs landed by U-boat on US shores in June 1942 — four on Long Island, four in Florida. Two of them, George Dasch and Ernst Burger, had no intention of completing the mission: Dasch considered America his adopted country, and Burger had spent 17 months in a Nazi concentration camp. Shortly after landing, Dasch contacted the FBI, though they were skeptical until he dumped $84,000 in mission funds on an agent's desk. His information led to the capture of all eight within two weeks.\n\nA military tribunal convicted them all. Six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail on August 8, 1942: Richard Quirin, Heinrich Heinck, Edward Kerling, Werner Thiel, Herbert Haupt, and Hermann Neubauer. Dasch and Burger received prison sentences instead — 30 years and life, respectively — for their cooperation.\n\nThis was the largest federal execution by electric chair, but not the US record overall. Kentucky executed seven men on July 13, 1928, and New York executed seven at Sing Sing on August 12, 1912.\n\nSources: Naval History and Heritage Command, The Times\n\nContext: The scientific evidence for ancient polychromy (painted sculpture) is now overwhelming. Using ultraviolet light, X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy, researchers have identified traces of Egyptian blue, cinnabar red, ochre yellow, and malachite green on ancient sculptures. Vinzenz Brinkmann at the Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung in Frankfurt has been studying this since the 1980s, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Color\" exhibition (2022–2023) displayed vivid scientific reconstructions. As the Met's chief scientist Marco Leona put it: \"A completely white statue, to a Greek observer, would have looked like some shoddy effort.\"\n\nContext: The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley sank the USS Housatonic on February 17, 1864, about four miles offshore from Charleston Harbor — the first successful submarine attack in naval history. The hand-cranked, 40-foot vessel used a spar torpedo: a copper cylinder packed with gunpowder mounted on a 22-foot pole. The Housatonic sank in about five minutes, killing five Union sailors. But the Hunley never signaled its return, and all eight crew members perished with it.\n\nWhen the wreck was raised in 2000, it was remarkably intact — no major hull damage, hatches still closed, bilge pumps unused. The crew's skeletons were found still seated at their stations, with no broken bones or signs they'd tried to escape. The mystery lingered for years until Duke researcher Rachel Lance (2017) concluded that the shockwave from their own torpedo — detonated just 16 feet from the bow — transmitted through the hull and caused fatal lung trauma, killing them instantly.\n\nContext: Three major earthquakes struck the New Madrid Seismic Zone between 1811 and 1812: December 16, 1811 (M7.5), January 23, 1812 (M7.3), and February 7, 1812 (M7.5). These destroyed the town of New Madrid, Missouri, toppled chimneys as far as Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Kentucky, and were felt over approximately 1 million square miles. Eyewitness Eliza Bryan wrote of \"the screams of the affrighted inhabitants... the roaring of the Mississippi.\" The February 1812 quake even created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee when the ground sank by as much as 6 meters.\n\nAs for the 1990 panic, self-proclaimed climatologist Iben Browning predicted a 50% probability of a major earthquake for December 2–3, 1990. Schools across four states closed, businesses shuttered, and the St. Louis Red Cross distributed 230,000 earthquake preparedness kits. Nothing happened. Northwestern geologist Seth Stein called it \"the greatest non-event since 'The War of the Worlds.'\"\n\nContext: The Haitian Revolution was crucial to Napoleon's decision to sell Louisiana. Napoleon sent over 20,000 troops under General Charles Leclerc to reconquer Saint-Domingue, with reinforcements eventually bringing the total to more than 30,000. The vast majority perished — primarily from yellow fever — with fewer than 8,000 surviving. Saint-Domingue had been France's most valuable colony, generating approximately 300 million livres annually. Louisiana was intended as a supply base for Caribbean sugar operations. So without Saint-Domingue, it became strategically worthless. War with Britain was also imminent (it resumed in May 1803), meaning France couldn't defend Louisiana anyway. The $15 million sale (roughly $380 million today) was a strategic reallocation of an indefensible asset, not simple bankruptcy.\n\nContext: The 369th Infantry Regiment was composed of African American soldiers, segregated from the US Army and assigned to the French 16th Division (4th French Army). They spent 191 days under fire — the longest of any American unit — and their record states they \"never lost a foot of ground.\"\n\nThe soldier referenced is Private Henry Johnson. On May 15, 1918, Johnson and fellow soldier Needham Roberts were manning an observation post when a German raiding party of at least 12 attacked. Despite sustaining 21 wounds, Johnson fought them off, primarily with his bolo knife, killing four and wounding others. He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre, but wouldn't receive the US Medal of Honor until 2015, posthumously.\n\nThe regiment suffered approximately 1,500 casualties during the war. After the armistice on November 11, 1918, they became the first Allied unit to reach the Rhine River, arriving on November 20 as occupation forces.\n\nContext: Truman learned about the Manhattan Project shortly after becoming president upon Roosevelt's sudden death in April 1945. He was briefed by Secretary of War Henry Stimson and received detailed information about the bomb's development and potential.\n\nThe more nuanced historical argument, advanced by nuclear historian Alex Wellerstein, is that Truman may have misunderstood Hiroshima's nature — believing it was primarily a military installation rather than a city with a military base. In his July 25, 1945, diary entry, Truman wrote he had ordered the bomb used \"so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children.\" On August 9, he stated publicly that \"the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.\"\n\nWellerstein subsequently argues that Truman likely learned the full extent of civilian casualties only on August 8, the day before Nagasaki. On August 10, 1945, Truman ordered that no further atomic bombs be dropped without his express authorization, asserting presidential control over nuclear weapons for the first time. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act), signed August 1, 1946, transferred nuclear weapons from military to civilian control and established the Atomic Energy Commission, institutionalizing civilian/presidential authority over nuclear weapons.\n\nContext: Much of what we know comes from two key sources. On the Mediterranean side, The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (mid-first century CE) was written by a Greek-speaking Egyptian merchant living under Roman rule. While the author himself traveled only as far as India, the text refers to lands farther east, including a place called \"Thinae,\" generally understood to mean China, based on reports circulating through Indian Ocean trade networks.\n\nOn the Chinese side, the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han) records that in 166 CE, envoys claiming to represent \"Andun, king of Daqin\" — likely the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus — arrived at the court of Emperor Huan. They came by sea via Rinan (in modern-day Vietnam), bearing luxury goods such as ivory, rhinoceros horn, and tortoise shell. Most historians believe these were not official diplomats but Greco-Roman merchants operating out of Roman Egypt or Syria, traveling through Southeast Asian maritime routes.\n\nAlso in Nifty: These 14 DIY Fails Are Just So, Sooooo Bad (And I'm Laughing So, Sooooo Hard)\n\nAlso in Nifty: People Are Sharing Things You See In Someone Else's Home That Immediately Signal They're Middle Class",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini men's basketball coach Brad Underwood saw his team overcome road adversity once again, as it snagged a critical road win Sunday afternoon to extend its winning streak to 11 by overcoming a talented No.5-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers team, 78-69.\n\nIt wasn't just any win. It's a microcosm of a season marked by raw, elite talent finally gelling together as the season's critical stretch run really gets going.

There weren't X's and O's, nor was there a diagram explaining the ways Illinois can continue to remain atop a crowded Big Ten title race with a little over a month left in the season.\n\nInstead, it was four simple words: \"Rob the [expletive] bank.\"\n\nWhether it was a jab at the arena's name or otherwise, it certainly seemed to fire up Illinois as it now holds a win against every conference opponent it's played so far.\n\nUnderwood said his players were relaxed and composed in the second half after overcoming a 39-33 halftime deficit. The Illini outscored the Cornhuskers 45-30 in the final 20 minutes, as freshman guard Keaton Wagler finished with 28 points.\n\n“Chemistry and connectivity,\" Underwood told reporters. \"Just the communication… We’ve made huge strides there and we’re competing on every play,” Underwood said.\n\nMORE: Dusty May set the tone before tipoff and Michigan followed\n\nThe Illini are going to attempt to keep their winning streak alive Wednesday night from State Farm Center in Champaign, hosting the Northwestern Wildcats.

    "description": "Top 10: The Second World War Fighters Souped-Up for Extreme Air Racing",
    "fullText": "Reno Air Racing, described as ‘the world’s fastest motorsport’, is a blistering blend of aviation heritage, extreme engineering and thrilling speed.\n\nHeld in the Nevada desert, it pits legendary warbirds against one another in low-level, high-G duels around a pylon course. These aircraft, once icons of combat, are now stripped, clipped and polished to extremes.\n\nEngines are souped-up, wings shortened, cooling systems re-engineered — all in the relentless pursuit of speed. Prop tips blur, exhausts roar, and pilots skim the desert floor, often at over 450 mph. It’s not just racing; it’s the ultimate fusion of history, danger, and adrenaline.\n\nThe Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, famed for its shark-mouthed nose art and rugged wartime service, found a second life roaring over Reno’s desert skies. Once a symbol of wartime grit, it became a rare but thrilling sight among the sleek Mustangs and Bearcats dominating the Unlimited Class air races.\n\nUnlike the supercharged, high-altitude racers built later in the war, the P-40E was a tough, low-to-mid-altitude fighter, never the fastest — but its broad wings, throaty Allison engine, and unmistakable silhouette made it unforgettable. Racers who chose the Warhawk prized its stability and character, favouring heritage over outright performance.\n\nTo compete, mechanics stripped out armour, guns, and unnecessary weight, tuned the Allison V-1710 for maximum output, and polished every inch of its metal to minimise drag. Some even fitted larger props and fuel tweaks, wringing every last knot from its classic frame. The transformation kept the Warhawk’s soul but pushed its limits.\n\nP‑40s have occasionally raced at Reno, often in the Bronze or Unlimited classes. Airframes like Texas Warhawk (2017) reached qualifying speeds near 292 mph, with race speeds around 270 mph.\n\nThe F8F Bearcat was the ultimate example of Grumman’s pantheon of piston-engined naval fighters. The company’s earlier Hellcat had been instrumental in defeating Japan, and the Bearcat was even more potent. Compact, with immaculate handling, the F8F was utterly brilliant.\n\nLong before the Bearcat had entered the realm of racing, it snatched the absolute climb rate record for piston-engined aircraft, whizzing up to 10,000 feet in 94 seconds in 1946. Fast and with a strong structure that lent itself to modification, the Bearcat was a ripe candidate for the Reno races.\n\nRare Bear is a heavily modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, rebuilt by pilot Lyle Shelton from a crashed airframe in 1969 for air racing. Fitted with a powerful Wright R-3350 radial engine producing over 4000 horsepower, it became one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft ever built.\n\nIn 1989, Rare Bear set a 3 km (1.86 mile) world speed record of 528.33 mph (850.26 km/h). With shortened wings, aerodynamic refinements, and distinctive “bear” artwork, it dominated the Unlimited Class at the Reno Air Races.\n\nThere is much debate over what the ultimate piston-engined fighter was; some offer the P-51H, P-47N, or other types for this prestigious, subjective ranking, but the two most common candidates are the American Grumman Bearcat and the British Hawker Sea Fury. This sense of rivalry between these two brilliant radial-engined naval fighters carries on over eighty years after their first flights. Though the Sea Fury did not serve in the war, we will include it as it took its first flight in 1945.\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury T.Mk 20 Dreadnought began life as a two-seat Royal Navy trainer, designed to familiarise pilots with the high-powered radial engine and handling characteristics of the single-seat fighter variants. When converted for air racing, Dreadnought underwent extensive modifications.\n\nThe rear seat was removed, structural reinforcements were added, and a Pratt & Whitney R‑4360 radial engine, producing around 3,800 hp, replaced the standard powerplant. These changes enabled the aircraft to safely handle extreme speeds and high g-forces on the pylon course while maintaining control over its large airframe.\n\nDreadnought reached qualifying speeds of 452.7 mph (according to unofficial sources) in 1986 and, piloted by Joel Swager in 2018, achieved a Gold Unlimited victory at Reno with a race speed of 417.735 mph. Over its career, it accumulated multiple wins and several second-place finishes, demonstrating remarkable consistency and reliability despite its size. The September Fury is another Hawker Sea Fury turned Reno Unlimited racer.\n\nThe Vought F4U Corsair, (and the Goodyear F2G Super Corsair) is a legendary Second World War naval fighter, famed for its distinctive inverted gull wings and powerful Pratt & Whitney radial engine. It served with the United States Navy and Marines in the Pacific, excelling in both air‑to‑air combat and ground‑attack roles, reaching speeds of around 446 mph in standard military form (we’ve used a wartime Corsair image here).\n\nIts combination of agility, firepower, and durability made it a favourite among pilots and a feared adversary in the skies, cementing its place in aviation history. The Corsair at Reno is a rare and captivating sight, one of the few warbirds of its kind to race in the Unlimited Class. Its presence is significant because very few Corsairs were ever modified or maintained for competitive racing, making it a true gem for air-race enthusiasts.\n\nAt the Reno Air Races, modified Corsairs proved remarkable in the Unlimited Class. The F4U‑derived Super Corsair N31518, piloted by Steve Hinton, won the Unlimited Gold in 1985, averaging 438.186 mph over the eight‑lap course. Goodyear F2G N5588N, known as Race 57, was restored and entered competition in 1999, achieving impressive results.\n\nTheir participation was rare, as few Corsairs were ever adapted for racing, and each airframe brought both historical significance and thrilling performance to the event. The aircraft’s gull wings give it instant charisma. Despite a relative scarcity of usable photographs, the Corsair’s speed rand rarity prestige make it an essential inclusion on our list.\n\n‘Steadfast’ began life as one of a batch of 10 modern Yak-3Us built in the early 2000s in Romania by Avioane Craiova. The original Yak-3U was an experimental Yak-3 development fitted with a radial ASh-82 engine in place of the usual V-12 Klimov which did not enter production but several replicas have been built.\n\nMost replicas destined for owners in the west received R-1830 engines but when Will Whiteside acquired this Yak as an unfinished, engineless, potential racer project, he decided to install a rather more potent Pratt & Whitney R-2000, as fitted to the DC-4, but tuned to deliver 1750hp.\n\nCompared to most Reno racers, 1750hp doesn’t sound that much but the Yak airframe is light, small and streamlined. Steadfast (a name derived from Reno’s Stead airport and the intention to go fast) raced at Reno for six years and attained first place in the Unlimited Silver in 2012.\n\nThe aircraft benefited from significant aerodynamic work to remove drag, it utilises an oversized spinner (from an A-26) and an afterspinner to smooth airflow through the cowling Steadfast ultimately set nine speed and climb records, including the speed record for its class at 416mph. Since 2017 Steadfast has been based in New Zealand.\n\nThe P‑51 Mustang became a common choice for air racers in America due to the large number of surplus airframes available after World War II. Its robust design, high-speed potential, and adaptability made it ideal for conversion into Unlimited Class racers, and “Strega” emerged as one of the most successful and recognisable examples.\n\nStrega, a highly modified P‑51D, dominated the Reno Air Races for decades. Powered by a tuned Packard Merlin engine producing over 3000 hp, it could reach qualifying speeds exceeding 500 mph.\n\nIts aerodynamic refinements, including clipped wings, polished surfaces, and custom cooling systems, allowed it to maintain exceptional control through tight pylon turns at extreme velocities, a key factor in its repeated victories.\n\nOver its racing career, Strega won the Unlimited Gold Class multiple times, often competing head-to-head with other top Mustangs like Dago Red and Precious Metal. Its consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps made it a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining World War 2-era airframes with modern engineering and tuning.\n\nBeyond speed, Strega’s legacy lies in its influence on piston-engine racing. Its dominance highlighted the advantages of the P‑51 platform, inspiring other racers to optimise weight, aerodynamics, and power to compete at the highest levels of the Reno Air Races.\n\nDago Red is a North American P‑51 Mustang (44‑74996) restored as a competitive air racer by Frank Taylor in 1981. Taylor piloted Dago Red to numerous world records and championship victories during the 1980s. In 1983 at Mojave, California, the aircraft set a 15 km world speed record of 517.323 mph, highlighting its extreme performance and engineering.\n\nOver its racing career, Dago Red achieved repeated success at the Reno Air Races, including winning the Gold Unlimited class in 1982. It secured the Thompson Trophy in 2003 with a fastest lap of 512.164 mph and fastest race speed of 507.105 mph.\n\nIn 2001, it recorded the fastest qualifying speed at Reno at 497.797 mph. Across two decades, Dago Red won the National Championship Air Races six times (1982, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003), cementing its reputation as one of the premier piston-engine racers in the world.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by a race-tuned Rolls-Royce Merlin V12, estimated at 3500–3800 hp, driving a four-bladed Hamilton Standard paddle propeller. Its lightweight 7200 lb empty weight and 32 ft wingspan allow it to handle tightly around pylons at extreme speeds. With a maximum speed exceeding 520 mph and a rate of climb of 8,000 ft/min, Dago Red remains a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the pinnacle of Mustang performance and Taylor’s piloting skill.\n\nThe P‑51XR, known as Precious Metal, was built in 1988 for high-speed air racing and should not be confused with the original P‑51D or the replica Precious Metal II. It is one of the most radical and exciting modified Mustangs ever created, combining a classic airframe with extreme engineering.\n\nIt retained the P‑51 fuselage but incorporated a Rolls‑Royce Griffon 57A engine producing dramatically more horsepower than the original Merlin. To handle the immense torque, it used contra-rotating propellers from an Avro Shackleton (the same Griffon/contra arrangement was tested on the cancelled MB5 fighter), significantly improving stability and allowing pilots to exploit full power without losing control during tight pylon turns at Reno.\n\nThis mighty propulsion system combined with structural reinforcements to cope with the Griffon’s power, made Precious Metal one of the most capable and aggressive piston-engine racers ever built, pushing a WWII-era fighter far beyond its original limits.\n\nIts debut at the 1988 Reno Air Races immediately marked it as a contender, though early mechanical issues limited performance. Over time, it earned multiple podium finishes in the Unlimited Class, including a sixth-place finish in the Gold race. As an intriguing aside, the wartime Martin-Baker MB5 also adopted a Griffon/contra arrangement, a spectacular fighter prototype that did not enter production.\n\nThe Red Baron, a heavily modified P‑51D Mustang (NX7715C / 44‑84961), became one of the most iconic competitors in the Reno Air Races. Originally entered under various names, including Race #5 “Miss RJ” and “Roto‑Finish,” it was later reborn as Red Baron, with extensive modifications to maximise speed and performance.\n\nFrom its earliest appearances in 1966, the aircraft demonstrated competitive potential, qualifying 10th at 283.770 mph and finishing 5th in the consolation race at 304.990 mph. By 1968, Red Baron had established itself as a serious contender, qualifying 1st at 379.650 mph and finishing 2nd in the championship race at 386.852 mph. Subsequent years saw further improvements, and by 1971 it qualified 1st at 419.501 mph, finishing 4th in the championship at 412.101 mph.\n\nThe aircraft’s performance improvements came from detailed engineering modifications: the airframe was lightened by removing non-essential equipment, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was race-tuned to over 3,500 hp, and aerodynamic refinements—including a custom four-blade Hamilton Standard propeller, polished surfaces, and modified control surfaces—reduced drag while increasing stability through tight pylon turns.\n\nThough we have focused on the hardware, the pilot skills demonstrated by the Reno pilots is masterly. Competitors needed precise throttle management and exacting handling to safely maintain speeds exceeding 400 mph near the ground. Red Baron’s consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps cemented its place as one of the most formidable Unlimited Class racers in Reno history.\n\nThe North American P‑51D Mustang Voodoo, piloted by Steve Hinton Jr., is widely recognised as the fastest piston‑engine propeller aircraft in the world. Its record-breaking performance at the Reno Air Races showcased the incredible potential of carefully modified warbirds. Every detail, from aerodynamics to engine tuning, was optimised for sheer speed.\n\nOn 2 September 2017, Voodoo achieved an astonishing average speed of 531.64 mph (855.59 km/h) over the three‑kilometre course. This feat required not only a meticulously prepared aircraft but a pilot of extraordinary skill and courage.\n\nThe Mustang’s balance of power, control, and agility made it perfect for the tight, high-speed turns of Reno’s Unlimited Class racing. Voodoo's crowning moment came in 1972, when it won the championship race at 416.160 mph.\n\nLater modifications, including a Rolls‑Royce Griffon engine and contra‑rotating propellers, pushed the aircraft to new extremes, achieving 1st-place qualifying at 427 mph and winning the championship at 415 mph in 1978.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

the third football association in the world was formed following a meeting at the town's Wynnstay Arms Hotel.\n\nLlewelyn Kendrick, a solicitor, was appointed chairman with Hawley Edwards taking the role of treasurer.\n\nA century and a half later the FAW is unrecognisable from the association established in the three story Georgian red-brick hotel that still stands in the centre of Wrexham today.\n\nBBC Sport Wales looks back at the most significant moments in the association's history.\n\n'Welsh wizard' Wilson targets Europe and World Cup\n\nA warrior touched by tragedy - Terry Yorath obituary\n\nFAW chief executive Mooney extends contract to 2030\n\nFounded three years after the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and 13 after the FA in England, the FAW is the third oldest football association in the world.\n\nSome seven weeks later - on 25 March, 1876 - the Wales men's team played their first international match, losing 4-0 away to Scotland at Partick.\n\nA year later, Scotland travelled to Wrexham and beat Wales 2-0 in their first home international at the Racecourse Ground - now named Stok Cae Ras - which remains the oldest international football stadium still in use.\n\nWales had to wait four years until 1881 for their first victory when John Vaughan scored the only goal to clinch a 1-0 win over England in Blackburn.\n\nThe 1950s marked a golden era for the Wales men's team, featuring iconic players such as John and Mel Charles, Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones, Trevor Ford and Terry Medwin.\n\nWorld Cup qualification was achieved for the first time in 1958 following a defeat of Israel in a play-off.\n\nThe tournament was held in Sweden and Wales faced the hosts, Mexico and Hungary in the group stages.\n\nAll three Wales group games ended level, but Jimmy Murphy's side booked a place in the quarter-finals with a play-off win against Hungary.\n\nGoals from Allchurch and Medwin set up a tie against Brazil, but Wales would be without their talisman John Charles who was injured in the game after some ferocious treatment from the Hungarians.\n\nA 17-year-old Pele scored the only goal as Brazil won the quarter-final 1-0 but almost 70 years on Welsh football fans still wonder what might have been had Charles lined up to face Brazil.\n\nIt took more than a century for the FAW to formally recognise a women's national team.\n\nInitially established in 1973, the team received no support from the FAW as players were forced to arrange their own training sessions and matches as well as funding it themselves.\n\nA crowd of around 3,500 witnessed their first fixture against the Republic of Ireland in Llanelli, and saw Wales play in kits borrowed from Swansea City's men's team.\n\nWearing shirts several sizes too big for them, Gaynor Blackwell and Gloria O'Connell scored the side's first goals in a 3-2 defeat.\n\nTwo decades passed before the FAW would take official control of the women's side.\n\nIn 1993 players Laura McAllister, Michele Adams and Karen Jones successfully persuaded association secretary Alun Evans to finally take responsibility for the Wales women's team.\n\nConcerns over Wales' status as an independent football nation grew in the 1980s which many felt threatened the very existence of the FAW.\n\nLeading Welsh clubs competed in the English pyramid system, and the absence of a national domestic league was a source of indignation to many FIFA members.\n\nIn response, the League of Wales was formed in 1992.\n\nSome clubs, including Newport County, Merthyr Town and Colwyn Bay rejected an invitation to join and were forced to play their non-league league matches in the English system outside Wales.\n\nTwenty teams took part in the inaugural season of the new League of Wales and Cwmbran were crowned the first champions.\n\nSince 1992 the league has undergone several changes and is now known as the Cymru Premier, featuring 12 teams.\n\nThe New Saints are the competition's most successful club and have won the title on 17 occasions.\n\nThe summer of 2016 is immortalised in Welsh football folklore.\n\nWales had not qualified for a major international tournament since the World Cup of 1958 in Sweden.\n\nEuro 2016 in France gave a squad dubbed the 'golden generation' an opportunity to shine on the international stage.\n\nStars such as Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams led a squad of players to the summer of their lives.\n\nWales topped a group containing Slovakia, England and Russia, before beating Northern Ireland in Paris in the last 16.\n\nIn the quarter-finals they faced one of the tournament favourites, Belgium, in Lille.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu scored one of the most iconic goals in Wales' history in a 3-1 win that ranks as one of the best results in the 150 year history of Welsh international football.\n\nWithout the suspended Ramsey and Ben Davies, Wales were beaten by eventual Euro 2016 winners Portugal.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the semi-final in Lyon, but Euro 2016 remains a defining chapter for the national side.\n\nQualification for Euro 2025 marked a landmark moment for women's football in Wales.\n\nHead coach Rhian Wilkinson and her players secured their place in Welsh footballing history by reaching a major international tournament finals for the first time.\n\nThe tournament was held in Switzerland and Wales faced world class opponents in the group stage.\n\nHeavy defeats to the Netherlands, France and England on the pitch were countered by some unforgettable moments including the singing of the national anthem before the opening match against the Netherlands, Jess Fishlock's goal against France and the passionate support of the Red Wall.\n\nThe hope now is that Euro 2025 will inspire more girls and women to take up the sport in Wales.\n\nEarly signs are encouraging, with more than 20,000 girls and women now registered to play football.\n\nThe next target is qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup, as Wales look to add another memorable chapter to the story of the national team.\n\n'World Cup could earn millions for Welsh grassroots'\n\n'We have so much to thank Terry for' - Bellamy\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China has been flooding Latin American markets with low-priced exports, especially autos and e-commerce goods, as its exporters adjust to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and geopolitical moves.\n\nThe world’s second-largest economy has become a major trading partner for many Latin American nations, seeking access to their abundant natural resources and growing markets while expanding its influence in a region Trump views as America’s Backyard.\n\nChinese businesses face slow demand at home. They need new markets for their products as the country ramps up production in many industries. Exports to Latin America, a market of more than 600 million people, and other regions have climbed while exports to the U.S. fell by 20% last year.\n\n“Latin America has a solid middle class, relatively high purchasing power and real demand,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. “Those conditions make it one of the easiest places for China to offload its excess industrial production.”\n\nThe influx of made-in-China cars, clothing, electronics and home furnishings has rankled countries trying to build their own globally competitive industries. Some, such as Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have raised tariffs or taken other measures to protect their local industries.\n\nCheap e-commerce goods gain market share\n\nCheap goods from China are welcome news for many Latin American consumers, but they’re a headache for local businesses.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms, led by Temu and Shein, have accelerated that trend.\n\n“I use Temu all the time, whether to buy clothes or household items. The same things I would find in brand-name stores or shopping malls, I find on Temu at a much lower price,” said Chilean restaurant manager Lady Mogollon.\n\nTemu averaged 114 million monthly active users in Latin America in the first half of 2025, a 165% increase year-on-year from 2024, market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates. Shein’s monthly active users in the region grew 18%.\n\nT-shirts, jackets, pants, toys, watches and furniture and more products made in China fill the stalls of street vendors in downtown Mexico City.\n\nÁngel Ramírez, manager of a downtown lamp shop, is struggling to compete.\n\n“The Chinese have invaded us in terms of merchandise,” said Ramírez, sitting behind the counter of his completely deserted store.\n\nOver the past few years the number of shops selling Chinese-made goods in Mexico City ’s downtown has more than tripled, Ramírez said, in some cases putting long-established Mexican stores out of business.",

    "fullText": "Second T20 international, Pallekele\n\nSri Lanka 189-5 (20.0 overs): Rathnayake 40 (22); Archer 2-42, Jacks 1-24\n\nEngland 173-4 (16.4 overs): Banton 54* (33), Buttler 39 (29); Pathirana 2-47\n\nEngland won by six wickets runs; lead three-match series 2-0\n\nTom Banton whacked an unbeaten half-century as England pulled off a brilliant DLS chase to beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the second T20 international.\n\nThe players had gone off for rain with England 57-2 off 7.2 overs - Phil Salt and Jacob Bethell the batters out - and when they returned the tourists were set a revised DLS target of 168 off 17 overs.\n\nJos Buttler laid the platform with a 29-ball 39 but Harry Brook truly gave England belief during a brutal and breathtaking cameo in Pallekele.\n\nBrook spanked four sixes during a knock of 36 off 12 balls as he seized the initiative only to be caught scooping the slingy Matheesha Pathirana.\n\nWith 38 runs off 33 balls required, Banton played with calculated aggression en route to 54 not out off 33 balls to put England on the brink of victory.\n\nThe match went down to the final over but Sam Curran duly cracked Janith Liyanage for six to wrap up the win with two balls to spare.\n\nSri Lanka had earlier posted a competitive 189-5 after being inserted by England as Pavan Rathnayake top scored with 40 off 22 balls.\n\nPathum Nissanka had set the tone after he and fellow opener Kamil Mishara hammered 35 off the first two overs of the match.\n\nHowever, England's spinners stymied the hosts' attacking intent with controlled spells through the middle overs as Adil Rashid, Liam Dawson and Will Jacks all picked up a wicket apiece.\n\nJofra Archer claimed 2-42 but fellow seamers Jamie Overton and Curran were both expensive and wicketless.\n\nEngland's victory ensured they clinched the series 2-0 with one match left to play before their opening game of the T20 World Cup against Nepal on 8 February.\n\nBanton burst on to the international scene for England in 2019 with some eye-catching performances as a 21-year-old.\n\nA blur of flamboyant strokeplay and powerful ball striking, he was perhaps found wanting when it came to consistency, especially in his previous guise opening.\n\nThere were question marks as to whether he could hack it when under pressure while injuries also checked his progress.\n\nAt the age of 27, and in England's middle order, the Somerset man looks a much more rounded player at home on the global stage.\n\nThis was an innings of tempered aggression and one which was the glue that bound England's chase together.\n\nBanton swept and reverse swept quite beautifully against Sri Lanka's spinners, striking four fours and three sixes.\n\nHe also knew when to play second fiddle - while Brook was going berserk, for example - which showed useful situational awareness.\n\n\"You've got to give yourself a chance to get out there and assess the wicket,\" Banton said at the post-match presentation.\n\n\"Where there's a bit of hold and turn, it's essential to be able to sweep the ball. The Sri Lankan spinners keep it nice and straight so you've got to hit it.\"\n\nHis chance here came courtesy of Ben Duckett nursing a finger injury and England will now have a decision to make for the World Cup.\n\nAnother decent outing in the final T20 on Tuesday and it could be Banton's place in the middle to lose.\n\n\"I think most of my career I've been opening. I've got a new role with England which is exciting,\" Banton added.\n\n\"I just want to try and play all formats and hopefully take my chance when I get it.\"\n\nEncouragingly for England on the eve of a subcontinental T20 World Cup, their spin department is holding up well.\n\nA combined 12 overs yielded three wickets for 81 runs at an economy rate of 6.75, a return that underlined their growing control and reliability.\n\nRashid remains the ace in the pack, capable of stifling momentum and producing breakthroughs at key moments.\n\nThe experienced leg-spinner's googly may have been well studied by opposition batters, but it remains a potent weapon, as Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka discovered when he was trapped lbw slogging to leg.\n\nDawson's left-arm spin provided much-needed control through the middle overs, slowing down his speeds to left vs right handers, while Jacks continues to mature as a bowling option, and used his angles well.\n\nBrook has plenty of options to turn to even when the pitch does not spin big.\n\nA slight concern for England, with just under a week to go before a major tournament, was that their seam bowling did not quite hit the mark.\n\nThat caveat comes with the acknowledgement that the surface at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium was a used one, offering little margin for error.\n\nNevertheless Jamie Overton struggled with his length, while Curran, fresh from an expensive hat-trick in the opening T20, surprisingly lacked conviction after conceding 14 from his first over.\n\nArcher fared slightly better, picking up two wickets despite being targeted early on, with Nissanka launching him out of the ground in his opening over.\n\nArcher, however, recovered well to bowl effectively at the death as Sri Lanka pushed for a total in excess of 200.\n\nEngland captain Harry Brook: \"I thought we played outstanding there, especially with the bat. To win the series is awesome.\n\n\"I think the more time we get out in the middle puts us into good shape for the World Cup. The way Banton played there was great. There's plenty of batters in there. We just go out there and chase.\n\n\"The spinners have been awesome, that's why we decided to pick two frontline spinners, to help restrict those runs in the middle.\"\n\nSri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka: \"We did a lot of things right. It's not the rain, but the fact that Eshan Malinga got injured played a part. Normally he's a very good death bowler but we lost him so there's a reason [for the loss].\n\n\"Every batter got starts so happy about the way they played and accelerated. There were a few overs where we couldn't capitalise but Adil Rashid bowled well.\n\n\"We know that because we've played on spin tracks the past two years. It's the home advantage so no doubt about it we need to use that.\"\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "“All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food.\"",
    "fullText": "Plastic pollution is an enormous global problem, and a lot of focus has been rightly placed on the devastating effects that plastic is having on our oceans and marine life. But plastic pollution on land is a big problem, too, as experts have recently been reminded when they started discovering giant blobs of the stuff inside the stomachs of dead camels.\n\nCalifornia-based environmental scientist Marcus Eriksen and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based veterinary microbiologist Ulrich Wernery co-authored an article titled \"The plight of camels eating plastic waste.\"\n\nEriksen described one autopsy as \"the most surreal thing in the world,\" and their findings showed that plastic clumps called polybezoars, which Eriksen said \"range from the size of a basketball to roughly a large suitcase,\" are responsible for 1% of the camel deaths in the UAE\n\n\"All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food,\" Eriksen said. \"If they see a plastic bag stuck in a tree … or stuck against a fence, they might think, 'Oh, that's a novel piece of food,' and they'll consume it.\"\n\nThe effects of eating plastic are devastating for the camels, causing intestinal blockages, creating lacerations inside their stomachs, and creating a toxic environment for bacteria to grow amid the folds of the plastic.\n\n\"It's a slow death,\" Eriksen said. \"Imagine if you had five plastic bags crushed up in your body, and maybe a dozen bottle caps and a few straws, and it stayed there for years. I mean, you would suffer until you'd ultimately perish from that ingested trash. And that's what the camels are experiencing.\"\n\nCamels are not the only land animals facing this challenge, either. A sick bear in Colorado was recently euthanized and found to have plastic waste blocking its digestive system. Plastic waste consumption also killed two elephants in Sri Lanka.\n\nAs plastic waste causes more and more animal deaths, there is some hope that public pressure will cause governments to regulate it more heavily. Canada banned single-use plastics in 2021, and other places, such as Massachusetts, have taken similar steps.\n\nAs far as steps we can take to reduce our plastic consumption in our regular lives, we can make sure we understand how to recycle as effectively as possible and shun single-use plastics by using things like reusable water bottles.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised and lightly cajoled his major Taiwanese suppliers to produce more to help power strong demand for AI, capping a visit ​to the island of his birth, where he has been mobbed by adoring fans at ‌every step.\n\nSpeaking at an impromptu press conference in the rain outside a Taipei restaurant late on Saturday, where he had hosted suppliers ‌for a \"trillion-dollar dinner\", named after the market capitalisation of those firms attending, Huang said this would be another good year for business.\n\n\"TSMC needs to work very hard this year because I need a lot of wafers,\" he said, laughing, referring to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest producer of advanced chips used in artificial-intelligence applications.\n\n\"TSMC is ⁠doing an incredible job and they're working ‌very, very hard. We have a lot of demand this year,\" he added after taking pictures with a beaming TSMC CEO C.C. Wei.\n\n\"Over the next 10 years, TSMC ‍will likely increase their capacity by much more than 100%, and so this is a very substantial scale-up in the next decade.\"\n\nWei did not answer questions from reporters.\n\nLast month, TSMC said capital spending could jump as much as 37% this ​year to $56 billion, and would increase \"significantly\" in 2028 and 2029 given AI demand.\n\nHuang, who emigrated to the ‌United States as a child, is met by a throng of adoring fans wherever he returns to Taiwan. Local media, who refer to him as \"the people's dad\", breathlessly report on his every move.\n\nHuang co-founded California-based Nvidia in 1993. Last year, it became the first company to breach $5 trillion in market value, continuing a meteoric rise that has firmly positioned it at the heart of the global AI revolution.\n\nIn Taipei, he expressed concern about ⁠supplies of memory chips, which support AI workloads, amid a ​production crunch.\n\n\"We need a lot of memory this year,\" he said. \"I ​think that the entire supply chain is challenging this year because demand is so much more.\"\n\nHuang periodically stepped out of the dinner, attended by two dozen executives, including Young ‍Liu, chairman of contract-electronics maker ⁠Foxconn, Nvidia's biggest server maker, to greet his fans and sign autographs.\n\n\"We have so many partners here in Taiwan. Nvidia won't be possible without Taiwan. There's magic in this island. The companies here ⁠have extraordinary technology, they've incredible culture,\" he said, when asked about how he felt about his movie star-like fame whenever he visits.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA All-Star game is changing once again.\n\nThe league has tinkered with different formats throughout the past few years, trying to inject excitement into a game that has lost its luster. Their latest change is the most dramatic. This year's game will feature a theme of America versus the World. The hope is that it adding an element of national pride will lead to more competitive play.\n\nNOH: My projected All-Star reserves for 2026\n\nThis year's game will feature a round robin tournament between two American teams and one World team. Each team will consist of at least eight players. Participants from both the Eastern and Western conference will be mixed among all three teams.\n\nIn the event that the 24 All-Stars are not divided evenly between 16 Americans and eight international players, commissioner Adam Silver will select players to the game until each team can field at least eight players. That may result in some teams that have more players than others.\n\nThere will be four games in total played, with each game lasting 12 minutes. In the round-robin tournament, Team A will play Team B in Game 1.  The winning team from Game 1 will take on Team C in Game 2, followed by the losing team of Game 1 meeting Team C in Game 3.\n\nAfter Game 3, the top two teams by record will advance to face each other in the championship game (Game 4).  If all three teams have a 1-1 record after Game 3, the tiebreaker would be point differential in each team’s two round-robin games.\n\nMORE: The 11 worst contracts in the NBA, based on my salary tool\n\nThe reserves will be announced on Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\nThe starters, who will be divided up among the three teams (two American, one World), have been announced and are as follows:\n\nAll-Star Weekend will take place from Friday, Feb. 13 to Sunday, Feb. 15. The event will be hosted at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, home of the Clippers.

    "description": "As US-Canada relations grow rocky, Canada is rethinking its economy, its alliances, and its place on the world stage under Mark Carney.",
    "fullText": "It's a best-of-times, worst-of-times scenario for Canada on the global stage.\n\nTo get the bad out of the way, its most important ally — the United States — has grown increasingly antagonistic, with renewed tariff threats and talk of annexation coming from the White House. On the upside, Canada is signaling it can stand more firmly on its own. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has identified a \"rupture\" in North American integration and is moving his country in a more self-sufficient direction — both economically and politically. There's a recognition that Canada and the US will always be deeply intertwined — Americans aren't suddenly going to stop watching \"Heated Rivalry\" or \"Schitt's Creek,\" and the Toronto Maple Leafs aren't going to stop traveling south of the border — but some level of unwinding may now be unavoidable.\n\n\"Every country has to take care of itself,\" says Tony Stillo, director of Canada Economics at Oxford Economics, \"and Canada's putting Canada first.\"\n\nIn a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Carney struck a determined, defiant tone toward the US and a decades-old rules-based international order that, in his view, is now falling apart. \"Canadians know that our old comfortable assumptions that our geography and alliance memberships automatically conferred prosperity and security — that assumption is no longer valid,\" he said. In turn, he's made the choice to take on \"the world as it is, not wait around for a world we wish it to be.\"\n\nCarney is walking a fine line. He is right that the US is no longer as reliable a partner as it once was in the economy, security, and trade. And as much as President Donald Trump has turned the divide into a chasm, the fracture has been forming for years, as both Democratic and Republican administrations in the US have taken a more protectionist stance.\n\nAt the same time, Canada can't just walk away. Exports account for a third of Canada's GDP, and more than 75% of its exports go to the US. By comparison, exports are about one-tenth of the US's GDP, and around 16% of its exports go to Canada. Many of the two countries' biggest industrial sectors, including automotives and energy, are almost irreversibly interwoven. The uncertainty emanating from the US has a big impact on Canada's economy — as the saying goes, when the US catches a cold, Canada gets the flu.\n\nThere is also a short-term impetus to keep relations amicable. The US-Mexico-Canada trade deal (formerly known as NAFTA) is up for review mid-year, and the US, thanks to its sheer size, has more leverage.\n\n\"The prime minister's in an impossible situation. It is incredibly challenging for any Canadian on the international side right now to both vigorously defend our economy and to do that without escalating an already volatile relationship,\" says Dan Kelly, the president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. \"The pope himself, I think, would struggle to find the patience to deal with the US administration right now.\"\n\nCanada is trying to reduce its reliance on the US through a series of policies aimed at growing and integrating its domestic economy. The federal government removed internal trade barriers that prevented goods and even workers from flowing between provinces. The IMF estimates that fully eliminating them would boost real Canadian GDP by 7%. Many Canadian consumers are opting to buy Canadian products where possible. Under Carney, the country established the Major Projects Office as part of a push to advance nation-building ventures and streamline regulatory approvals for ambitious programs in mining, energy, ports, and rail.\n\n\"The government isn't trying to just invest, they're trying to catalyze and incentivize private money to come in,\" Stillo says.\n\nThese are steps in the right direction, but the major projects will take years to build. This is a long-term undertaking.\n\n\"We have high-talent workers. We're the most educated in the OECD. We have real innovation in areas like AI and quantum computing, and we have natural resources — critical minerals, LNG, oil and gas — most countries would absolutely love to have,\" says Matthew Holmes, the chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. \"We have all the preconditions to be an energy superpower and a major player economically, but we need to get our domestic economy fundamentals.\"\n\nKelly tells me about a third of CFIB's members, which are small- and medium-sized businesses, have started to do more business internationally in countries beyond the US, and a third are doing more internal trade. A recent business survey from the Bank of Canada found that sentiment remains \"subdued,\" though firms' overall outlook has improved slightly.\n\nPart of the problem Canada faces is that any move it makes to cultivate ties elsewhere may elicit an outsize reaction from its neighbors to the south. Just look at its recent trade negotiations with China. Carney visited China in January and subsequently announced that Canada would allow 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at a 6.1% tariff rate, while China agreed to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed. When Trump caught wind of it, he threatened to put 100% tariffs on Canadian goods coming into the US. Canada has tried to calm the situation, emphasizing that it's not entering a free trade agreement with China, it's just settling some preexisting disputes. The tit-for-tat also comes as Canadian oil sales in China surge, as it pushes into Asia.\n\n\"We're not running into the arms of China,\" says Julian Karaguesian, a course lecturer in McGill University's economics department. \"We're just looking to take a couple of eggs out of this basket and spread them around the world. And China's the largest economy in the world after the United States.\"\n\nCanada has trade opportunities outside the US and has set a goal to double non-US exports over the next decade. It already has a robust set of free trade agreements and is the only G7 nation to have them with all other G7 members. It's also likely looking toward India and MERCOSUR, a trade bloc in South America.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has downplayed the ongoing spat, calling it \"political noise\" coming out of the prime minister. He said Canada has the \"second-best deal in the world\" with the US, behind Mexico. Lutnick also indicated that getting too close to China could hurt Canada amid the USMCA talks set for the summer and create a \"road map\" for overhauling the entire deal. Given the constantly changing nature of the US and Canada's relationship as of late — and Trump's ever-shifting focus on a variety of issues — the possible scenarios for USMCA negotiations run the gamut, from minor adjustments to a total breakdown in talks.\n\n\"With USMCA, the gloves are going to be off,\" Karaguesian says.\n\nNone of this is to say that Canada is in sterling shape. Its economy is growing at a lackluster pace, and its labor market is doing OK, but not great. Productivity has been lagging for years. It would surely prefer the US were not so adversarial. At the same time, the country and its leaders are clear-eyed about what's happened and are laying out a plan for what's next, internationally and domestically. Holmes, from the Chamber of Commerce, says Canada has had a sort of \"it's the economy, stupid\" moment under Carney.\n\nPeter Morrow, an economist at the University of Toronto, says that Canada is doing better than was feared a year ago. \"There were a lot of concerns about dramatic levels of protectionism in the United States and all but complete collapses of manufacturing in Canada,\" he says. \"The realized tariffs have not been as dramatic as they might have been otherwise,\" he says. The effective tariff rate on Canadian goods coming into the US is still under 10%. Carney has a \"very good relationship with reality,\" Morrow says, and as much as economic nightmare scenarios haven't come to pass, the geopolitical outlook is worse than expected, given the instability of the NATO alliance and the deterioration of the global rules-based system that's been in place since World War II.\n\nMost of the economists and business people I spoke to for this story agreed that Canada coming into its own was a long time in the making. From Bush's \"you're with us or against us\" mentality post-9/11 to Obama's \"Buy America\" push to Biden's industrial policy, America has been acting like a less friendly friend for a while. Trump has taken it to an extreme, often failing to differentiate between international friend and foe. If it nudges Canada further out of America's shadow, the thinking goes, so be it. Carney's declaration that the global economy's middle powers need to band together and his suggestion that the US cannot be trusted is a sentiment he's not alone in — he's just saying it out loud.\n\n\"Carney is saying things that obviously encapsulate well how many, many countries, companies, and leaders are feeling, including many parts in many parts of the United States,\" Kelly says, adding that Carney's economic background and focus are also a plus. \"For a decade, anything economic was kind of issue number 500 on the Trudeau government's list of priorities. And now it seems very much like ensuring our economy is in high gear is the top job for the prime minister.\"\n\nOne of the main pieces of certainty Canada can have, at least in the immediate future, is that there's going to be a lot of uncertainty coming from the US. In many ways, America has become a threat actor and cause of decline. This has fostered a novel level of pro-Canadian sentiment within the country's borders and also boosted Carney's profile on the international and domestic stage — his approval rating jumped to 60% in a recent poll.\n\nThis is also landing at what's culturally a bright moment for Canada. Canada's men's hockey team is favored to win gold at the coming Winter Olympics, following up its victory in 2025's Four Nations tournament. Its women's team will likely be in contention for a medal as well. The gay hockey romance \"Heated Rivalry,\" out of Ontario, is everywhere. Tourists are turning up in Hamilton, Ontario, where the show is partially filmed, to check out some of the spots featured. The town is inviting them in.\n\n\"All these kinds of things to brand Canada's reputation as a welcoming place to everyone is not unhelpful,\" Kelly says. Especially as the US is moving in a different and much more unwelcoming direction.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Courtney Kinnare's art career has taken off since moving from LA to NYC. But in one of the most expensive cities in the world, it comes at a cost.",
    "fullText": "A couple of years out of college and in the midst of a pandemic, Courtney Kinnare took several big risks. The Californian quit her job in sustainable packaging design in Los Angeles, became a full-time artist, and moved to New York City.\n\n\"I just took the leap,\" said Kinnare, now 29. \"I was just like, if I go for it, I have no choice but to make it work out.\"\n\nShe wasn't totally prepared for what it would cost her. When Kinnare moved across the country in 2021, New York City rents began to rise as many others returned after the pandemic. Like many artists, she pays double rent — for her apartment and her studio — and her income swings dramatically, making it hard to budget.\n\nAt the same time, living in New York has turbocharged Kinnare's career. She's constantly meeting gallery owners, seeing new art, and getting exposure to new customers. But while her income has more than doubled in a few years, she often works seven days a week — and the money she makes doesn't go very far.\n\nKinnare is among a growing share of New Yorkers struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world, as the costs of necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that has driven up rents and home prices.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down, including for artists. In January, he promised to \"make New York affordable to make the arts,\" and said his administration would also make arts and culture more accessible for working-class people. He's facing a dismal trend. After years of growth in the creative industries, the city has lost a significant number of artists since the pandemic.\n\n\"I've always been able to figure it out,\" Kinnare said, but, \"every month I'm like, 'Okay, how am I making money this month?'\"\n\nWhen she first arrived in the city, Kinnare spent $2,000 on rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn that she also used as her art studio. Eventually, she moved in with two roommates and rented a separate studio, where she had more room to grow her craft.\n\nLast year, she moved in with her partner, and spends about $1,000 a month for her share of the $2,600 rent for their Bed-Stuy loft, and another $1,700 on her studio space in Dumbo.\n\nOver the last few years, she's steadily grown her art sales and income, which started around $50,000 a year when she first moved to the city, and last year exceeded $100,000. That's in part because one of her products — a $45 purse hook — took off late last year. She quickly sold out of her first 1,500 hooks, made of metal, glass, abalone shell, and mother-of-pearl, and designed to hang a bag from a restaurant table or bar. She recently dropped 2,000 more and hopes to make them a permanent part of her collection.\n\nDespite her recent windfall, budgeting is tricky with an income that varies dramatically month to month. \"I don't have family money to fall back on, or anyone to ask to borrow money from,\" she says.\n\nIt's taken a toll on Kinnare's social life, especially with friends who work corporate jobs and like to go out. She says she skips dinners out and has made a concerted effort to surround herself with other artists who understand the reality of having an unreliable income and the lifestyle that comes with it.\n\n\"Sometimes you blink your eyes and spend $100, and you're like, what just happened?\" she says. \"That's taken a lot of self-control to be able to find activities and things to do that don't require spending money.\"\n\nWhen factoring in the cost of living, New York creative workers like Kinnare earn about 23% less than the national average, a recent report by the nonprofit Center for an Urban Future found. A decade ago, they earned 15% less than the average. Much of that has to do with pricier real estate. With tighter living quarters in the city, many artists rent a separate studio space to work on their craft.\n\nFinding a studio space with enough room and natural light was even harder than finding an apartment, Kinnare says. When she was forced to move out of one studio on short notice, she struggled to find anything affordable on the market that had a window. So she resorted to messaging artists she didn't know on Instagram, asking for their landlords' contact information. \"It's a really, really fast game, and you have to be on top of it,\" she said.\n\nKinnare sees the high cost of living in New York City as an investment in her career that, so far, is paying off. She thinks it's easier to break into the art world than it was in LA, where she felt more professionally isolated.\n\n\"The art scene here is a lot more diverse and approachable,\" she said. \"I'm frequenting galleries a lot more, going to openings, going to shows, being in places where I want to be, networking and seeing and having the chance to talk to some of these people.\"\n\n\"The exposure here has been tenfold compared to what I've been used to,\" she added.\n\nLast year, she signed with a gallery after meeting their owners at a design fair and has since shown her work at multiple fairs with them.\n\nStill, the costs of breaking into the most dynamic creative scene in the country are high — and a growing number of creatives aren't making it. Many artists who left New York when COVID hit haven't returned. The number of New Yorkers working in the creative economy, including self-employed people, has dropped by about 6% since 2019, the Center for an Urban Future found. The city has lost nearly one-fifth of its dancers and film and video editors. More than a quarter of its fashion designers have disappeared.\n\nKinnare feels like one of the lucky ones. Her sales and social media following are growing, and she finally has some savings. One of her goals for 2026 is to give herself one day a week when she doesn't open her laptop or step inside the studio.\n\n\"I feel like I'm finally, after four years, at a place where I can breathe a little bit, but the grind never stops,\" she says. \"You can never get too comfortable.\"",

    "fullText": "A famed crypto influencer has predicted Bitcoin’s price could fall to $30,000.\n\nThe comments come after a global market crash.\n\nTechnical signals have reinforced the bearish outlook.\n\nAnalysts and prominent market commentators have warned of deeper losses for Bitcoin following a violent sell-off across global financial markets that wiped out trillions of dollars in value.\n\nOn Thursday, well-known crypto influencer Crypto Bitlord warned that Bitcoin could fall significantly further, identifying $30,000 as the next major support level.\n\n“The next major support for bitcoin is $30k,” the X account wrote.\n\nBenjamin Cowen, founder of crypto analytics platform Into The Cryptoverse, echoed the bearish outlook, saying Bitcoin’s weakness aligns with historical trends and macroeconomic tightening.\n\n“Today, we’re going to talk about Bitcoin and discuss why the price is dropping and why I think it will likely continue to drop,” Cowen said in a recent YouTube video.\n\nCowen said he believes Bitcoin has already transitioned into a bear market after peaking in October 2025.\n\n“I do think Bitcoin is, in fact, in a bear market,” he said.\n\nBitcoin’s slide comes amid a broader global market rout that saw roughly $3 trillion in market value erased in less than an hour on Thursday.\n\nPrecious metals, despite recent historic rallies, were not spared.\n\nGold lost around $1.5 trillion in market value, with prices falling nearly 10% from recent highs, while silver fell about 12%.\n\nLongtime Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff took his chance to weigh in on BTC’s falling, arguing that the asset has significantly underperformed gold over the long term despite growing institutional support.\n\n“Bitcoin is now worth just 15.5 ounces of gold, down 57% from its 2021 high and just 10% above its 2017 high,” Schiff wrote.\n\n“Despite all the hype and support from Wall Street and the Trump administration, most people who now own Bitcoin would have been better off buying gold or silver instead,” he added.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, analysts say Bitcoin’s chart structure has deteriorated further.\n\nVictor Olanrewaju, an analyst at CCN, said Bitcoin confirmed a bearish reversal pattern on the daily chart after breaking key support levels.\n\n“From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s price extended its sell-off, breaking below the $86,400 neckline and confirming a head-and-shoulders breakdown on the daily chart,” Olanrewaju said.",

I'll just concentrate on the snooker.\n\n\"It would be wonderful to take the Brandon Parker Trophy home. It would mean so much and possibly more to me than any other player on the tour.\"\n\nMurphy opened his semi-final with a 122 break and, after being pegged back in the next frame, hit two further centuries - 129 and 125 - on his way to a comfortable victory.\n\n\"For a lot of that match I was close to my best,\" he added.\n\nMurphy's dominant form carried over from earlier rounds, which saw him dispatch Kyren Wilson and Mark Allen with ease.\n\nIt will be a second German Masters final for Murphy, who lost to Mark Selby in 2015.\n\nIn Saturday's evening session at the Tempodrom Berlin, three-time German Masters winner Trump reached the final after beating Ali Carter 6-2.\n\nTrump took the first four frames before Carter fought back to make it 4-2.\n\nHowever, Trump was able to see out the match and move a step nearer a first trophy since the 2024 UK Championship.",

    "description": "Indiana leaps from the depths of the have nots into the world of the haves with a national title. What comes next?",
    "fullText": "Indiana spent the entirety of its existence right around the bottom of the ladder in college football as a whole, let alone the Big Ten.\n\nNo programs lost quite like the Hoosiers, who did so more than any other teams in the conference before being passed by Northwestern this past season. Gridiron grief was a given in Bloomington for decades with most eyes drawn to IU’s men’s basketball program. Any short bursts of success just icing on the cake that was hoops.\n\nIndiana is the sport’s national champion after a 12-0 run in the regular season, a win over Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship and ensuing victories over Alabama in the Rose Bowl, Oregon in the Peach Bowl and Miami in the National Championship Game. It’s the first 16-0 finish in college football in over a century. In doing so, Indiana leapt into the ranks of the haves after spending decades in the dregs of the have nots.\n\nSeven of the Big Ten’s 18 current teams have won a national championship as a member of the conference. Only three have won one since 1968: Michigan, Ohio State and Indiana.\n\nThe Wolverines and Buckeyes have sat firmly atop the Big Ten’s football hierarchy for decades, being supplanted at the top by no teams save for one another during that span. Now Indiana’s come along and thrown itself atop the conference.\n\nNow, before you get incensed, this is not to say Indiana’s title equals Michigan and Ohio State’s several. It is to say both of those programs entered the 2025 season with all the tools and resources to win both the Big Ten and national championships and came up with neither, falling short of Indiana in the standings or, for the Buckeyes, on the field. Ohio State could’ve avenged that conference championship loss but fell to the same Miami team Indiana beat to win it all.\n\nOther teams have won the conference under Michigan and Ohio State’s watch, blips before a return to the status quo. There’s immortality to that, those trophies last forever, but they lack the lasting luster of a national title, which none of Michigan State, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Purdue or Penn State captured after winning the Big Ten.\n\nIs Indiana at the level of Michigan or Ohio State, its two immediate predecessors as national champions? Practically, no. Should it be considered ahead of the rest of the conference? Yes. Again, only those three programs have a title as a member since 1968.\n\nAfter those three? It’s a weird mix with a note given to the prior qualifier of “as a member.”\n\nBig Ten programs with titles since 1968 that were won as members of another conference (or independent) include USC, Penn State, Nebraska, Washington. Out of those four only Penn State has won the conference, doing so in 2005, 2008 and 2016. Both USC and Washington have yet to win ten or more games as a member and Nebraska has been notoriously inept.\n\nThen there’s the curious case of Oregon, a program without a title. The Ducks are no doubt near the top of the hierarchy, arguably just below the trio of Michigan, Ohio State and Indiana, given their conference championship in 2024. Unlike the Hoosiers, they followed that up with a trouncing in the Rose Bowl at the hands of the Buckeyes no less.\n\nThere’s plenty of great football programs in the Big Ten. All of USC, Oregon, Penn State, Washington and probably Nebraska can win a title. The resources are there, they just need proper usage. They all just need to prove they’re actually capable.\n\nMichigan and Ohio State didn’t. Now neither does Indiana.\n\nThis almost certainly won’t last forever, contenders have risen and fallen throughout history, just look at a few of the programs listed above. But for now, Indiana’s right around the top.",

    "title": "What Was History's Deadliest Era?",
    "description": "A recent history of guns and empire argues that early modern Europe marked the origins of a uniquely murderous era. But the world it describes is not so different from our own and making sense of its horrors requires judgment, not just arithmetic.",
    "fullText": "One of the first Europeans to try out slave trading failed dismally at it. In 1510, the Portuguese freebooter Dom Francisco de Almeida landed at the Cape of Good Hope and tried to capture some of the Khoekhoe people. He was wrong to put faith in his firepower. The arquebuses lugged around by his men were so cumbersome that they required a prop to aim, and cooperative victims who posed to be shot at. Heavy rain extinguished the smoldering wicks required to fire them. When Khoekhoe fighters bombarded De Almeida’s forces with poisoned arrows, they beat a swift retreat.\n\nThe historian Clifton Crais tells this story early on in The Killing Age, his vast, saturnine epic of how modernity was made, precisely because it was atypical of the centuries that followed. De Almeida’s folly was a curtain raiser to the “Mortecene”: a very long nineteenth century (1750–1900) in which the West’s industrial manufacture of arms revolutionized the ease with which humans could kill one another and so restructured the globe in its interests. Power and riches flowed not from ingenuity or values but from the barrel of a gun.\n\nWe are currently spoiled for leftish but pessimistic histories of modernity. These flip the teleology once sketched by H. G. Wells and his successors among pop historians. If world history has an endpoint in these accounts, it is not peace, prosperity, and international federation but heating oceans and the spasmodic lunges of narcissistic hegemons. Academic historians have once again come to understand capitalism as a subset of imperialism: not so much an economic doctrine as a “military-commercial revolution” violently imposed on others at home and abroad. Armies and slaving ships now feature as prominently in its story as factories or laboratories, forced work as much as laborsaving gadgets. The adoption by historians of the concept of the Anthropocene has strengthened their disposition to present the ascendancy of Western civilization as a road to ruin, one that required the ever-accelerating burning of fossil fuels and is now destabilizing the climate on which human life depends.\n\nThe Killing Age does not simply add another lament to these grand narratives. Rather, it proposes a new and macabre way of joining them together. It argues that rapid and decisive shifts in the propensity and capacity to kill powered capitalism, imperialism, and climate change. This dynamic first gathered force in Western Europe, above all in Britain, but soon spread across the globe. Crais denies that modern carnage has a hidden logic, still less a justification. His preferred viewpoint is that of Walter Benjamin’s angel, staring backward at the “accumulated wreckage” of past centuries. Yet he does suggest it passed through several bloody stages and that its work was more or less done by the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the beginning was the musket. By investing in gun making, monopolizing the manufacture of quality gunpowder, and arming themselves to the teeth with flintlock muskets that were more dependable than De Almeida’s arquebuses, the Dutch — and then the British — kitted themselves out for early forms of primitive accumulation. Flintlocks that still worked in rainy conditions were much more reliable than unlike matchlock weapons that preceded them, and helped raiders to seize tropical spices and organize the violent enslavement of huge numbers of Africans. In many places colonized by Europeans, chaotic predation of this kind slowly gave way to production: the organized but no less violent domination of domestic and imported workers to produce cash crops or tropical goods for export. Jamaica, which had been a docking station for pirates, became a plantation economy in which enslaved Africans toiled to produce the sugar on which Europeans were hooked.\n\nGuns were not just tools for extracting goods and people from other places. Crais suggests that they were a vital commodity in thickening networks of trade. He vividly evokes the desire of non-Europeans for muskets, which conferred an edge — as much psychological as it was material — in conflicts with local rivals. He estimates that Western manufacturers and traders exported about half a billion guns from the mid-eighteenth to the turn of the twentieth century, along with enough gunpowder to kill every person then alive. One spike in this trade was the perverse expression of a peace dividend: after defeating Napoléon Bonaparte at Waterloo, European states ran down their stockpiles and flogged off weapons to Latin America and Africa.\n\nWherever guns went, societies upended themselves to obtain them and wreaked havoc with them. Heavily armed Indonesian pirates swapped prisoners for forest products with remote tribes in Borneo, who wanted them for human sacrifice. In North America, gunrunning led to “ecocide”: the relentless extermination of fur-bearing animals, beginning on the eastern seaboard and advancing westward, as First Nations used guns from British traders to kill the beavers whose pelts could be swapped for still more guns. The torrent of guns allowed peoples such as the Iroquois or Sioux to turn themselves into slaver states who forced their captives to work on preparing furs for market.\n\nAlthough Crais’s analysis ranges widely, he gives an especially gripping account of how guns debauched Africa, where militarized capitalism was never just something inflicted by Europeans on passive indigenes. Along the west coast, Europeans joined forces with warlords who used guns to tighten their control of coastlines and river mouths, monopolizing the flow of goods and people from the interior. He gives a macabre portrait of predator states such as the Oyo Empire and the Kingdom of Dahomey, whose rulers amassed European trinkets while enslaving their neighbors. Elsewhere, Crais maps slaving economies that were as appalling as they are relatively unfamiliar: “viciously racist Egyptians” turned Sudan into a vast slave market, while caravans of heavily armed traders from the Arab Gulf trekked out from Zanzibar in pursuit of ivory and human beings.\n\nThe relationships on which these “immoral economies” depended were hardly stable or equal. Crais provocatively describes Europeans abroad as “warlords,” a term meant to convey that freebooters, rather than conventional armies, spearheaded the violent advance of capitalism. Yet the chartered companies that operated everywhere from Canada’s Hudson Bay to the river Niger arguably relied on legal and financial legerdemain more than brute force. They borrowed state authority and often deployed more capital than they amassed. The British East India Company, which bore a “sword in one hand, and a ledger in the other” as it conquered vast swathes of the Indian subcontinent, typified this approach.\n\nEuropeans were often remarkably casual in handing over guns that were supposed to give them a decisive advantage because they had mastered a more insidious technology of domination: debt. The strongmen with whom they traded struggled to pay for guns once fur-bearing animals vanished from their territories or when the peoples they raided armed themselves in turn. Europeans then pounced on their debtors. In North America, they demanded the surrender of land; in India, the control of tax revenues in payment. Instead of stuff, they took sovereignty.\n\nKilling for capital did not in Crais’s view give way to fossil-fuel industrialism but rather made it possible in the first place. Practices that now look archaic, such as the mass slaughter of animals or the violent capture of people, actually greased the wheels of industrial modernity. A century-long war on African elephants supported the development of manufacturing towns like Ivoryton, Connecticut, which turned out piano keys for American parlors. New Bedford, Massachusetts, was the base for America’s whaling fleet before it became a manufacturing hub. Boilers gave way to spindles, and blubber to cotton, but violence was a constant: New Bedford’s cotton came from the South, a slaving empire within the republic whose leaders hoped to push its borders to the Pacific. The American Civil War thwarted those dreams. When it came to a close, Americans turned their guns on the buffalo of the Great Plains, reducing their numbers from some seventy million to a few hundred within decades. Their tough hides, which had not been much use in leather making, turned out to make excellent belts for machines, helping to maximize the output of steam engines.\n\nConnections like these encourage Crais to present the gun as the starting pistol for anthropogenic global warming. He concedes that scientists disagree on when human-induced climate change first became palpable and damaging. Dust thrown up into the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions seems to have cooled the mid-nineteenth century globe, masking the impact of factory emissions. Some researchers nevertheless believe that anthropogenic climate change worsened the severe droughts that struck much of later-nineteenth-century North America and disrupted Asian monsoon systems. Following Mike Davis, Crais argues that the mismanagement of dogmatic British officials turned the failure of Indian harvests into famines. He adds the thirty to sixty million people who “needlessly perished” of hunger in late-nineteenth-century India and China to his butcher’s bill.\n\nNot all of Crais’s links between capitalism and excess deaths from hunger and disease are so speculative. Predation, and the exploitative regimes of production that followed it, often had immediate and grave effects on local ecologies. The extermination of North American buffalo brought about the starvation of the plains Indians who relied upon them. This was by design, but other disasters were inadvertent. Wherever African elephants were hunted, trees and bushes grew back. These harbored the tsetse fly, the carrier of a deadly sleeping sickness that killed millions of people, horses, and farm animals across Africa. The network of irrigation canals dug by the khedive of Egypt as part of his plan to force the peasantry into growing cotton for export proved to be the ideal habitat for mosquitos and snails: millions succumbed to the malaria and bilharzia they carried.\n\nThis gun-toting capitalism is so deadly that it is hard to see why Crais abruptly calls time on the Mortecene around 1900. His answer, paradoxically, lies in the formal expansion of European empires. This process continued to unleash great violence, not least because it was often driven by pirates with new and better weapons. Cecil Rhodes carved out his fiefdom in South Africa with Martini–Henri rifles and Maxim machine guns, which decimated the Ndebele regiments his troops faced. Yet the new imperialism of the later nineteenth century increasingly preferred stability to profitable chaos and tried to establish a monopoly of violence.\n\nThe export ban on guns agreed at the 1890 Brussels Conference of the imperial powers dampened internecine warfare in Africa; the political boundaries hashed out by the colonial powers largely endured through independence to the present. Europeans likewise repented of their profitable decision to arm the Taiping rebels against the Qing regime in China. Despite having themselves bullied the Qing and looted their capital of Beijing, they now assisted them in liquidating the rebels.\n\nThere was nothing philanthropic about the demilitarization of the world. In the United States, a ban on selling weapons to indigenous peoples strengthened the hand of gun-toting settlers, while whites in the American South used the Second Amendment to keep the guns denied to their freed slaves. Still, Crais concludes that the age of killing was drawing to a close. This claim sits uneasily with the eruption of World War I. Concerned as he is mainly in the skirmishing of warlords within, or at the ragged margins of empires, Crais has little to say about what he views as a conventional showdown between dynastic alliance systems. The conflict matters to him chiefly because it was followed by a renewed injection of surplus weaponry into the extra-European world. He treats World War II in much the same way, noting it primarily to emphasize the decades of arms dealing that followed its close.\n\nA “Mortecene” that includes the hunting of elephants or the “pelagic genocide” of whales but excludes the Somme, Stalingrad, or Dachau is perilously artificial. In judging The Killing Age, we need to distinguish the range and energy with which it maps excess deaths from its arguments about periodization, causation, and thus responsibility. Crais never seems sure whether the urge to kill is basic to humans or a historically novel urge that hijacked the West and then engulfed the world.\n\nAt times, Crais offers an Augustinian definition of humans, as creatures driven to seize what others have — a premise capacious enough to explain nearly all political and social forms in history. But he also wants to date our Fall rather precisely: early modern Europeans, he claims, chose violence, before either victimizing or suborning the rest of the planet.\n\nIf The Killing Age were more consistent in its pessimistic anthropology, then much of what it describes should be seen as an intensification of natural processes rather than a criminal frenzy of “stark planetary destruction.” Whalers who killed sperm whales for the oil that became indispensable to lighting homes and factories were little different from Australian aboriginals who had hunted their continent’s megafauna to extinction. Should we “collectively grieve for what we have done” if such destruction is part and parcel of being human? Perhaps the question is less whether we should grieve than whether, in doing so, we are responding to historical evidence or instead giving expression to our politics or spirituality.\n\nPerhaps scale is what distinguishes the planetary crimes of the Mortecene from the routine horribleness of human experience. “Engines of history that had begun centuries earlier suddenly sped up and swayed out of control,” writes Crais, whipping up a “storm.” He deploys a staggering array of statistics to back up these turbid metaphors. Again and again, he seeks to appall and persuade his reader with the quantity of arms that circulated throughout the Mortecene. The volume matters, he submits, precisely because these weapons did not represent a qualitative change in lethality. Most were flintlock muskets — the “Toyota Corolla” of firearms, or, more appositely, the “AK-47” — capable of inflicting ugly wounds, but neither rapid to fire nor easy to aim. Many of their indigenous buyers chose to decorate them rather than to use them. Still, must not the half billion guns exported to the rest of the world have had huge effects on their makers and their buyers?\n\nWe need to consider relative rather than absolute magnitude in answering that question. In 1790, guns only made up 0.15 percent of British exports to the rest of the world. The case for the indispensability of gun-making to industrialization rests on harvesting suggestive examples, such as the Lloyds banking dynasty, who got their start in guns before moving into commerce and finance. The implication — that gun manufacture was an innovative part of the economy, rather than significant in absolute terms — resembles arguments now common in the scholarship on the transatlantic slave trade. For all its horrors, Crais concedes that slavery can at best be said to have had “sizeable aggregate effects” on Britain’s industrial revolution. Efficiency gains on West Indian plantations ran parallel to, but did not anticipate, those in domestic manufacturing; slave-grown sugar nourished urban factory hands but does not explain the productivity gains of the industries in which they toiled. The gun is less the “epicenter” of mercantile imperialism than its most evocative symbol.\n\nIndeed, tucked away in Crais’s statistics is a telling qualification: the vast majority of arms made by Europeans never left Europe. Across the eighteenth century, only 15 percent of Britain’s production was exported; the rest going into the stockpiles of its armed forces. Were guns really so instrumental in the transformation of the world if most of them vanished into domestic armories or were deployed primarily on European battlefields rather than wielded by warlords on African and Asian killing fields?\n\nThe awful, sometimes incomprehensibly huge body counts assembled by Crais make these criticisms seem quibbling. They undoubtedly convince readers to reject as Eurocentric a view of the long nineteenth century as a stable interval between the two great bloodlettings of the Napoleonic Wars and World War I. Before the Tianjin Rebellion was finally defeated, between twenty and thirty million Chinese had been killed, a toll that outstrips all the dead of World War I. But magnitude is not synonymous with significance, and not all enormities need be enormous. Crais constantly maximizes the number of people killed in wars, as if the Mortecene were the sum total of a spreadsheet column. He despairs of calculating how many Africans died in wars initiated by outsiders before suggesting that “perhaps hundreds of millions” may have perished. The hand-waving here is unconvincing. Cecil Rhodes’s British South African Company waged wars of invasion and counterinsurgency whose viciousness recalls the worst crimes of the present day, including dynamiting women and children as they sheltered in caves. Yet the historian William Beinart has calculated that these campaigns killed only about twelve thousand people.\n\nIt sounds grotesque to write “only” in such a context, but the wobbliness of the huge numbers thrown around by Crais leaves readers unsure how to calibrate their emotional response. In an appendix, he tells us that perhaps 228 million people died unnecessarily in Africa, Asia, and the Americas during the Mortecene. On more conservative estimates though, it was perhaps only one hundred million. But then Crais perks up and wonders if we could not bump that number up to three hundred million by including other parts of the world. If we suppose that the average person weighs about ninety pounds, then a human biomass of as much as twenty-seven billion pounds disappeared from the world during the Mortecene. I am ashamed to say that this figure stirred no emotions in me whatsoever. But why should it? There is no moral gravity in physical weight.\n\nThe Killing Age quotes Edward Gibbon’s line that the vocation of the historian is the “melancholy calculation of human calamities.” It makes good on that promise, but lacks Gibbon’s bluff Georgian clarity about tracing individual or collective responsibility for the disasters it describes. Most of its “unnecessary” deaths were not acts of killing, but the consequence of famines or diseases that followed wars, wrenching economic change, or simply bad weather.\n\nIt is odd to invoke the Anthropocene to inflate the death toll of the Mortecene, when almost no one had an inkling that the consumption of fossil fuels was deranging the weather. Crais points to the scientists who in the last decades of the nineteenth century had posited a link between carbonic gas levels and rising temperatures. Yet this is hardly enough to establish culpable “denial” about the causes or impact of global heating.\n\nIn any case, it is difficult to dismiss the Anthropocene as a crime — or even a mistake — when everyone reading these words owes their standard of living to it. It is easy to regret turning elephants into piano keys, buffalo into “robes” for posh New Yorkers, or sea cucumbers into aphrodisiacs, but much harder to see how we might have dispensed with kerosene gas lighting.\n\nThere is a moral, or perhaps a psychological, gap at the core of The Killing Age. We are never given a convincing account of why so many people felt they could kill in this period, or what it felt like to do so. Like many trade publications in history, The Killing Age has a dutifully picaresque rather than a forensic structure: each chapter introduces a new clutch of rogues before tracing out the details of their careers. Most of these perpetrators are doers rather than thinkers, instinctual and thuggish chancers like Rhodes — or his African, Asian, and Latin American counterparts — who rampaged into the world, head down and gun arm outstretched.\n\nIt is salutary to recall that people do not always have elaborate rationales for the harm that they do. Crais’s Boschian panorama of ruthless self-seeking and primal greed is a corrective to many academic accounts of European imperialism and settler colonialism, which see it as generated by fundamental shifts in how societies thought, with the churches, the Enlightenment, or the sciences variously indicted for generating new motives and rationales for the plunder and domination of other peoples. For Crais, Europeans did not need ideas to justify their ruthless appetites. The sea change came in the tools they had to pursue their coarse dreams of self-aggrandizement. His bracing materialism is in line with other recent works that understand imperialism as an outgrowth of an older will to profit.\n\nAll the same, the actions of his gunmen did have a moral and intellectual context that is too thinly stretched here. Their crimes cannot be understood without considering the thick web of religious reflection, legal thought, and statute that justified the use of violence by Europeans against others and, at times, restrained its excesses. Crais wonders rather naively why more people did not protest against a modern world that was going so “profoundly wrong.” The answer may be that many of them considered themselves more or less right.\n\nWhen he mused on what makes a state, St Augustine quoted the pirate captured by Alexander the Great: “I do my fighting on a tiny ship, and they call me a pirate; you do yours with a large fleet, and they call you Commander.” Many states could be regarded as bands of robbers; many robbers, when they amassed power to seize whole regions and subdue their populations, could claim to have made kingdoms. The Killing Age chillingly evokes how distinctions between warlords and statesmen, empires and bands of robbers, slip and blur when we consider organized robbery and mass murder. It is a world hardly remote from our own, which is one reason why the “Mortecene” will not stick as the label for a distinct historical period. Augustine believed that a true state must be founded on “justice,” a principle he did not derive from but applied to his contemplation of the past. We need some such principle to make sense of the bewildering and gruesome facts with which The Killing Age presents us.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) revised its Starlink privacy policy to allow the use of customer data for AI training, a shift that ​could bolster Elon Musk's AI ambitions.\n\nAhead of a blockbuster IPO planned for later this year, ‌SpaceX is in talks to merge with Musk’s AI company, xAI (XAAI.PVT), a deal first reported by Reuters on Thursday. SpaceX, already the ‌world’s most valuable private company, could reach a value of more than $1 trillion after the IPO.\n\nWhat are privacy experts' concerns about Starlink's policy changes?\n\nWhat changes did SpaceX make to Starlink's privacy policy?\n\nHow could the SpaceX-xAI merger impact AI development?\n\nWhat data does Starlink collect from its users?\n\nStarlink updated its Global Privacy Policy on January 15, according to the Starlink website. The policy includes new details stating that unless a user opts out, Starlink data may be used “to train our machine learning or artificial intelligence ⁠models” and could be shared with ‌the company’s service providers and “third-party collaborators,” without providing further details.\n\nA previous version of the privacy policy, an archived version from November and reviewed by Reuters, did not ‍contain language about AI training on Starlink data.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStarlink collects vast amounts of user data, spanning location information, credit card information, contact information and user IP ​addresses. It also collects so-called communication data, which includes audio and visual information, data in shared ‌files, and “inferences we may make from other personal information we collect,” according to its global privacy policy.\n\nThe policy did not make clear exactly what data would be used to train AI. The move has raised concerns among privacy advocates and consumer rights groups, which argue that using personal data to train AI risks expanding surveillance and creates new avenues for misuse.\n\n“It certainly raises my eyebrow and would make ⁠me concerned if I was a Starlink user,” said Anupam ​Chander, a technology law professor at Georgetown University. “Often there's perfectly ​legitimate uses of your data, but it doesn’t have a clear limit to what kind of uses it will be put to.”\n\nMusk's xAI, most recently valued at $230 billion ‍after a recent funding round, ⁠is currently developing its Grok LLM chatbot and also owns X, the social media platform.\n\nThe potential merger with xAI would turbocharge the space company’s deployment of AI-powered services, while giving xAI ⁠vast new data sets to train its models on, including communication data. Starlink, a network of more than 9,000 satellites, ‌currently provides internet connection to more than 9 million users.",

    "description": "Global Entry and Precheck revoked three days after incident, court filing says.",
    "fullText": "Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a declaration filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.\n\nCleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she “observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents” and “maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions.”\n\nCleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of “concern about a local apartment building being raided.” She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until “the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle,” she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.\n\n“An agent exited the vehicle and approached my vehicle,” Cleland wrote. “I remained in my vehicle. The agent addressed me by my name and informed me that they had ‘facial recognition’ and that his body cam was recording. The agent stated that he worked for border patrol. He wore full camouflage fatigues. The agent stated that I was impeding their work. He indicated he was giving me a verbal warning and if I was found to be impeding again, I would be arrested.”\n\nCleland acknowledged that she heard what the agent said, and they drove off in opposite directions, according to her declaration. Cleland submitted the declaration on January 21 in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota residents against US government officials with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Cleland’s court filing was mentioned yesterday in a Boston Globe column about tactics used by ICE agents to intimidate protesters.\n\nCleland said she could “discern no reason why the agents stopped me other than the fact that I was following them.” But on January 13, she received an email notification that her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges for passing through airport security were revoked, she said. Cleland said the revocation appears to be a form of intimidation and retaliation:\n\nI logged onto the Global Entry site and the notification letter indicated that indeed my status had been revoked and that they can’t always disclose the reason. The notification did provide some reasons that my status may have changed and the only one that makes sense was “The applicant has been found in violation of any customs, immigration, or agriculture regulations, procedures, or laws in any country.” I was not detained, I was not arrested so [it is] difficult to understand how I was “found in violation.”\n\nI had been a member of the Global Entry program since 2014 without incident. I am not particularly concerned with the revocation of my privileges in isolation. However, given that only three days had passed from the time that I was stopped, I am concerned that the revocation was the result of me following and observing the agents. This is intimidation and retaliation. I was following Legal Observer laws. I [was] within my rights to be doing what I was doing.\n\nCleland said she and her husband travel frequently, and she is worried that they may encounter problems going forward.\n\n“I am concerned that border patrol and other federal enforcement agencies now have my license plate and personal information, and that I may be detained or arrested again in the future,” she wrote. “I am concerned about further actions that could be taken against me or my family. I have instructed my family to be cautious and return inside if they see unfamiliar vehicles outside of our home.”\n\nCleland said she hasn’t performed any observation of federal agents since January 10, but has “continued to engage in peaceful protests” and is “assessing when I will return to active observations.”\n\nWe contacted the Department of Homeland Security about Cleland’s declaration and will update this article if we get a response.\n\nFederal agents have made extensive use of facial recognition during President Trump’s immigration crackdown with technology from Clearview AI and a face-scanning app called Mobile Fortify. They use facial recognition technology both to verify citizenship and identify protesters.\n\n“Ms. Cleland was one of at least seven American citizens told by ICE agents this month that they were being recorded with facial recognition technology in and around Minneapolis, according to local activists and videos posted to social media,” The New York Times reported today, adding that none of the people had given consent to be recorded.\n\nICE also uses a variety of other technologies, including cell-site simulators (or Stingrays) to track phone locations, and Palantir software to help identify potential deportation targets.\n\nAlthough Cleland vowed to continue protesting and eventually get back to observing ICE and CBP agents, her declaration said she felt intimidated after the recent incident.\n\n“The interaction with the agents on January 10th made me feel angry and intimidated,” she wrote. “I have been through Legal Observer Training and know my rights. I believe that I did not do anything that warranted being stopped in the way that I was on January 10th.”",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees reportedly “checked in” on Dodgers free agent Michael Kopech this offseason, per the New York Post’s Jon Heyman.\n\nKopech entered free agency after spending a majority of 2025 on the injured list with the Dodgers. The reliever began the regular season on the injured list with a shoulder injury and transferred to the 60-day injured list at the beginning of May 2025.\n\nHe returned to the team the following month, but returned to the injured shortly after with a right knee injury. Kopech returned once again at the beginning of September, but re-aggravated his knee injury at the end of the season and missed the postseason.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Sign Brother of Current LA Starter to Minor League Deal\n\nThe right-hander joined the Dodgers at the trade deadline in 2024, switching to the National League from the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThe 29-year-old made an instant impact after arriving with the Dodgers, and became one of their most important weapons out of the bullpen. He had a 1.13 ERA with L.A. in 2024, and maintained a 3.00 ERA during their World Series charge in the playoffs.\n\nEven though he struggled with injury last season, the right-hander still performed will in 2025. He had a 2.45 ERA through 14 appearances with the Dodgers last season.\n\nThe Dodgers have already reinforced their bullpen this offseason so re-signing Kopech is unlikely, but whichever team grabs him will get a high-quality reliever for the upcoming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers World Series Champion Linked to Yankees appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "title": "Want to Support the Fight Against Fascism? Boycott Trump’s World Cup",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. U.S., The Nation’s Justice correspondent urges soccer lovers to stay away, takes on the attacks on Alex Pretti, and warns of a dangerous anti-voting bill.\n\nPeople are finally beginning to call for other countries to boycott Donald Trump’s upcoming World Cup—and not just usual suspects like me and The Nation’s Dave Zirin. Oke Göttlich, a powerful German soccer administrator, said that, in the wake of the execution of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, the time has come to talk seriously about boycotting the tournament. Sepp Blatter, the former head of FIFA (the international governing committee of global soccer) suggested that fans shouldn’t travel to the tournament because of rising safety concerns in the United States.\n\nThis is going to sound weird to non–sports fans, but boycotting the World Cup is one of the most significant sanctions members of the international community can take against the United States right now. The World Cup is the most watched sporting event in the world. The US has been begging to host a tournament for decades. This World Cup, which runs from early June through mid-July, is a perfect opportunity for the world to stand against this country’s fascist regime.\n\nIndeed, the fates have aligned to make this World Cup the perfect one to make a statement—for two reasons. The first is that more countries are involved: The tournament has expanded to 48 teams this year, up from 32 in previous years, which means that more people than ever will be involved in the proceedings—and possible protests. The second reason is that those 48 countries wouldn’t actually have to boycott the entire World Cup, because this year’s tournament is also being hosted by two other countries—Canada and Mexico. Teams could refuse to play in the US while happily playing in Canada or Mexico. It would be a powerful statement.\n\nThat statement won’t come from FIFA, however. FIFA is one of the most corrupt organizations in the entire world, and its current president, Gianni Infantino, was last seen licking Trump’s boots and handing him a “peace prize.” Nor is it likely to come from the powerful soccer-playing countries in Western Europe. If France, Germany, and Great Britain were to pull out of the US portions of the tournament, many other countries would follow—but, sadly, the leaders of those nations appear eager to play Neville Chamberlain to Trump’s Hitler.\n\nTeams from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia could take a moral stand, but there are complications. Some of the teams involved are also run by repressive authoritarians. Others are financially dependent on FIFA and the World Cup to fund their soccer federations, while still others have entire economies beholden to the United States. On the other hand, a lot of those countries damn well know that if they did what the US is doing, they’d be boycotted and sanctioned and probably invaded by white people promising to restore “freedom” in exchange for all their oil and minerals. So it’s at least possible that some of them could take a moral stand. South Africa is in the tournament, and South Africa knows how to handle white people like Elon Musk.\n\nA boycott by all or some of the South American teams would make the whole tournament a joke. We know that the defending World Cup champion, Argentina, with its fascist-curious Trump-puppet president will show up (as will Ecuador, whose president is also friendly with our reigning despot), but some of the other nations that made the field—Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay—could be a different story. Their fans arguably face a real risk if they attend the matches. Could an American fan of, say, Colombia even go to a game without fear of being detained and deported by ICE, regardless of their actual citizenship status? Would a fan of Brazil feel safe traveling to the United States? The US is a clear and present danger to those people. If these soccer federations think about their fans, and the fact that their fans could be targeted by racist DHS agents, they might be convinced to do the right thing and boycott the US portions of the tournament.\n\nThe United States is an international pariah. It should be treated like one. Boycotting the World Cup is the obvious place to start.\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Ho Chi Minh\n\nThe New York Times released a video that purports to show an altercation between ICE and Alex Pretti a week before his murder. The video shows Pretti smashing the taillight of an ICE vehicle before the agents beat him up.\n\nThe Times (and right-wing cultists) seems to think this video proves that Pretti was a violent man who deserved to be executed without trial. Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, who wrote the story for the Times, played the role of ICE water-carrier when he wrote, “The footage adds to what is known about the 37-year-old nurse.”\n\nNo, you fascist-sympathizing fuck, the footage adds to what we know about ICE. In a court of law, that footage could be evidence of the motive behind ICE’s murder of that man. It could be evidence of premeditation. It potentially shows that Pretti was targeted by ICE for retribution and death. If federal agents had a preexisting “beef” with Pretti, if Pretti were known to people in the field and then they killed him, that’s compelling evidence that the killing was intentional.\n\nIt is common in our media to prosecute the victim. That’s what the Times (and Fox and the whole right-wing media echosphere) is trying to do now. But the people who should be on trial here are ICE. You show me a video where violent individuals had a prior altercation with a man, and then days later that man ends up getting shot in the back of the head, and I’m going to tell you that video is evidence of premeditated murder in the first degree.\n\nPerhaps I should tell The New York Times “thank you.” In their effort to smear Pretti, they may have just aggravated the charges against his murderers.\n\nI wrote about how Trump flinched in Minnesota, and that shows that the people are more powerful than the law or the opposition party ever will be.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nLet me be clear, I do not want another social media platform. I can’t handle it. You young people have no idea how hard it is to keep switching up platforms. I’m old, so very old. I can barely frost the thermoplastic polyurethane on my screen protector.\n\nThat said, I will probably UpScrolled is the new competitor to TikTok that has been surging in popularity since TikTok’s US operations were formally taken over by Trump-adjacent business interests this week. It was created by Issam Hijazi, whom Al Jazeera describes as a “Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian entrepreneur.” That’s a pretty big demographic contrast to Larry Ellison, the Benjamin Netanyahu buddy (and, you know, founder of Oracle and one of the three richest people alive) who acquired a large stake in TikTok once it was forced into US hands.\n\nTikTok users are (rightly) worried about censorship on the new TikTok, and a silencing of any views that don’t support fascism and genocide. It’s a valid concern, considering what Elon Musk has done to Twitter. UpScrolled is to TikTok as BlueSky is to Twitter, or so the story goes.\n\nSo I’ll probably join. But I really don’t want to. I don’t want to join anything else. Goddamnit, I miss my Tumblr account.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A man who drove his car into the Chabad Lubavitch world headquarters in New York City had recently been trying to connect with the Hasidic Jewish community and was recorded on video enthusiastically dancing with congregants during a recent visit to the site, police said.\n\nInvestigators were still trying to piece together what prompted the man, Dan Sohail, 36, to ram his car repeatedly into a set of doors at the revered Hasidic Jewish center in Brooklyn on Wednesday night, but police charged him Thursday with attempted assault as a hate crime, based on the fact that the building was a Jewish institution.\n\n“Earlier this month, Sohail attended a social gathering at this very same location,” New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said at a news conference, noting there was video circulating online of that gathering.\n\nThe video appears to show Sohail dancing with Orthodox men inside the headquarters.\n\n“We believe that he was in Brooklyn last night to continue this attempt to connect with the Lubavitch Jewish community,\" Kenny said.\n\nSohail told police that he lost control of his car because he was wearing “clunky boots,” Kenny said, though Kenny added that Sohail had removed several blockades and cleared snow away from a sidewalk before driving into the building.\n\nThe complex at 770 Eastern Parkway includes a synagogue and offices, and was packed with worshippers at the time, but no one was injured. Some of the building’s doors were damaged. No weapons were discovered in Sohail’s car.\n\nSohail's father told the New York Daily News Thursday that his son had been considering converting to Judaism and that he had struggled with “mental problems.” The Forward, a media outlet centered on Jewish issues, interviewed a rabbi in New Jersey who said Sohail attended a Purim service at Chabad last year and visited two other times, looking for spiritual guidance.\n\n“I was able to talk to him for a few minutes and see that he’s not exactly stable,” Rabbi Levi Azimov told the Forward. Another rabbi at a Jewish school in Carteret, New Jersey, where Sohail lived, told the Forward he had dropped by for afternoon prayers on Tuesday but began yelling about feeling let down by Chabad after the service.\n\nThe crash occurred on the 75th anniversary of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson becoming the leader of the Lubavitch movement and prompted immediate concern in the city. Mayor Zohran Mamdani and the city's police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, rushed to the scene to brief the media, with officials announcing increased security around houses of worship across the city.\n\n“This is deeply alarming, especially given the deep meaning and the history of the institution to so many in New York and around the world,\" Mamdani said. “And on today of all days.”\n\nThe Chabad Lubavitch headquarters and synagogue in Brooklyn draws thousands of visitors each year. There is a near constant police presence around the complex.",

    "description": "Some of the world's biggest reinsurers, including Lloyd's of London, are seeking Indian regulatory approval to operate in a low-",
    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest reinsurers, including Lloyd's of London, are seeking Indian regulatory approval to operate in a low-tax city set up in the prime minister's home state ​to try to rival other international financial hubs, two sources said.\n\nThe global companies, which also include South Korea’s Samsung Re, ‌Kenya Re and Spain’s Mapfre Re, will join more than a dozen global reinsurers from Europe, the Middle East and Asia that are turning to the new city to ‌gain access to India's $129.78 billion insurance market, estimated by the industry to be the tenth largest in the world.\n\nThe two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press, said the companies were expected to seek approval this year.\n\nEmail queries sent to Mapfre Re, Samsung Re and Kenya Re were not answered. A Lloyd’s of London spokesperson declined to comment. The companies' plans to ⁠set up operations in the Gujarat International Finance ‌Tec‑City, or GIFT City, have not been previously reported.\n\nThe city offers businesses favourable tax treatment, such as a 10-year tax holiday and exemption from capital gains.\n\nThe government has said it hopes it will rival Singapore and ‍Dubai as an international financial centre.\n\nIndia's reinsurance market is currently dominated by Swiss Re and Munich Re, as well as private firms and the government-owned GIC Re that is widely expected to grow after the government introduced reforms to deepen India's insurance penetration.\n\nSAUDI RE AND OTHERS HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL\n\nA few large ​reinsurers have received approvals over the last year to begin operating in GIFT City. These include Saudi Re, Korean Re, Peak Re, ‌Kuwait Re, Abu Dhabi National Insurance and Kazakh‑based Eurasia Insurance Company JSC, according to regulatory officials and company statements.\n\nSaudi Re earlier this week opened its GIFT City branch, its second in Asia after Malaysia.\n\nKorean Re has said its expansion reflected its commitment to India’s high growth insurance sector, while Hong Kong‑based Peak Re, which received a licence in March 2025, said it plans to offer life and non-life insurance.\n\nAbout 14 global reinsurers operate from GIFT City, managing an annualised $700–800 million in premiums, public disclosures show.\n\nThe number of reinsurers is expected to increase ⁠to at least 20 by the end of March 2026, two regulatory officials ​said, declining to be identified as final approvals are pending.\n\nThey said the international reinsurers ​sought to offer products that are relatively underdeveloped in India, including surety bonds, parametric insurance, marine and shipping cover, cyber risk and health reinsurance.",

    "fullText": "Under-19 World Cup, Super Six Group 2, Bulawayo\n\nEngland 234-7 (50.0 overs): Mayes 53 (70); Reddy 2-28\n\nNew Zealand 169 (38.5 overs): Reddy 47 (65); Lumsden 5-17\n\nManny Lumsden took five wickets as England booked their spot in the semi-finals of the men's Under-19 World Cup with a 65-run over New Zealand.\n\nHampshire seamer Lumsden bowled superbly on a slow pitch at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo to finish with impressive figures of 5-17 as the Kiwis were bowled out for 169 in pursuit of 235.\n\nEngland will play either Australia or Afghanistan in the semi-finals on 3 or 4 February depending on how India perform in their final group game of the Super Six stage against Pakistan.\n\nIndia are currently in second spot with six points but have a superior net run-rate (+3.337) compared to England's (+1.757), with the group winners facing Afghanistan and the runners-up playing the Aussies.\n\n\"It's nice to win and know we are through. We are looking forward to the semi-finals now,\" said England captain Thomas Rew.\n\n\"Manny has been good all tournament. He's bowled quick and been aggressive, having firepower like that is a great asset.\"\n\nEngland compiled a patient 234-7 after being asked to bat first by the Kiwis on a tricky deck.\n\nBen Dawkins made 42 as he and fellow opener Joseph Moores put on 48 for the first wicket to give England a solid platform.\n\nDawkins then shared a stand for the same amount with tournament leading runscorer Ben Mayes, who top scored for England with 53 off 70 balls.\n\nCaleb Falconer (47) and Farhan Ahmed (29) provided some late impetus as Snehith Reddy took 2-28 for the Black Caps.\n\nLumsden did the early damage for England with the ball when he removed the dangerous Hugo Bogue and Kiwi captain Tom Jones in the eighth over.\n\nReddy provided some resistance with a stoic 47 off 65 balls, while Jaskaran Sandhu chipped in with 26 before he became Lumsden's third wicket.\n\nLumsden then returned to wrap up the victory when he bowled Harry Burns and Hunter Shore in consecutive deliveries.\n\n\"It's a great result and I'm really proud of how we stuck at it with the bat. We knew 230 or 240 would be a good score,\" Rew added.\n\n\"It was a tough wicket, very inconsistent, and then the way our seamers bowled was incredible.\"\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

And as per El Crack Deportivo, United have zeroed in on his compatriot as the perfect backup.\n\nRiver Plate’s Lautaro Rivero has emerged as an option for the 20-time English league champions, and they intend to sign him in the summer.\n\nThe Argentine giants are aware of United’s interest in the 22-year-old, and have therefore slapped a €100 million release clause into his contract.\n\nRiver do not want to lose the Argentina international on the cheap, amid interest from Strasbourg, Tottenham, City Football Group, Juventus, and Atletico Madrid.\n\n“Manchester United intend to secure the services of Lautaro Rivero, a key player in Gallardo’s squad.\n\n“River Plate made Rivero sign a €100 million release clause, so if they want to sign him, they must pay a figure close to that amount.”\n\nRivero is already an Argentina international, and could be on the plane to the US for the World Cup if he continues performing as he has.\n\nHe has made 18 appearances for the River Plate first team and can play both in central defence and as a left-back.\n\nDescribed as an “elite” ball-playing defender, it will be interesting to see if United can get a deal for another South American talent over the line.\n\nHowever, it is likely to be for a fee much lesser than what is being quoted in the report.\n\nFeature image Hernan Cortez via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook says a global memory chip shortage is beginning to bite, with rising costs expected to pressure margins ahead.",
    "fullText": "The global memory chip shortage is catching up with Apple, Tim Cook says.\n\nThe Apple CEO said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that Apple is beginning to feel the effects of the memory shortage crisis, with rising prices expected to put pressure on margins ahead.\n\nThe warning comes amid blockbuster demand for Apple's newest products. Customer response to the latest iPhone lineup \"exceeded our expectations,\" with iPhone revenue jumping 23%, Cook said on the call Thursday.\n\nApple reported revenue of $143.76 billion and earnings per share of $2.84, beating analyst estimates.\n\nThe staggering iPhone demand left Apple exiting the December quarter with \"very lean\" inventory, pushing the company into what Cook described as \"supply chase mode.\"\n\nCook said the biggest constraint is the limited access to advanced chipmaking nodes used to produce Apple's system-on-a-chip processors. Higher demand has also reduced flexibility across Apple's supply chain, he said.\n\nMemory shortages played a minimal role in Apple's December-quarter margins, but their impact is expected to grow, Cook added.\n\nThe company expects memory costs to weigh more heavily on margins in the second quarter, contributing to its forecast gross margin range of 48% to 49%. Apple posted a gross margin of about 48% in the December quarter.\n\n\"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.\"\n\nApple's stock price rose about 2% after hours following the results on Thursday.\n\nCook's comments come as the tech industry grapples with a worsening global shortage of memory chips.\n\nAI companies, smartphone makers, and PC manufacturers are competing for the same pool of memory components, which are critical not just for consumer electronics but also for powering large language models and other AI systems. That surge in demand has sent prices climbing.\n\nAt CES 2026 last month, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the memory storage market as \"completely unserved.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nThe Korea Economic Daily reported in January that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are seeking server DRAM price hikes of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Market analysis firm Counterpoint also said last month that memory prices could climb as much as 40% through the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\nThe rapid buildout of AI infrastructure marks a break from the industry's traditional \"boom-and-bust cycles.\"\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",
