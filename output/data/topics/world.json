    "fullText": "Happy Thursday, Dodgers fans. Cactus League play is just around the corner for the Boys in Blue.\n\nAs we await the joy of getting to see World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto return to the mound on Saturday, here are some of the top headlines from around Major League Baseball.\n\nThe reigning back-to-back National League manager of the year was rewarded by the team on Thursday.\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers gave Pat Murphy a three-year extension, ESPN reports.\n\nIn addition to the three years — 2026 through 2028 — the deal also includes a club option for 2029, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reports.\n\nThe trial of Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, who are accused of tipping pitches to bettors in exchange for kickbacks, is likely to move to the fall, Zack Meisel of The Athletic reports.\n\nBoth have pleaded not guilty and are free on bail, though they are on the MLB’s restricted list.\n\nThey were scheduled to have their trial begin in May, though Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto “suggested she’ll ultimately shift the date to the fall,” Meisel wrote.\n\nThose involved were ordered to submit their preferred new trial date by Monday.\n\nIf October is indeed the new trial date, it will be interesting to see if the legal proceedings overlap with the World Series.\n\nInfielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. has made public his intentions to join Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani in an exclusive club that was empty until last season and now only includes the Japanese two-way player.\n\nChisholm told Chris Kirschner of The Athletic that he wants to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a season, which was done for the first time in history by Ohtani just last year.\n\n“Reminded that 50-50 has been accomplished just once in MLB history, he shrugged,” Kirschner wrote. “’You’re looking at the second one,’ Chisholm said.”\n\nThe quest may seem nearly impossible, but Yankees teammate Aaron Judge expressed confidence to Kirschner.\n\n“He really can accomplish anything,” Judge said.",

    "description": "Tokenization allows investors to own a share of a real-world asset — in this case, a loan funding the construction of a Trump property in the Maldives.",
    "fullText": "World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm cofounded and partly run by the Trump family, will tokenize loan revenue interest from a new Trump International Hotel and Resort in the Maldives.\n\nTokenization is the process of putting an asset on the blockchain to turn it into a crypto token that can be easily traded, in this case, a loan used to fund the construction of a hotel. Investors who buy tokenized pieces of the loan will be entitled to a portion of the interest payments made on it.\n\nAccording to WLF documents, DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is owned by the Trump family, reserves the right to receive 75% of the revenue generated from $WFLI token sales after expenses.\n\nThe offering won't be available to everyone. Only accredited investors, or those with at least $1 million in liquid assets and who make enough money per year, will be given access to the tokenized loan. The tokens will be offered in partnership with Securitize, Inc. and Dar Global PLC.\n\nThe Trump hotel in the Maldives is set to open in 2030 and was announced in late 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is listed as \"Cofounder Emeritus\" of World Liberty Financial on its website. His three sons — Don Jr., Eric, and Baron — are listed as cofounders, as is Steve Witkoff, who is currently serving as United States special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial's new tokenization offering is the Trump family's latest move in the crypto space. In January 2025, Trump launched $Trump coin, a meme token that spiked to $45 shortly after launch, and currently trades at $3.40. According to Reuters, the coin made almost $100 million in fees in the first couple weeks after its launch.\n\nWLF also sold a 49% stake in January 2025 to an Emirati royal for $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. The firm launched a stablecoin, USD1, last March.\n\nIn addition, Trump Media and Technology Group adopted a crypto treasury strategy last year, buying billions of dollars in bitcoin. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto had boosted the Trump family's net worth by $1.4 billion as of January 2026.\n\nThe token offering from WLF comes as crypto assets endure a brutal bear market as funds flee the space. Bitcoin's price is down 45% from October's high, while ethereum has fallen 59% since August.",

I'm in a good standing for Saturday and that brings me a lot of confidence, so I am super excited.\"\n\nBorn and raised in the United States to a British father and a Malaysian mother, Atkin has competed for Great Britain her entire career and made an Olympic debut four years ago.\n\nWith her sister and family watching on at Livigno Snow Park, she put in an assured performance to start her Olympic campaign, impressing the judges with the height of her tricks above the 6.7m-high pipe.\n\nCanada's Cassie Sharpe, the 2018 Olympic champion and 2022 silver medallist, qualified third after her first run, but was taken away on a stretcher after a heavy crash on her second.\n\n\"It is nerve-wracking, but it is also nice as you get to see what everyone is doing, so you can strategise a little bit,\" she added.\n\n\"It gives me confidence to know the judges like my skiing, and they're hyped to see what I bring to the finals. I am confident and feeling excited.\n\n\"The pipe is amazing. It is definitely a steep pitch, so it allows for a lot of speed, which is kind of one of my things to go big.\"\n\nHeavy snow fell on Livigno throughout Thursday, causing the men's halfpipe qualifiers to be postponed.\n\nThey will now take place on Friday morning from 09:30 GMT, with Gus Kenworthy and Liam Richards competing for Great Britain.\n\nEileen Gu - the 'snow princess' who divides opinion\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "American superstar Alysa Liu added Olympic figure skating gold to her world title as she beat a standout field in the women's final.\n\nLiu came into the free skate in third place following a couple of errors in the short program, but produced a performance for the ages.\n\nAppropriately wearing a sparkly gold dress and performing to Donna Summer, she scored a staggering 150.20 in her free skate.\n\nIt pushed her to the top of the leaderboard with an overall score of 226.79, narrowly beating Japan's Kaori Sakamoto - who Liu beat to the world title last year.\n\nSakamoto, in her final performance before retirement, won silver with 17-year-old compatriot Ami Nakai claiming bronze.\n\nJapan's Mone Chiba finished fourth, ahead of Amber Glenn - who rose from 13th to fifth after an excellent free skate - while Russian champion Adeliia Petrosian came sixth following a fall.\n\nLiu, 20, becomes the first American Olympic champion in women's figure skating since Sarah Hughes in 2002, and the first USA medallist since Sasha Cohen in 2006.\n\nShe was playing catch up on Nakai - leader after the short program - and Sakamoto after Tuesday night following a mistake on her triple lutz where she failed to fully rotate in the element.\n\nBut there were no mistakes here with a truly showstopping routine that drew deafening cheers from the crowd.\n\nIt was a much needed boost for the USA, as their only gold in singles figure skating following Ilia Malinin's collapse in the men's event.\n\nMalinin was among those in the crowd who gave Liu - the alt girl with her iconic halo hair and lip piercing - a standing ovation as she wrote herself into Olympic folklore.\n\nIt completes a remarkable comeback for Liu, who previously quit the sport aged 16 after missing out on a medal at Beijing 2022.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nSakamoto meanwhile has to settle for silver as her stellar career ends without an Olympic crown.\n\nShe is retiring aged 25 having won three world titles and bronze at Beijing 2022.\n\nHer final performance here was to Non, je ne regrette rien by Edith Piaf, and Sakamoto must have no regrets about a performance in which all 12 elements were given positive grades of execution.\n\nBut it scored five points lower than Liu in the technical elements, with the American's routine judged to have been more challenging.\n\nSakamoto wept as she left the ice, but by the medal ceremony rightly looked delighted with another major honour.\n\nThat initial disappointment was in stark contrast to the joy of compatriot Nakai, who ends a phenomenal debut campaign with an Olympic medal.\n\nThe youngest skater in the competition, Nakai stormed to the top of the leaderboard following the short program and opened her free skate with a triple axel - a brutally tough element she is now making her trademark.\n\nBut Nakai stumbled on her triple lutz, which played a major role in knocking her down below Liu and Sakamoto.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nFor a while, it looked like American champion Glenn might have produced an all-time great Olympic comeback.\n\nShe was down in 13th following a disastrous short program which left her in tears after she missed her triple loop, meaning it was scored zero as an invalid element.\n\nGlenn - who is open about her bisexuality and criticism of USA president Donald Trump - has been a magnet for online backlash, and came out on Thursday in Milan with a point to prove.\n\nDespite suffering a heavy fall in the warm-up she attacked her free skate, including a triple axel to start then a complex triple loop and double axel sequence.\n\nShe punched the air at the conclusion, and even as she missed out on a medal she had the body language of someone pleased to have brought her best to the Olympic stage.\n\nThe same could not be said for Petrosian, who was aiming to be the second Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) of the day to win a medal at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nThe teenager is under the tutelage of controversial Eteri Tutberidze - the coach of Kamila Valieva at the last Olympics - who was rinkside during Petrosian's pre-skate.\n\nBut the 18-year-old's medal hopes were all but dashed on her first routine as she attempted a quad toe loop but fell.\n\nIf she had nailed her complex routine, gold was likely. But instead Petrosian was left stony faced, and she exited the stage quickly when it was confirmed she had missed the podium.",

    "description": "Eileen Gu is the most decorated female Olympic freestyle skier in history, and a global superstar, but continues to divide opinion.",
    "fullText": "Wherever Eileen Gu goes, her fans will follow. Headlines will too.\n\nWith five medals - and the opportunity for one more on Saturday - she is the most decorated female Olympic freestyle skier in history.\n\nBut she is also someone who transcends her sport, a 22-year-old global superstar with a bank balance to make your eyes water.\n\nChina fell in love with its 'snow princess' at the Beijing 2022 Olympics where, as the poster girl of the Games, she duly delivered.\n\nShe became freestyle skiing's youngest Olympic champion with her big air and halfpipe golds at the age of 18, and the first to win three medals at the same Games when she added slopestyle silver.\n\nLater that year, she was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.\n\n\"I just like being the best. I've always wanted to do that,\" said Gu at the Milan-Cortina Olympics, where she has added two more silver medals to her Olympic collection.\n\n\"I wanted to be the best at math when I was in kindergarten, and then I wanted to get into the best high school, and I wanted to have the highest SAT score, and then I wanted to get to the best college, and I wanted to be the best skier I could be.\n\n\"Then I wanted to do every event, and then I wanted to win them all. When you get a taste of it, it's kind of addictive.\"\n\nThe two Chinese-American Olympians competing for rival superpowers\n\nOn and off skis, Gu is a high achiever in every part of her world.\n\nCalifornia-born and raised by an American father and Chinese mother, she attended private school in San Francisco and is currently taking a sabbatical from her studies at Stanford University, where she majors in international relations and previously studied quantum physics.\n\nShe is also fluent in Mandarin, and as a child would spend summers in Beijing.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like I'm carrying the weight of two countries on my shoulders,\" Gu said earlier in the 2026 Games.\n\nIn 2019, at the age of just 15, she switched her sporting allegiance from the US to China, wanting to \"inspire millions of young people in Beijing - my mother's birthplace\" before the 2022 Olympics.\n\nWhatever her reasoning, it was a decision that proved lucrative.\n\nIn December, Forbes ranked Gu as the fourth-highest paid female athlete for 2025, behind only tennis players Coco Gauff, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek.\n\nBut unlike those three, only a tiny amount of her $23.1m (£17.1m) income last year came from prize money from her sport - around $100,000 (£74,000).\n\nInstead, it comes through endorsements with brands such as Red Bull, Porsche and Tiffany & Co, while she has walked the runway for Louis Vuitton and Victoria's Secret and is signed by modelling agency IMG.\n\nIt also emerged in 2025, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, external, that Gu and another athlete were set to be paid a combined $6.6m (£4.9m) by the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau.\n\nIn total, the two athletes were said to be paid nearly $14m (£10.4m) over the past three years by the Bureau.\n\nBut her decision to compete for China was also one that drew much criticism, not just because of China and the US' rivalry as the world's two biggest economies, but because of China's authoritarian Communist Party rulers and its poor record on human rights - which it denies.\n\nWhile the initial furore died down, it has raised its head again at these Games.\n\nAt the start of the Olympics, American freestyle skier Hunter Hess spoke out about the actions of the United States' Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) organisation and ongoing tensions in the US.\n\nIn January, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, 37, and fellow Minnesota resident Renee Good, 37, were both killed by ICE agents in the city, sparking widespread protests.\n\nAsked what it means to represent the USA, Hess said: \"It's a little hard.\n\n\"Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded to Hess' comment by calling him a \"real loser\", and Gu was one of several athletes who publicly defended Hess and others speaking out.\n\n\"As someone who's been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,\" she said.\n\nBut that enraged her critics, given Gu chose to speak out against Trump but has never criticised China.\n\nFormer NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom called her a \"traitor\", adding she \"was born in America, raised in America, lives in America and chose to compete against her own country for the worst human rights abuser on the planet - China\".\n\n\"You don't get to enjoy the freedoms of US citizenship while acting as a global PR asset for the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote on X.\n\nWhen asked about China's human rights record by Time magazine, external, in an interview published in January, she answered: \"I'm not an expert on this.\n\n\"I haven't done the research. I don't think it's my business.\"\n\nGu has 2.6m followers on Instagram, has amassed 11.7m likes on TikTok, and at the Livigno Snow Park high up in the Italian Alps, no athlete has more fans in attendance.\n\nClad in the red colours of China, they line the front of the fan areas, flags adorned with images of Gu's face pegged to the fences, and celebrate her every run like it has clinched Olympic gold.\n\nAfter every run, the ever-driven and disciplined Gu seeks out her mother, Yan, to review video footage on her phone. Yan, reportedly a successful venture capitalist who brought her daughter up single-handledly, is accredited at the Games and is the first person Gu celebrates her successes with.\n\nDuring Monday's big air final, Yan was seen watching alongside former International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach.\n\nAfter competitions, Gu is the one every media outlet wants to speak to, and she gracefully and politely obliges as she slowly shuffles through the mixed zone.\n\nBut it was from a press conference earlier this week that her remarks to a journalist went viral, when she was asked if she felt her two silver medals were actually two golds lost.\n\n\"I'm the most decorated female freeskier in history. I think that's an answer in and of itself,\" she replied.\n\n\"How do I say this? Winning a medal at the Olympics is a life-changing experience for every athlete. Doing it five times is exponentially harder because every medal is equally hard for me but everybody else's expectations rise, right?\n\n\"So the two medals lost situation, to be quite frank with you, I think is kind of a ridiculous perspective to take.\n\n\"I'm showcasing my best skiing, I'm doing things that quite literally have never been done before so I think that is more than good enough. But thank you.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to the Games, Gu did interviews with the likes of Vogue and Time magazine, but it was reports in the Swiss media, external that had the potential to further fuel a competitive rivalry at the top of the sport.\n\nIt was reported that the coach of Swiss skier Mathilde Gremaud left her team to join Gu's on the eve of the Games, just as he had four years earlier before Beijing 2022.\n\nAt those Games, Gremaud pipped Gu to slopestyle gold, while Gu won the big air title with Gremaud taking bronze.\n\nThis time around, Gremaud again won slopestyle gold, with Gu taking silver, while the Swiss star withdrew from the big air after a crash, with Gu going on to finish second again.\n\nBefore that big air final and as a result of reaching it, Gu had taken to Instagram to highlight a scheduling issue.\n\nIt meant, as the only woman competing in three freeski events, she would miss a full day of halfpipe training. After appealing to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) for another opportunity to train, she said she had been turned down.\n\n\"This decision is disappointing to me because it seems to contradict the spirit of the Games,\" she said.\n\n\"Daring to be the only woman to compete in three events should not be penalised. Making finals in one event should not disadvantage me in another.\"\n\nBBC Sport understands Gu had already been handpicked as one of 10 athletes - five men, five women - invited to a halfpipe testing training session, while having three official training sessions is more than the usual two held before World Cups.\n\nIn a statement, FIS told BBC Sport: \"For athletes who choose to compete in multiple disciplines and/or multiple events, conflicts can sometimes be inevitable.\"\n\nSo serious is Gu taking these Olympics that she has brought 21 pairs of skis with her to Livigno, seven per event. Asked by BBC Sport how many she would normally take to a competition, she replied two or three.\n\nIn the halfpipe training she did do she looked in imperious form, and qualified for Saturday's final in fifth place, with Great Britain's Zoe Atkin, also a Stanford student, topping the standings.\n\n\"My sixth Olympic final. I am proud to have a 100% success rate,\" Gu told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It is not an easy thing to do. The Olympics brings out the best and worst in people.\n\n\"Being able to withstand that pressure is something I am really proud of.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Keely Hodgkinson has broken the long-standing women's indoor 800m world record, set by Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak on the day the Briton was born almost 24 years ago.\n\nOlympic champion Hodgkinson crossed the line in one minute 54.87 seconds in Lievin, France, taking almost one second off Ceplak's time of 1:55.82 which had endured since 3 March 2002.\n\n\"Thank god. That was really fun, I was really looking forward to this,\" Hodgkinson told the crowd, before being adorned with a golden crown as she took her place on a throne beside the track.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who broke the rarely contested 600m record during her previous indoor season three years ago, joins triple jumper Jonathan Edwards as the only British athlete to hold a current world record in one of the sport's championship events.\n\nHodgkinson was primed to target the indoor 800m record at her eponymous Keely Klassic event in February last year, before her ambitions were ruined by the first of two serious hamstring injuries that season.\n\nSpeaking before Thursday's event, Hodgkinson said that Lievin was not just about the world record \"but seeing how fast we can really go\", after bettering her own national record by almost one second at the UK Indoor Championships on Saturday.\n\nJoined on the start line by Ethiopia's Olympic silver medallist Tsige Duguma and Switzerland's Audrey Werro, who Hodgkinson replaced as the fastest woman this year, Poland's Anna Gryc was tasked with setting a pace of 55.8 seconds through halfway.\n\nAhead of schedule after a 55.56-second first 400m, Hodgkinson strode off the front and never appeared in danger of losing touch with the green wavelights representing the record time on the inside of the track.\n\nAfter the desperate lows of her first year as the reigning Olympic champion, Hodgkinson has come out firing in her second.\n\nThe world record appeared to be on borrowed time after Hodgkinson opened her season with a 1:56.33 clocking in Birmingham five days ago.\n\nShe made no secret of her ambition to surpass Ceplak's mark on a notoriously fast track in Lievin following that statement performance, saying: \"I feel like it is my record to break.\"\n\nIt left Ceplak and Austrian Stephanie Graf, who set her best time in finishing runner-up to Ceplak's world record run in Vienna, as the only athletes ahead of Hodgkinson on the all-time list.\n\nThat mark had remained a controversial one ever since Ceplak, and indeed Graf, later served two-year doping bans.\n\nBut, 12 days short of her birthday, and the latest anniversary of Ceplak's record, Hodgkinson took down the record to which she has long attached a sense of destiny.\n\nHodgkinson became known as 'Keely 2.0' among her M11 training group, such were the developments she made in strength and power during her time spent in the gym recovering from two hamstring tears in 2025.\n\nThose significant setbacks, though challenging both physically and emotionally, did not prevent her from making the world podium in September following a 376-day wait to race as Olympic champion.\n\nWith an uninterrupted winter training block behind her - the \"healthiest\" she says she has had \"in a long time\" - Hodgkinson signalled in devastating fashion that she is ready to make up for lost time.\n\nAfter she won BBC Sport's Personality of the Year following her crowning moment at Paris 2024, Jenny Meadows, co-coach of the M11 training group alongside husband Trevor Painter, said an attempt at the sport's oldest world record would naturally follow once the indoor best was captured.\n\nIt is close to 43 years since Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova set the outright world 800m record by running 1:53.28 in July 1983.\n\nOn this evidence, it may not be long before Hodgkinson, who has world indoor, European and Commonwealth honours to target this year, writes further history.\n\n\"She's absolutely obliterated that world record... What better way to head on to the world indoors,\" British former 400m athlete Allison Curbishley said on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"A world indoor medal has eluded Keely in the last five years, so it's something she's desperate to get in Poland in a few weeks' time.\"\n\nRenee adds to Regis legacy with first UK title\n\nHodgkinson eyes world record after breaking British mark",

    "fullText": "NASA’s new boss blasted Boeing and the space agency Thursday for Starliner’s botched flight that left two astronauts stuck for months at the International Space Station.\n\nAdministrator Jared Isaacman said poor leadership and decision-making at Boeing led to Starliner’s troubles. He also blamed NASA managers for failing to intervene and get Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back more quickly.\n\nThe two test pilots, now retired from NASA, spent more than nine months at the station before catching a lift back with SpaceX last March.\n\nIsaacman said Starliner’s problems must be better understood and fixed before any more astronauts strap in.\n\nIn a sweeping and emphatic move, Isaacman upgraded the seriousness of Starliner's troubled astronaut debut, declaring it a “Type A mishap,” something that could endanger a crew. Both the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters also involved cultural and leadership missteps. It is a mistake that Starliner was not designated a serious mishap right from the start, Isaacman said, citing internal pressure to keep Boeing on board and flights on track.\n\n“This is just about doing the right thing,” he said. “This is about getting the record straight.”\n\nThruster failures and other problems almost prevented Wilmore and Williams from reaching the space station following liftoff in 2024. The thruster analyses continue by Boeing.\n\n“We almost did have a really terrible day,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, referring to a potential loss of life.\n\nNASA issued its 312-page Starliner report while conducting a second fueling test of its moon rocket at Kennedy Space Center. Hydrogen fuel leaks spoiled the first dress rehearsal earlier this month and stalled astronauts' first flight to the moon since 1972.\n\nBoeing said the findings will help the company move forward in ensuring crew safety, and stressed that the Starliner program would continue. Time is running out as NASA proceeds toward decommissioning the space station in 2030, although Isaacman, a self-financed space traveler, foresees “endless demand” for multiple pathways to orbit once private outposts are booming.\n\nThere is no timeline for when Boeing can launch Starliner on a supply run, essentially another test flight to prove its safety before astronaut flights. The grounding leaves SpaceX as the only U.S. taxi service for astronauts.\n\n“Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team,” Boeing said in a statement.\n\nEven before the troubled astronaut flight, Boeing was struggling with Starliner issues. The first test flight in 2019, without anyone on board, ended up in the wrong orbit and forced a repeat mission, which had its own difficulties.\n\nNASA hired Boeing and SpaceX in 2014, in the wake of the space shuttles’ retirement, to ferry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Their contracts are worth billions. SpaceX just delivered its 13th crew to the space station for NASA since 2020.\n\nKshatriya said the space agency must do better moving forward.\n\n“We have to own our part of this,” he said. As for Wilmore and Williams, “We failed them.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "In 2020, Microsoft announced a moonshot commitment to become carbon negative by 2030 — accelerating work across our company to advance the partnerships and technologies needed to advance sustainability for our businesses, our customers and the world. A key milestone on this journey was our aim to match 100% of our annual global electricity consumption with renewable energy(1) by 2025. Today, we are pleased to share that Microsoft has achieved this milestone(2). This progress helps drive investment into the power systems where we operate, expand clean energy supply and advance broader energy innovation.\n\nWhat began in 2013 with a single 110 megawatt (MW) power purchase agreement (PPA) in Texas — a small first step to demonstrate how corporate procurement could scale clean energy(3) — has evolved into one of the largest clean energy portfolios in the world. This first deal not only supported Microsoft’s early cloud services but also set in motion a decade of commercial partnerships and learning-by-doing that served to demonstrate how corporate demand for advanced energy solutions can help to achieve a more affordable and sustainable power system, while supporting reliability for customers.\n\nSince our carbon negative announcement in 2020, we have contracted 40 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable energy supply across 26 countries, working with more than 95 utilities and developers across 400+ contracts and counting. To put that amount in perspective — that’s enough energy to power about 10 million US homes. Of that contracted volume, 19 GW are now online, delivering new clean energy supply to the power grid, while the remainder are slated to come online over the next five years.\n\nOur new renewable energy procurement continues to deliver significant environmental benefits, including the reduction of Microsoft’s reported Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 25 million tons(4) and the mobilization of billions of dollars’ worth of private investment in regions where we operate.\n\nMicrosoft is among the early pioneers in developing technical and commercial practices that help advance bankable, repeatable and scalable procurement tools suitable for each market. Our clean energy purchasing navigates a global patchwork of power market designs, requiring creativity in how we balance cost, time to market and project sizing in our portfolio across planning, contracting and management.\n\nOur work has benefited from a broad coalition of partners helping to build this market together. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more than 200 global corporations collectively purchased nearly 200 GW of clean energy around the world since 2008. Working alongside other clean energy buyers — as well as hundreds of utilities, manufacturers, financiers, developers and engineers — we have helped reduce transaction costs, expand developer access to financing and streamline procurement approaches that other buyers can adopt.\n\nThis global flywheel of partnership, investment, technology and policy innovation is expected to continue to facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of investment into infrastructure and jobs. And as we’ve seen repeatedly, when Microsoft sends a clear market signal for world-class, first-of-a-kind technologies and infrastructure, the power sector rises to the challenge. Our procurement over the past decade has demonstrated that partnerships, communities and innovation are essential ingredients that help to accelerate first-of-a-kind technologies and infrastructure at scale.\n\nCritical to Microsoft’s success in expanding digital infrastructure and supporting our local communities is our ability to build trusted partnerships with the over 95 global energy suppliers that support our clean energy portfolio. We have sourced clean energy through multiple requests for proposal or information, bilateral engagements and clean tariffs to evaluate over 5,000 unique carbon-free energy projects around the world.\n\nToday, Microsoft has six energy company partners with which we have over 1 GW of contracted renewable energy capacity, and more than 20 energy supplier partners where each partner has at least five separate renewable energy projects with Microsoft — evidence of the durable, repeatable relationships necessary to scale clean energy. Combining scale with speed, Microsoft’s landmark 10.5 GW framework agreement with Brookfield sends a long-term, 2030 demand signal to the market that enables developers to raise funding more efficiently, bolster supply chains, hire engineers and construct world-class energy infrastructure.\n\nOur renewable energy procurement has mobilized billions of dollars in private investment, supported thousands of jobs across the communities where we operate and delivered meaningful co-benefits. Through partnerships with developers and nonprofit organizations, we’ve worked to embed community-driven benefits into our energy portfolio. These benefits include robust infrastructure, economic inclusion and support for community-focused organizations.\n\nOur support for communities shows up in projects like our 500 MW PPA with Sol Systems, or our 250 MW PPA with Volt Energy Utility that provided local training and jobs, as well as grants to community nonprofit organizations and habitat restoration. We’ve also signed over 1.5 GW of distributed solar, bringing clean energy directly into hundreds of communities around the world. Landmark agreements like our 500 MW offtake with Pivot Energy, or our 270 MW offtake with PowerTrust are expected to foster employment, energy cost savings and grid resilience in communities across the United States, Mexico and Brazil. More details on the above examples and our approach to community benefits in clean energy agreements can be found in a dedicated Microsoft whitepaper.\n\nMicrosoft’s clean energy procurement continues to play an important role in catalyzing technical, commercial and regulatory innovation. Our commercial efforts have helped lower barriers to entry into new markets and expand access into multi-technology contracts that accelerate decarbonization.\n\nIn Japan, Microsoft signed one of the first corporate PPAs in the country’s restructured power market. Our 25 MW, 20-year agreement with Shizen represents the first single-asset virtual PPA executed in the country, which helped pave the way to over 2GWs of corporate procurement since 2024, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Alongside opening new markets, we have structured several multi-technology offtakes in nascent markets for corporate procurement. In India, Microsoft purchased a combined 437 MW solar/wind hybrid offtake from Renew, where our projects will support energy access and rural electrification. In Microsoft’s home state of Washington, our datacenters in Douglas County are supplied by 100% carbon-free energy, as we leverage a creative blend of new wind power and hydropower storage to deliver around-the-clock clean energy.\n\nIn 2025, the International Energy Agency (IEA) described a new “Age of Electricity,” marked by accelerating electricity demand from electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centers and heat pumps. As the world electrifies more of the economy, the demand for affordable, reliable and clean electricity will continue to rise.\n\nOur experience building Microsoft’s clean energy portfolio both reflects and furthers global trends. According to IEA data, since 2000, renewable energy generation has expanded nearly four-fold. In many power markets across the world, clean energy is one of the fast-growing sources of generation, and often the one with the fastest time-to-market. Corporate buyers like Microsoft continue to serve as an important catalyst in driving commercial demand for innovation and infrastructure across the power industry.\n\nAs we continue our journey toward becoming carbon negative by 2030, Microsoft will continue to push for an expansive focus on adding all forms of carbon-free electricity solutions, complementing and adding to our portfolio of renewable energy resources. We recognize that the world’s rising electricity needs require a balanced, all-of-the-above decarbonization strategy to meet global economic growth and environmental goals, and our sustainability goals will continue to support this approach moving forward. Such a strategy requires a broader set of carbon-free energy and grid-enabling technologies, including nuclear energy, next-generation grid infrastructure and carbon capture technology. Just as renewable energy was a relatively small part of global energy grids in 2013 when we signed our first PPA, today many advanced energy technologies remain early in their development but offer significant promise to accelerate progress towards an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy future.\n\nMicrosoft has already taken early steps to support the advancement of a broader set of carbon-free energy technologies as we partner with Helion and Constellation Energy on a 50 MW fusion project in Washington state and work with Constellation to restart the 835 MW Crane Clean Energy Center in Pennsylvania. Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund has allocated $806 million of capital to 67 investees, with 38% directed toward Energy Systems — advancing carbon-free power and fuels, energy storage and energy management solutions.\n\nWe welcome continued collaboration with our power sector partners to bring these innovations to market and incorporate new technology tools in the process to accelerate their development.\n\nWe will continue to build and leverage new AI-driven tools to design, permit and deploy new power technologies that help expand and more efficiently operate the electricity grid, bringing more clean energy online faster. This work is exemplified by our recently announced collaborations with Idaho National Laboratory and the Midcontinental System Operator, among other examples.\n\nAnd as we advance innovative energy technologies, we recognize that standards must evolve alongside innovation. That is why we will continue participating in industry forums that strengthen carbon accounting frameworks — so that our clean energy procurement is measured with greater accuracy and delivers real world emissions reductions, with a continued focus on maintaining the high level of integrity that the world has come to expect from Microsoft.\n\nOur carbon negative commitment remains a call to action — for Microsoft, our customers and the broader technology sector — to invest in an affordable, reliable and sustainable power system. As we look toward 2030, that call to action has never been clearer.\n\nToday’s milestone represents a shared achievement among the utility professionals, clean energy developers, community leaders, technology innovators and forward-thinking policymakers who continue the deployment of renewable energy. Meeting today’s milestone shows what partnership can deliver in bringing big ideas to life. The future of carbon-free energy is one that we will create – together.\n\nAs Microsoft’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Melanie Nakagawa leads the company’s targets to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. She brings deep experience at the intersection of policy, business, and technology to advance climate and sustainability solutions globally.\n\nAs President of Cloud Operations + Innovation at Microsoft, Noelle Walsh leads the organization that powers the global Microsoft Cloud. She oversees the company’s physical cloud infrastructure and operations, with a charter focused on safety, security, availability, sustainability, and competitive infrastructure growth—bringing decades of global operational leadership.",

    "fullText": "The streaming boom that fueled a ton of production in the last decade-plus is gone, and lots of the remaining work is going overseas. No one really knows how AI will affect the movie and TV business, but there's lots of fear it won't be good. And barring something truly surprising, Warner Bros., one of Hollywood's most important movie and TV studios, is going to get swallowed up in the next year or so, which will mean even more consolidation.\n\nBut don't take it from me: Ask Janice Min, who has spent a couple decades enmeshed in Hollywood. First as the editor of the Hollywood Reporter, and now as CEO of The Ankler, an industry trade built for the Substack Age.\n\nThat means she's not a disinterested observer at all: If the center of the movie and TV industry is shrinking, that's bad news for the advertising, subscriptions, and events businesses she's trying to build.\n\nI talked to Min about all of that on my Channels podcast, and you can listen to the whole thing here. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation.\n\nPeter Kafka: If you had to bet right now, who wins the newly reopened bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery?\n\nJanice Min: Doesn't it really depend if Netflix decides they're going to step it up? So far, it seems like they will. But Netflix is a pretty ruthless company: Season two isn't working out, it's not driving as many subscribers as season one, your show is canceled. Or cofounder Reed Hastings' famous \"keeper test\": You aren't performing well. You're out.\n\nAnd shareholders are not loving this pursuit of Warner Bros. At some point, they will cut it off. They're a very pragmatic company.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that Netflix would really like this deal, and that Paramount has to have this deal. Do you agree?\n\nI do. If you're David Ellison and you've assembled probably the most expensive leadership team in history, you are prepping to have Warner Bros. David Ellison was not prepping to have the seventh-biggest studio or the seventh-biggest streamer.\n\nIn the end, if he doesn't have that, you're kind of left holding the bag that nobody wanted. How do you win?\n\nYou are holding the thing that Shari Redstone was desperately trying to get rid of.\n\nThat's important context. This battle is so interesting to me because Warner Bros. is such a stinker, with so much debt, that they are being forced to sell. They had no other outcome. Paramount was such a stinker that Shari Redstone couldn't get the stink off of her fast enough. And there was basically, in the end, one bidder [for Paramount].\n\nThat one bidder is now one of two bidders for the other thing. We get caught up in the excitement that these are huge prizes, but they're just these debt-stuffed, slow-moving beasts that need to have someone who has an emotional attachment to them for them to make sense as a buyer.\n\nAfter Netflix won the first bidding round in December, there was an immediate negative reaction from Hollywood. What's the current vibe when it comes to Netflix vs. Paramount as WBD's future owner?\n\nI think for most people it's Sophie's Choice. There are two potential bad outcomes here.\n\nOn the plus side for David Ellison: People love that he loves movies.\n\n\"I love movies. You guys make movies. I'm gonna make more movies. You should work with me.\"\n\nIt's not a sophisticated business argument, but everyone here has dollar signs spinning in their eyes, everyone's looking for the next deal for themselves. So they like that. Perhaps David Ellison will pay and maybe even overpay for what you are making. And it's exciting that it'll create a big buyer in the market.\n\nThe flip side of that is, Hollywood is not a particularly pro-Trump industry. I don't think they like a lot of the things they are seeing happening at Paramount right now, like the situation that happened with Stephen Colbert and James Talarico. They certainly don't like what's happening with CBS News.\n\nFundamentally, though, it does come down to your bottom line. The industry is struggling. People are having a hard time having the careers they had 10 years ago. So people like the idea of a buyer with deep pockets, even if it's daddy's money.\n\nThere is a steady stream of stories and social media posts about how AI is going to disrupt Hollywood. How much of that concern do you see reflected in day-to-day conversations?\n\nThe thing with AI right now in Hollywood: Everyone's lying just a little bit. Studios are lying about how much they're using it.\n\nCompanies are lying about the capability of their products. And for creative people, they're lying about the fact that they're not using it. I dare you to find a screenwriter who is staring at a blank page and not talking to Claude or ChatGPT at the same time.\n\nIt seems clear that it's going to be a big deal for people working in visual effects, and that was already a challenged industry.\n\nI have a friend who's been sending me LinkedIn posts that are showing up in his feed, and it is so grim. It's people largely who have worked in VFX, and they are posting this full-on bleed out, like \"I will be homeless by next Thursday if I don't have work.\"\n\nIt doesn't appear they're being hyperbolic.\n\nI guarantee that every single studio, every single streamer, they are all completely doing this. During last year's Oscar race, [there was a controversy about] \"The Brutalist,\" and how Adrian Brody's voice was made more Hungarian-accented through technology.\n\nThis year, it is crickets. Even the Academy, the most precious, legacy-protecting institution in Hollywood, has not come out in a really firm way about AI. They basically have a don't ask, don't tell policy. I would say with some certainty that every single best picture nominee this year has used AI in its production process.\n\nWhat's the story people outside Hollywood are missing about your industry right now?\n\nYou look at LA and you think it's sunny and amazing and people are happy. People are having a hard time here. The unemployment rate of Los Angeles is much higher than the national average.\n\nYou're seeing a city that is so big and sprawling, with a kind of rudderless feeling: Who's going to stop this? There is definitely a Detroit vibe underway if things don't course correct.\n\nAnd you're seeing a paralysis: Hollywood used to be a place that had a lot of protests, spoke out, was always fighting the so-called man. And it is pretty much crickets now, because everyone is scared.\n\nI was struck by the fact when you saw the Grammys, you have these musicians getting up on stage, — Billie Eilish, Bad Bunny — and really sticking it to the president and ICE. And you compare that with the Golden Globes, where it was sponsored by Polymarket, and no one's saying anything.\n\nWhen you think about how to capture young people, who are the pipeline for everything — they love this culture of rebellion and revolt and speaking out. I worry about Hollywood containing itself so much to the point that it stops speaking to the audience.",

I'm not expecting it to be easy and nor do I want it to be easy,\" said the 37-year-old Wood.\n\n\"I actually feel better when I'm going through it and then I get the victory.\"\n\nHe holds a record of 28 wins and four defeats, with 17 of those victories coming by knockout.\n\nNottingham-born Wood - who has built a reputation in recent years for his heavy hands and consistent threat inside the ring - insisted he was not underestimating Warrington either.\n\nHis victory over the 35-year-old in October 2023 remains one of the most memorable all-British fights of recent years.\n\nWarrington appeared to be edging the action in Sheffield through his work-rate and pressure, before Wood unleashed a powerful right hand in the seventh round to force a stunning stoppage.\n\nLeeds-born Warrington described that as a \"fantastic\" punch but promised to make the necessary adjustments this time to change the outcome.\n\n\"I can't see what Leigh's going to do differently,\" he said.\n\nWarrington, whose record has 32 wins in 37 bouts, with four defeats and a draw, is a two-time IBF featherweight champion, while Wood held the WBA featherweight crown in 2023.\n\nBut much has changed since their first meeting as both men have suffered setbacks against Anthony Cacace. Warrington briefly retired after his loss to the Belfast fighter in September 2024 before deciding to return.\n\n\"I mourned my career a little bit then decided to continue because I felt I had more than enough to do some things in this sport,\" he said.\n\nWith careers hanging in the balance, there is a growing sense defeat could spell the end for either man, and even the winner might also call it a day.\n\nAlso on the undercard in Nottingham will be an exciting women's contest as Derby-born Sandy Ryan challenges Mexico's Karla Ramos Zamora for the vacant WBC world super lightweight title, while Bilal Fawaz meets Ishmael Davis for the British light middleweight crown.\n\nHeavyweight Dave Allen returns to action against Karim Berredjem, former UFC standout Molly McCann continues her transition to professional boxing, and teenage prospects Leo Atang and Tiah Huyton also feature.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Hayes is also benefitting from the strong passing ability of both Doncic and LeBron James, averaging a career-high 77.2% from the field, as the duo has helped him find easy looks inside the paint.\n\nAs long as Hayes can continue to play the pick-and-roll well with Los Angeles' ball-handlers, he'll have the opportunity to be effective in the Lakers' offense.\n\nThat said, at 7' 0\", Hayes could be a bit better defensively, having never averaged one block or \n\nEither way, it appears Hayes could be a Laker for many seasons to come.\n\nDoncic and Hayes will return to action following the All-Star break Feb. 20 against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nLonzo Ball calls himself the 'scapegoat' following trade from Cavaliers\n\nSpurs' Mason Plumlee deal foreshadows another move to come\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo praises Kon Knueppel: 'One of the smartest rookies I’ve ever seen'\n\nCarter Bryant reveals what happened on final dunk attempt\n\nTyrese Maxey: 'I feel a lot less out of place' after second All-Star appearance\n\nKon Knueppel speaks after third-place in three-point contest",

    "fullText": "The old saying \"Everything is bigger in Texas\" now applies to data centers.\n\nThe Lone Star State is on track to unseat Virginia as the world's largest data center market by 2030, new research from Jones Lang LaSalle shows.\n\nThe shift indicates how drastically the data center development boom has reshaped the US's digital infrastructure map and the landscape as a whole. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta plan to spend more than $600 billion on AI infrastructure expansion in 2026 — a number so dizzyingly high that Wall Street is on high alert for signs of an AI bubble.\n\nMore than half of all data center construction in the US now happens outside the industry's traditional hubs, according to JLL's North America Data Center Report — Year-End 2025. Tennessee, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas are now considered the top emerging markets for data centers.\n\nTexas alone has 6.5 gigawatts of data center capacity under construction.\n\nThat amount of power is roughly equivalent to more than three Hoover Dams or over 17,000 Tesla Model 3s when using the US Department of Energy's standard, and it accounts for about one-fifth of the 35 gigawatts of data center capacity the US added to its pipeline.\n\nThat 35 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of the UK or Italy, and adding it would nearly double the existing data center capacity in the US, according to JLL.\n\nPart of Texas's appeal is its sprawl.\n\nThe state houses some of the most ambitious data center projects in the country. Oracle and OpenAI's flagship Stargate data center is in Abilene, Google is planning a $40 billion expansion in West Texas, and Meta is building a massive new site in El Paso, just to name a few.\n\nTexas also has abundant energy resources, which is good news for data center developers. The AI boom has driven electricity demand to new heights and strained the nation's power grid. In Texas, several data centers — including Stargate — are being built alongside on-site power plants.\n\nNorthern Virginia has been the data center industry's central hub for more than 15 years, going back to the early days of cloud computing. That has changed rapidly as Big Tech spreads out across the country in search of available power, cheap land, and the best tax incentive packages for the coming wave of AI data centers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Global markets' pecking order could be shifting.\n\nThat's the fear being voiced by more investors in recent months as doubts swirl around American exceptionalism — the idea that investors can expect better returns on US assets relative to international markets.\n\nThe US's dominance in global markets has been the historical precedent, but talk about America losing its edge has been rising over the past year as investors take stock of risks like higher inflation, more debt, and increasing geopolitical tensions.\n\nMore investors also appear to be turning their attention to other areas around the world, particularly as the US stocks battle continued selling pressure.\n\nHere are two stats that illustrate how the US could already be losing its edge.\n\nThe S&P 500's year-to-date performance is lagging behind the MSCI World Index by the most in at least 30 years, the bank said, citing its historical analysis since 1995.\n\nThe US has already been lagging global markets for the past year, hedge fund manager Rob Citrone noted when speaking to CNBC about his outlook for US markets this week. In the year leading up to last Friday, he said that the gains in dollar-based assets have been the weakest when compared to 19 other markets around the world.\n\n\"The US is 20th out of 20,\" Citrone said, adding that gains in the US market fell around 30% short of the gains in emerging markets in the last year. \"That's a significant difference.\"\n\nInvestors around the world are swapping their holdings of US-based stocks for emerging markets at the fastest pace since 2021, according to Bank of America's survey of global fund managers in February.\n\nOn average, global investors reduced their position in US stocks by around 20 percentage points compared to their position the prior month. US stocks were the category that investors shifted away from the most, while the eurozone and emerging markets were among the top five areas where investors increased their positioning.\n\nTalk about \"Sell America,\" or investors shifting away from US assets, has picked up in recent months as markets eye potential headwinds, like hotter inflation and higher deficits in the US.\n\nFamed fixed-income investor Jeff Gundlach said last month that he was steering clear of the US entirely, and that he believed \"all\" investors should have exposure to non-US stocks in non-dollar currency.\n\nRon Temple, the chief market strategist for Lazard's advisory and asset management business, said in December that 2025 marked the last year of American exceptionalism, as he expected investors to continue shifting away from the US due to concerns about higher inflation and debt levels.\n\nCitrone added that he thinks the US market will continue to underperform the rest of the world, and that he was short US assets while betting on other markets, like Mexico.\n\n\"Most people are going to move some money from the US,\" he told CNBC earlier this week.",

A 50,000-square-foot data center that pops up in your neighborhood is a lot harder to ignore.\n\nIt's not just their sheer size that's tangible. The cost of these data centers, both economically and environmentally, is very real.\n\nThat's why Business Insider embarked on an investigation to better understand these data centers' impact. That work just earned us a very prestigious award.\n\nThe investigation was a full newsroom effort, with multiple reporters, editors, videographers, and designers chipping in. From environmental implications to complex financing to neighborhood drama, we covered the topic from all angles.\n\nWe've also got an incredible video and interactive map worth checking out.\n\nWinning an award doesn't mean our work is done.\n\nBig Tech companies keep ramping up their spending. Amazon and Alphabet recently announced plans to spend $200 billion and $185 billion, respectively, on AI infrastructure this year.\n\nNew states are also vying for data-center business, threatening traditional hubs like Northern Virginia.\n\nFinancing these deals is becoming increasingly complex and exotic, ranging from 100-year bonds to various types of securitization. In short, it's not just tech companies carrying the risk for these massive bets.\n\nYou can even include yourself in that group if you've noticed your utility bill went up recently.\n\nIt's still not entirely clear if these companies' AI efforts will eventually pay off.

    "description": "As a club coach with Arsenal, Juventus and Lyon and an international coach with Australia, Joe Montemurro has experience of pressure from both sides as he talks to BBC Sport.",
    "fullText": "As a club coach with Arsenal, Juventus and Lyon, and an international coach with Australia, Joe Montemurro has experience of pressure from both sides.\n\nThe recent flurry of club managerial sackings in England has highlighted the volatility of elite coaching.\n\n\"You only see from the outside,\" reflects Montemurro.\n\n\"I think clubs now have a lot of short-term processes that they have to achieve instead of having long-term visions and that puts a lots of pressure on coaches from day one - because sometimes, you've got to fix cultures, you've got to fix structures, you've got to fix organisational processes before you can start getting the results.\"\n\nMontemurro suggests time is a precious commodity.\n\n\"The nature of what we do means we don't have time anymore. It's a high-pressure scenario - results aren't just about winning matches.\n\n\"It's fan engagement, it's commercial, it's money, it's economics, it's all the other 'side dishes', if you want to call it that.\"\n\nFrom 2017-2021 Montemurro was head coach of Arsenal Women. In 2021, he managed Juventus' women side, before becoming the first non-French manager at eight-time Women's Champions League winners Lyon in 2024.\n\nAfter winning league titles at all three clubs, Montemurro was appointed the Matildas head coach in June 2025.\n\n\"It's been an interesting transition,\" he tells BBC Sport from Australia. \"You're used to the day-to-day contact with players and staff, the excitement of games coming quickly.\n\n\"In international football there are little gaps between tournaments and windows that give you more time to reflect and work on other areas.\"\n\nMelbourne-born Montemurro's international journey is about to accelerate. The Women's Asian Cup begins on 1 March in his homeland, with the final set to be staged at Stadium Australia in Sydney - the same arena where Australia's men lifted the trophy in 2015 when Ange Postecoglou led the Socceroos to a 2-1 extra-time victory over South Korea.\n\nThe Matildas are chasing a second Asian Cup crown after a penalty shootout final win over North Korea in 2010 - a tournament where a 16-year-old Sam Kerr scored her first two international goals.\n\nHosting the Asian Cup comes at a pivotal moment for women's football in Australia, building on momentum generated by the Fifa Women's World Cup 2023, which the country co-hosted with New Zealand.\n\nFifa president, Gianni Infantino described that tournament as the \"best and greatest and biggest\" in history with a record-breaking near two million tickets, external sold and an average attendance of about 30,000 fans per match.\n\nThere will be an exodus from the Women's Super League (WSL) with 13 of Australia's 26-player squad currently playing in this country, underlining the depth of Australian influence in England's top flight.\n\nMontemurro understands the tension that creates for clubs.\n\n\"The timing is never perfect,\" he adds. \"I've been in that position when you lose players. It's unfortunate. But one thing clubs sometimes forget is that it's an honour for these players to represent their country.\n\n\"These tournaments don't come around often. For the Australian players, it's a home tournament - the opportunity to do well in that is exciting.\"\n\nMontemurro accepts there are \"pros and cons\", particularly as the WSL season reaches decisive months, but believes most clubs \"now plan for such absences\".\n\nJapan have called up 16 players from the WSL for their squad, including Ayaka Yamashita, Aoba Fujino and Yui Hasegawa from WSL leaders Manchester City.\n\nPlayers will travel around 21 February to prepare for the tournament which runs from 1-21 March.\n\nShould Australia reach the final, English-based players will miss two WSL games and an FA Cup fifth-round match.\n\nArsenal trio Caitlin Foord, Steph Catley and Kyra Cooney-Cross are heading to the tournament, and, should Australia progress to the quarter-finals, Chelsea will be without striker Kerr and defender Ellie Carpenter for their League Cup final against Manchester United, which takes place on 15 March at Ashton Gate in Bristol.\n\nMontemurro has also backed Manchester City forward Mary Fowler to return to fitness for the tournament, despite playing only 15 minutes since rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in April 2025.\n\nThe full list of WSL players in Australia's Asian Cup, external squad:\n\nCharlize Rule (Brighton and Hove Albion)\n\nEmily van Egmond (Leicester City)\n\nAlanna Kennedy (London City Lionesses)\n\nKaitlyn Torpey (Newcastle United)\n\nClaire Hunt (Tottenham Hotspur)\n\nMontemurro is also clear the women's game in Australia must raise its professional standards.\n\nA recent report, external from the Players Football Association in Australia highlighted low average salaries of A$30,000 (£15,500) in the domestic women's league, with around 63% of players working second jobs.\n\n\"There are minimum standards that all professional leagues are ascertaining,\" says Montemurro, 56. \"We need to make sure we adhere to those standards.\n\n\"There's really no excuse from my perspective. There should be the minimum standards of proper 12-month contracts, pay that's relative to a professional contract [and] all the benefits that come with that.\n\n\"But also the environments that clubs adhere to in terms of their minimum standards - the proper medical, the proper technical, tactical analysis, everything that a professional sporting organisation should have.\n\n\"I think the biggest question is to understand what are the minimum standards from a worldwide perspective that we should be achieving in Australia. We must adhere to those.\"\n\nRecent FIFPRO research, external shows the 2026 Women's Asian Cup could generate up to US$82.4m (£61m), potentially making it the tournament's most commercially successful edition. Yet, the current prize pool remains $1.8m (£1.3m) - unchanged from four years ago and just 12% of the men's equivalent.\n\nAsked if that should increase, Montemurro adds: \"Totally. If national organisations are investing substantially in travel, tournaments and preparation, the prize pool should reflect that.\n\n\"If we're serious about these being major tournaments, there needs to be an incentive to take part.\"\n\nThe Women's Asian Cup will stage matches in Perth, Gold Coast and Sydney.\n\nPerth's 60,000-seat stadium will host the opener on 1 March as Australia face the Philippines, while the final will be played in Sydney at the 79,500-seat Stadium Australia on 21 March.\n\nAustralia are among the favourites, alongside two-time winners Japan, but China are the reigning champions after winning their ninth title in 2022.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "Jos Buttler's form is a concern but Will Jacks and Sam Curran have shown promise. What to make of England's unconvincing start to the World Cup?",
    "fullText": "England‘s group stage at the T20 World Cup was a mixed bag - some good but overall unconvincing.\n\nSam Curran and Will Jacks have provided reasons to be positive but Jos Buttler‘s tricky start is a concern.\n\nWe have taken a look into the numbers behind his struggles and the other themes of England’s first four matches…\n\nScores of three against both Italy and Scotland mean Buttler made only 53 runs across the group stage – a low return for one of England's key men.\n\nThe 35-year-old has had a quiet winter with no fifties in 15 international innings across all formats, though a 97 not out in the SA20 in January casts doubt on those writing him off entirely.\n\nButtler's dismissals against Italy and Scotland were almost identical.\n\nLooking for his first boundary from his fourth ball, he miscued a length ball in the off-stump channel to mid-off.\n\n\"Maybe he is trying too hard to get a score on the board,\" said Buttler's former England team-mate Dawid Malan.\n\n\"The last two innings he has played, he has tried to hit the ball over mid-on.\n\n\"Knowing him and playing with him, his gameplan is generally to look to the off side first and then pick up leg side, so maybe he's just going back to his basics.\n\n\"I don't think we have to worry.\"\n\nAll three of his dismissals against pace, including nicking off against Nepal seamer Nandan Yadav, have come against balls clocked between 75-82mph.\n\nSince the start of 2024, Buttler has struggled against pace bowlers in that bracket more than any other – with an average of 35.8 and a strike-rate of 129.\n\nPerhaps more concerningly, given the tournament now returns to the turning tracks of Sri Lanka, his average against spin in T20 internationals has dropped to 24.1 since 2024 from 61.8 across the two years prior.\n\nButtler's other dismissal in this tournament came against Roston Chase's off-spin.\n\nEven with making 202-7 against Italy, there remains a feeling England's batting is yet to fully fire at this tournament.\n\nThey posted 184-7 against Nepal, were bowled out for 166 by West Indies and wobbled when chasing 153 in their victory over the Scots.\n\nThe problem has not been batters getting in.\n\nEnglishmen have reached 25 runs 14 times so far – the most of any team in the competition – but only four of those knocks have been converted into fifties. No England player has made a score above 75.\n\nWill Jacks rejected the notion this is due to batters failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Responsibility in T20 can be misunderstood,\" he said. \"Sometimes the responsibility is to try and hit 30 off the over.\"\n\nMalan believes The Hundred may be having an impact.\n\n\"There's more emphasis on the first 10 overs now, so if you lose wickets in those first 10 overs then it makes it harder towards the end, but you still need to keep going,\" he said.\n\n\"I used to always worry more about the second 10 overs, so it was about setting things up and then being able to get to that 180 or 190-mark, if the score and wicket dictated it.\n\n\"A lot of these players are playing in The Hundred which is less balls, meaning you have to keep going earlier, and it doesn't really teach you to soak up the pressure for an over or two.\"\n\nCaptain Harry Brook has now got out against spin in three innings in a row after beginning the tournament with 53 against Nepal.\n\nThis is a familiar issue for Brook, who averages 47 against pace in T20 internationals since the start of 2024 but only 23.5 against spin.\n\nBrook's struggles are curious, given his stunning 136 not out on a turning pitch in a one-day international in Sri Lanka last month.\n\nThe return to Sri Lanka for the Super 8s may help Brook because in India he is averaging 20.5 in T20s.\n\nCould Harry Brook struggle in that department then?\n\n“It has probably been his weakness but, saying that, when you bat at four, five or six in T20 cricket and you're walking in at the ninth or 10th over, the majority of balls you are going to face are spin,” Malan said.\n\n“If he is out there for eight overs and he is facing six overs of spin, there is a high chance he's going to get out against spin after starting against spin.\n\n“He changed his technique at the beginning of the year to become better at spin.\n\n“He keeps his bat on the floor for longer whereas he used to stay up.”\n\nOne of the positives of this World Cup so far has been Jacks' promising returns as England's finisher.\n\nHis 39 not out from 18 balls in the four-run win over Nepal was crucial – so too his maiden T20 international fifty against Italy from the tricky position of 101-5.\n\nJacks only took on the finishers' role at the start of last summer but is faring well compared to others before him.\n\nJacks' bowling is more of a concern, however.\n\nWith leg-spinner Adil Rashid, plus two left-arm spinners in Liam Dawson and Jacob Bethell, in the squad, Jacks' bowling role is more significant given he turns the ball in the other direction as an off-spinner.\n\nIt is problematic for England that his six overs have cost 83 runs with two wickets in return.\n\nJacks has struggled most when being swept, conceding 31 runs from eight sweep shots in the group stage.\n\nThough his average amount of turn is only down slightly, 3.5 degrees in the pre-tournament series in Sri Lanka compared to 3.3, Jacks is drifting the ball far less - 1 degree compared to 1.7 degrees in Sri Lanka.\n\nSam Curran came through twice when England were under the most pressure during the group stage.\n\nAgainst Nepal, he successfully defended 10 from the last over.\n\nWhen Italy and Grant Stewart were flying in Monday, Curran stopped the runs and then dismissed the right-hander.\n\nCurran, who was out of favour until September last year, has taken on the role of England's death bowler to good effect.\n\nHe has been especially effective with yorkers – going at 5.07 runs per over with a full length at the death, compared to 14.14 with anything shorter.\n\nCurran is often credited with having a canny mix of slower balls but he has largely kept his pace above 80mph in those crucial final stages.\n\nMore significant has been his control of line…",

    "description": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat",
    "fullText": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US quietly funded a global effort to keep the internet from splintering into fiefdoms run by authoritarian governments. Now that money is seriously threatened and a large part of it is already gone, putting into jeopardy internet freedoms around the world.\n\nManaged by the US state department and the US Agency for Global Media, the programme – broadly called Internet Freedom – funds small groups all over the world, from Iran to China to the Philippines, who built grassroots technologies to evade internet controls imposed by governments. It has dispensed well over $500m (£370m) in the past decade, according to an analysis by the Guardian, including $94m in 2024.\n\nThen came Doge, Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency, tasked with reducing the size of US government agencies and initiatives. Career employees who staffed Internet Freedom resigned or were sacked in 2025 as part of larger reductions. Many of its programmes were cut permanently; its main granting office issued no money in 2025. The Open Technology Fund (OTF), a nonprofit that works with the government to direct roughly half of this money, won a lawsuit to get some of this funding restored in December; the Trump administration is now appealing against that ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration this January withdrew from the Freedom Online Coalition, a global alliance set up by the US to defend digital rights.\n\nThe cuts risk curtailing technologies that helped Iranians to coordinate during recent anti-government protests, and that allowed videos and images of massacres to reach the outside world. They could have a major impact in other nations too; the efforts of groups in Myanmar to get past the junta’s “digital iron curtain”, and the ability of users in China to avoid surveillance.\n\n“The programme was effectively gutted,” said a former US official. “They didn’t issue any grants this year.”\n\n“I would like to live in a world where a single US programme is not such a linchpin, such a load-bearing programme, but it has been. It’s hard to deny it has been,” said one digital rights expert based in Europe who has worked on a number of projects for Internet Freedom.\n\nTo report this story, the Guardian spoke to 10 people with knowledge of Internet Freedom, including six of its grantees, and reviewed documents related to its operations and budget.\n\nThe US Department of State has been approached for comment. The OTF declined to comment.\n\nThe purpose of the programme was to make it extremely difficult to do what North Korea has accomplished through decades of censorship efforts, and what Iran succeeded in doing this January during a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests: cut an entire population off from the global internet.\n\nThe US aimed to circumvent this by funding groups capable of building and harnessing technologies that evade such restrictions and censorship. These include familiar tools, such as the encrypted messaging service Signal and the Tor browser, which allows users to be anonymous online.\n\nThey also include far more powerful tools. Advanced circumvention technologies can make it possible to get past even extremely powerful censorship regimes – to leap the firewall in China, for example, or to obtain international news in Iran even when mobile phone networks are out, through methods like satellite datacasting, in which data is broadcast in a similar way to television signal.\n\nAnother technology has allowed Iranians to securely communicate during recent anti-government protests, alerting each other to shootings and police presence, even as the rest of the internet has been cut off.\n\nThe soft-power aim behind this was to keep the internet as it is: mostly accessible, mostly a global commons. The groups it funded made censorship costly and difficult. “When you challenge censorship, the long-term effect is that oppressive governments must either open their internet, or to go in the direction of North Korea,” said the former US official.\n\n“But because each of those options is costly for them, they’ll keep trying to censor their networks so as to have the economic benefits of the internet without the drawbacks of freedom of speech and access to information. So the fight continues.”\n\n“Internet Freedom funded the development of many of the censorship-circumvention technologies that millions of people around the world depend on to maintain a link to the outside world,” said Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who works closely with many of these groups.\n\nTheir makers are “often operating on a shoestring and passion. They believe in the cause. There’s no fancy offices, they’re working out of their apartments. It’s not a moneyed industry.”\n\nMost recipients of this money keep it quiet; it’s a dangerous thing, in some places, to take state department funds. But even as the funds run out, more and more organisations – journalists, activists, and civil society – are seeking out these technologies, and the groups that build them. Censorship regimes are getting worse worldwide.\n\n“It’s a massive blow. The need is bigger and other funding is also gone. Organisations that provide these tools are being overwhelmed,” said the digital rights expert. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\nSome of the groups working on these technologies have laid off staff; others are continuing without pay. A few hold out hope that some money can be restored – although they fear that the Trump administration might more overtly politicise its aims. While a recent appropriations bill contains a budget line for Internet Freedom, it names no specific programmes as recipients of this cash.\n\nOthers say they’re existing in a brief grace period as the rest of the funds run out.\n\n“Everybody’s just waiting right now, to be honest. But at the same time, wait at your own risk,” said an Iranian technologist funded through Internet Freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, censorship tech is growing cheaper and easier to access. Chinese companies have exported sophisticated middleboxes – devices that sit on network cables and allow authorities to monitor internet traffic – to countries across Africa and Asia in the past year. These allow regimes such as Iran’s to fine-tune their control over the domestic internet – allowing commerce to continue, for example, while communication is throttled.\n\nSeveral recipients of the US money expressed hope that Europe might fund these technologies in the future; some have already petitioned EU officials for funding.\n\nThe cuts “make it easier to build a ‘digital iron curtain’. It makes it easier for the Kremlin to put Russians in a digital information bubble that reinforces specific narratives about people outside of Russia. This makes it easier for China to do this. For Iran to do this,” one said.",

    "description": "Cade Smith will not be competing in the 2026 World Baseball Classic, instead focusing on the Cleveland Guardians' upcoming season.",
    "fullText": "Three years ago, before Cade Smith made his Major League debut or even threw a pitch for the Cleveland Guardians, he had the opportunity to compete for his home country of Canada in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\n\nSince then, Cade has established himself as one of the best high-leverage relievers in MLB, and for the first time in his career, enter the season as Cleveland’s closer.\n\nHowever, Smith is not playing for Team Canada in the 2026 WBC. It was a decision that he recently told Foul Territory was his own as he heads into\n\n“It was my decision [to not play in the WBC], Cade said.\n\n“In ‘23, it was a phenomenal experience. Like, that was my first experience pitching in major league stadiums in front of sold-out crowds and that kind of environment. I had so much fun and enjoyed that. So, just this year, being at, kind of where things are architecturally, I didn't feel that it was wise for me to take that time away. I wanted to make sure that I was here and completely present and focused on the year coming up.”\n\nThe 2026 season will be Smith’s last year on a minimum MLB contract before his arbitration eligibility next winter. Considering that through his first two years, Smith has a 2.42 ERA, 0.95 WHIP, and 17 saves under his belt, he is in line for quite a large payday, even in his first year in the arbitration process.\n\nThat inevitable payday is contingent on one thing, though: health.\n\nSmith has pitched in 150 games through his first two big-league seasons. That’s a heavy workload for any pitcher in MLB, let alone one with an average fastball velocity of 96.4 mph.\n\nIt’s hard to blame Cade if he didn’t want to compete in the WBC because of this high workload, and solely focus on the upcoming season.\n\nPerhaps three years from now, in the 2029 WBC, Cade will get another chance to rep Candada, but for now, he’s concentrated on the Guardians.\n\nGuardians Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA star Enes Kanter Freedom piled on to the often-conservative criticism of freestyle skiing great Eileen Gu on Wednesday.\n\nGu, whose mother is Chinese, was born in San Francisco but is representing China for the second straight Winter Olympics.\n\nPolitics: Trump's Latest Epstein Denial Has Critics Asking New Questions\n\nShe has earned China two silver medals in the Milan Cortina Games with the halfpipe up next. She won two golds and a silver in 2022. She has vaulted to international fame as an athlete and sometimes a model, reportedly earning tens of millions of dollars a year ― a chunk of which she has received from the Chinese government.\n\nBut as in the last Winter Olympics, Gu has gotten heat for her choice, though it should be noted that several U.S.-born athletes compete for other countries. Brazil’s Lucas Pinheiro Braathen, who was born in Oslo but has a Brazilian mother, has been widely celebrated during the Games for representing a country other than his birthplace. Gu’s defenders have suggested that racism and Sinophobia are factors in why she is being treated differently.\n\n“I’m just going to say it. She’s a traitor,” Freedom told Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday. “She was born in America. She was raised in America, lives in America, and chooses to compete against her own country for, literally, the worst human rights abuser on the planet, China. She built her fame in a free country, and then chooses to represent an authoritarian regime.”\n\nKanter Freedom: Eileen Gu Is a traitor. She was born in America and chooses to compete against her own country. pic.twitter.com/gAh4YbrFpt\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) February 18, 2026\n\nThe former center, who played for the Utah Jazz, New York Knicks and other teams in the NBA from 2011 to 2022, added “Freedom” to his name when he became a U.S. citizen in 2021. The former Turkish citizen was outspoken against the Turkish government and had his passport canceled by the country in 2017. He often speaks out against human rights abuses in China.\n\nBefore the Games, Gu defended her choice to represent China.\n\nPolitics: Money And Power Converge As CBS Becomes Trump State Media\n\n“The U.S. already has the representation,” Gu said, per Newsweek. “I like building my own pond.”\n\nShe also dismissed speculation that she chose China because the financial windfall was potentially greater.\n\n“I’m glad that there’s enough money in the sport now for people to think that’s a consideration,” Gu said.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nEven Vice President JD Vance weighed in about Gu’s decision, starting off diplomatically but eventually throwing some shade her way.\n\nAsked by Fox News’ Martha MacCallum on Tuesday if the status of the San Francisco-born athlete should be “changed,” the veep replied: “Well, look, I have no idea what her status should be. I think that’s ultimately up to the Olympics Committee. I won’t pretend to wade into that.”\n\nPolitics: Homeland Security Flack Tricia McLaughlin Set To Leave Trump Administration\n\n“I certainly think that somebody who grew up in the United States of America, who benefited from our education system, from the freedoms and liberties that make this country a great place, I would hope that they want to compete with the United States of America,” he added.\n\n“So, I’m going to root for American athletes, and I think part of that is people who identify themselves as Americans. That’s who I’m rooting for this Olympics,” Vance said.\n\nFox News Host Asks Vance If U.S.-Born Olympian Should Lose ‘Status’ Skiing For China\n\nOlympian's *** Confession Spreads To Another Sport In Wild 'Late Show' Send-Up\n\nItaly Taunts U.S. In Oh-So-Familiar Style After Winning Speedskating Team Event",

Gymnast Carlos Yulo won two gold medals at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAnd now Alpine skier Tallulah Proulx has become the first female athlete from the Philippines to compete in the Winter Olympics — and at 17, the youngest ever from the Southeast Asian country.\n\n“This is a new era for the Philippines and sports on the global stage and I really am grateful that I get to be a part of it,” the U.S.-born Proulx said as she finished 50th in the slalom at the Milan Cortina Games on Wednesday after carrying her country’s flag during the opening ceremony.\n\nShe was 52nd in the giant slalom.\n\nProulx grew up skiing at the Sierra Tahoe resort in California, then moved at age 7 to Iowa and raced at tiny Sundown Mountain before moving on Colorado and then settling in Park City, Utah, where she now resides.\n\nProulx’s father is from the Eastern Samar province in the Philippines’ Eastern Visayas region.\n\n“And I have a lot of relatives, family back there and honestly the response has been so heartwarming,” Proulx said. “Filipinos are just such warm and welcoming people. … I think that’s what makes us really strong and I’m so grateful that I get to be the first Filipina because I show that others can follow in my footsteps and hopefully get more involved into winter sports, which I know is quite hard in the Philippines.”\n\nProulx was slated to visit the Philippines for the first time a few years ago before her trip got canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, she has emersed herself in the country’s culture, thanks to her grandmother.\n\n“Me and my brother grew up with her cooking — all of course the delicious Filipino food and sharing her culture,” Proulx said. “Unfortunately, last year she passed away. … I really wanted to push for this and wanted to represent such an important part of my heritage, both for her and for myself.”\n\nIn Cortina, Proulx traded pins with American slalom standout Paula Moltzan and got a picture with slalom gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\n“It’s amazing being around these people that I’ve looked up to my whole life,” she said, “and then realize I’m skiing that course next.”\n\nNext up for Proulx: a trip to the Philippines.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Feb 18 (Reuters) - Chinese and Indian tourists are set to make up for a potential slowdown in growth from U.S. travellers to Europe ‌this year, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Travel Commission, ‌with international arrivals to the continent set to rise by 6.2%.\n\nThis is the first sign of a slowdown ​in the post-pandemic boom in American travel to Europe, driven by a strong U.S. dollar and economic resilience in North America.\n\nAn earlier study from industry group the European Travel Commission showed that Americans were less intent on travelling to Europe in 2026 than in 2025, a ‌trend driven by worsening economic concerns ⁠and geopolitical instability.\n\nWhile Chinese arrivals to Europe are set to rise by 28% compared to 2025 and Indian arrivals to climb by 9%, ⁠traveller numbers from the Americas were seen growing by just 4.2%.\n\nAccording to data from aviation intelligence platform Cirium, bookings from Europe to the U.S. between October 7 and end January fell ​14.2% year-on-year, ​while bookings from the U.S. to Europe slid ​7.3%.\n\nDespite a tempering of interest from ‌core American travellers, Europe is still seeing a steady rise in both long-haul travellers and in spending, showing that tourists who still want to come are more focused on high-value experiences that can keep the European travel market steady.\n\n\"Europe continues to stand out as a reliable destination, well-positioned to respond to evolving demand for more flexible travel and experience-led ‌journeys,\" said Miguel Sanz, head of the European ​Travel Commission, in a statement.\n\n\"Particularly encouraging is the fact ​that growth in traveller spending is ​outpacing that of arrivals, allowing destinations to focus more on value than ‌volume.\"\n\nTravel spending in Europe is set to ​have risen by 9.7% ​in 2025, according to the new report.\n\nThat is in line with reports from Europe's major carriers, including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, of a steady rise in ​bookings for their premium offerings, ‌while economy cabin bookings for transatlantic travel have fallen.\n\nAir France-KLM reports its full-year ​results for 2025 on Thursday.",

    "description": "The ‘Ain Braq aqueduct, which runs through the Jabal al-Madhbah massif into Petra, was even more sophisticated than scientists previously believed.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe ‘Ain Braq aqueduct, which supplied water to ancient Petra, was thought to have only one conduit, or channel, until the recent discovery of a second one.\n\nAlthough most of the lead pipe is no longer present in the conduit, its former extent can be inferred by matching its imprint to still-extant lead pipe fragments in the area.\n\nLong and narrow, this pipe was most likely used as an inverted siphon, with water passing through a header tank before it flowed through to a series of reservoirs.\n\nThe importance of finding water supplies in a harsh desert climate is a central theme in Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction novel Dune (and in its latest film adaptation by Denis Villeneuve). Rising from dusty sands and carved out of red sandstone, Jordan’s ancient city of Petra is reminiscent of the desert landscapes and stone edifices of Herbert's faraway science-fiction desert planet. But Petra already had aqueducts and water systems thousands of years ago that were far ahead of any on fictional Arrakis—so no one in Petra ever needed a stillsuit to survive.\n\nPetra was an urban hub of the ancient world despite its location in a semiarid climate that brought hardly any rain. It stood as the capital of the Nabatean kingdom until it became part of the Roman province of Arabia in the early 2nd century C.E. As an important administrative and trading center, Petra needed water for purposes beyond keeping its people alive. Its hydraulic systems filled baths, kept gardens and agriculture thriving, gushed from a sacred fountain known as a nymphaeum, and filled up basins in temples, sanctuaries, and tombs. Now, on the abandoned city’s southeast edge, archaeologists have discovered that the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct running through the Jabal al-Madhbah massif into Petra was even more sophisticated than they previously believed.\n\nAs part of a 2023 excavation conducted as part of the Urban Development of Ancient Petra project, a research team led by Niklas Jungmann of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin studied the system that brought water into Petra. These included cisterns, basins, a reservoir with a dam, and the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct. In the course of their research, Jungmann and his team discovered something that the aqueduct had been hiding for millennia. It featured not just one, but two different main conduits that kept water flowing into Petra. Researchers had long known about the first channel lined with terracotta pipes to carry water into the city. What the researchers didn't expect was to unearth the imprint of a second conduit that once held a pressurized lead pipeline supplying water to basins and reservoirs on az-Zantur hill.\n\n“The discovery of numerous water structures on the plateau directly above the rock slopes with the presumed aqueduct channel and the dam, raised broader questions about the engineering and chronology of this area,” Jungmann said in a study recently published in Levant. “As [the existence of a second conduit] was not mentioned in prior research, examining how the aqueduct entered the city became a primary research objective.”\n\nMeasuring roughly 380 feet (116 meters) in length, the newly-discovered pipeline used a welded metal pipe that was made of lead and encased in mortar. Further evidence that the Nabateans used a lead pipe in the second conduit includes its significantly larger diameter compared to the terracotta pipes found in the area, and the regular surface of the imprint it left behind in the underlying stone, as opposed to the irregular surface imprint typical of channels that held terracotta pipes. A later excavation backed this hypothesis when Nabatean conduit blocks were discovered during a survey of the city center. In the hardened mortar was section of lead pipe, whose imprint texture and dimensions matched those of the earlier find and left no more doubts about the overall composition of the aqueduct’s second main conduit.\n\nJungmann concluded that such a long and narrow lead pipe was probably used as an inverted siphon within the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct. It was buried in concrete to transport water beneath the city, bypassing obstacles on the surface. Water in the system would have flowed through a header tank before entering the aqueduct’s two conduits. Previously, one theory posited that the conduit could have taken a detour to supply water to another part of the city before arriving at its destination. However, the conduit was found to head west, probably to reach the reservoirs of az-Zantur hill. A detour would have not even been viable, since only an uninterrupted pipeline that generates enough internal pressure can allow water in a siphon to run from the header tank to the basin or reservoir it was meant to fill.\n\n“Overall, this study underscores the potential for further research into Nabataean water management,” said Jungmann. “While some hypotheses about the aqueduct’s two branches into the city have been proposed above, more fieldwork is required in order to provide a fuller understanding of the distribution system and its evolution over time.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Spanish football expert Guillem Balague details how Vincius Jr has become a global symbol of resistance against discrimination.",
    "fullText": "Spanish football expert Guillem Balague was at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon on Tuesday as Real Madrid's Champions League play-off tie at Benfica was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius Jr reported alleged racist abuse.\n\nIt marked the 20th time Vinicius alleges he has been the subject of abuse during his eight years at Real Madrid.\n\nHere, Balague gives his perspective and details how the 25-year-old forward has become a global symbol of resistance against discrimination.\n\nFootball should have been revelling in a masterpiece last night - Vinicius scoring a goal so outrageous it deserved to dominate every headline.\n\nInstead, once again, the sport was dragged into the same rancid swamp it never seems able to climb out of: alleged racism, denials, excuses and a staggering lack of understanding from those who should know better.\n\nVinicius has been here before many, many times. In fact, he has now faced 20 incidents of alleged abuse.\n\nThe latest accusation is that Benfica's Argentine midfielder Gianluca Prestianni racially abused him minutes after that wonder goal.\n\nPrestianni denies the allegation. Vinicius has been backed strongly by a number of his team-mates, in particular Kylian Mbappe who told the media he heard a racist term used five times.\n\nAfter the game, Benfica boss Jose Mourinho effectively blamed the player himself for provoking the situation.\n\n\"These talents are able to do these beautiful things, but unfortunately was not just happy to score that astonishing goal,\" he told Amazon Prime Video Sport. \"When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.\"\n\nHe then went on to claim that Benfica couldn't possibly be a racist football club for the simple reason that its greatest-ever player Eusebio was black.\n\nMourinho's comments mark a new low, but are nonetheless indicative of the media debate - particularly in Spain and today clearly in Portugal - that remains stuck in the same place.\n\n\"Yes, they insult him, but he should behave better,\" seems to be the constant refrain.\n\nAs if you could separate one thing from the other. As if they weren't part of the same process.\n\nWhen Vinicius confronts the stands his attitude is interpreted as arrogant and inappropriate.\n\nBut that reaction is said to stem from the same source as his protests against racism: a constant struggle against a hostile environment.\n\nFrantz Fanon said in his influential 1952 book Black Skin, White Masks: \"The Black man has to fight twice as hard to be accepted as a man.\"\n\nPerhaps for Vinicius this burden translates into anger, tension and gestures that, from the outside, seem excessive.\n\nBut seen from within, they could be viewed as pure survival.\n\nWhen the Spanish press demands that Vinicius limit himself to \"playing and keeping quiet,\" it points to what the American sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva called \"racism without racists\" - cultural frameworks that don't directly insult, but blame the affected person for their reaction.\n\nVinicius has become a global symbol of resistance against discrimination as he strives to get the authorities to toughen their protocols and actions.\n\nWhat is Uefa's racism protocol and is it working?\n\nThe hostility towards Vinicius is real - and it has names, dates and court sentences.\n\nThe latest incident at the Estadio da Luz marks the 20th time he has allegedly been abused in his time with Real Madrid.\n\nHe has been insulted in stadiums across Spain. He has testified in court after a black mannequin wearing his shirt was hung from a bridge.\n\nHe has seen fans being sanctioned with suspended sentences for racist abuse in Valencia and Mallorca. This was largely thanks to La Liga's efforts to ensure those actions do not remain unpunished within a judicial culture that long treated football's \"industrial\" language and \"banter\" with indulgence.\n\nA chronology of some of the incidents suffered by him makes for depressing reading.\n\nBack in October 2021 during a Clasico at the Camp Nou, a fan shouted racist abuse at him as he was being substituted. The case was closed because the police were unable to identify the perpetrator.\n\nThen in March 2022, Mallorca fans made monkey noises towards him and told him that he should \"go pick bananas\".\n\nThe authorities were \"outraged\" and said it was \"despicable\" but not \"criminally significant\". No action was taken.\n\nOn the Spanish football programme El Chiringuito, Pedro Bravo, the head of the Spanish Football Agents' Association, suggested Vinicius should \"stop acting like a monkey\" and respect his opponents.\n\nHe later apologized on X, claiming he had \"badly used the expression... in a metaphorical way to mean 'fooling around'\".\n\nThe comment caused outrage, especially in Brazil. No further action was taken.\n\nIn September 2022, Atletico Madrid fans chanted racist abuse outside the stadium. Prosecutors did not file charges.\n\nA doll wearing Vinicius' jersey was found hanging from a bridge in January 2023. Four members of the supporters' group Frente Atletico were sentenced to prison terms of between 14 and 22 months, which were later commuted to fines and restraining orders.\n\nFurther incidents followed over the next few months, all of which led to little or no repercussions for the perpetrators.\n\nIf there was a turning point it occurred in Valencia at the Mestalla in May 2023, when Vinicius confronted the stands after being insulted.\n\nLater, in extra time, he was sent off after an argument with Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili and for punching Hugo Duro in the face.\n\nIn June 2024, three fans were sentenced to eight months in prison and two years of stadium bans for their part in the abuse. It was the first sentence of its kind in Spain.\n\nWhen he returned to Mestalla in March 2024 he was met by a chorus of boos. His response? Two goals, celebrated with a raised fist.\n\nSometimes he doesn't even have to be at the match to suffer the racial taunts.\n\nEleven days after the Mestalla return, racist abuse towards him was chanted before a Champions League match between Atletico Madrid and Inter. Real Madrid reported the incident to the hate crimes prosecutor's office.\n\nThen five days later, at Osasuna's ground shouts of \"Vinicius die\" were heard.\n\nOn 29 September 2024, four people were arrested for inciting a hate campaign on social media under anonymity to insult the player during the derby against Atletico Madrid.\n\nMost recently, this February, during the Copa del Rey semi-final against Real Sociedad, referee Jose Maria Sanchez Martinez paused the match through Spain's anti-hate protocol.\n\nThis was due to chants against another player, but the cameras also captured a fan making monkey gestures towards Vinicius during the stoppage. The club broadcast announcements over the PA system and LED screens rejecting xenophobic chants.\n\nOnly last month, during Alvaro Arbeloa's debut as Real manager against Albacete in the Copa del Rey, a group of their fans hurled racist insults at the Brazilian.\n\nLa Liga strongly condemned the incident, reaffirming its support for the player.\n\nPerhaps you might wonder why Vinicius continues to react and fight? He gave an answer in June 2024 after the racists who abused him in Valencia were sentenced to jail term.\n\n\"Many people asked me to ignore it, others said that my fight was in vain and that I should just 'play football',\" Vinicius said in a post on X.\n\n\"But, as I've always said, I'm not a victim of racism. I am an executioner of racists. This first criminal conviction in Spanish history is not for me. It's for all black people.\"",

    "description": "The four-time world champion previously claimed the new F1 regulations are like \"Formula E on steroids\", revealing that he doesn't like driving the 2026 cars",
    "fullText": "Max Verstappen has doubled down on his criticism of the 2026 Formula 1 regulations, stating the championship must “stay away” from becoming Formula E.\n\nThe four-time world champion caused a huge stir during last week’s Bahrain pre-season test, when he labelled the new F1 rule set as “anti-racing” and “Formula E on steroids”.\n\nThis comes as the F1 power unit is now more reliant on electrical energy with a near 50-50 split against the internal combustion engine, meaning battery harvesting will play a greater role at grands prix.\n\nIt may include drivers downshifting on straights to preserve energy, and this is similar to Formula E, where racers often deliberately drop back to save battery before launching late attacks.\n\nVerstappen is against all of this and, when asked on Wednesday if more Formula E drivers may enter F1 because of their experience with battery management, or if the all-electric championship could even become a feeder series, the Red Bull racer said: “Well, let's hope not.\n\n“I mean, not about the drivers, because there are a lot of good drivers that would be able to perform also really well here. But I don't want us to be close to Formula E.\n\n“I want us to actually stay away from that and be Formula 1. So don't increase the battery. Actually, get rid of that and focus on a nice engine and have Formula E as Formula E, because that's what they are about.\n\n“I'm sure that with the new car [Gen4] from what I've seen and talked to some of my friends in there, that's going to be also a really cool car. But let them be Formula E and we should stay Formula 1, and let's try not to mix that.”\n\nVerstappen’s comments are just an example of how the 2026 regulations have divided opinion, as reigning world champion Lando Norris claimed that the new cars are “a lot of fun”.\n\n“I'm just sharing my opinion,” added the Dutchman, when asked if he received any pushback from the authorities over his criticism.\n\n“We live in a free world, free speech and yeah, that's what I felt. Not everyone needs to feel like that, but that's how I felt and it also doesn't matter, of course, what other people have to say about that. It's just I got a question and I shared my opinion.\n\n“I think that I'm allowed to do [that]. So it's not about receiving pushback or whatever.”\n\nRed Bull: Can't make Verstappen happier about 2026 F1 cars, but can build him a winning one\n\nWhat Verstappen means by warning of F1 2026 \"disaster\" to come\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Electric vehicle sales fell 3% worldwide in January compared to the same period last year, as the industry braces for a deep freeze.",
    "fullText": "The EV winter is going global — and even Tesla isn't immune.\n\nElectric vehicle sales across the auto industry fell 3% worldwide in January compared to the same period last year, according to data from Benchmark Intelligence published Friday, as policy changes in the US and China threaten to throw the industry into a deep freeze.\n\nIn North America and China, sales fell 33% and 20% respectively last month.\n\nEV sales in the US have plummeted since the removal of the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles in September, and CEOs and industry experts have warned of a bumpy few years ahead.\n\nIn China, EVs accounted for around half of all vehicles sold last year — but companies are facing their own challenges after the government moved to end a key tax exemption for EV purchases and adjusted its trade-in scheme to make it less generous for battery-powered vehicles.\n\nChina's EV wobble has also hit its most successful foreign import — Tesla.\n\nElon Musk's automaker sold fewer than 20,000 vehicles in China in January, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association, its lowest figure since late 2022.\n\nUnlike many other Western carmakers in China, Tesla has largely managed to fend off a wave of local rivals and protect its market share in the world's largest auto market.\n\nHowever, a slowing EV market and a lack of new products — barring refreshes and variants, Tesla hasn't launched a new vehicle in China since the Model Y in 2021 — has left the US automaker vulnerable.\n\nIndustry data published last week suggests that Tesla's Model Y was outsold in January by more than two to one by Xiaomi's YU7, which was widely hailed as a serious rival to Tesla's bestselling EV when the smartphone maker launched it last June.\n\nAnd last year, BYD took Tesla's crown as the world's largest seller of battery-powered vehicles — although the Chinese company also saw its January sales fall 30% year over year, signaling a difficult start to 2026.\n\nOutside of China, things aren't looking much better for Tesla.\n\nThe company continues to struggle in Europe, after facing major backlash last year over CEO Musk's interventions into local politics and endorsement of the German far-right party AfD.\n\nDespite staging a recovery in some markets, such as Spain and Italy in January, Tesla's registrations also collapsed by 42% in France and fell to just 82 cars in EV-friendly Norway.\n\nIn the UK, where Tesla's Chinese rivals do not face tariffs, BYD sold four times as many cars as Tesla last month, after the Austin-based automaker's registrations fell by half.\n\nThe ongoing slump comes despite Europe being one of the few regions to see a bump in EV demand so far this year. Electric vehicle sales grew by nearly 25% year-over-year in January, per Benchmark figures.\n\nTesla's struggles in China and Europe mean its attempt to return to growth after two years of annual sales declines is off to a rough start.\n\nThe company has also faced a difficult spell in the US following the end of the tax credit, with sales in the final three months of 2025 falling 15% year over year, per figures from Cox Automotive — although the brand's January sales were only 2% lower than last year.\n\nTesla is by no means the only US automaker taking a hit in the EV market. The Detroit \"big three\" of Ford, GM, and Stellantis have collectively announced over $50 billion in charges related to their EV businesses in recent months, as they switch gears to sell more gas-powered and hybrid vehicles. Just 90,000 electric vehicles were sold in North America in January, according to Benchmark's figures.\n\nGetting caught in the EV winter might not bother Tesla's management, though, with the company rapidly shifting its focus away from the traditional auto industry.\n\nMusk told investors last month that Tesla will sunset its pioneering Model X and S models to build a new production line for its Optimus humanoid robot, and predicted that the company's upcoming Cybercab robotaxi will make current transportation methods obsolete.\n\n\"We're literally saying what we're going to do and have said what we're going to do for a while,\" Musk said\n\n\"I think long-term, really the only vehicles that we'll make will be autonomous vehicles, with the exception of the next-generation Roadster,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Rob Citrone sees better opportunities outside of the US.\n\nThe billionaire hedge funder says he's short US stocks, largely due to expectations that the domestic market would continue underperform the rest of the world.\n\n\"I am short the US, and I'm long global markets,\" the Discovery Capital founder said, speaking to CNBC about his investment strategy on Tuesday.\n\nCitrone said the US market was already beginning to fall behind relative to other assets. In the year leading up the last Friday, he noted that the gains in dollar-based assets have been the weakest when compared to 19 other markets around the world.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 11% over the past year, compared to the 34% gain in the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Market ETF over the same period.\n\n\"The US is 20th out of 20,\" Citrone said, adding that gains in the US market fell around 30% short of the gains in emerging markets in the last year. \"That's a significant difference.\"\n\nThere are a few reasons Citrone said he believed the US's underperformance would continue:\n\nMost global investors are \"way overweight\" in the US-based assets. On average, US-based institutions have around 80% of their wealth invested in the US market, he said.\n\n\"Most people are going to move some money from the US, elsewhere,\" Citrone added.\n\nAI uncertainty. US markets are also facing uncertainty as to how the AI trade will pan out, he said, pointing to overarching concerns about large AI-related capex spending, though monetization plans for AI remain unclear at some firms.\n\nVarious stock sectors are also starting to sell-off out of fear over how AI could disrupt business models, he added, pointing to the selling pressure that's hammered the software, real estate, and trucking sectors recently.\n\nCitrone said he saw better opportunities in emerging markets. He pointed in particular to the promising investment climate in areas like Argentina and Brazil, and said Mexico was his top pick due to its growing ties to the US economy.\n\n\"I think Mexico has really gone all in with the United States and they've got good — better leadership, the companies are quite competitive,\" Citrone said, adding that most of the companies in the nation had \"big moats\" in competition due to being monopolies or oligopolies.\n\nInvestors have been increasingly turning their attention to other areas around the world, a trend that has been gathering steam since President Donald Trump's tariffs first sparked a \"Sell America\" moment in markets last year. Goldman Sachs and Lazard are among the firms that have also warned the US's dominance in global markets could continue to fade.",

    "fullText": "Last year, the bears came out of hibernation.\n\nThere were 166 short-selling campaigns launched in 2025, according to industry tracker Diligent Market Intelligence — a 55% bump compared to 2024. The vast majority were based in the US.\n\nThe most targeted companies were technology stocks that had been boosted by market-wide optimism about artificial intelligence, Josh Black, the author of Diligent's report, told Business Insider. The report identified Applovin, a company that helps iPhone apps monetize users via advertising technology, as an example of a common short. The company's stock is down nearly 40% this year.\n\nThe spike in short-selling campaigns may be a sign of pain to come in 2026. In 2021, one year before a global market plunge brought on in part by concerns over lofty tech valuations, there were 128 campaigns — the most in the last five years until 2025.\n\nOf last year's 166 campaigns, 55 of them were focused on technology companies, by far the most of any sector.\n\nThe slide in software stocks such as Salesforce and Oracle this year has added fuel to short-sellers' questions about the industry's valuations in the age of AI.\n\nNew shortseller BMF Capital, run by Frankie Gerola and based in Arizona, told Diligent that one of the firm's first bets, against defense AI company BigBear.ai, came about in part due to what it viewed as a \"lack of true AI innovation.\" BigBear, which has attracted other short sellers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the short-sellers' critiques.\n\nBMF Capital is also keeping an eye on companies \"that repeatedly change narratives in search of relevance, such as a sports company pivoting into AI dating.\"\n\n\"That kind of identity drift usually precedes capital stress or poor fundamentals,\" BMF Capital said.\n\nLast year, the average short campaign generated returns of 7.2% 30 days after launch, according to Diligent. So far in 2026, the software-stock crash has generated billions for those betting against the stocks, short-seller tracker S3 Partners said.",

    "fullText": "Jess Fishlock will join Rhian Wilkinson's coaching staff for part of Wales' international camp in March before leaving to fulfil club commitments with Seattle Reign.\n\nWales legend Fishlock, 39, retired from international football in October, but signed a new one-year deal with National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) side Reign the following month.\n\nShe will join her former international team-mates as a technical assistant for Wales' opening 2027 World Cup qualifying game against the Czech Republic on Tuesday, 3 March.\n\nFishlock will not be present for the second Group B1 fixture, against Montenegro in Llanelli four days later, because of Reign's preparations for the new NWSL season, which begins later in the month.\n\n\"She's obviously in pre-season with Seattle so a big thank you to Seattle and to her coach Laura Harvey for allowing us to borrow her for the front end of this campaign,\" said Wales head coach Wilkinson.\n\n\"She's coming in as a technical assistant. I know as a former player who became a coach, it's quite a leap off a cliff. When the players have days off, you do not. Your day starts a lot earlier and ends a lot later.\n\n\"Jess is still a player for Seattle and she's just retired from the national team so she will be eased into it. In that way, it's slightly different than the other technical staff, but she will be putting in a shift for sure.\"\n\nFishlock's former team-mate Kayleigh Barton, who has been working with Wales' under-17s squad after retiring in the wake of Euro 2025, will also be involved with the senior group.\n\nFishlock has 'had conversations' over Wales role\n\nCould granddaughter of 'The King' play for Wales?\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying\n\nWales 'all in' for 2027 World Cup - Wilkinson\n\n\"These are women who have given everything for their country and as our young players come through now, I think having the support of those players around the environment is huge,\" Wilkinson added.\n\n\"Equally, Jess needs to see a little bit behind the curtain so she can make her decisions about what she might want to do in the future, if she ever retires.\"\n\nThe Czech Republic game, which will be played in Uherske Hradiste, is Wales' first competitive fixture since Euro 2025, which was the first women's major tournament the team had qualified for.\n\nWales' hopes of following their European Championship appearance by reaching a first World Cup have not been helped by the loss of Fishlock, the greatest female player in the history of the Welsh game.\n\nBut while she feels Fishlock could still contribute on the pitch, Wilkinson says she has to accept her decision to stand down from Wales duty.\n\n\"Jess is one of those players that could play for many more years and she knew that when she retired,\" Wilkinson said.\n\n\"It's painful to know that she could probably still step on the pitch, but equally I think it was a great decision that she's made when she's healthy, strong and still fully capable to be like 'OK, I want to focus on my club football at this point'.\n\n\"We had really good conversations and Jess is an all-in type person so she wouldn't say 'oh I'm good to go for another year'. In her mind if she's good to go, she's saying yes to a cycle, whether that's two or four years, and I don't think she felt like she had the energy to do that.\"\n\nWales begin their bid to reach the World Cup knowing there is no opportunity to qualify automatically because they are in League B.\n\nAssuming they do not finish bottom of a group which also includes Albania – which would be disastrous – Wales will progress to a play-off campaign in which they may have to come through stages to secure a place at the tournament, which will be held in Brazil.\n\nWilkinson has recalled fit-again Newcastle United player Lois Joel to her squad for the first two group games, but midfielder Laura Hughes misses out through injury.\n\nHughes, who has previously been capped by Australia, made her Wales debut in the friendly win over Switzerland in December.\n\nWilkinson says she does not know the exact nature of Hughes' injury, but expects her back for the double-header against Albania in April.\n\nThere are three uncapped players in the squad - goalkeeper Poppy Soper and Plymouth Argyle duo Olivia Francis and Phoebie Poole.\n\nOlivia Clark (Leicester City), Safia Middleton-Patel (Manchester United), Poppy Soper (Rugby Borough), Ceri Holland (Liverpool), Gwen Zimmerman (Eclipse Select), Ella Powell (Bristol City), Rhiannon Roberts (Sunderland), Hayley Ladd (Everton), Gemma Evans (Liverpool), Charlie Estcourt (Portsmouth), Lily Woodham (Liverpool), Esther Morgan (Bristol City), Sophie Ingle (Bristol City), Mia Ross (Charlton Athletic), Angharad James (Seattle Reign), Lois Joel (Newcastle United), Carrie Jones (IFK Norrkoping), Tianna Teisar (Plymouth Argyle – on loan from Bristol City), Mared Griffiths (Sunderland - on loan from Manchester United), Olivia Francis (Plymouth Argyle), Phoebie Poole (Plymouth Argyle), Hannah Cain (Leicester City), Rachel Rowe (Nottingham Forest), Ffion Morgan (West Ham United), Elise Hughes (Crystal Palace), Mary McAteer (Charlton Athletic).",

    "fullText": "The sensation of winning is an addictive one.\n\nWhether it's the fizz of champagne bubbling on the tongue, the feeling of completion mixed intoxicatingly with the ecstasy of achievement, or even the monetary rewards, those who have enjoyed success crave it greedily.\n\nHull KR captain Elliot Minchella is no exception.\n\nIn 2025, Minchella got his hands on all the prizes; the first Robin since the great Roger Millward to lift a Challenge Cup, the first since David Watkinson to raise the prize for securing the top-flight championship.\n\nWinning Super League for the first time gives Rovers a crack at a trophy no Robin has ever won - the World Club Challenge.\n\nThursday's showpiece against Australia's National Rugby League premiers Brisbane Broncos will give Minchella and his team-mates the chance to box off their 2025 successes and earn the mantle of best club team in the world.\n\n\"St Helens, Leeds, Wigan and Bradford, to name just four, all won World Club Challenges and we want to remembered for winning this game,\" Minchella told BBC Sport.\n\n\"No-one remembers a team that didn't come out on the winning side. You remember the ones that won for years to come.\n\n\"That's my thought process - I want to be part of a team that wins. I experienced that last year and this is the first opportunity for 2026.\n\n\"Winning silverware felt great last year, so I want another piece of it.\"\n\nAlthough there might be some in the west of the rugby league-mad city of Hull who swap their irregular black and white hoops for maroon, white and gold on Thursday night, the World Club Challenge tends to unite many fans behind the Super League representing the northern hemisphere game.\n\nBeing standard bearers for the competition and the community is not lost on Minchella, who watched the likes of Bradford and St Helens strike a blow to the all-conquering NRL in the inter-hemisphere match-ups as a boy.\n\n\"It's unique to play against a team not in your competition, teams you're not used to if you like,\" he added.\n\n\"In Super League you get to know your opposition when you play against them two or three times a season, so this is a completely unique situation.\n\n\"It's the same for both teams; you do your homework on the opposition.\n\n\"These are games I watched as a kid, the World Club Challenges from yesteryear. You dream then of being involved in one someday, and here we are, getting the chance to play in one on Thursday.\n\n\"It's a massive privilege to be involved in this game, not just to represent the city of Hull but also Super League and going up against the NRL's best.\"\n\nHaving dominated the competition in 2025, Hull KR's start to life as champions can hardly be described as ideal preparation for the ominous meeting with NRL champions Brisbane.\n\nThe Robins let slip an 18-6 lead against newly-promoted York in their season opener to lose 19-18 and started the Super League campaign in defeat.\n\nFor head coach Willie Peters, it is a case of finding improvement and learnings, and a little inspiration, as they head into Thursday's crunch encounter with the Broncos.\n\n\"The way York handled the game, coming up against a team who had just won the treble, they showed no fear,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"It didn't matter who was in front of them, they just went after them.\n\n\"We need to be the same this week against Brisbane. The Broncos are a formidable side, the best in the NRL, so it will be good to take some of York's mindset against us into the game.\"\n\nThursday, 19 February (19:30 GMT)\n\nWatch on BBC Three and BBC iPlayer; listen to commentary on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio Humberside\n\nAround 24,000 fans will get the opportunity to roar on Rovers in Thursday's game, after Hull KR negotiated the use of the larger MKM Stadium, home of their fierce rivals Hull FC.\n\nCraven Park's much lower capacity would have left many fans locked out of the event, and stifled the club's ability to generate revenue from a major showpiece.\n\nSo, Minchella and his team-mates have a unique situation whereby they will head for the home dressing room rather than the away facility, as well as running out to thousands of cheering voices rather than a chorus of boos and jeers.\n\nThey will also do so in a specially designed kit, which harks back to the Robins' famous 1983 victory over a touring Queensland side which featured 'The King' Wally Lewis, later Wigan star Gene Miles and other Australia internationals such as Wally Fullerton-Smith and Bryan Niebling.\n\nThat Rovers side remains fondly recalled, with Robins forever favourites such George Fairburn, Gary Prohm, Mike Smith, John Dorahy, Watkinson, Mark Broadhurst and Phil Hogan among the ranks.\n\n\"We're looking forward to pulling the shirt on,\" Minchella added. \"I've done some pictures with the kit and heard a lot of the story, the reasons why we're wearing the shirt.\n\n\"You never forget the history is there, it's in the books forever and for us to be able to represent those guys, our club and our community wearing the shirt is a great nod to them.\n\n\"Hopefully people are proud to see us wear that and we can make them proud and make our own history as the 2026 team.\"\n\nBrisbane arrived in England for a two-week visit last week, spending the first part of their trip in London, where they linked up with namesakes London Broncos as part of legend Darren Lockyer's involvement in the capital.\n\nThe NRL champions then headed north to prepare for Thursday's match, having put together an impressive squad.\n\nRugby league's 'Justin Bieber' in the shape of dynamic full-back Reece Walsh spearheads the high-profile group, while powerful forwards such as Payne Haas and Patrick Carrigan offer the muscle to put Rovers under duress.\n\nPeters will look to Arthur Mourgue, Oli Gildart, Peta Hiku and Mikey Lewis to provide the sparkle in response to the attacking gifts of Walsh, Kotoni Staggs, Ezra Mam and Gehemat Shibasaki.\n\nTom Amone, Jai Whitbread and Dean Hadley are among the packmen who will look to get at their Broncos counterparts.\n\n\"Us as a forward pack, we look forward to going up against theirs, and most games of rugby league are won in the middle, and the backs decide by how many,\" Minchella said.\n\n\"So, it'll be no different on Thursday. We're testing ourselves against the best out there and we're looking forward to the physical battle of the game, and going after it and embracing it.\n\n\"We've got to stop them but we want to be confident in making them try to stop us too.\"\n\nHull KR became only the fifth team to win Super League in achieving their 2025 dreams, likewise in terms of securing a treble.\n\nWhile skill was at the heart of such success, mentality and mindset too are key for the Robins to continue to bring silverware to the red and white side of the River Hull.\n\n\"We've got a responsibility to put our best foot forward, we need to put together a 'British' performance, represent who we are and that's East Hull as well,\" Minchella maintained.\n\n\"It's about having some grit and some toughness, doing that to the best of our ability.\n\n\"It's something we're good at as a team and it's going to come out on the biggest stage - it needs to come out on the biggest stage.\n\n\"The conditions are going to be pretty cold, the atmosphere is going to be hostile, and for us as players we need to nail all those effort areas, be a tough team to break down and be dogged.\"",

    "fullText": "Former world number two Paula Badosa has responded to claims she is \"disrespectful to the game\" following her withdrawal from a match in Dubai.\n\nThe Spaniard beat Katerina Siniakova 6-3 7-5 at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Monday before a right thigh issue forced her to retire from the match against Elina Svitolina on Tuesday.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who retired from four matches last year, was 4-1 up against Svitolina but lost the first set 6-4 and then, having called for treatment, withdrew.\n\nA social media user accused Badosa of being \"disrespectful to the game\" as \"you cannot retire/withdraw from every tournament\".\n\n\"You have no idea what it's like to live with a chronic injury and still choose to keep going,\" wrote Badosa in response., external\n\n\"To wake up every day not knowing how your body will respond, searching for solutions, and fighting for something you love and give everything to even when it's so difficult.\"\n\nTennis 'racist, misogynistic, homophobic', says Aiava\n\nBadosa contemplated ending her playing career in 2024 because of a string of injuries, including a chronic back problem.\n\nShe was ranked as high as number two in 2022 but, despite working her way back into the top 10 last year, is now 70th.\n\n\"Trust me I'm the first one suffering with pain and having endless nightmares to try to find solutions every single day,\" she added.\n\n\"I'll always try one more time. And if there's even a 1% chance to keep going, I'll take it.\"\n\nBadosa, who reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in January 2025, criticised the toxicity of some of social media.\n\n\"So for me the only disrespect here is to open social media and read messages like this,\" she added.\n\n\"Then we complain if we see players or people suffering and having mental health issues. But I'm not surprised with the amount of hate and 'experts' we have here.\"\n\nBadosa's comments follow Destanee Aiava announcing her impending retirement aged 25, saying it had a \"racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile\" culture.\n\nAs part of her explanation of her decision, Aiava said she had faced abuse from online trolls - an issue that has affected several players in the game.\n\nBritish player Katie Boulter shared some of the abuse she had received with BBC Sport last year to help highlight the scale of the problem.\n\nFigures from data science firm Signify, the International Tennis Federation and Women's Tennis Association show that in 2024, about 8,000 abusive, violent or threatening messages were sent publicly to 458 tennis players through their social media accounts, with many stemming from betting.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "'It smacks of England' - Australia fail again at T20 World Cup",
    "description": "Muddled selection and the lack of a plan B - how Australia's T20 World Cup campaign was derailed in Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "After Monday's resounding defeat by Sri Lanka took World Cup fate out of his side's hands, Australia captain Mitchell Marsh asked for the luck of the Irish to kick in.\n\nThe following day, Ireland were due to take on Zimbabwe in Pallekele. Any points for the African side would knock Australia out of the competition.\n\nClearly, no-one told Marsh that when it comes to Irish luck in a cricketing context, rain is never far away. The two sides shared the points after wet weather saw the match abandoned without a ball bowled. Zimababwe through, Australia gone.\n\nFor the first time since 2009, there will not be an Australian side in the Super 8s stage or equivalent. Since winning it in 2021, this edition marks a third consecutive T20 World Cup without Australia in the semi-finals.\n\nLess than a month on from wrapping up a resounding Ashes drubbing, Australia's T20 side has failed to hit similar heights. The failings of this competition, which has seen them play all of their group games in Sri Lanka, alongside a wider slump in this format, does little to discard the notion that T20 cricket is not a priority.\n\nAs always after a difficult tournament, selection is questioned. Steve Smith has long been out of this side, not appearing in almost two years. A century and two 50s in the recent Big Bash were not enough to earn a recall. Not until Marsh was hit in the groin in training prior to Australia's first game against Ireland.\n\nSmith was summoned to acclimatise in Colombo in case he was required. He ultimately was, but not as a replacement for Marsh.\n\nAustralia's Test run machine eventually earned a place in the squad proper when the selectors belatedly named a replacement for Josh Hazlewood, who was ruled out of the competition before a ball was bowled.\n\nAll those moving parts for a player who only made it onto the park as a sub fielder while Australia were still mathematically alive, with Smith powerless to stop Sri Lanka and Pathum Nissanka's charge.\n\nThe decision to drop Matthew Renshaw for that defeat also reads as confusing. His 37 off 33 balls against Ireland was slow, but the Ireland camp highlighted how impressed they were given the tricky nature of the pitch. Next time out, Renshaw's 65 off 44 fell short of match-winning status against Zimbabwe.\n\nDropping him against Sri Lanka backfired. After Travis Head and Marsh's opening partnership of 104 off 8.3 overs, Australia looked well set. They lost the next three wickets for 26 runs, the middle order appearing to lack the stability previously provided by Renshaw.\n\n\"The reaction back home has been rather heavy because I think we've been sold down the stream a little bit in terms of our selection and how we've gone about preparing for this T20 World Cup,\" Australia's two-time 50-over World Cup winner Matthew Hayden told Test Match Special.\n\n\"It sort of smacks of England, and their questions in the Ashes preparation - this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy of 'we're OK' and 'no, don't worry'. It's a mix of denial and maybe even just mismanagement.\n\n\"We enjoy coming to countries like Sri Lanka but we just haven't prepared for what we've seen. We've picked power hitters in finesse type conditions.\n\n\"[It's] almost like stubbornness but there is a plan A. And that plan A is called power. And it's a day and age of power. In India, that's certainly the case.\n\n\"These conditions [in Sri Lanka], though, are different. They're not such pure batting surfaces, and that requires methodology. It almost requires a bit more of an old school approach and way of thinking about the game that allows you to stay in the contest.\"\n\nAustralia's fast-bowling depth behind the big three of Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc looks strong in red-ball cricket. Just ask England.\n\nIn white-ball cricket, though, it's a different story. Starc has retired from the format while Cummins and Hazelwood are injured. It says plenty that, instead of calling up a bowler immediately once the latter went down, they waited until mid-tournament to call up Smith, a batter.\n\nWord from within the camp refuses to dwell too much on muddled selection or lack of depth.\n\n\"Looking down our list, honestly, it feels like there's more than enough talent to look after the situations in the games that we're playing,\" said Marsh after the Sri Lanka defeat.\n\n\"As much as we can talk about team line-up and who's in, who's out and that sort of thing, I think if everyone just looks after their role it should help [put] us in good stead.\"\n\nAll-rounder Cameron Green, who became the Indian Premier League's most expensive overseas signing when he was picked up for more than £2m by Kolkata Knight Riders in December, was criticised by Hayden having struggled to make an impact despite batting at number three.\n\n\"Cam Green has just looked awful with the bat,\" said Hayden. \"He looks woody, he looks tinny, he looks like he's just a man with no confidence, and I'd be very surprised if that's not exactly the case.\n\n\"Matt Renshaw has come with no baggage to this tournament. He actually had a really good series back home in Australia in the ODIs. He's been a man that's been very ill treated - there's no doubt he should be in the Test team too.\"\n\nThere is a wider question on Australia's cultural attitudes towards T20.\n\nWhile Big Bash crowds are healthy, this tournament has taken place at a difficult time for fans back home to watch. Only one Australian journalist has travelled to cover the team in Sri Lanka, reflecting how editors view the levels of public interest.\n\nIn that context, it seems easy to question to what extent this competition has been prioritised. Even if injuries ruled out players such as Cummins and Hazlewood, other senior players were told to prioritise the Big Bash finals instead of heading on the warm-up tour to Pakistan prior to this week's failing.\n\n\"Cricket Australia needs to have a look at their schedule, and they need to be able to manage their number one and primary resource, which is cricket talent,\" said Hayden.\n\n\"[They need to] find a way to just be a little more controlled, and a little more destined and built towards the purpose of Australian cricket.\"\n\nBefore that, however, Australia have one match remaining in this competition, against Oman on Friday.\n\nA dead rubber, the kind of match usually more associated with England in the Ashes.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nEngland still confident despite unconvincing run - Jacks\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Prof Michael Wooldridge says scenario such as deadly self-driving car update or AI hack could destroy global interest\n\nThe race to get artificial intelligence to market has raised the risk of a Hindenburg-style disaster that shatters global confidence in the technology, a leading researcher has warned.\n\nMichael Wooldridge, a professor of AI at Oxford University, said the danger arose from the immense commercial pressures that technology firms were under to release new AI tools, with companies desperate to win customers before the products’ capabilities and potential flaws are fully understood.\n\nThe surge in AI chatbots with guardrails that are easily bypassed showed how commercial incentives were prioritised over more cautious development and safety testing, he said.\n\n“It’s the classic technology scenario,” he said. “You’ve got a technology that’s very, very promising, but not as rigorously tested as you would like it to be, and the commercial pressure behind it is unbearable.”\n\nWooldridge, who will deliver the Royal Society’s Michael Faraday prize lecture on Wednesday evening, titled “This is not the AI we were promised”, said a Hindenburg moment was “very plausible” as companies rushed to deploy more advanced AI tools.\n\nThe Hindenburg, a 245-metre airship that made round trips across the Atlantic, was preparing to land in New Jersey in 1937 when it burst into flames, killing 36 crew, passengers and ground staff. The inferno was caused by a spark that ignited the 200,000 cubic metres of hydrogen that kept the airship aloft.\n\n“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Wooldridge said. Because AI is embedded in so many systems, a major incident could strike almost any sector.\n\nThe scenarios Wooldridge imagines include a deadly software update for self-driving cars, an AI-powered hack that grounds global airlines, or a Barings bank-style collapse of a major company, triggered by AI doing something stupid. “These are very, very plausible scenarios,” he said. “There are all sorts of ways AI could very publicly go wrong.”\n\nDespite the concerns, Wooldridge said he did not intend to attack modern AI. His starting point is the gap between what researchers expected and what has emerged. Many experts anticipated AI that computed solutions to problems and provided answers that were sound and complete. “Contemporary AI is neither sound nor complete: it’s very, very approximate,” he said.\n\nThis arises because large language models, which underpin today’s AI chatbots, rattle out answers by predicting the next word, or part of a word, based on probability distributions learned in training. It leads to AIs with jagged capabilities: incredibly effective at some tasks, yet terrible at others.\n\nThe problem, Wooldridge said, was that AI chatbots failed in unpredictable ways and had no idea when they were wrong, but were designed to provide confident answers regardless. When delivered in human-like and sycophantic responses, the answers could easily mislead people, he added. The risk is that people start treating AIs as if they were human. In a 2025 survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology, nearly a third of students reported that they or a friend had had a romantic relationship with an AI.\n\n“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge said. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”\n\nWooldridge sees positives in the kind of AI depicted in the early years of Star Trek. In one 1968 episode, The Day of the Dove, Mr Spock quizzes the Enterprise’s computer only to be told in a distinctly non-human voice that it has insufficient data to answer. “That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he said. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the Star Trek computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”",

    "fullText": "Google, Anthropic and OpenAI bosses to mingle with global south leaders wrestling for control over technology\n\nSilicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.\n\nDuring the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.\n\nAmid a push to speed up AI adoption across the globe, Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, the heads of Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, will all be there. Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.\n\nMeanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioning India as the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.\n\nModi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raised serious concerns about India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”\n\nSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.\n\nIndian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.\n\nIf a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.\n\nIndia’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”\n\nSafety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.\n\n“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”\n\nOne of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”\n\nBut the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.\n\n“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.\n\nCompanies such as Google are focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.\n\n“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”\n\nGoogle’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.",

Now I’m here, and thank God things turned out this way. I’m very happy and grateful,” Díaz said.\n\nDíaz has 19 goals and 15 assists across all competitions for Bayern Munich this season.

    "description": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Team USA skiers Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin, along with Italy's Federica Brignone, are among the many skiers who have expressed concern during these Olympic Games about the accelerating melt of the world’s glaciers.",
    "fullText": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Team USA skiers Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin, along with Italy's Federica Brignone, are among the many skiers who have expressed concern during these Olympic Games about the accelerating melt of the world’s glaciers.\n\nAnd Olympic host city Cortina is a fitting place for them to be talking about climate change: Glaciers once visible from town have dramatically shrunk. Many have been reduced to tiny glaciers or residual ice patches at high elevations among the jagged peaks of the Dolomites. Any Olympian or spectator wishing to lay eyes on a major glacier would have to take a long drive on winding mountain roads to the Marmolada. It's melting rapidly, too.\n\nThe world’s top skiers train on glaciers because of the high-quality snow there, and a warming world jeopardizes the future of their sport. Vonn started skiing on glaciers in Austria when she was just 9 years old.\n\n“Most of the glaciers that I used to ski on are pretty much gone,” 41-year-old Vonn said Feb. 3 in response to a question from The Associated Press at a prerace press conference in Cortina before she crashed on the Olympic downhill course. “So that’s very real and it’s very apparent to us.”\n\nAs athletes in snow sports, Shiffrin said, they “get a real front-row view” to the monumental changes underway atop some of the world’s highest, coldest peaks.\n\n“It is something that’s very close to our heart, because it is the heart and soul of what we do,” Shiffrin told AP after racing Sunday. “I would really, really like to believe and hope that with strong voices and sort of broader policy changes within companies and governments, there is a hope for a future of our sport. But I think right now, it’s a little bit of a ... it’s a question.”\n\nItalian glaciologist Antonella Senese said Italy has lost more than 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) of glacier area since the late 1950s.\n\n“We are observing a continuous and uninterrupted decrease in glacier area and volume. In the last one to two decades, this reduction has clearly accelerated,” Senese, associate professor of physical geography in the University of Milan's environmental science and policy department, said in an interview.\n\nAmong the peaks surrounding Cortina d’Ampezzo, there are glaciers on the slopes of the Cristallo and Sorapiss mountains. The 2015 New Italian Glacier Inventory found these glaciers shrunk by about one-third since the 1959-1962 inventory.\n\nShortly after winning a second gold Sunday at her home Winter Olympics, Brignone told AP that skiing is “totally different” now than when she was younger. Brignone lives in the Valle d’Aosta, about six hours away.\n\nWhen she sees how glaciers are retreating to higher elevations, Brignone said she’s not thinking about the future of skiing — she’s concerned for the future of the planet.\n\n“There we have a lot of glaciers, but they are going up and up, every year, more and more,” she told AP.\n\nYet many people who don't frequent the mountains remain unaware of what's at stake, so the University of Innsbruck created the Goodbye Glaciers Project. The loss of glaciers has far-reaching consequences, threatening water sources, increasing mountain hazards and contributing to sea level rise.\n\nThe project shows how different warming levels change the amount of ice left on selected glaciers around the world. To be included, glaciers must have an estimated 2020 volume of at least 0.01 cubic kilometers. The Cristallo and Sorapiss glaciers no longer meet that threshold, said Patrick Schmitt, a doctoral student at the University of Innsbruck.\n\nSome 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Cortina is the Marmolada glacier, one of the largest glaciers in Italy and the largest in the Dolomites. An apartment building-sized chunk of the glacier detached in July 2022, sparking an avalanche of debris that killed 11 hikers. The mountain is popular for hiking in summer and skiing in winter.\n\nThe University of Padua said in 2023 the glacier had been halved over 25 years.\n\nIt's expected to be mostly gone by 2034 if the world warms 2.7 Celsius (4.9 Fahrenheit), according to the Goodbye Glaciers Project. But if warming is limited to 1.5 C (2.7 F — the international goal — the glacier’s life could be extended by another six years, and around 100 glaciers in the Alps can be saved, Schmitt said.\n\n“Cutting greenhouse gas emissions now will reduce future ice loss and soften the impacts on people and nature,” Schmitt wrote in an email. “The choices we make in this decade will decide how much ice remains in the Dolomites, across the Alps, and around the world.”\n\nGlobally, more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) has been lost since 2000, according to a study last year. And the prospective impact of climate change on Olympic sport is enormous; the list of places that could host Winter Games is projected to shrink substantially in the coming years.\n\nIn Cortina, Noa Szollos, who is competing for Israel, said in an interview the state of the nearby glaciers speaks to the condition of glaciers around the world.\n\n“I hope we can do something about it,” she said, “but it’s a hard time.”\n\nSilja Koskinen of Finland said in an interview she can’t train on some of the glaciers she used to because of crevices, rocks and flowing water. Team USA skier AJ Hurt talked about starting the season in October on glaciers in Sölden, Austria.\n\n“Every year, I feel like we come and there’s a little less snow. And every time, we’re like, are we really going to start in October? There’s no snow here,'” Hurt told the AP. “It is really sad and it’s hard to ignore in this sport, definitely, when we’re around it so much and it is so clear.”\n\nNorwegian skier Nikolai Schirmer is leading an effort to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports. Burning coal, oil and gas is the largest contributor to global climate change by far.\n\nIn Bormio, Italy, Team USA skier River Radamus said athletes — as stewards of outdoor winter sports— should be on the forefront of trying to defend the environment as best they can.\n\n“It’s always present in our mind that we’re on a dangerous trend unless we do something right,” Radamus said.\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed from Bormio, Italy.\n\nAP Winter Olympics coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "description": "Detroit Tigers shortstop Javier Báez addressed his suspension from the 2026 World Baseball Classic after a positive marijuana test during the 2023 tournament.",
    "fullText": "Javier Báez didn’t dodge responsibility. He didn’t deflect blame. And he didn’t sugarcoat how much it hurts.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, Feb. 17, at spring training in Lakeland, the Detroit Tigers shortstop addressed his suspension from the 2026 World Baseball Classic, which will prevent him from representing Team Puerto Rico after testing positive for marijuana during the 2023 WBC.\n\n“I don’t want to point fingers at anybody because this is all my fault,” Báez said via the Detroit Free Press. “I’m the one that failed the test. … It’s just really frustrating that I won’t be able to be there. … It really hurts my family, my reputation, but it’s part of it. Other than that, I got a long season to go, and I got to prepare for that.”\n\nThe 2026 World Baseball Classic is scheduled to run from March 5–17, but Báez’s suspension — handed down by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) — does not expire until April 26, making him ineligible for the tournament.\n\nWhile Major League Baseball has permitted marijuana use since 2020 under its jointly negotiated drug policy with the MLB Players Association, the WBSC still prohibits the substance. MLB and the MLBPA explored whether Báez could be cleared for the tournament, but those efforts ultimately failed.\n\n“I understand the rules,” Báez said. “It’s not like I was taking steroids or anything to last longer or whatever. They made that decision. I’m fine with it – I mean, I’m not fine with it. I just keep my mouth shut.”\n\nThe positive test dates back to March 12, 2023, during the previous WBC. As a result, Báez received a two-year period of ineligibility — from April 26, 2024, through April 26, 2026 — which bars him from WBSC-sanctioned events.\n\n“There are a lot of people mad and frustrated,” Báez said, “but it doesn’t hurt more than it hurts me. It’s time to turn the page and get ready for the season – and try to stay healthy.”\n\nThe timing makes the situation even more painful. Team Puerto Rico will host WBC games in 2026, marking the first time the tournament returns to the island since 2013. For Báez, the opportunity carried deep personal meaning.\n\n“One of my dreams is to play in Puerto Rico for Team Puerto Rico with our families, our fans, our island,” Báez said. “Nothing I can do. I’m just happy for all of my teammates that got the chance to represent. I wish them good luck.”\n\nBáez, who lives in Puerto Rico during the offseason, vividly remembers watching the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic as a 13-year-old fan in the stands at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan.\n\n“It’s been a long, long time since we played this tournament in Puerto Rico,” Báez said. “To have the chance to be a part of that, and now it’s away from me, it really hurts.”\n\nThe post Detroit Tigers’ Javier Báez Addresses Suspension, WBC Absence appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

Longtime digital trend watcher Don Tapscott says the next wave of artificial intelligence is all about identic AI – where personalized agents don’t just complete tasks, but understand your judgment and values and take actions on your behalf. He explains the technologies for this that already exist amid the rise of agents and bots, what it means for leaders and organizations, and the pitfalls to look out for.

    "fullText": "Ireland and Australia have both been eliminated from the T20 World Cup as rain prevented play in the Group B game between the Irish and Zimbabwe at Pallekele Cricket Stadium in Kandy.\n\nZimbabwe's shock victory over Australia left them needing just a point on Tuesday to advance to the Super 8s with the match being a must-win for Ireland to retain any hope of advancing.\n\nAustralia, who suffered an eight-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka on Monday, were also banking on a win for Ireland to remain in the hunt for the next phase.\n\nBut with the rain unrelenting in Kandy the match was abandoned with both Ireland and Zimbabwe taking a point apiece.\n\nThat left Zimbabwe on five points and Ireland - whose four-game campaign is complete - on three, with Australia sitting on two and just one game remaining against Oman on Friday (13:30 GMT) which is now a dead rubber.\n\n\"It's very disappointing to go out in this fashion but it's completely uncontrollable,\" said Ireland stand-in skipper Lorcan Tucker.\n\n\"It looked like we were building momentum with the Oman win but unfortunately it came too late.\n\n\"I think when we look back there were moments, especially in the first game against Sri Lanka, which we didn't get quite right. It just wasn't to be - we started a bit slower than we wanted.\n\n\"Our group gained great experience from the tournament, for many it was their first World Cup. It's really competitive and shows the pressure elite cricketers are under.\n\n\"Those big moments, it's how you deal with them and process them. We hope to have big moments in the next couple of years and prepare well for the next tournament.\"\n\nZimbabwe will take on Sri Lanka in Colombo on Thursday (09:30 GMT) with the winner topping Group B, but they are both guaranteed a place in the next phase of the tournament.",

    "fullText": "Team GB's Winter Olympics curling medal hopes are now in serious jeopardy after Bruce Mouat's world champions were beaten 9-5 by Canada in Cortina.\n\nArriving in Italy as gold-medal favourites, the British quartet have lost four of their eight matches in a round-robin stage full of maybes and might have beens.\n\nNow, they must beat the United States in their final game on Wednesday (13:05 GMT) - and hope either Italy or Norway fail to win both their closing games, against the Canadians and the unbeaten Swiss - to reach Thursday's semi-finals and salvage their podium prospects.\n\nThe 2022 silver medallists have spoken all week of playing well, but coming out on the wrong side of the narrow margins. And that was the case again against their great rivals high in the Dolomites.\n\nA shot here and a shot there was the difference, as Canada kept their shape better in the big moments and confirmed their own progress.\n\n\"That wasn't a game where we played well,\" vice-skip Grant Hardie told BBC Sport. \"We made too many mistakes and we're running out of time to put it right.\n\n\"I think we can deliver the right result tomorrow and hopefully get into the semis.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nMouat's rink have an excellent record against Brad Jacobs' team, and beat them in the last four of the worlds last spring.\n\nBut the Canadians knew they could improve their own chances - and inflict a little revenge - and they started strongly, opening a 3-1 lead after three ends.\n\nThe British team are considered the world's best, though, and righted themselves. Capitalising on a slight drop off by their opponents, they took two themselves in the fourth and another two in the sixth to lead with four to play.\n\nHowever, the clank of granite went against them in the seventh, an unfortunate bounce leaving Canada the chance of three, which they gladly took.\n\nMouat and his team needed to respond. They couldn't. Instead, they gave up a steal to leave themselves with a three-point deficit with two ends to play.\n\nIt was a deficit that they could not overcome. And now, their aspirations of upgrading their silver medal from Beijing are no longer in their own hands.\n\nGB's women are also in a perilous position, and also must beat the United States on Wednesday (08:05), as well as Japan later in the day (18:05) and Italy on Thursday (13:05) if they are to scrape into the last four.\n\nTeam GB finished 12th in the two-man bobsleigh after brakeman Taylor Lawrence withdrew from the final two runs and was replaced by Leon Greenwood.\n\nA statement from Team GB said that Lawrence, who missed several World Cup races last season because of a calf injury, sat out the race as a \"precautionary measure\" in preparation for the four-man event that begins later this week.\n\nGreenwood, making his Olympic debut, and pilot Brad Hall clocked 55.72 seconds and 56.17secs to give them a combined overall time of 3:43:43.\n\nIt was a disappointing showing from Hall, who is GB's most decorated men's bobsleigh pilot in World Cup history with 30 race medals.\n\n\"It wasn't plan A but with Leon [Greenwood] coming in last minute, we wanted to keep Taylor [Lawrence] safe, ready for the four-man,\" Hall told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We knew we were out of contention for the two-man so we just used it as extra training runs for the four-man.\"\n\nIt was a German clean sweep on the podium as Johannes Lochner and Georg Fleischhauer won gold while legendary pilot Francesco Friedrich and Alexander Schuller took silver with Adam Ammour and Alexander Schaller bronze.\n\nThe four-man event begins on Saturday with the medal-deciding runs on Sunday.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Walsall head coach Mat Sadler said \"it's not my job to worry about that\" following a statement from the club's board last week in the midst of their stuttering promotion challenge.\n\nThe Saddlers have seen a four-point lead at the top of League Two in December whittle away into a 14-point deficit behind current leaders Bromley, slipping from first place to ninth in the process.\n\nTheir run of one win in eight league games since 26 December has seen them drop one point outside the play-off places and led to the board to announce last Friday they were \"aware of the urgency to improve results\".\n\nIn the build up to Wednesday's game at Grimsby, Sadler was asked about his take on what the board said.\n\n\"It's not my job to worry about that,\" he told BBC Radio WM.\n\n\"It's my job to make sure the players see me, win, lose or draw as exactly the same person.\n\n\"My role is doing exactly what we've done for the last three and a half years through scrutiny, through every single part of that.\"\n\n\"The belief I have in the players and their willingness to work all comes though me.

I'm certainly not looking back. I never will be because this is a completely different group and team,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not a completely different environment - we get constant reminders about that - our job is to focus on us and not on what anyone else is saying - good and bad.\n\n\"I live in a positive world. I recognise where we are, and where we want to get to, and we do that doing it our way.\n\n\"Everyone's human and different things happen. Sometimes that edge of uncertainty can affect people. It's our job to bring clarity and a restart.\"",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — First came the expletives. Then the allegations. Then the media glare and hilarious memes.\n\nGlobal interest in curling surged over the past week when a cheating controversy erupted at the Winter Olympics, rocking a staid, 500-year-old sport known for its etiquette, manners and friendliness.\n\nAfter a wild few days for curling featuring plenty of verbal jousting and a brief rule change, things have calmed down and both players and officials appear ready to move on with the medal games approaching.\n\n“It’s the Olympics,” said Canadian curler Ben Hebert, whose team has been a central character in the controversy. “It’ll be over in two weeks and everyone will go back to covering curling in four years.”\n\nYet the headline-grabbing saga has highlighted some issues in a sport eager for exposure – and one slowly becoming more professional — but maybe isn’t ready for all the trappings that come with it.\n\nSweden crying foul over a rule infringement, an illegal double-touch by Canada’s Marc Kennedy in the act of releasing his stone down the ice, called into question whether the so-called “spirit of curling” had been broken.\n\nCurling, after all, has long been a tight-knit sport where players typically call their own fouls, shake hands at the end of a match and share a beer or two afterwards.\n\nThe Swedish and Canadian players have been long-time rivals but they’re also friendly. Couldn’t they just have dealt with this behind closed doors without all the bruising?\n\n“That’s where I think the spirit of curling is in a little bit of trouble,” Kennedy said, “and honestly that’s probably come from the quest for medals. But it’s OK. It’s all about the evolution of the sport. There’s opportunity here as well, right? For the sport to really figure it out as we all go forward.”\n\nIt seems the top of the sport isn’t quite ready for that.\n\nThere are no video replays in curling, unlike with sports like soccer, cricket and in the NFL, so officials aren’t allowed to re-umpire decisions like the hog line violation apparently committed by Kennedy when he poked one of the granite stones with his outstretched finger after releasing it.\n\nIn response, curling’s higher-ups first stationed umpires at the hog line to check for future fouls, but then reverted to the traditional practice of players policing themselves.\n\n“We’re trying to spread the word about our culture, and our culture is one based on integrity, and honor, and friendship,” World Curling President Beau Welling told The Associated Press in a phone interview. “We live by this code — the spirit of curling — where you’re expected to have honorable conduct on ice, but also off ice.\n\n“Obviously, this has been tested a little bit this week. But, fundamentally, that’s who we are,” he said. “And I really don’t see that changing.”\n\nSome might see this as sweeping the issue under curling's rug.\n\nYet this is the Olympic Games — it’s serious business, being played out in front of curling’s biggest audience.\n\n“Curling needs to professionalize a little bit,” Canada Curling CEO Nolan Thiessen told the AP at the Cortina Curling Center. “If we want to be where we want to be as a sport, there’s some steps we have to take, and some give and take probably. You know, having officials making subjective calls ... there’s a lot of sports that have that. And we probably need to get there as opposed to, ‘I think you did this’ and ‘Well, I don’t think I did.’\n\n“We’re trying,” he added, “to find the right balance as a sport.”\n\nThe Olympics soon will be without Sweden’s defending champion men’s team, which was officially eliminated from semifinal contention on Tuesday after a sixth loss in seven matches in round-robin play.\n\n“We maybe should have done something different and could have dealt with it differently,” Sweden skip Niklas Edin said of what he described as a “horrible week.”\n\nPlenty of curling traditionalists will no doubt agree with that.\n\nAP Sports Writer Jimmy Golen and Associated Press writer Julia Frankel contributed to this story.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Speedskater Andrea Giovannini knew he was going to celebrate with Steph Curry's “Night night” celebration if he could help Italy beat the favored U.S. in the men’s team pursuit final at the Milan Cortina Olympics on Tuesday.\n\nGiovannini just didn't want to tell teammates Davide Ghiotto and Michele Malfatti ahead of time, in case things didn't go well. Not a problem. The Italians claimed the gold medal by finishing 4 1/2 seconds faster than the American world record-holders, and that margin was so large that Giovannini pulled his two white-gloved hands together and pressed them to the side of his head at the close, just the way NBA star Curry does.\n\n“The last lap, we were in control,” Giovannini said, “and I was just waiting for that finish line to emulate Steph.”\n\nGiovannini said he remembered watching on TV during the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics when Curry did his signature move after one of his late 3-pointers sealed a 98-87 victory for the U.S. against France to win gold in men's basketball.\n\n“Emblematic of having cold blood,” Giovannini said.\n\nSo a couple of days ago, Giovannini was chatting with his Olympic roommate, speedskating teammate Francesco Betti, and told him he planned to go with the “Night night.”\n\n“It happened,” Giovannini said. “I was worried I would forget.”\n\nOne of the other team pursuit gold medalists, Ghiotto, said later he hadn't seen what Giovannini did — and actually wasn't even sure what the whole thing was about, because he wasn't aware of who Curry is.\n\nHearing that, Giovannini joked: “Tonight we’ll watch a basketball game.”\n\nThe American trio of Casey Dawson, Emery Lehman and Ethan Cepurian — who got the bronze in the event at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and set the world record in November — weren't aware of Giovannini's gesture.\n\n“It’s better,” Lehman said with a big laugh, “than getting two middle fingers from the Russians four years ago.”\n\nAP Sports Writer Daniella Matar contributed to this report.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "One of the world's richest men and his son get another shot at the media conglomerate, which includes Warner Bros., HBO and CNN.",
    "fullText": "Larry and David Ellison are getting another shot to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe media conglomerate announced Tuesday that it will let the Ellisons make another bid for the company over the next week, with two key stipulations: Their offer has to be more than $31 for each share of WBD, and it will be the last time the Ellisons get to make a formal pitch to the WBD board.\n\nWBD's announcement reopens a deal that was theoretically closed last December, when it agreed to sell most of itself to Netflix in an $83 billion transaction.\n\nSince then, the Ellisons, who bought Paramount last year and want to merge it with WBD, have argued that their offer of $30 per share — for the entire company — was better than Netflix's offer.\n\nThey have repeatedly told WBD and its investors that they should get another shot at making their case. Their most recent pitch came a week ago, when they offered to pay billions \n\nNow, WBD says, they have one more opportunity to bid. WBD says they expect the Ellisons to increase their offer to more than $31 a share. The company is trading around $28 a share, up 170% in the last year.\n\nIn a press release, WBD officials say that last week, a \"senior representative\" for Paramount told them that if they had the chance to bid, they would offer $31 per share, but could go above that.\n\nNone of this means the existing deal Netflix has with WBD goes away. For starters, WBD continues to formally endorse its Netflix deal. More important: If Paramount does increase its bid, Netflix will have the ability to raise its offer, too.\n\nAnd no matter what bid WBD eventually agrees to, the deal will still need regulatory approval in the US and overseas. Netflix got a preview of some of the issues regulators might bring up earlier this month during a congressional hearing, when Republicans argued that the company is too woke, and Democrats worried that a combined Netflix/WBD could doom the movie industry.\n\nA Paramount/WBD combination would also get regulatory scrutiny, though the Ellisons are counting on their ties to the Trump White House to give them a leg up.",

    "description": "The US has the world's largest military budget. Here's how military budgets compare around the world, and what they reveal about military priorities.",
    "fullText": "The US has the world's most expensive military, spending nearly $1 trillion on defense. That's roughly four times China's reported defense budget, the next largest.\n\nFrom spending on nuclear technology to advanced aircraft and warships, the world's top militaries allocate hundreds of billions of dollars each year to stay ahead.\n\nIn some countries, big-ticket items such as naval assets or technologically advanced aircraft or missiles account for the bulk of military spending, while others devote large sums to maintaining large conscription troop systems.\n\nUltimately, military spending varies by country depending on location and interests, Gian Gentile, a retired US Army colonel and senior historian at RAND, told Business Insider. Some countries prioritize homeland defense while others value overmatch and far-reaching power projection.\n\n\"The US spends a lot on more sophisticated, extremely precise weapon systems,\" he said.\n\nA military's budget can be measured either as a total amount or as a share of its country's GDP, reflecting the burden on its economy. Worldwide, countries spent an average of 2.4% of their GDP on defense in 2024.\n\nWartime spending as a share of GDP typically rises, putting strain on the civilian economy, said Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Ukraine in 2024, for example, devoted over 15% of its GDP to its military, the highest share globally.\n\nSpending statistics help paint a picture of defense priorities, but they don't always translate into readiness for conflict.\n\n\"Readiness is very expensive, and perishable,\" Cancian said.\n\nA country's on-paper investment in its defense systems doesn't always translate directly into military capability, he added. Training and maintenance are often overlooked in analyses of spending on equipment and technologies.\n\nA particularly significant cost when it comes to technologically advanced aircraft, for instance, is maintenance and sustainment.\n\nStill, looking at military budgets can reveal how much capital each country relies on to defend itself.\n\nLast year, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank, released its Military Balance report, which included data on nearly every country's defense budget based on each's reported 2024 figures.\n\nThe report includes each country's total budget (in US dollars), per-capita figures, and defense budget as a share of GDP. Some countries, such as North Korea, Libya, Syria, Cuba, and Afghanistan, did not publicly report their defense budgets.\n\nThese are the 30 countries that spend the most on their military, ranked by the size of their defense budgets.\n\nDefense budget per capita: $3,785\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,776\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,157\n\nDefense budget per capita: $301\n\nDefense budget per capita: $170\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,517\n\nDefense budget per capita: $799\n\nDefense budget per capita: $411\n\nDefense budget per capita: $455\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,220\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,328\n\nDefense budget per capita: $111\n\nDefense budget per capita: $696\n\nDefense budget per capita: $723\n\nDefense budget per capita: $797\n\nDefense budget per capita: $3,589\n\nDefense budget per capita: $578\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,360\n\nDefense budget per capita: $842\n\nDefense budget per capita: $430\n\nDefense budget per capita: $937\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,963\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,184\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,022\n\nDefense budget: $120.32 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $854\n\nDefense budget: $234.98 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $166\n\nDefense budget: $967.96 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,831",

    "fullText": "Former Ireland captain Johnny Sexton has said he does not think Edwin Edogbo \"paid too much attention\" to the racist abuse that was directed at him following his international debut.\n\nThe Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) had to turn off comments on a social media post that congratulated the Cork-born player for coming off the bench in the Six Nations game against Italy because of replies that contained racial abuse.\n\nOn Tuesday, the IRFU said it is hopeful \"we can bring something to the Gardai [Irish police]\" regarding the abuse.\n\n\"It's horrible to see that in this day and age, it still exists like that,\" said Ireland assistant coach Sexton.\n\n\"In terms of how he is, he's good. I don't think he would have paid too much attention to it, and I don't know if he would have even seen most of it.\n\n\"He's a pretty humble guy, really level-headed, but it's not right, some of the comments that were made.\n\n\"I feel for him, I feel for his family, it marred a pretty special day for him.\"\n\nIRFU keen to 'hold people to account' for racist abuse\n\nKeyboard warriors should 'cop on and help 10s' - Farrell\n\nI think Crowley starts against England - Murray\n\nSexton was speaking before Ireland's match against England on Saturday amid ongoing uncertainty over who will in the long term fill the number 10 jersey he wore with distinction.\n\nSam Prendergast has started both Six Nations games this year, but head coach Andy Farrell has Jack Crowley, Ciaran Frawley and Harry Byrne as options against England.\n\n\"It's important that they all keep developing and getting game-time,\" added Sexton, who won 118 Ireland caps.\n\n\"So there are four guys and all the criticism from previous World Cup cycles is that we didn't develop guys, and we have relied too heavily on one [player] in some positions.\n\n\"So we're doing it a different way now and whether that's right or wrong, everyone judges it by the outcome but I know that in games to come, they're going to hit their best form and they'll be in a good place.\"\n\nThe former British and Irish Lions fly-half emphasised Ireland's eagerness to have strength in depth for next year's World Cup.\n\n\"All four are very good, they've all got their different strengths and as coaches I think we are trying to make sure that we have lots of options going to a World Cup, try and learn from previous cycles and make sure that we give them all a certain number of caps,\" he added.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we see their form in different pressurised situations, in different venues against different opposition and yeah, I'm sure it will be like that for the foreseeable.\"",

    "fullText": "Oli Burke insists he has given little thought to a Scotland recall for the World Cup and is simply focusing on doing well for Union Berlin in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe 28-year-old joined Union on a long-term contract in the summer and has scored four goals this season, including a hat-trick against Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\n\"I'm just focused on my football here and what happens, happens really,\" Burke, who earned the last of his 13 caps in 2020, said.\n\n\"I've not really thought too much on it. Obviously, I know there's a World Cup coming up, but I've not really been a part of it recently.\n\n\"I'm not really expecting anything. I'm just enjoying myself and enjoying football again, which is the most important thing for me.\n\n\"If I can, hopefully, do some good performances, score some more goals and hopefully that is catching the eye a little bit and gives me a chance, at least.\n\n\"Obviously, it's an absolute honour to wear the badge and represent your country. It's such a privilege. Obviously, I would really love that again and to have that experience again.\n\n\"I cannot think too much on that. I have to just stay focused and do the best I can here and see what happens.\"\n\nBurke is in his third spell in Germany, having made his first move to the Bundesliga in 2016, when he joined RB Leipzeg from Nottingham Forest for what was then a record fee for a Scottish player of £13m.\n\n\"I was young, the price tag, I didn't really know too much about it,\" he recalled. \"I didn't really understand it so much at that age. As I got older, it started to weigh a little bit.\n\n\"In football, everything happens quickly. You have your good moments and then there can be bad moments.\n\n\"It's been kind of like this throughout my career. Many ups and many downs.\"\n\nBurke, who joined Union from Werder Bremen, says the experience he has in Germany has developed him.\n\n\"I almost feel like a different player, but obviously that comes with maturing,\" he said. \"Knowing your job better and being more effective in your role, defensively as well.\n\n\"It's just about adapting really.\"\n\nIn 2019, Burke had a spell on loan to Celtic, who play Stuttgart on Thursday in the Europa League play-off, and he is predicting a difficult tie for his former club.\n\n\"Stuttgart are not an easy team,\" he said. \"They're doing brilliantly this season.\n\n\"Celtic are an amazing club. I love the club. I still watch here and there.\n\n\"I watched the Kilmarnock game the other day. I was saying to my wife 'they're going to score in the last minute' because it's just Celtic typical.\"\n\nKirkcaldy-born Burke also had a stint with Alaves in Spain after his time with Celtic.\n\n\"When you move abroad, it's also important to try and embed yourself into the culture quickly and become close with your team-mates as fast as you can,\" he added.\n\n\"Create a bond, not just on the pitch but off it as well, so that you feel more comfortable and you feel more at home.\"",

They called me that when I was younger,” he said to ESPN.\n\n“But some people also tell me I play like Ibrahima Konate. It’s very similar. He’s a leader. For a defender, it’s very important to be a leader. Off and on the pitch, I talk a lot. It’s an important job. I think I anticipate well.\n\n“With the ball, I can pick a good pass.

    "fullText": "England captain Leah Williamson returns to the squad for the first time since Euro 2025 as they prepare to begin their 2027 Women's World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nWilliamson, 28, missed England's friendly victories over China, Ghana and Australia as well as their defeat by Brazil at the end of 2025 due to a knee injury.\n\nThe Arsenal defender had surgery after lifting England's second successive European title in July and returned to action at the start of December.\n\n\"I'm very happy. It feels really good for her too. She has trained lots and I'm in close contact with her and the club,\" said manager Sarina Wiegman.\n\n\"There are more players who are still building and that is one of the reasons why we went with a bigger squad.\"\n\nSeveral big names return to the squad including Chelsea forward Lauren James, Manchester City defender Alex Greenwood and goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.\n\nJames, 24, was absent for four months with an ankle injury before returning in November and is now back to full fitness.\n\nShe impressed in Sunday's win over Liverpool and boosts Wiegman's attacking options with Arsenal's Beth Mead out with a fractured shin.\n\nGreenwood, 32, missed the start of the season with a knee injury while Hampton had a thigh issue which ruled her out of the November camp.\n\nThere is a first senior call-up for London City Lionesses defender Poppy Pattinson, while uncapped 20-year-old Freya Godfrey retains her place in the squad.\n\nAston Villa goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck also earns a recall, with Manchester City's Khiara Keating dropping out of the squad.\n\n\"[Roebuck] came in the last camp of course because we had some injuries. She has got some minutes [with Villa] so it's really good to see her back, see her happy and being available. She is playing and training fully,\" added Wiegman.\n\n\"Keating will be with the under-23s. We all know she is a very talented goalkeeper. I had big concerns about her playing minutes over this last season.\n\n\"It's a long period of time. There is also competition with the other goalkeepers.\"\n\nGotham FC defender Jess Carter is back after she was given time to recover from the conclusion of the National Women's Soccer League play-offs in November.\n\nEngland are without Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, who is out with a hip injury until the end of March.\n\nBay FC defender Anouk Denton, 22, who made her debut as a late substitute in December, is not included in the squad.\n\nThe Lionesses travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThey are the first competitive games since England's success in Switzerland and they will meet reigning world champions Spain later in their qualifying group.\n\nThere are eight international windows before England hope to travel to Brazil for the World Cup between 24 June and 25 July 2027.\n\n\"It's a new year with new objectives as we start our qualification journey with these two very important fixtures against Ukraine and Iceland,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"This is new opposition for this England team, so that's exciting too. I am looking forward to being back with the squad and getting back to work.\"\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nLondon City Lionesses defender Pattinson has featured for England's youth teams and is the latest to make the jump up to the senior squad.\n\nShe follows in the footsteps of team-mate Godfrey, who is yet to make her debut having been selected for the friendlies against Ghana and China.\n\nWiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to watch Pattinson in London City Lionesses' 2-1 defeat by Manchester United and delivered the news of her England call-up this week.\n\n\"It was a short conversation but she was really happy and really grateful. She can't wait to come in so that was a nice phone call,\" Wiegman told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"She deserved the call-up because she has played really well. What we have seen the most is that she is very proactive and takes a lot of initiative.\n\n\"She can cover the whole wing on the left side. At the same time, she wants to play forward and is looking for passes forward which I thought was really good.\n\n\"Although she is not the tallest, she does use her body well in defence. Let's see how she relates to the other players we have in the squad.\"\n\nGoalkeepers: Hannah Hampton (Chelsea), Anna Moorhouse (Orlando Pride), Ellie Roebuck (Aston Villa)\n\nDefenders: Lucy Bronze (Chelsea), Jess Carter (Gotham), Grace Fisk (Liverpool), Alex Greenwood (Manchester City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Maya Le Tissier (Manchester United), Esme Morgan (Washington Spirit), Taylor Hinds (Arsenal), Poppy Pattinson (London City Lionesses), Leah Williamson (Arsenal)\n\nMidfielders: Grace Clinton (Manchester City), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Keira Walsh (Chelsea), Laura Blindkilde Brown (Manchester City), Lucia Kendell (Aston Villa)\n\nForwards: Chloe Kelly (Arsenal), Lauren James (Chelsea), Aggie Beever-Jones (Chelsea), Alessia Russo (Arsenal), Lauren Hemp (Manchester City), Freya Godfrey (London City Lionesses), Jess Park (Manchester United)",

    "fullText": "China is a huge market for the NBA, and that is nothing new. Among the league’s international audiences, few countries can go toe to toe with the second-most populous nation in the world. Because of that, the NBA makes sure to establish its presence on the ground every single year. The face of the league, LeBron James, understands this as well.\n\nJames has been to China 15 times so far for his Nike promo tour. It’s also not been that long since his last visit, with the King traveling to China as recently as 2025 to promote his “Forever King” tour, to promote his LeBron 23 shoes. Was it also a farewell visit? One last visit to China?\n\nNot according to James, who, during media availability at All-Star Weekend, admitted that he would like to make another trip to the East.\n\n“To all my fans and people over there it’s always been great,” James stated. “Always welcomed me and my friends and family in open arms. I’ve always appreciated it, they’re be another opportunity for me to go over there at some point.”\n\nJames has remained coy on his relationship with China over the years. He found himself in hot water in 2019 when he went against Daryl Morey’s statement on China.\n\n“I don’t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke.”\n\nSince then James has returned to China on a semi-regular basis as he did before the incident as well. So, it’s safe to say he’s welcome in the country to quite a fair extent.\n\nEven if James retires from the NBA after the 2025-26 season, as some believe he will, Nike, which has supported him throughout his career, would still look to capitalize on his popularity in China. Both James and the iconic American brand remain hugely popular there, despite the political tensions between the two countries.\n\nAt the same time, it looks as though James has another country in his mind he would love to visit. And that’s Israel.\n\nIn the same presser in L.A., James was asked about his thoughts on the Middle-Eastern country, and his reply showed that he really wanted to go there. “If I have fans over there — I’ve never been there — I hope you follow my career, I hope I inspire people over there.”\n\n“Not only to be great in sports, but to be better in general in life, hopefully someday I can make it over there,” the Lakers icon added. “I’ve heard great things and I appreciate the question.”\n\nFor now, though, James cannot travel anywhere that far from home. Crunch time in the season is here with the All-Star break nearly over, and his focus is solely on possibly ending his career with a fifth ring.\n\nThe post LeBron James Admits To Wanting To Visit China “At Some Point” appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Nvidia was his dream job, but he got turned down. So this 30-year-old regrouped and strategized. He shares how he got a job offer there.",
    "fullText": "As Sylendran Arunagiri considered moving from India to the US to pursue a master's degree, some friends and mentors advised him to delay his move. They warned that the US tech job market had become too challenging.\n\nArunagiri's goal was to move to the US in late 2023, begin a master's program in product management at Carnegie Mellon University, and land a Big Tech internship for the summer of 2024. He hoped this would be a stepping stone toward landing an AI-related role, ideally at Nvidia, his \"dream company\" because of its central role in the AI technologies he'd long wanted to work on.\n\nHowever, there were several things working against him. For one, the US tech hiring landscape was already creating headaches for job seekers. Openings had plummeted from highs reached a year earlier, and industry layoffs were increasing competition for available roles.\n\nAdditionally, Arunagiri had grown accustomed to the job market in India, where he earned a bachelor's degree and an MBA from top institutions that he said relied on structured campus placement programs to funnel many students directly into jobs. But from what he'd heard, the US was very different. Job fairs were often more like networking events than recruiting opportunities.\n\n\"You're completely on your own,\" said the 30-year-old, who now lives in San Jose.\n\nArunagiri is among the many job seekers who have struggled to navigate a US hiring landscape that's become more challenging in recent years. Amid economic uncertainty, the early effects of generative AI adoption, and a broader push to streamline operations, US businesses are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.\n\nStill, some people have managed to break through in a challenging market. Arunagiri shared how he pursued his goal of working at Nvidia — a company he described as his dream employer — and offered his top advice for other job seekers.\n\nMany of the tech companies Arunagiri was targeting had conducted summer internship interviews the previous fall, so he began applying before moving to the US. After sending out many applications, he landed an interview with Nvidia in November 2023.\n\nArunagiri said the interview process went so well that he stopped applying to other internships. But after moving to the US and completing his final interview in February, he learned that he wouldn't be getting the role — which left him scrambling to find another internship.\n\n\"I had to start from scratch, but by then many of the applications had dried out,\" he said\n\nArunagiri was able to land an AI product manager internship based in India at the tech company Informatica. However, that summer, he found it difficult to stop thinking about what went wrong during his interview process with Nvidia — and began setting his sights on eventually landing a full-time role with the company.\n\nUpon reflection, Arunagiri suspected that his final Nvidia interview may have doomed him. He said he was lower energy than usual because he was feeling sick that day, and that he'd been hesitant to postpone it out of fear that the opportunity would be filled in the meantime. In hindsight, he said that decision was likely a mistake.\n\n\"I came off as a dull candidate, but I'm usually energetic and conversational,\" he said. \"I should have probably postponed it to a day that I was feeling better.\"\n\nArunagiri decided to reach out to an HR professional from Nvidia to get insight into where he fell short, and they agreed to jump on a call with him. While they didn't provide specific insights into his candidacy, he said they recommended he try to connect with people at Nvidia in current roles, including hiring managers and interns, to get insight into the kinds of projects they were working on and how he could better align his profile.\n\nHe eventually connected with about five Nvidia interns, who he said provided valuable insights. Those conversations helped shape the personal AI-related projects he began pursuing and sharing on LinkedIn in hopes of standing out.\n\nAfter the summer, Arunagiri dove back into the job search, eager to land a role before he graduated in December 2024. He knew that if he didn't land a job within 90 days after graduation, his F-1 visa restrictions would force him to return to India.\n\nIn September 2024, he submitted a cold application for a technical product marketing role in agentic AI at Nvidia —a role he described as his \"dream AI role\" at his dream company. He was asked to interview starting in October, and around the same time, he was also invited to interview for a more junior product management role at Microsoft.\n\nIn December, with his graduation looming later that month, Arunagiri received offers from Nvidia and Microsoft within days of each other. Given that Nvidia was his dream employer, the role checked a lot of his boxes, and the pay was higher than Microsoft's, he said the decision was fairly easy — and he accepted Nvidia's offer. He said that so far, working at Nvidia has been \"everything that I've dreamed of.\"\n\nArunagiri believes that his LinkedIn presence helped him stand out. During the interview process, he said, the hiring manager told him that he'd reviewed his LinkedIn profile and noticed the projects he'd been working on, including small experiments with new generative AI tools and models he'd shared publicly.\n\nHe has a few pieces of advice for job seekers. First, he said, time management is key, particularly because applying for jobs and connecting with people can be time-consuming. Second, he said, never compare your job search journey to anyone else's, since a variety of factors can influence how it plays out.\n\nRather than quietly applying and networking, he recommends sharing tangible projects publicly — such as posting about AI tools you've explored and linking to projects on LinkedIn or a personal website — so hiring managers can see your work.\n\n\"You need to find something that sets you apart from others,\" he said.",

    "description": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the last person to leave the Toronto dugout after the Game 7 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series last fall because the star slugger wanted that to be the moment when he moved on.  The first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.  “When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter.",
    "fullText": "DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the last person to leave the Toronto dugout after the Game 7 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series last fall because the star slugger wanted that to be the moment when he moved on.\n\nThe first full workout for the Blue Jays at spring training Monday brought some clarity to that plan.\n\n“When I left, I felt like I had faced reality, and the only thing I had left to say to myself was just thank God for the year I had, for the year the team had had,” Guerrero said through an interpreter. “Right then, I just turned the page.”\n\nThe Blue Jays lost the decisive game 5-4 in 11 innings, missing on a second consecutive chance to clinch the franchise's third championship at home. For manager John Schneider, this spring training is no different from a year ago.\n\n“The main message is we’re not defending anything,” Schneider said. “We’re not defending the AL East. We’re not defending the American League. We’re attacking 2026 like we did in 2025 or any year, really. You’re trying to win the division, you’re trying to win the World Series. That’s it.”\n\nGuerrero jolted the franchise at the start of the spring last year, when he said there was no deal on a new contract and that his own deadline for getting one done had passed, raising the specter of free agency in 2026.\n\nInstead, the sides settled on a $500 million, 14-year contract early last season, and the son of Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero went on to hit .292 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs.\n\nIn the postseason, Guerrero had a 1.289 OPS while hitting .397 with eight homers in 18 games and was MVP of the American League Championship Series. He didn't homer in any of his first three trips to the playoffs, and the Blue Jays lost all six of those games.\n\n“Going back to the postseason last year, I think it’s really cool for everyone to be on that heightened stage and to see how they responded,” Schneider said. “I think that kind of bleeds into this year, but (Guerrero) has been a little bit more vocal than I’ve ever seen him, a little bit more loose than I’ve ever seen him and understands that he’s one of the best players in the game.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Guerrero, a five-time All-Star, is now the longest-tenured Blue Jays player.\n\n“I don’t see myself as a leader,” Guerrero said. “I always put myself as a good teammate, and when you are a good teammate, then you become a good leader. I’m a good teammate.”\n\nHis role as the face of the franchise was cemented when Bo Bichette left the team, signing a $126 million, three-year with the New York Mets and moving from shortstop to third base.\n\n“It’s difficult not having him around,” said Guerrero, who played with Bichette through the minor leagues. “I mean, we played 10 years together. But at the same time, I understand it’s business, and he has to take care of his family as well.”\n\nThe Blue Jays signed Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto to fill the void left by Bichette while adding pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce.\n\n“I think we’re very capable,” Guerrero said. “I think it’s going to be more fun, and I’m actually more happy than last year.”\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

so they will want to ensure there are no slip-ups in their first qualifying matches of the year.\n\nEngland have been drawn in a qualifying group alongside 2023 winners Spain - who beat the Lionesses in the final - as well as Ukraine and Iceland.\n\nWiegman will name her squad for the first time in 2026 on Tuesday at 11:00 - who might feature and what are the key decisions for the Dutchwoman?\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nEngland have not had a competitive fixture since winning Euro 2025 as they beat China 8-0 and Ghana 2-0 in friendly matches at the end of last year.\n\nBefore that, they suffered a 2-1 defeat by Brazil on their homecoming return but recorded a 3-0 win over Australia three days later.\n\nThe matches gave Wiegman an opportunity to test new players and formations - handing a debut to 30-year-old goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse in the process.\n\nAmong those to receive their first senior call-ups to the squad were defenders Anouk Denton, Taylor Hinds and forward Freya Godfrey.\n\nThere was also time for England stars Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze and Lauren James to recover from lengthy injuries.\n\nChelsea defender Millie Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final in 2023, announced her retirement in October having withdrawn from the Euros.\n\nThere was a serious blow for Arsenal forward Michelle Agyemang - one of England's key players in Switzerland - as she was carried off on a stretcher after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during the win over Australia.\n\nBut it's been a successful time for the other Lionesses in Arsenal's squad, including captain Williamson, who lifted the Champions Cup in February.\n\nAnd Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was named the world's best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards in September, as Wiegman picked up the best coach award.\n\nHampton also wrapped up the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award in November after being caught up in the fallout of Mary Earps' autobiography, which was released earlier that month.\n\nMost of Wiegman's key players have returned from injury in recent weeks - but there will still be some noteable absentees.\n\nManchester United midfielder Ella Toone is out with a hip issue until the end of March so will not feature against Ukraine or Iceland.\n\nThere are not many midfield options available with Aston Villa's Missy Bo Kearns also absent, while team-mate Lucia Kendall came off the bench to play 28 minutes of Villa's 7-3 thrashing by Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance in five weeks due to a thigh injury.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal winger Beth Mead fractured her shin so is out but Chloe Kelly made her return at the end of January and is available for selection.\n\nArsenal defender Hinds has had an ankle injury that has kept her out for a few weeks but she could still be included.\n\nChelsea full-back Niamh Charles is also sidelined with an ankle injury but team-mate Aggie Beever-Jones came on as an 83rd-minute substitute in their win over Liverpool on Sunday so her return is timely.\n\nTottenham full-back Ella Morris is close to returning from the ACL injury she suffered last year but will not be back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Agyemang and Arsenal defender Katie Reid are still recovering from their respective ACL injuries.\n\nThere remains a lack of full-back options for Wiegman with Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier seen as back-up for Bronze despite playing her club football at centre-back every week.\n\nCharles' absence and Hinds' recent injury means there are limited options at left-back too - meaning Manchester City's Alex Greenwood could once again make the switch from centre-back to full-back.\n\nThere could be a recall for Bay FC's Anouk Denton, who moved to the American club from West Ham in February, two months after making her England debut.\n\nLondon City Lionesses forward Godfrey has impressed this season and Wiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to see her grab an assist in a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United.\n\nThe 20-year-old was called up for the first time in November but remains uncapped - so she will hope to feature this time around.\n\nTeam-mate Izzy Goodwin could be a surprise call-up in Beth Mead's absence, though Chelsea's James is back so Wiegman has other attacking options.\n\nWiegman will need to manage players like Kelly, Bronze and Keira Walsh who have not been fully fit in recent weeks and they may not be able to start both games.\n\nBut she will have been boosted by James' impressive display for Chelsea on Sunday, while Jess Park has shone for United and Lauren Hemp for Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "England narrowly avoided a disaster in their final T20 World Cup group match against Italy on Monday.\n\nHarry Brook won the toss and controversially decided to bat first at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.\n\nEngland were 105/5 after a shaky opening 13 overs before Will Jacks rescued the innings with an unbeaten 53 from 22 balls.\n\nItaly then battled back from 22/3 to 135/4 in their run chase, making the England players and fans nervous.\n\nHowever, the Italians ultimately collapsed to 178 all out, and the Three Lions qualified for the Super 8s.\n\nBrook made an interesting comment about England’s performance in his post-match interview, which many will disagree with.\n\nHarry Brook has every reason to be pleased with his team’s progression into the last eight of the competition.\n\nHowever, it would be foolish to suggest that England’s performance against Italy was anything to be proud of.\n\nItaly are the 26th-ranked team in the ICC T20I Team Rankings, so it should never have been a close contest.\n\nThat is why it was so surprising to hear Brook’s claim that England bowled well on Monday.\n\n“I thought we fielded excellently, and we bowled nicely as well,” he said. “I never had a doubt at the end with Sam [Curran] and Jamie [Overton]. Sam has been awesome, and he has been throughout this comp so far.\n\n“When Jof is on a heater, you want to get as much out of as possible – he did that today in his first couple of overs.”\n\nWithout question, England will need to bowl much better in the next stage of the tournament if they want to make the semi-finals.\n\nWhile Brook praised England’s bowlers, he did recognise that their batting unit must improve quickly.\n\n“We haven’t played our best cricket,” he added. “At the end of the day, we have made it through, and we’re heading to Sri Lanka, so we can be happy about that.\n\n“A little bit of a trend in this competition. We have not managed to string along the score as we like to do as a batting unit. We have got to keep on being brave and taking our options.”\n\n202 would normally be an excellent T20 score, but England would have hoped for at least 220 against cricket minnows Italy.\n\nBen Stokes finally has a rude awakening about importance of helmets in cricket\n\nMatthew Renshaw’s scathing interview reveals main culprit behind Australia’s disastrous loss vs. Zimbabwe\n\nSir Geoffrey Boycott reignites Joe Root debate after England’s T20 World Cup loss to West Indies",

    "fullText": "PARIS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - French police searched the Arab World Institute in Paris on Monday as part of a ‌probe into its former head, ex-culture minister Jack Lang, and ‌his links to late convicted U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, prosecutors said.\n\nFrance's National Financial Prosecutor (PNF) said ​in a statement that the Arab World Institute was among several locations being raided.\n\nProsecutors this month opened a preliminary investigation of Lang and his daughter Caroline on suspicion of tax fraud following the release of documents on Epstein in ‌the U.S.\n\nLang, who was ⁠culture minister under late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, resigned this month from the Arab World Institute, which he had led ⁠since 2013.\n\nHe has said he was unaware of Epstein's crimes despite corresponding with him between 2012 and 2019, 11 years after the financier was convicted of soliciting ​prostitution ​from an underage girl. Epstein died in ​prison by suicide in 2019.\n\nThe ‌Institute, which is overseen by France's foreign ministry, said it could not immediately comment on the police action.\n\nBoth Jack and Caroline Lang have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and receiving financial benefits from Epstein. Their lawyer Laurent Merlet told French broadcaster BFMTV this month that \"there was no movement of funds\".\n\nFallout from ‌the release of millions of new documents ​related to Epstein has rippled through Europe. On ​Saturday, Paris prosecutors set up ​a dedicated team to review the files, coordinating with the ‌financial prosecutor and national police.\n\nThe office ​said it was ​analysing several potential cases stemming from the Epstein files.\n\nOne concerns French diplomat Fabrice Aidan, alleged to have transferred United Nations documents to Epstein.\n\nAidan, ​who worked at the ‌U.N. from July 2006 to April 2013, has rejected the accusations ​through his lawyer.",

    "title": "Nvidia: A complete guide to the hardware company behind the AI boom",
    "description": "Nvidia is one of the world's most valuable companies. Read about its history, leadership, and financials.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia has been around for over three decades, but the chipmaker became a household name only in the past few years.\n\nIn October 2025, the AI chipmaker became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nNvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, \"with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets.\"\n\nThe boom in AI technology has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world as companies scramble to buy its graphics processing units. Here's what you need to know about Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's origin story began at a Denny's during a meeting between Huang — who once worked for the chain — Malachowsky, and Priem.\n\nPersonal computing was on the cusp of taking off, and the trio sought a way to capitalize on it. Huang said in a 2010 interview with Stanford University's engineering school that they \"wondered whether starting a graphics company would be a good idea.\"\n\n\"We brainstormed and fantasized about what kind of company it would be and the world we could help,\" he said. \"It was fun.\"\n\nTheir goal was to improve the experience of gaming on a PC.\n\nIn 2006, it released CUDA, a general-purpose programming interface that would expand its business far beyond gaming.\n\nOn Sequoia Capital's \"Crucible Moments\" podcast, Andrew Ng, a Stanford professor who founded Google Brain, recalled his students telling him, \"Hey, Andrew, there's this thing called CUDA — not that easy to program, but it's letting people use GPUs for something different.\"\n\n\"We started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training neural networks on GPUs because we could do 1,000 or 10,000 things in parallel rather than one step after another,\" he added.\n\nNvidia's GPUs were used to train AlexNet, an image classification system unveiled in 2012 that significantly influenced the field of deep learning.\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ushered Nvidia into a new era. The chipmaker's shares surged by more than 1,000% from 2022 to early 2026.\n\nMuch of that growth came from the success of Nvidia's H100 chip, which it released in March 2022. The $40,000 chip, named for the computer scientist Grace Hopper, has played a crucial role in providing the computing power for large language models.\n\nSince the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which are twice as fast as its Hopper chips, customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft have also flocked to the company.\n\nNvidia's success may be best personified by its CEO, Jensen Huang.\n\nA 61-year-old bona fide tech mogul, Huang has a net worth of about $165 billion, according to Forbes. While some execs sport chains or Patagonia vests, Huang is often spotted in a leather jacket. Business Insider identified at least six versions he's worn over the years, including a nearly $9,000 lizard-embossed coat from Tom Ford he wore at the company's global AI conference, GTC, in 2024. He commemorated Nvidia's stock price hitting $100 with a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his arm.\n\nHuang's early years were tumultuous. He was born in Taiwan, and he spent time there and in Thailand before his parents sent him to the United States because of social unrest in the region.\n\nHe attended a reform school in Kentucky. He later moved to Oregon, where he was reunited with his parents. In high school, he became a nationally ranked table tennis champion.\n\nHuang graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1984.\n\nDuring his freshman year, Huang met Lori Mills, his future wife. In an interview at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, he said he won her over by offering to help her with her homework. They married five years after meeting and now have two children.\n\nJensen Huang later earned a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford, and he worked at the chip companies LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices before launching Nvidia.\n\nHuang sold about 1.3 million shares of Nvidia when the company hit a $3 trillion market cap in June 2024, but he retains a more than 3% stake in the company.\n\nNvidia's business is built around GPUs, which can handle tasks simultaneously, as opposed to central processing units, or CPUs, which are in standard computers.\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become a mainstay of the AI revolution because they provide the computing power needed to run massive large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's Llama 3.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's H100 chips, built on its Hopper architecture, has been so high in late 2023 and 2024 that tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have bragged about how many units they're training new technology on. ByteDance has found workarounds to the US export bans on the chips to China. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bought up thousands of units to fuel their AI ambitions, while venture capitalists have bought Nvidia GPUs as backup units for their startups.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chips, which it says are twice as fast as its Hopper chips and have attracted customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft. The recent frenzy around the Chinese company DeepSeek's models has fueled demand for Nvidia's H200 chips.\n\nIn January 2025, Huang also unveiled new chips targeting the gaming, robotics, and autonomous vehicle industries, as well as partnerships with Toyota and Microsoft.\n\nAt the January 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled the new Vera Rubin architecture that will succeed Blackwell. During his presentation, Huang said Vera Rubin is built to confront the core problem of a surge in computing demand.\n\nCompared with Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, Huang said Rubin delivers more than three times the performance, can run inference up to five times faster, and offers significantly higher inference compute per watt.\n\nA key to Nvidia's success is also CUDA, a software layer that can link GPUs to almost any AI application a developer wants to run. It's a critical component of the competitive advantage, or moat, that Nvidia has built up over the years.\n\nStill, AMD, Nvidia's main competitor, is quietly catching up. In October 2025, AMD announced a major multi-year strategic partnership with OpenAI under which OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs for its AI infrastructure starting in the second half of 2026. The deal is expected to bring tens of billions of dollars in revenue to AMD over time.\n\nNvidia's other competitors include Intel and IBM. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have also released their own AI chips.\n\nNvidia overtook Apple and Microsoft for the title of the most valuable company in the world when it hit a historic $5 trillion in market capitalization in October 2025.\n\nAfter a tumultuous start to 2025 over chip export restrictions to China that would have cost billions in losses for Nvidia, Nvidia is heading into 2026 with confidence that demand for its AI chips is far from peaking.\n\nIn 2025, the chipmaker's blockbuster third-quarter results brought in $57 billion in revenue, including $51 billion from its data center business alone, beating Wall Street expectations. Nvidia raised its fourth-quarter forecast to $65 billion in sales, helping revive AI and semiconductor stocks after a brief slump. Shares of Nvidia and peers rallied on the upbeat outlook.\n\nHuang repeatedly dismissed fears of an AI bubble, arguing that the shift from CPUs to GPUs, the rise of agentic AI, and monetization through advertising all point to sustained growth. Nvidia also expanded its influence through major partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and hyperscalers such as Meta.\n\nLooking to 2026, Nvidia is betting big on next-generation chips like Blackwell Ultra, massive AI infrastructure projects, and growth areas including robotics and automotive. While US export restrictions on China remain a headwind, Nvidia expects hyperscalers and global AI investment to keep demand strong into next year.\n\nNvidia is based in Santa Clara, California. Nvidia's headquarters, known as Voyager, was designed by the architectural firm Gensler and is about 750,000 square feet.\n\nIt has parks, \"treehouses\" for gatherings, and places designed to help employees focus. However, the overall design is intended to facilitate Nvidia's flat organizational structure.\n\n\"When you're moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible,\" Huang told the Harvard Business Review in 2023.\n\nIt's also a way to create more harmony between leadership and workers. Huang, who in 2023 oversaw 50 direct reports, has said that CEOs \"by definition\" should have the most direct reports at a company.\n\nHuang has earned a reputation among those who work with him as a demanding boss. Meetings with Huang can get heated, and senior employees have described his tough questions as a \"Jensen grilling.\"\n\nNvidia's top executives include Ian Buck, a vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing; Colette Kress, the chief financial officer; and Bryan Catanzaro, a vice president of applied deep learning research.\n\nLanding a job at Nvidia isn't easy, but Lindsey Duran, a VP of recruitment, told BI that Nvidia applicants should express an interest in generative AI, tap into their professional network for referrals, and aim to do an internship.",

He needs to learn from what he did because it was a key moment in the game.\n\n\"He knows and he's owned it, but I want to see some action off the back of it.\"\n\nThursday, 19 February (19:30 GMT)\n\nWatch on BBC Three and BBC iPlayer; listen to commentary on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio Humberside\n\nMeanwhile, St Helens' Jackson Hastings has also avoided a ban as he was also given five penalty points for late contact on Warrington's Cai Taylor-Wray in the Wire's derby win.\n\nCatalans Dragons' Ben Garcia has been given a one-match ban for late contact on the passer in their win over Huddersfield Giants and Hull FC's Ligi Sao has been given a two-game suspension for dangerous contact in their victory over Bradford Bulls.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Pallekele\n\nAustralia 181 all out (20 overs): Head 56 (29); Hemantha 3-37\n\nSri Lanka 184-2 (18 overs): Nissanka 100* (52), Kusal Mendis 51 (38)\n\nAustralia's hopes of reaching the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup are all but over after Sri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka hit a brilliant unbeaten 100 to condemn them to an eight-wicket defeat in Pallekele.\n\nStunned by Zimbabwe in their second outing on Friday, Australia needed a win to keep their qualification fate in their own hands but it is Sri Lanka who march into the next round.\n\nFor Australia to sneak through as the second-placed team from their group, they now need Zimbabwe to lose both of their remaining matches against Ireland and Sri Lanka and then to defeat Oman themselves which would bring net run-rate into play.\n\nAustralia's predicament came from their inability to convert a good start from their openers Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh as they set the home side a target of 182 after a collapse in the second half of their innings.\n\nDespite the feeling Sri Lanka could have a complicated chase on their hands because of a pitch which was slowing down, they eased to victory with the Australian bowling attack lacking any bite in the absence of injured Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc.\n\nAnd the Sri Lanka duo of Nissanka and Kusal Mendis took full advantage.\n\nWith wicketkeeper Mendis providing perfect support with a composed 51 from 38 balls, Nissanka brought up his century in 52 balls to take his side past the finish line with an innings that blended brute power and finesse.\n\nAustralia had Marsh return after recovering from a groin injury that forced him out of the first two matches and the returning skipper gave his side a solid platform batting alongside Head, who hit a long-overdue half-century off 27 balls.\n\nThey powered Australia to 104-0 in 8.2 overs before Head departed for 59 and it marked the beginning of dramatic downturn.\n\nMarsh followed him shortly after with a brisk 54 as they unravelled alarmingly to be bundled out for 181, losing their final five wickets in the space of just seven runs and 14 balls.\n\nWith Sri Lanka chasing down the target with ease, the Australians are left clinging to only the slimmest mathematical hope and will watch nervously as Zimbabwe face Ireland on Tuesday.\n\nIt looked as though Sri Lanka's chase of 182 might slip away early when Kusal Perera fell to Marcus Stoinis only eight balls in.\n\nBut it became clear almost immediately Nissanka was operating on an entirely different level in Pallekele, playing \"an innings for the ages,\" as Test Match Special commentator Daniel Norcross labelled it.\n\nNissanka raced to 38 off 20 balls to lift Sri Lanka to 61‑1 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nKusal Mendis then picked up the pace against Australia's spinners, bringing up his third consecutive half-century of this T20 World Cup in 35 balls before Nissanka joined him, reaching his fifty in just 32 deliveries.\n\nAustralia would have hoped for a way back after Mendis departed in the 13th over with Sri Lanka on 105‑2, and though Pavan Rathnayake walked in, he only needed to play second fiddle to Nissanka, who effortlessly took Sri Lanka past the target.\n\nThe 27‑year‑old Sri Lanka opener was outstanding in manipulating the leg‑side field all game, scoring 26 runs through mid‑wicket and another 20 through square leg.\n\nBut he mixed brutal hitting with plenty of finesse too, guiding 15 runs down to third with some deft late cuts.\n\nAdding extra sweetness to Nissanka's day was an extraordinary catch he took to dismiss Glenn Maxwell and keep Australia at bay in the closing stages of their innings.\n\nHaving dropped Maxwell in the previous over, Nissanka more than made up for it with a brilliant flying catch at backward point to send back the Australia all-rounder, who had looked dangerous.\n\nThough there will be concern for pacer Matheesha Pathirana, who walked off with an injury, Sri Lanka will fancy their chances of putting on a good show in the Super 8s and making it to the semi-finals, with both Nissanka and Mendis in good form.\n\nAustralia captain Mitchell Marsh: \"I thought it was a competitive total at the halfway mark but with the start we had, maybe a few short. Well played to Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We know that at our best we can make big scores but we lost our way a little bit at the end and Sri Lanka bowled well. Not much more to say other than Sri Lanka outplayed us.\n\n\"It's a devastated group. We are in the lap of gods now. We haven't been at our best. We will watch the Zimbabwe vs Ireland game and hope.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka: \"One of the best performances in the recent times. Really happy with how the proceedings went.\n\n\"We were still very positive after losing [Pathirana] in the powerplay. We had the confidence and knew about the wicket. Each and every one showed a good body language today. And everyone wanted to contribute somehow.\n\n\"We hope to continue like this in the tournament. It's wonderful to qualify after many years. It's a good team. We should go to the next round and hopefully make to the semis. Thanks to the massive crowd today.\"\n\nNissanka's century leads Sri Lanka to victory and puts Australia on brink - as it happened\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers",
