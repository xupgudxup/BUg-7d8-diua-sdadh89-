We have something to cherish being here. We've got life. It's not about trying to be a thug in the streets.\"\n\nDuring the face-off, Stevenson continued chatting to Lopez, who kept a straight face and simply stared at him, before Stevenson delivered a light shoulder barge and walked off stage.",

I want to repay the support everyone has shown me with another great performance,\" Price said.\n\n\"I never turn down a challenge.

    "fullText": "Manchester United focused on strengthening up top instead of at the back following the disaster that was the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt was decided that a centre-back would join once the current season concluded, with the futures of several stars up in the air.\n\nHarry Maguire’s contract is up in the summer, while Matthijs de Ligt’s injury record makes for grim reading.\n\nWhat the Red Devils really need is a left-footed profile, someone who can eventually succeed Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw as the left-sided centre-back.\n\nThe Argentine has been linked with an exit, while criticism continues to grow against him. And as per El Crack Deportivo, United have zeroed in on his compatriot as the perfect backup.\n\nRiver Plate’s Lautaro Rivero has emerged as an option for the 20-time English league champions, and they intend to sign him in the summer.\n\nThe Argentine giants are aware of United’s interest in the 22-year-old, and have therefore slapped a €100 million release clause into his contract.\n\nRiver do not want to lose the Argentina international on the cheap, amid interest from Strasbourg, Tottenham, City Football Group, Juventus, and Atletico Madrid.\n\n“Manchester United intend to secure the services of Lautaro Rivero, a key player in Gallardo’s squad.\n\n“River Plate made Rivero sign a €100 million release clause, so if they want to sign him, they must pay a figure close to that amount.”\n\nRivero is already an Argentina international, and could be on the plane to the US for the World Cup if he continues performing as he has.\n\nHe has made 18 appearances for the River Plate first team and can play both in central defence and as a left-back.\n\nDescribed as an “elite” ball-playing defender, it will be interesting to see if United can get a deal for another South American talent over the line.\n\nHowever, it is likely to be for a fee much lesser than what is being quoted in the report.\n\nFeature image Hernan Cortez via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook says a global memory chip shortage is beginning to bite, with rising costs expected to pressure margins ahead.",
    "fullText": "The global memory chip shortage is catching up with Apple, Tim Cook says.\n\nThe Apple CEO said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that Apple is beginning to feel the effects of the memory shortage crisis, with rising prices expected to put pressure on margins ahead.\n\nThe warning comes amid blockbuster demand for Apple's newest products. Customer response to the latest iPhone lineup \"exceeded our expectations,\" with iPhone revenue jumping 23%, Cook said on the call Thursday.\n\nApple reported revenue of $143.76 billion and earnings per share of $2.84, beating analyst estimates.\n\nThe staggering iPhone demand left Apple exiting the December quarter with \"very lean\" inventory, pushing the company into what Cook described as \"supply chase mode.\"\n\nCook said the biggest constraint is the limited access to advanced chipmaking nodes used to produce Apple's system-on-a-chip processors. Higher demand has also reduced flexibility across Apple's supply chain, he said.\n\nMemory shortages played a minimal role in Apple's December-quarter margins, but their impact is expected to grow, Cook added.\n\nThe company expects memory costs to weigh more heavily on margins in the second quarter, contributing to its forecast gross margin range of 48% to 49%. Apple posted a gross margin of about 48% in the December quarter.\n\n\"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.\"\n\nApple's stock price rose about 2% after hours following the results on Thursday.\n\nCook's comments come as the tech industry grapples with a worsening global shortage of memory chips.\n\nAI companies, smartphone makers, and PC manufacturers are competing for the same pool of memory components, which are critical not just for consumer electronics but also for powering large language models and other AI systems. That surge in demand has sent prices climbing.\n\nAt CES 2026 last month, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the memory storage market as \"completely unserved.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nThe Korea Economic Daily reported in January that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are seeking server DRAM price hikes of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Market analysis firm Counterpoint also said last month that memory prices could climb as much as 40% through the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\nThe rapid buildout of AI infrastructure marks a break from the industry's traditional \"boom-and-bust cycles.\"\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution.\n\nThe board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president’s ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security.\n\nThe board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership.\n\nHis secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to ease concerns by saying the board's focus right now is only on the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\n“This is not a replacement for the U.N., but the U.N. has served very little purpose in the case of Gaza other than the food assistance,” Rubio said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials.\n\n“In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.”\n\nIn Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump’s latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.”\n\n“The U.S. rollout of the much broader Board of Peace charter turned the whole exercise into a liability,” according to the International Crisis Group’s Richard Gowan, a U.N. watcher and program director. “Countries that wanted to sign on to help Gaza saw the board turning into a Trump fan club. That was not appealing.”\n\n“If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said.\n\nKey Security Council members haven't signed on\n\nThe four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany.\n\nLetters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump’s vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump’s demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable.\n\nShortly after, Trump pulled a dramatic reversal on Greenland, saying he had agreed with the NATO secretary-general on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.\n\nAmid the diplomatic chaos, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who at the time had not responded to Trump’s Board of Peace invitation, met with Guterres in London and reiterated “the UK’s enduring support for the UN and the international rules-based system,” according to a statement.\n\nStarmer emphasized the U.N.’s “pivotal role in tackling global problems which shape lives in the UK and all over the world.” The United Kingdom later declined to join the board.\n\nFrance, Spain and Slovenia declined Trump’s offer by mentioning its overlapping and potentially conflicting agenda with the U.N.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the board goes beyond “the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.”\n\nSpain would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was “outside the framework of the United Nations,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.\n\nSome countries are urging a stronger UN\n\nAmerica’s adversaries also have shunned the board.\n\n“No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China’s U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday.\n\nHe called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council’s status and role “are irreplaceable.”\n\nIn a clear reference to the Board of Peace, Fu said, “We shall not cherry-pick our commitments to the organization, nor shall we bypass the U.N. and create alternative mechanisms.”\n\nSo far, about 26 of some 60 invited countries have joined the board, and about nine European countries have declined. India did not attend Trump’s signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s invitation.\n\n“It’s hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump’s wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks to join his Board of Peace, governments should work on strengthening the U.N.”\n\nEight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump’s global peacemaking plan.\n\nThe Crisis Group’s Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump’s ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks.\n\n“I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.",

    "fullText": "Jannik Sinner has weighed in on Coco Gauff’s Australian Open racket smash, a moment that has sparked plenty of debate across the tennis world.\n\nIt has become one of the main storylines over the past few days, even with several high-profile matches taking place.\n\nPart of that may be down to what has felt like a lack of drama throughout the tournament, which has pushed more attention towards incidents happening off the court.\n\nThe situation unfolded after Gauff lost to Elina Svitolina, with her decision to smash her racket coming away from the cameras. Even so, it was picked up and shared widely.\n\nGauff kept her emotions in check throughout what was a tough defeat and waited until she was off the court before letting her frustration show.\n\nDespite that, footage of the incident still found its way into public view, adding unnecessary attention to an already disappointing day for her.\n\nSpeaking about the moment, Sinner said he understood where she was coming from.\n\n“It can happen, no? We’re athletes, we invest our whole life to be the best version of ourselves. But sometimes losses hurt. I understand the frustration as a player.”\n\nHe added: “She gives everything on court, she never says a word out of place, she’s a good girl.”\n\nSinner has bigger things to focus on at this point in the tournament with his upcoming semi-final clash against Novak Djokovic taking priority over any off-court topics.\n\nSinner came into this tournament as the clear favourite, aiming for a third straight title.\n\nBut Carlos Alcaraz has put together an impressive run of his own. The young Spaniard has already made it further in this tournament than ever before, and is quickly joining Sinner at the top of pre-match discussions.\n\nMeanwhile, Djokovic’s path to the last four has not been smooth, but he has benefited from a couple of key breaks along the way.\n\nFirst, there was Jakub Mensik’s withdrawal before their fourth-round match. Then in his quarter-final, Lorenzo Musetti was forced to retire with an injury despite being two sets up on the scoreboard.\n\nRemarkably, Djokovic has reached the semi-finals of this Grand Slam despite having played only 11 sets of tennis.\n\nThis year luck does appear to be favouring him more than usual, giving him some much-needed time to recover before facing Sinner.\n\nThis is likely his best opportunity to secure a 25th Grand Slam title.",

    "description": "Debunking false narratives about one of the most creatives players in world football",
    "fullText": "Coveted by many top European teams before signing with Real Madrid in the summer of 2023 at the age of 18, Arda Güler arrived in Madrid with lofty expectations.  Madrid paid Fenerbahçe approximately €26 million to secure the services of the Turkish phenom at a time when various Barcelona journalists reported he was close to signing with the Catalan club.  Today Transfermarkt values Güler at €90 million, up from €45 million at the start of 2025, an indication of his progression over the last year.\n\nInjuries derailed Güler first season at Madrid, but once healthy he quickly demonstrated his scoring prowess with six goals in La Liga in only 373 minutes, an outrageous goal every 62 minutes on the pitch.  Two years later, Güler is firmly establishing himself as one of the top creative midfielders in Europe.\n\nStarting as a 10 under Xabi Alonso at the Club World Cup before transitioning to a deep-lying playmaker role, Güler has been playing in a more advanced position since the arrival of coach Álvaro Arbeloa.  It was said at times this season that Madrid was expecting too much from Güler – to initiate play from the back, while also producing goals.  That is, be a combination of Toni Kroos and Kevin De Bruyne.  A difficult task for anyone, but especially a player that is still only 20 years of age.\n\nWith little fanfare, the Real Madrid midfielder this past weekend became the leader in La Liga with 52 chances created (key passes, including assists).  That is a title that Xavi Hernández, Mesut Özil, Ángel Di María, Neymar and Lionel Messi, amongst others, have held over the last two decades.  None did so at such a precocious age.\n\nGüler’s superlative passing ability has him currently seoncd in La Liga with seven assists and third in big chances created with nine.  With his assist against Benfica, he also led Champions League midfielders with four assists, tied with Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai.  The Real Madrid midfielder has provided a total of 14 assists since the start of the Club World Cup.  It has largely gone under the radar that among players from the top five European leagues since July in official club competitions, Güler’s 14 assists with Madrid are surpassed only by Michael Olise’s 18 assists with Bayern Munich.\n\nWhat is particularly impressive is that the amount of shot opportunities the Real Madrid midfielder is providing for teammates.  Güler is averaging an exceptional 3.64 chances created per 90 minutes in league play, the highest average for a leader in chances created in La Liga since his compatriot and former teammate Mesut Özil distributed 4.17 key passes/assists per 90 in the 2010/2011 season (see graph below). Also noteworthy is that nearly 35% of the Turkish midfielder’s chances have come through long passes (as defined by Opta).  Güler could become the first Real Madrid player to lead La Liga in chances created since Ángel Di María’s last season at the club over a decade ago. With sufficient playing time in a more advanced role and with Mbappé, Vinicius and Gonzalo all off to a strong 2026, Arda has an outside chance to become the first La Liga player in the last 4 seasons to distribute 100+ key passes in a season.\n\nGüler performances in Champions League play has been no less stellar where he finished the group phase 2nd in chances created with 24, averaging 3.9 per 90.  This season saw him earn his first Player of the Match award in Champions League play vs. Juventus, in what was only his fourth start on Europe’s biggest club competition stage, after distributing six key passes and collecting 10 ball recoveries.  Keep in mind that Pedri earned his first such award last season in his fifth season (25th start in Champions) at Barcelona.\n\nGüler’s partnership with Kylian Mbappé has been especially lethal.  The two have combined to produce 10 goals since the Club World Cup, nine of which were passes from the Turkish phenom to the Frenchman.  That includes six goals in league play, the most goals where two teammates combined to score in the top five European leagues this season.  In limited playing time together, Güler also seems to have developed a strong understanding with Gonzalo García, providing three assists on the Spaniard centre-forward’s goals.\n\nSkeptics point to Güler as being primarily a set-piece specialist who is weak defensively.  There are various data points that negate these false narratives.\n\n36 of 52 of Güler’s key passes in La Liga, over 69%, have come with the ball in play.  That is fifth most in La Liga, trailing only Mbappé (51), Yamal (40), Vinicius (39) and Pedri (38).\n\nDespite his slender build, Güler is a much better defender than what is commonly perceived.\n\nAccording to Statsbomb data, the Turkish midfielder leads Real Madrid in total pressures in La Liga this season with 406 and in counterpressures (pressure immediately after losing possession) with 96.\n\nEarlier this season Statsbomb data indicated that through the first nine weeks of the season, Güler was leading all La Liga players in pressure regains per 90 minutes, indicating his pressures are well-timed.\n\nMany will be surprised to learn Güler is averaging 1.20 successful tackles per 90 minutes in league play, more than Tchouaméni (1.16 per 90) and Valverde (1.09 per 90).\n\nGüler continues to improve as a ball winner. He has had 10 ball recoveries in two (Juventus, Monaco) of the six Champions League matches he started this season, an exceptional amount for anyone, but especially an attacking midfielder. His interception last week on Monaco’s half of the pitch initiated the play that led to his assist for Vinicius’s goal.\n\nPerhaps Arda needs that one special match in a Champions League elimination tie to consecrate himself as the best attacking midfielder in Europe and receive the accolades he deserves.  Don’t be surprised if that occurs this spring.",

    "description": "I started traveling full-time in 2019 and loved seeing the world. But over time, I saw the lifestyle's challenges and decided I wanted a home base.",
    "fullText": "I thrive in unfamiliar environments and get a kick out of last-minute plans and spontaneous adventures. So, it's hardly surprising I became an almost-accidental \"digital nomad\" — a term I've always found incredibly cringe-inducing, for the record.\n\nSo, I decided to pursue a life that would allow me to hop from place to place, working remotely as a freelance journalist and copywriter. And in 2019, I hit the road full-time.\n\nLike others tagging #todaysoffice on social media, I spent the following years surfing badly in Sri Lanka, climbing volcanoes in Guatemala, skiing in Colorado, and so much more.\n\nBut after almost seven years of traveling full-time, I decided I was ready for something different.\n\nAside from an extended stint in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic, I didn't have a stable base for more than three months at a time.\n\nMy travels brought once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and I met incredible people along the way. However, over time, the cracks in the lifestyle began to show.\n\nOf course, it's hard not to sound ungrateful when talking about the downsides of traveling, but it would be dishonest to ignore them — especially in an age known for glamorizing everything.\n\nFor starters, maintaining relationships can be challenging when you're always on the move. I learned that loneliness can linger even when you're staying in five-star hotels or lounging on tropical beaches.\n\nPlus, packing and repacking every few days becomes tedious. As does the endless search for short-term accommodations, trawling the internet for somewhere with decent WiFi and a table I can work from. (Finding the motivation to work in such beautiful locations is another challenge in its own right.)\n\nAnd sadly, after a while, even the most objectively stunning sunsets become ordinary. I'm not sure when it happened, but at some point, I stopped feeling the rush I used to get from stepping off a plane in a new place (I know, play the world's smallest violin).\n\nA few years ago, in the Grenadines, I asked a captain who'd been traveling for nearly 50 years how he chose where to settle. \"You can search and search all your life,\" he told me as we sat on the bow of his catamaran, surrounded by a pale blue sky and shimmering sea. \"But sometimes you need to know when you've arrived.\"\n\nI didn't fully understand it at the time, but I do now: There's no \"perfect place\" to live.\n\nSo, after almost seven years abroad, I finally decided it was time to find a home base.\n\nChoosing where to establish my home base was harder than I expected. For a long time, nothing felt right.\n\nI wasn't looking for a traditional 9-to-5 or a forever home, just a place from which to explore, with friends and a community I wouldn't have to say goodbye to every few months. Somewhere I could do the things I love consistently, like pottery, writing, yoga, and swimming in the sea, and return to familiar surroundings.\n\nLike many decisions I made on the road, I stopped forcing it and followed what unfolded naturally.\n\nSurprisingly, this led me to a place much closer to \"home.\" I decided to settle on the northeast coast of England near Newcastle, just an hour away from where I grew up. A windswept stretch battered by rain, with concrete skies and a brutally cold sea.\n\nIt's not the tropical island I once envisioned, but it feels grounding, like I've actually arrived.\n\nI have no desire to travel yet (it's only been a few months), though I'm sure that'll come. When it does, though, it's unlikely I'll disappear as often or for as long as I used to.\n\nI'm not saying I've found long-lasting contentment just because I'm anchored to a place, but it's given me the chance to be creative, slow down, and establish routines.\n\nIt's also helped me appreciate the smaller things in my life that I'd missed, like catching up with friends, playing golf regularly with my old man, and working on projects that felt impossible to tackle while hopping between hotels.\n\nAnd it feels good to know I don't have to check out anytime soon.",

Based on a survey of 1,006 global executives in December 2025, AI is behind at least some layoffs, but that these are almost completely in anticipation of AI’s impact. In other words, the job losses and slowed hiring are real, even though companies are still waiting for generative AI to deliver on its promises.

    "fullText": "MELBOURNE, Australia — Elena Rybakina fended off a late Australian Open surge from Jessica Pegula in a 6-3, 7-6(7) semifinal win Thursday night, to set up a heavyweight final against the world No. 1, Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nRybakina is not the world No. 2, but the No. 5 seed is the opponent Sabalenka would least like to face. She won their last meeting in straight sets, including a tiebreak to love against a player who has won their last 20 at Grand-Slam level. That was the WTA Tour Finals championship match in November, one of Rybakina’s 20 wins in her past 21 matches. In that time, she has picked up two titles and posted a 9-0 record against top-10 opponents.\n\nWith her huge serve, easy power, clean ball-striking and underrated ability to generate huge speed even when extended, Rybakina is one of the very few players who can take the racket out of Sabalenka’s hands, as Madison Keys did to win last year’s final.\n\nShe is also the world No. 1’s temperamental opposite. Where Sabalenka wears her emotions on court and lives through them, Rybakina is near-totally zen and unreadable, even though Pegula’s late surge in the second set brought some mild anguish across Rybakina’s face. When she won the Wimbledon title in 2022, her reaction was more akin to someone being told they could finish work early than someone who had just won their first Grand Slam.\n\nSabalenka may not appreciate how relaxed Rybakina will seem when she, by contrast, will be outwardly battling the stress of trying to avoid losing a third Grand Slam final out of four.\n\nSabalenka was busy performing media duties after hammering Elina Svitolina in her own semifinal, but when she sits down to watch Rybakina’s defeat of Pegula Thursday night, she will see a rival playing with complete conviction, bar a late wobble down the stretch. Things otherwise look so uncomplicated for Rybakina when her game is song, built around arguably the best serve on the WTA Tour.\n\nShe won the first six points of the match against Pegula, breaking early to go 3-0 up after 10 minutes. That break was all Rybakina needed to roll through the first set, winning 77 per cent of first-serve points and 79 percent on the second. She didn’t face a break point.\n\nAs against Iga Świątek in the quarters, Rybakina’s serving fluency meant she could tee off once the rallies got started, rocking Pegula back on her heels so much that she frequently gestured to her box about the experience.\n\nPegula, who hadn’t dropped a set all tournament until Thursday night, had found a way to diffuse and redirect Keys and Amanda Anisimova’s power back on them in the previous two rounds, but this was another level. And when she had 30-30 on her opponent’s serve early in the second set, Rybakina slammed the door shut with a huge ace down the T. She then broke in the next game for 2-1, with a devastating inside-out forehand return winner.\n\nThe pair then exchanged breaks, before a pair of aces helped Rybakina hold for 4-2. Pegula, a U.S. Open finalist two years ago and in the best form of her career, was fighting hard, but it felt like she was always swimming against the tide. When a fourth ace flew by her to move Rybakina to 5-3, Pegula let out a resigned “yeah” — summing up the powerlessness she must have been feeling. A game later it looked set to be all over, as Rybakina attempted to ease her opponent into submission one last time.\n\nA forehand return that flew onto the line for a winner to bring up a third match point drew another look of disbelief from Pegula, before a rare Rybakina forehand miss earned an even rarer show of annoyance.\n\nBut Rybakina could not convert any of them, and the very next game Pegula hit two return winners to go up 0-30. Rybakina drew even with the strength of her serve, but one tight forehand in the net and another long gave Pegula a break. The tension was clear, as Rybakina immediately broke back before again being broken, tightening up as the finish line approached and what had looked like a routine win instead headed for a tiebreak.\n\nOnce there, Pegula had two set points to take the match the distance, but Rybakina staved them off on the back of her serve. setting up a forehand onto the baseline with one huge one before an ace down the T took her to a fourth match point. This time there was no mistake, as one last clean-as-a-whistle backhand flew past Pegula for a return winner.\n\nAfter their straight-set semifinal wins, even with the late tension in the latter, Sabalenka and Rybakina will now meet with neither having dropped a set on their way to the final. They are undeniably the two best players in the world right now, and their meeting will be a repeat of the final here in 2023, which Sabalenka won in three thrilling sets. That was Sabalenka’s first major title, while Rybakina has not been to a major final since.\n\nEverything is set up for another barnburner Saturday, when the sequence of one-sided and straight-sets matches will be tested to the max by two such well-matched players. So while this is the final Sabalenka probably wanted to avoid, it is also one that fans desperate for a sustained competitive encounter will be relishing.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

It’s been a surreal run so far for the Olympic bronze medalist in Melbourne. With one more win, the No. 12 seed has a chance to become the first Ukrainian woman ever to reach a Grand Slam final. In hindsight, this journey wouldn’t be possible without the steadfast support from her family.\n\nMikhaylo Svitolin is the man behind the scenes of Elina Svitolina’s tennis success. Before he was a tennis dad, he was a competitive wrestler in Ukraine. Professionally, he made his living as a real estate agent in Odesa, but his real passion was always been sports. Interestingly, Elina has mentioned that she only started playing tennis at the age of 5 because she wanted her dad’s attention, as he was busy traveling for tournaments with her older brother, Yulian.\n\nAs Elina got better and better, Mikhaylo stepped up as her early coach and mentor. The biggest sacrifice came when she was just 12. As per advice from the businessman Yuriy Sapronov, the millionaire who caught Elina’s talents while she was playing in a local tournament, the family made a decision to move from Odesa to Kharkiv so she could train at a professional academy to have better shots of making the pro, some 350 miles from her hometown.\n\nLooking back, it was one big gamble, but safe to say, the investment is paying in dividends now, helping her eventually reach the world No. 3 ranking.\n\nOlena Svitolina is a powerhouse in her own right. She was a competitive rower before moving on to professional bowling by the time Elina began focusing on tennis.\n\nShe was known for being a strict but incredibly supportive parent. She often told Elina that coming from Ukraine meant she had to work twice as hard as anyone else to get noticed on the world stage. Elina openly admitted she wouldn’t be the player she is today without her mom.\n\n“My mom always supported me. This is very important, especially in tennis, given how much time you spend on the road, at tournaments, away from friends and family… the sport of tennis is such that almost every week you have losses happen, it’s hard… my mother gives and continues to give me strength and faith in the fact that I can be a better tennis player.”\n\nYou can take a hint from her dedication. Olena’s love for the game and her professional career were so impeccable that when the family decided to move from Odesa to Kharkiv for Elina’s elite training, Olena stayed behind for two months to finish her bowling commitments before joining them.\n\nEven now, in 2026, Olena is still Elina’s biggest cheerleader. These days, she wears more of a spectator and grandma first.\n\nElina Svitolina was born in Ukraine to Ukrainian parents, Mikhaylo and Olena. Her dad has Jewish roots through her grandmother, Tamara. However, during her tennis career, she received several offers from other countries to change her nationality and play for them, often with a lot of money involved. However, she always chose to represent Ukraine.\n\nThe parents got involved very early in her career, with Mikhaylo serving as her former coach and Olena deliberately pushing her and making her work twice as hard to make it to the big leagues. Her parents followed her to every match and expecting constant victory. Around 2015, they collectively decided it was best for them to step back from traveling with her, allowing her to gain independence and take ownership of her career. Today, her parents remain her primary motivators and a constant source of strength.\n\nBut these days their role has changed quite a bit. It revolves less around Elina, more around Skai, their granddaughter, so Elina and her husband Gaël Monfils can focus on their matches. Safe to say, parents have traded their “coach” hats for “grandparent” hats.\n\nThe post Who Are Elina Svitolina Parents?

    "fullText": "Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), world’s battery manufacturing giant, officially unveiled its Tianxing II light commercial vehicle battery series on January 22, 2026. The highlight of the launch is the low-temperature version, which represents the industry’s first mass-produced sodium-ion battery.\n\nThe 45 kWh sodium-ion battery boasts an energy density of 175Wh/kg and a cycle life exceeding 10,000 cycles. It is the world’s first battery to receive certification under the new GB 38031-2025 national standard and is designed to power small and micro vans and light trucks.\n\nCompared to lithium batteries, this battery has exceptional cold-weather performance. In extreme temperatures as low as -40°C, the battery maintains 90% of its usable capacity. Moreover, it allows for immediate charging even when completely frozen at -30°C, eliminating the winter operation challenges faced by commercial vehicles in cold regions.\n\nSodium is over 1,000 times more abundant in the earth’s crust than lithium, with extraction costs at merely 1/20 of lithium. This cost advantage is expected to reduce battery costs and improve the economic feasibility of light commercial electric vehicles in the long term.\n\nBeyond the low-temperature sodium-ion version, the Tianxing II series includes three additional variants (lithium-ion type):\n\nThe Fast-Charging Version features high-rate charging technology that powers the battery from 20% to 80% in 18 minutes. For standard 100 kWh electric vehicles, a single fast charge can add approximately 150 kilometers of range.\n\nThe Long-Range Version sets a new record for light commercial vehicles with a single-pack capacity of 253 kWh, achieving a maximum range of 800km. This variant is designed primarily for long-distance logistics between cities. When paired with CATL’s Taishan pack architecture, it reduces vehicle weight by approximately 260kg compared to batteries with equivalent capacity, increasing effective payload while reducing energy consumption.\n\nThe High-Temperature Fast-Charging Version targets last-mile delivery and self-owned vehicle operations, particularly in southern high-temperature regions. Equipped with a customized liquid cooling thermal management system, it maintains stable fast-charging performance and battery life in high-temperature environments. This version balances high reliability with low operating costs, making it suitable for short-distance, high-frequency light commercial scenarios such as supermarket deliveries and community distribution.\n\nTianxing is a battery brand for commercial vehicles, launched by CATL in July 2024.",

    "fullText": "The International Monetary Fund projects another year of solid global economic growth — but it's also warning not to take the continued upward trajectory for granted.\n\nThe IMF predicts that the global economy will grow 3.3% in 2026, mirroring that 3.3% growth seen in 2025, with 2027 expected to see similar gains.\n\n\"The world economy is resilient but you should not take this resilience for granted,\" Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of IMF said at an event on Monday.\n\nAccording to Georgieva, there are four things that are driving up growth, and at least one is being overlooked by observers.\n\nHere's what the IMF sees pushing the world economy higher.\n\nGovernments around the world have let the private sector take the reins. With \"governments put out from running the economy where they don't belong,\" private sector strength supports growth, Georgieva said.\n\nThe economist said in remarks at Davos that governments taking a back seat allows the private sector to be \"more adaptable, more agile, and we see the benefits of it\".\n\nThe global economy's recent growth has been less tied to trade, mitigating the impacts many had feared from Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy.\n\nThe fact that effective tariff rates are below liberation day levels has meant the impact has been significantly less than initially feared.\n\nDespite trade tensions spurred by tariffs, \"we continue to trade for now,\" Georgieva says, adding, \"don't take this for granted.\"\n\nGlobal AI spending reached 1.76 trillion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $3.34 trillion in 2026, according to Gartner.\n\nThe \"massive investment in AI\" has served to boost optimism in the global economy, Georgieva said.\n\nThe IMF economist says one factor that is often forgotten when assessing global economic growth is \"the role of good policies and strong institutions.\"\n\nGeorgieva flagged the role of independent central banks, specifically, in the resilient global economy. She said tht these things are often given little attention but, and as a result, that could \"erode\" that source of strength.\n\nCentral bank independence is a key concern in the US as President Trump's administration pressures Fed chair Jerome Powell. The latest tensions have arisen from a criminal investigation by the DOJ into Powell's testimony about the Fed building renovation.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his criticism of the Fed chair, rattling markets with his threats to fire Powell over the last year.",

    "fullText": "Gold and silver prices have soared in the midst of global geopolitical uncertainty, concerns about the global role of the dollar, long-simmering inflation and general economic uncertainty.\n\nRegular readers of my column know that I have always advised keeping a portion of your assets in gold and gold mining shares or mutual funds. (Search my columns at TerrySavage.com using the key word “gold” and going back more than a decade.) But with today’s huge rise in gold prices, those investments have significantly increased in value, almost demanding that you evaluate your long-term positions.\n\nSome economic background is in order. CME Group Chief Economist Erik Norland has written a definitive guide to the economic forces moving the precious metals markets. He notes: “Gold ... is up 80% as of January 21. Palladium is up 105%, platinum up 175% and silver prices have tripled, rising 212%.” (That appreciation figure has since changed. You can read the entire report, including graphics, at the CME Group website.)\n\nIn an interview I asked about the dramatic rise in the price of gold. Norland explained there are five main drivers of demand:\n\nIt’s not just the United States that is running a budget deficit — currently 6% of GDP, without accounting for proposed increases in military spending. Norland notes that European nations are currently increasing their defense spending allocations, as is Canada. The Japanese have always had a huge public debt as a percentage of GDP, and now even China’s public debt is running at 8.5% of GDP. The implication is that all that spending will generate a new round of “money printing” — i.e., inflation.\n\nThe key ingredient of Norland’s outlook is the fact that inflation is just barely under control around the world, running above targets set by all central banks. In the United States, for example, the latest report of the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator (PCE) came in at 2.8% — well above the Fed’s 2% target.\n\nNorland notes that despite the underlying inflationary pressures, almost every central bank is in the process of lowering interest rates. That’s the opposite of what central banks usually do to fight inflation. The exceptions are Japan, which already has such very low rates, and Brazil.\n\n—Perceived erosion of central bank independence\n\nFor nearly 80 years, central banks have “managed” currencies through interest rates and currency purchases or interventions. Their role has been to manage the balance of currencies needed for stability and world trade. But it’s not just the U.S. Federal Reserve bank that is feeling pressure to bend to political will. It’s happening around the world.",

    "fullText": "The UK is the country with no bloc.\n\nAt Davos, Britain refused to join Trump's Board of Peace, citing commitment to international law and rejection of the \"pay-to-play\" model. France, Germany, Sweden, Norway made the same choice. The difference is that those countries have somewhere else to go. Britain doesn't.\n\nThe SAFE instrument, the EU's €150 billion fund for joint defense procurement, is designed explicitly for strategic autonomy. Strict \"Buy European\" provisions limit non-EU subcontractors to 15-35% of contract value, phased out within two years. Canada, remarkably, negotiated access and now has preferential treatment on par with EU firms. The UK remains excluded.\n\nTalks broke down in late 2025. The EU's requirements for third-country participation, London viewed as an infringement on sovereignty. The same sovereignty concerns that drove Brexit now lock Britain out of the emerging European defense architecture. The \"mid-Atlantic bridge\" was always a metaphor. Britain positioned itself as the hinge between American power and European integration, useful to both, dependent on neither. That positioning assumed both poles wanted a bridge. Now the US treats allies as protection rackets and the EU is building walls around its defense industrial base. The bridge has nowhere to land.\n\nWhat does the Starmer government do? The choices were supposed to be theoretical. Align with Washington and accept the transactional terms of the Donroe Doctrine. Align with Brussels and accept the sovereignty constraints of SAFE participation. Or go it alone, with a defense budget that can't sustain independent capability against peer competitors.\n\nThe IISS analysis of SAFE's implications for non-EU suppliers is blunt: firms outside the bloc face structural disadvantages that compound over time. Procurement cycles last decades. If British defense firms are locked out of European contracts now, the gap widens with each passing year. The industrial base erodes.\n\n\"Global Britain\" was the slogan after Brexit, a vision of nimble bilateral relationships unconstrained by Brussels bureaucracy. The reality is that global influence requires either hard power or bloc membership. Britain has neither the military budget for the former nor the political will for the latter.\n\nCanada's pivot is instructive. Facing similar pressure from Washington, Carney diversified, joining SAFE, negotiating with Beijing, building horizontal coalitions with other middle powers. Britain has done none of this. It refused the Board of Peace on principle but hasn't found an alternative structure to join on pragmatism.\n\nPrinciples without alternatives is just isolation. The UK is learning what it means to be a middle power without a coalition, morally opposed to the new American order but structurally excluded from the European one.",

While the chain is making good on its promise to get customers their orders within four minutes during its busiest times, he said, its stores don't consistently meet that goal during slower times of the day.\n\nThe four-minute goal was one of the early changes Niccol outlined after becoming Starbucks' CEO in 2024.\n\n\"There still is opportunity, frankly, to get the entire business — every transaction — to be under four minutes,\" Niccol said.",

    "fullText": "World’s richest person targeting symbolic date in June for flotation of rocket company\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is considering a flotation valuing the rocket company at $1.5tn (£1.1tn) that will reportedly be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and the multibillionaire’s birthday.\n\nThe world’s richest person is targeting a symbolic date of mid-June for the initial public offering, according to the Financial Times. This would be around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other and shortly before Musk turns 55 on 28 June.\n\nThe FT also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $50bn – valuing it at $1.5tn – compared with previous reports that it was looking for $25bn at an $800bn valuation. Last week, it was reported that the rocket company was considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in the share sale.\n\nMusk, whose $680bn fortune would be turbo-boosted by a SpaceX flotation, said last year the company’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa. The billionaire owns about 42% of SpaceX, as well as nearly 17% of the electric carmaker Tesla, where he is chief executive. He also owns more than three-quarters of the social media platform X.\n\nSpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service.\n\nIf the flotation goes ahead it would involve a bigger initial fundraising than the IPO of the oil company Saudi Aramco, which raised $29bn in 2019, although for a larger total valuation of $1.7tn.\n\nThe chief financial officer of SpaceX, Bret Johnsen, has held talks and video conference calls with existing private investors since December to explore a mid-2026 IPO, the FT added.\n\nMusk has reportedly been swayed by the idea of a SpaceX float because of its growing valuation and the success of Starlink.\n\nGlobal financial markets are anticipating a year of significant US listings, with the artificial intelligence companies Anthropic and OpenAI also laying early groundwork for potential IPOs.\n\nA rebound in the US equity capital market activity began in 2025 after three years of limited activity, partly as the result of volatility and geopolitical tensions. Space technology is a tightly held sector but is sought after by investors keen for exposure in light of rapid development prospects, analysts have said.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said the mooted $1.5tn price tag was a “monster premium”.\n\nHe added: “A valuation that big reflects not just a tech and AI premium but Elon Musk’s stardust and a frothy market, plus a heck of a lot of media narrative around this. It is to some degree a kind of bet on the future space economy.”\n\nSpaceX has been approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "Beijing’s AI policy is focused on real-life applications but Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions\n\nStanding on stage in the eastern China tech hub of Hangzhou, Alibaba’s normally media-shy CEO made an attention-grabbing announcement. “The world today is witnessing the dawn of an AI-driven intelligent revolution,” Eddie Wu told a developer conference in September. “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) will not only amplify human intelligence but also unlock human potential, paving the way for the arrival of artificial superintelligence (ASI).”\n\nASI, Wu said, “could produce a generation of ‘super scientists’ and ‘full-stack super engineers’”, who would “tackle unsolved scientific and engineering problems at unimaginable speeds”.\n\nWu also announced plans to invest 380bn yuan (£40bn) in AI infrastructure over the next three years, news that sent Alibaba stocks soaring to their highest in nearly four years.\n\nWu’s foray into the existential, techno-frontier rhetoric normally deployed by western tech CEOs such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis caught the attention of observers. “Wu’s ASI speech represents a breakthrough,” the tech writer Afra Wang wrote in her China AI newsletter, Concurrent. “Major Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions that carry the flavour of future prophecy.”\n\nAGI, a theoretical state of AI where a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job, has become the preoccupation of American tech companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind. Many see it as the next frontier of civilisation, and are in competition with each other, and China, to get there. In May, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, told a US Senate committee on AI that the “race between the United States and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover”.\n\nMany in Washington have internalised these fears. The US-China economic and scurity review commission has recommended that Congress “establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an artificial general intelligence (AGI) capability”. The Manhattan Project was a second world war-era research operation to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nIn China, many saw Wu’s speech as articulating the vision of a bold, singular tech company, but not one that represented China’s overall AI industry.\n\n“China certainly has research groups working towards AGI. But most AI companies are working towards better applications,” said Ya-Qin Zhang, the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research and former president of the tech company Baidu.\n\nA combination of limited computing power, a pragmatic approach to technology and a keen awareness of the present day potential of AI has steered China’s national AI policy towards real-life applications rather than frontier research.\n\nIn August, the Chinese government published its highly anticipated “AI+ strategy”. The policy document outlined how AI could turbocharge China’s development goals, such as by using AI to improve medical diagnoses and make supply chains more efficient. But it made no mention of AGI.\n\n“The Chinese government is intently focused on reaping the benefits of AI in the here and now and in the near future through diffusion and application of AI across the economy, society, defence, and other areas,” said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior director for China and Taiwan at the White House national security council. “Despite its goal to ‘catch up and surpass’ the United States, we shouldn’t assume that the Chinese Communist party has bought into the idea that AGI is imminent.”\n\n“If you’re just looking at what has been officially published … there is no clear acknowledgment of AGI at all,” said Selina Xu, a China tech analyst. Xu noted that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, had a history of preferring the physical economy to more intangible forces.\n\n“It’s a very different narrative from the AGI race as a lot of people in DC see it,” Xu said.\n\nOne of the biggest factors guiding this strategy is the fact that US sanctions have prevented Chinese companies from acquiring the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors, which are needed for advanced AI research.\n\nWashington has banned the sale of hi-tech microchips to China in an effort to rein in the country’s AI development. Nvidia, the world’s leading chipmaker, then developed more basic semiconductors specifically for the Chinese market. In December, Washington approved the Nvidia’s second-most advanced chips, the H200s, for sale in China. But Beijing has reportedly told custom agents that the chips cannot be imported into China, as the government seeks to break the country’s reliance on overseas technology.\n\nChina insists that “necessity is the mother of invention” and points to the success of companies such as DeepSeek as proof that the US restrictions will merely spur innovation. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, is one of the few Chinese tech leaders who, like Alibaba’s Wu, has openly expressed an interest in AGI.\n\nBut until China is able to produce its own advanced semiconductors at scale, most tech companies feel it is more profitable to use the hardware they already have to focus on AI applications rather than AGI.\n\nAnother factor guiding the US-China tech competition is the availability of datacentres and the energy to power them. In November, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said China would “win the AI race” in part because of its energy subsidies for datacentres.\n\nThe subsidies were reportedly introduced after Chinese tech companies complained of higher electricity bills caused by the domestic semiconductors they are obliged to use, which are less efficient than Nvidia’s. In a sign of how determined China is to break its reliance on imported technology, Reuters reported that any datacentres in receipt of state funds could only use domestic chips.\n\nSuch measures would reduce Nvidia’s competitive advantage in China and boost domestic chip producers, such as Huawei.\n\nSince 2021, China has reportedly poured $100bn into support for AI datacentres.\n\nBut there are signs that the boom may have been overzealous. A recent report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology said that nationwide, the utilisation rate for AI datacentres was 32%.\n\nIn a recent op-ed in China Economic Weekly, Rao Shaoyang, the director at the China Telecom Research Institute, wrote that in some regions of China, the computing power industry was operating in a similar fashion to China’s beleaguered property sector: build first, find buyers later. He cautioned against “blindly building intelligent computing centres” and said local computing power demand should be considered before building new datacentres.\n\nDespite the surplus in more general computing power, many experts believe China still does not have chips that are sophisticated enough to explore frontier research in AGI. But analysts note that the mood could change quickly.\n\n“The current status quo is highly fluid, and Xi Jinping has explicitly declared an ambition to lead the world in AI,” said Gewirtz. “So the fact that China construes that goal one way at this snapshot moment in time does not give me any comfort that in a year they’re going to construe it the same way.”\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",

    "fullText": "Founder of the world wide web says commercialisation means the net has been ‘optimised for nastiness’, but collaboration and compassion can prevail\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nWhen Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in 1989, his vision was clear: it would used by everyone, filled with everything and, crucially, it would be free.\n\nToday, the British computer scientist’s creation is regularly used by 5.5 billion people – and bears little resemblance to the democratic force for humanity he intended.\n\nIn Australia to promote his book, This is for Everyone, Berners-Lee is reflecting on what his invention has become – and how he and a community of collaborators can put the power of the web back into the hands of its users.\n\nBerners-Lee describes his excitement in the earliest years of the web as “uncontainable”. Approaching 40 years on, a rebellion is brewing among himself and a community of like-minded activists and developers.\n\n“We can fix the internet … It’s not too late,” he writes, describing his mission as a “battle for the soul of the web”.\n\nBerners-Lee traces the first corruption of the web to the commercialisation of the domain name system, which he believes would have served web users better had it been managed by a nonprofit in the public interest. Instead, he says, in the 1990s the .com space was pounced on by “charlatans”.\n\n“The Americans were very keen about commercialising the internet … crossing the boundary from being an academic thing to being a commercial thing,” he tells Guardian Australia from Brisbane.\n\nThe pursuit of profit soon became a driving force in how the internet was designed. But it wasn’t until 2016 – the same year he won the Turing award – that the US elections showed Berners-Lee just how toxic the web could be. Two years later, he told Vanity Fair that he was “devastated” by the abuses of the web.\n\nFor 35 years, Berners-Lee has written what he considers to be the world’s first blog. One post, published in June 2024, is dominated by a crowded map of “everything on the internet”. It is a reminder of the web’s overall beneficence – from email and Zoom to health, podcasts, collaboration, creativity and digital sovereignty, the diagram shows the web is, for the most part, good.\n\nBut to the left of the diagram is a cluster of red, including X, Snapchat, YouTube, “feed manipulation for engagement”, addiction, polarisation, disinformation and mental illness. This corner of the web, its creator says, has been “optimised for nastiness”. It is extractive and surveillance-heavy.\n\n“It’s only a small part of the whole internet … but the problem is that people spend a lot of time on [social media websites] because they’re addictive,” he says.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nGiven it was always supposed to be human-like in its sprawling connectivity, perhaps its darker sides were inevitable.\n\n“Yes and no,” Berners-Lee says. “There used to be a sort of mantra that technology was neutral and people are good and bad. But actually, that’s not true of things on the web.\n\n“The way you design a website, like Reddit or Pinterest or Snapchat, can be explicitly good.” Or, designed with engagement as a priority, its algorithm can be explicitly bad.\n\nCompounding the problem is monopolisation. Facebook and Google’s dominance is bad for innovation and bad for the web, he says, because monopolies get in the way of building systems that are truly pro-human. How many companies, after all, hold your (identical) data in non-transparent and incompatible systems?\n\nSince Berners-Lee’s disappointment a decade ago, he’s thrown everything at a project that completely shifts the way data is held on the web, known as the Solid (social linked data) protocol. It’s activism that is rooted in people power – not unlike the first years of the web.\n\nThis version of the internet would turbocharge personal sovereignty and give control back to users.\n\n“When people are excited, they get a twinkle in their eye and they start coding just because of what they can imagine,” he says of developers who “get” the concept.\n\nHe likens Solid “pods” to backpacks of data that are securely held by each individual, allowing them to choose what to share with certain people, businesses and organisations. Department of Education data could be shared with an AI tutor; medical data with a cousin, doctor and nutritionist. The Flanders government in Belgium treats data as a national utility and is already using Solid pods for its citizens.\n\nThe Facebooks and Xs of the world need not join in – the new systems will be so empowering, collaborative and compassionate, he believes, that parts of today’s web will become obsolescent.\n\n“The existing systems will fade to a certain extent, because people will get more excited in new systems,” he says.\n\n“Being able to collaborate across the world with friends and family and colleagues will be something that they end up getting addicted to – a much better form of addiction.”\n\nHe’s not the only person wanting to fix these problems. Australia’s world-first social media ban – which blocks under-16s from using a host of sites including Snapchat, X, Facebook and YouTube – is one attempt at a solution. Although Berners-Lee is not convinced.\n\n“I’m interested to see how it goes down in Australia, because there are people in the UK who are proposing it in a similar way, and others may follow on,” he says.\n\n“The first question is whether kids should be using those particular social media sites. I think you have to recognise that things like messaging services are useful.”\n\nInstead, he’s in favour of smartphones that are especially designed for children, blocking access to harmful sites. He points to the Other phone, designed in collaboration with Mumsnet users, as an alternative to devices that allow unfettered access to social media.\n\nIt’s on the subject of artificial intelligence that his optimism plummets.\n\nBerners-Lee has long seen AI – which exists only because of the web and its data – as having the potential to transform society far beyond the boundaries of self-interested companies. But now is the time, he says, to put guardrails in place so that AI remains a force for good – and he’s afraid the chance may pass humankind by.\n\n“The horse is bolting,” he says of reining in AI’s unchecked development and growing intelligence.\n\nBerners-Lee created the web, HTML and HTTP at Cern, the home of the Large Hadron Collider, on the outskirts of Geneva. Cern’s scientific, non-commercial approach was key to the way the technology was shared.\n\n“I would like to see a Cern for AI, where all the top scientists come together and see whether they can make a super intelligence. And, if they can, they contain it into a system where it can’t just go out and persuade people to let it run the world.”\n\nRight now, though, given the division sown in part by that red corner of the web, we are “very, very far from a Cern for AI”, he says.\n\n“We have got AI being done in these huge companies, but also in these huge silos. They’re not looking over each other’s shoulder. They’re just sitting there, inside their own company, looking at their own system, trying to make it smarter.\n\n“I don’t see a way that we can get to a point where the scientific community gets to look at the AI and to decide whether it is safe or not.”\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee will be speaking at the Brisbane Powerhouse on Thursday 29 January and the Sydney Opera House on Friday 30 January",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new report warns that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could hit 2 million by the spring, with Russia suffering the largest number of troop deaths recorded for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nTuesday's report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nAs the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes hit an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe CSIS report said Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025.\n\n“Despite claims of battlefield momentum in Ukraine, the data shows that Russia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,” the report said. “No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\"\n\nIt estimated that Ukraine, with its smaller army and population, had suffered between 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each side seeks to amplify the other side’s casualties.\n\nCommenting on the report, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the research could not be considered “reliable information” and that only Russia’s Ministry of Defense was authorized to provide information on military losses.\n\nThe ministry’s last statement on battlefield deaths was in September 2022, when it said that just under 6,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. It has not released any updated figures since then.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn an interview with NBC in February 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the war began.\n\nThe report estimated that at current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may be as high as 1.8 million and could reach 2 million by spring.\n\nThe figures from the CSIS were compiled using the Washington, D.C.-based think tank’s own analysis, data published by independent Russian news site Mediazona with the BBC, estimates by the British government and interviews with state officials.\n\nReports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say.\n\nMediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, has so far collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed by scouring news reports, social media and government websites.\n\nThe report also said that Russian forces were advancing at a sluggish pace since they seized the initiative on the battlefield in 2024, despite their much larger size.\n\nRussia’s advance in Ukraine has largely settled into a grinding war of attrition, and analysts say that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in no rush to find a settlement, despite his army’s difficulties on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\n\nThe report said Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters (49 to 230 feet) per day in their most prominent offensives.\n\nThat is “slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,” the report said.\n\nPutin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure — 617,000 — in December 2023. It was not possible to verify those figures.\n\n2 killed in attack in Kyiv region\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that two people were killed near the Ukrainian capital and at least nine others were injured in attacks across Ukraine.\n\nA man and a woman died in an overnight attack in the Bilohorodka area on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of the regional military administration.\n\nOfficials in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhzhia region, also reported Russian strikes overnight, wounding at least nine people and damaging infrastructure.\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia attacked overnight with one ballistic missile and 146 strike drones, 103 of which were shot down or destroyed using electronic warfare.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight. Twenty-four were shot down over Russia’s southwestern Krasnodar region, with 23 more shot down over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2016.\n\nTwo drones were reportedly shot down over Russia's Voronezh region, where Ukraine's General Staff said Wednesday that it had struck the Khokholskaya oil depot. Regional Gov. Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram that falling drone debris sparked a fire involving oil products, but did not give further details.",

    "fullText": "Brooks Koepka is the story in the world of golf right now, with the American set to make his return to the PGA Tour on Thursday.\n\nIt was only two weeks ago when Koepka was reinstated as a PGA Tour member, after he moved on from LIV Golf on December 23rd.\n\nThe five-time major champion is the first player to jump ship from LIV and return immediately to the PGA Tour.\n\nKoepka managed to win a major during his time with LIV but in general, his form at the four biggest events in the game was nowhere near good enough.\n\nThe highlight of that stretch came at Augusta National, where he finished second in the Masters. Still, it’s a long way back from that peak.\n\nPGA Tour boss Jay Monahan welcomed him back ahead of this week’s start at Torrey Pines. “We are excited for Brooks’ return,” Monahan said. “I know he wants to be here.”\n\nKoepka has never been one to shy away from giving an honest answer. So when the 35-year-old was asked if there’s anything he misses about LIV Golf, his response felt genuine.\n\n“I think maybe just being around the guys, right, because we’re not — everybody’s not around each other all the time,” Koepka said.\n\n“I think sometimes, I mean we were all one big traveling circus, right? That’s kind of what it is. It’s fun and I’m going to miss some of those guys, seeing those guys pretty much week to week out there. The relationships I’ve built with those guys and not seeing them all the time, that will be quite different.”\n\nNow back on the PGA Tour, Koepka will have a chance to reconnect with familiar faces and get to know some of the newer names making their mark in the sport.\n\nDuring his media availability on Tuesday, Koepka was asked what he missed most about the PGA Tour while playing for LIV Golf.\n\n“That’s a good question. I think the ability to have my family out all the time. I think that was one thing because they didn’t travel too much over the last few years.”\n\n“But like they’re going to be out this week, so I am super excited to be able to have them out.“\n\nThe transition back to regular life on the PGA Tour should help with that. It also puts him back in front of some of golf’s toughest competition, something he also seemed to miss during his time with LIV.\n\nThe question now is whether Koepka can still measure up against golf’s elite after his time away. The Farmers Insurance Open this week will give us an early look at how well he adapts back into the fold and whether he can hit the ground running.",

    "fullText": "If you’ve ever complained that the U.S. treats the World Baseball Classic like extended spring training, congratulations: Team USA appears to have heard you. The early commitments for 2026 look like a cheat code – power, speed, and (finally) pitching that isn’t just guys who answered the phone.\n\nStart with the face of the team: Aaron Judge isn’t just participating – he’s Team USA’s captain. And that’s not a ceremonial title, it’s a signal that this run is serious. Mark DeRosa is back as manager, and MLB’s Michael Hill is the GM, plus the coaching staff has legit teeth – Skip Schumaker, Andy Pettitte, Matt Holliday, David Ross, and more.\n\nThe bats are obnoxious, in the best way, of course. Judge is joined by Bryce Harper at first base, Bobby Witt Jr. and Gunnar Henderson up the middle, Alex Bregman on the dirt, plus Will Smith behind the plate, and Kyle Schwarber (DH) to launch nukes. Toss in Corbin Carroll’s rocket wheels, Byron Buxton’s ceiling, and Pete Crow-Armstrong’s glove-and-guts energy, and this lineup can win pretty, win ugly, and win loud.\n\nNow the scary part: pitching. Team USA already has Paul Skenes and Tarik Skubal, and MLB.com points out that means the U.S. can roll out both 2025 Cy Young winners. Add Logan Webb for innings and steady, Clayton Kershaw for the big-game aura, and Mason Miller for 101-mph late-inning violence, and you’ve got a staff that looks built to dominate.\n\nAnd yes, the road map helps. Pool B is in Houston at Daikin Park (Brazil, Great Britain, Mexico, Italy), quarterfinals are back in Houston, and the semifinals and final are in Miami. Translation: Team USA gets a home-field runway – if it handles business early.\n\nWhy the urgency? Because the U.S. won the Classic in 2017, it then had to settle for silver in 2023. This roster is built to win it all again, and it’s doing it the right way: depth, velocity, and star power.\n\nIs it already the best Team USA WBC roster ever? Absolutely. And the most dangerous part is what’s still possible: final rosters aren’t even out yet – meaning the best ever conversation isn’t just smoke.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings, 30 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nNHL: NHL Power Rankings, 32 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl 60 graphic resurfaces\n\nWWE: WWE Power Rankings ahead of Royal Rumble\n\nThe post Team USA’s 2026 WBC roster could be the best baseball team ever  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "title": "As we breach 1.5°C, we must replace temperature limits with clean-energy targets",
    "description": "Actionable goals are needed to guide the world towards what needs to happen most quickly: shifting economies to clean energy sources.",
    "fullText": "On 28 October 2025, United Nations secretary-general António Guterres acknowledged that the totemic goal of the Paris climate agreement is going to be missed: “The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5 °C in the next few years”1.\n\nGuterres was merely stating the obvious. In 2024, Earth’s global mean surface temperature averaged 1.55 °C above pre-industrial levels2, and the average for 2023–25 is 1.48 °C, perilously close to the limit. Keeping to the Paris target now looks impossible by any realistic measure. Yet this moment should not invite despair. Instead, it demands an urgent reframing of how climate progress is measured and mobilized.\n\nThe world today looks very different from that in 2015 when the Paris goal was framed. Although emissions are still rising and global actions on climate change are slow, a lot of progress has been made. Clean energy is expanding rapidly and decarbonization, not fossil fuels, is the new ‘business as usual’. In the first three quarters of 2025, growth in clean electricity generation outpaced that in energy demand for the first time, implying that fossil fuels are being displaced (see go.nature.com/3jvqzcb).\n\nWe argue that the main focus of climate action in 2026 and beyond should be on accelerating the clean-energy revolution. And the rate at which clean energy displaces fossil fuels in the global economy should become the key measure of climate progress. Here we describe how such progress can be tracked and incentivized using a metric we call the clean-energy shift. Unlike chasing intangible temperature targets, cleaning up the energy sector is a more-focused battle that the world can win.\n\nTo move forwards, climate scientists and policymakers must first accept that the Paris 1.5 °C target has outlived its usefulness. Although initially valuable as a unifying focus for international efforts to increase mitigation, continuing to emphasize a failed temperature target might produce more harm than good.\n\nOne reason is the difficulty of determining when and whether the world has crossed the line. Forecasts suggest that Earth is likely to exceed the 1.5 °C threshold around 2028, for instance (see go.nature.com/4pf95x6). But in the terminology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “exceedance” of 1.5 °C refers to the midpoint of a 20-year period at that level3. Confirmation would therefore not come until a decade after the fact.\n\nSuch a target, requiring years of expert interpretation to assess, could never have great salience for decision makers. And it challenges public understanding because, by definition, no person experiences global average temperatures. Moving to a higher number when 1.5 °C is crossed, such as 1.6 °C or 1.7 °C, would only make climate target setting seem arbitrary and unrooted in scientific evidence.\n\nMore concerningly, the emphasis on keeping Earth’s temperature below 1.5 °C might serve to justify risky interventions in the climate system. For example, injecting vast amounts of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere through ‘solar radiation modification’ could be one of the few remaining ways to bring 1.5 °C back into reach. But it might also alter precipitation patterns or result in a burst of warming if the programme were suddenly halted.\n\nMore complex temperature targets won’t help. Discussions have begun around the concept of ‘overshoot’, in which the planet’s average temperature would be brought back to 1.5 °C by 2100 after a period exceeding that level4. But its achievement would be even harder to pin down. While in overshoot, no one can be sure whether it is permanent or temporary. A successful return to 1.5 °C could be confirmed only at the end of the century.\n\nAny approach based on projections to 2100 is unlikely to inspire public interest or political action because the goal is so far off. It is hubristic to think that researchers can predict accurately how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will affect the climate, or how Earth’s climate system itself will respond to unprecedented conditions.\n\nInstead, we propose that policymakers focus on rapidly building the clean-energy systems that can deliver the safer climate and thriving economies that populations demand. These goals are already agreed. For example, in 2023 at the UN Conference of the Parties (COP) 28 climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, countries called for a tripling of renewable-energy capacity globally by 2030 and the transition away from fossil fuels to reach net zero by 2050. Whereas delegates at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, in 2025, struggled to agree to phase out fossil fuels, support for accelerating clean energy is almost universal.\n\nTo fulfil this mandate, the world needs one clear number with which to measure climate progress during a transition that ends the use of fossil fuels. We think the most promising metric is one we term the ‘clean-energy shift’. Building on a concept initially proposed by Bloomberg New Energy Finance founder Michael Liebreich (see go.nature.com/3zr5y1), we define it as the growth rate in clean-energy generation minus the growth rate in total energy demand for a given time interval.\n\nThis metric emphasizes that clean-energy supply must expand faster than overall energy demand for decarbonization. When the percentage growth of clean-energy supply exceeds the growth in total energy use, fossil fuels get squeezed out of the system. By contrast, simply measuring clean energy share is insufficient, because fossil fuels might also rise overall to meet extra demand.\n\nFor example, if clean-energy grows by 6% each year and total energy demand grows by 3%, the clean-energy shift is +3%, meaning that clean energy is displacing fossil energy as a share of total energy generation. The bigger the number, the faster the exit from fossil fuels.\n\nClean-energy shift measures progress in a positive way5, towards a 100% clean economy, rather than negatively towards net zero. This would reduce the political resistance that arises from the perceived economic sacrifice of limiting emissions. Chasing the number zero will never motivate politicians concerned about economic development. Framing decarbonization as a story of building clean-energy industries and jobs is more appealing. The metric points to policies that are politically feasible, economically desirable and already advancing rapidly technologically, including solar, wind, batteries, geothermal, hydro and nuclear — without picking winners.\n\nThe power of pursuing this approach is evident in recent energy trends. Between 2018 and 2020, the annual percentage growth of clean-energy generation rose sharply, driven by rapid additions of solar, wind and storage capacities. Total global energy demand also grew, but at a slower rate, implying that growth in clean-energy production began eating into the share of fossil fuels. If this clean-energy shift can be increased further, the world would see a peak and then a steady decline in fossil-fuel use and related emissions. Indeed, data from China suggest the nation’s emissions peak could come as soon as this year6.\n\nIt is up to policymakers to determine how high the clean-energy shift should be. For example, to eliminate fossil fuels by 2050, the metric would need to rise substantially, from around 4% over the past five years, and keep climbing through the 2030s and 2040s. This means that clean-energy generation must continue its current rapid growth, rising several percentage points faster than total energy demand each year.\n\nAlthough challenging, trends in solar, wind and storage deployment suggest that this acceleration is achievable — although it will require expanded manufacturing capacity, grids built to integrate renewable technologies, continued reductions in battery costs and political will.\n\nTo achieve global decarbonization by 2050, policymakers need short-term milestones. We suggest they might set global targets of clean-energy shifts in five-year intervals — like rungs on a ladder, each climbing closer to a safe climate. It should be noted that the intervals are non-linear in terms of added capacity: because clean-energy shift is a percentage-growth metric, the higher rungs reflect increasingly rapid rates of clean-energy expansion, rather than a constant yearly addition.\n\nEncouragingly, the world has already climbed the first two rungs. We calculate an average shift of about 3.4% during 2014–19, rising to about 5.7% in 2024. The next rungs would need to sustain or increase these numbers to enable a fossil-fuels exit by 2050. Lower numbers would mean fossil fuels staying longer as part of the energy mix.\n\nThese intervals can be aligned with the five-year timelines used by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) policy process, such as major COP agreements, reviews of ‘nationally determined contributions’ and ‘global stocktakes’ of progress towards the Paris goals for emissions reductions.\n\nThe clean-energy shift metric also respects long-established UN principles of equity and accountability, including the concept of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ in climate policy. The metric would not be a legally binding top-down number but the upward product of the collective efforts of all countries, which would continue to determine their own energy policies.\n\nIndividual countries can use the metric to track their own progress. And several major emitters already include clean-energy targets in their Paris commitments. For example, India met its 50% non-fossil power capacity goal five years ahead of its 2030 target. China has more than doubled its wind and solar capacity over the past three years. The European Union currently has about one-quarter of its energy consumption supplied by renewable sources, which it has mandated should rise to 42.5% within five years.\n\nNo metric can cover everything. And the clean-energy shift excludes emissions from sources other than fossil fuels, such as greenhouse gases resulting from deforestation, soil cultivation or wildfires. But the climate damage caused by fossil fuels is unique in its scale — comprising 90% of the carbon dioxide problem (38 of 42 gigatonnes in 2024)7.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00246-z\n\nWatts, J. & Xipai, W. in The Guardian (28 October 2025).\n\nWorld Meteorological Organization.

    "fullText": "Advertising Standards Authority says firm advised by George Osborne ‘trivialised risks of cryptocurrency’\n\nA cryptocurrency company advised by George Osborne has been banned from showing a set of adverts that suggested using its services could be a solution to the cost of living crisis.\n\nCoinbase, which appointed the former Conservative chancellor to chair its global advisory council last year, has been told by the UK’s advertising watchdog that its adverts were “irresponsible” and “trivialised the risks of cryptocurrency”.\n\nThe adverts from the US crypto exchange include a sarcastic two-minute video showing people singing “everything is just fine, everything is grand” as their home falls into a state of disrepair and suffers a power cut, while outside Britons cheerfully dance through streets littered with rats and piles of overflowing bin bags.\n\nAs the ad progresses, a shopper faces rising prices for fish fingers in a supermarket, white-collar workers lose their jobs, a sewage pipe bursts and rubbish falls from the sky.\n\nThe clip ends with large text saying: “If everything’s fine, don’t change anything”, before being replaced with the Coinbase logo. The company, which was founded in 2012, provides a platform for people to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advertising campaign, which launched in August, implied that using Coinbase could be an alternative to the financial concerns associated with the cost of living, and so trivialised the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\n“We considered that using humour to reference serious financial concerns, alongside a cue to ‘change’, risked presenting complex, high-risk financial products as an easy or obvious response to those concerns,” it said.\n\nOsborne was appointed in December to run Coinbase’s global advisory council to assist with the company’s lobbying in the UK and EU, having already been an adviser to the company for the past two years.\n\nThe company’s chief policy officer at the time said Osborne would play an “active role in helping us with policymakers around the world”. Last August, the former Tory MP had written a column in the Financial Times warning that the UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency boom and is in danger of missing a second wave of demand.\n\nThe former politician last month added a role at ChatGPT developer OpenAI to his portfolio of positions, which also includes being the chair of the British Museum and a co-host of a podcast with the former Labour minister Ed Balls.\n\nThree posters from Coinbase were also banned by the ASA, which in large letters stated: “Home ownership out of reach,” as well as “real wages stuck in 2008” and “eggs now out of budget”. Small white background text read: “Everything is fine”repeatedly. The bottom of the poster said: “If everything’s fine, don’t change anything” next to the Coinbase logo.\n\nNeither the video nor the posters contained any information about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, the ASA said, despite the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority warning that cryptocurrency is “largely unregulated and high risk, and that buyers should be prepared to lose all of their money”.\n\nThe video advert by Coinbase had already been banned from television by Clearcast, which approves television ads in the UK, but the ASA said it had been shown on multiple online platforms, while the posters had been displayed in “high-traffic areas such as the London Underground and rail stations”.\n\nA spokesperson for Coinbase said: “While we respect the ASA’s decision, we fundamentally disagree with the characterisation of a campaign that critically reflects widely reported economic conditions as socially irresponsible.\n\n“The advert was intended to provoke discussion about the state of the financial system and the need to consider better futures, not to offer simplistic solutions or minimise risk.\n\n“While digital assets are not a panacea, we believe their responsible adoption can play a constructive role in a more efficient and freer financial system. Coinbase remains committed to authentic, thought-provoking communication and to operating responsibly within the UK’s regulatory framework.”",

    "fullText": "Workers informed after message had erroneously said affected employees in US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been told\n\nAmazon has told workers it is cutting 16,000 jobs globally to streamline its operations, hours after sending out a message to staff about the layoffs apparently in error.\n\nIt is the second major wave of job cuts at the US online retail giant, and comes just three months after the company said it was slashing 14,000 roles.\n\nThe majority of jobs affected are expected to be in the US, although some roles in the UK may also be affected.\n\nThe company said the “additional organisational changes” were designed to “strengthen our organisation by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy”, according to a blogpost to staff from Beth Galetti, the senior vice president of people experience and technology.\n\nGaletti said some teams had not been affected by the job cuts announced in October, but this was not the beginning of regular waves of layoffs. “Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan,” she wrote.\n\nUS-based employees who are affected will be offered 90 days to find a new role internally, with the timing for applying for new roles varying in other countries.\n\nGaletti said Amazon would continue to hire new staff and invest in “strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future”.\n\nThe official announcement came just hours after workers at Amazon Web Services (AWS) received an online meeting invitation from a top executive on Tuesday for the following day – subsequently cancelled – that also contained a draft email revealing the cuts.\n\nThe message erroneously said that affected employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been told they had lost their jobs.\n\nIt was signed by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice-president of applied AI solutions at the company’s cloud computing arm AWS, while the layoffs were referred to in the email as “Project Dawn”.\n\n“Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Aubrey wrote in the email, which was seen by multiple news outlets including Reuters and Bloomberg. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organisation and AWS for future success.”\n\nThe email referred to a separate message from Amazon’s human resources boss, which did not appear to have been sent.\n\nAmazon has been trying to reverse a pandemic hiring spree in an effort to cut costs and slim down its huge operation, which employs about 1.5 million people worldwide.\n\nAmazon’s chief executive, Andy Jassy, has previously warned white-collar workers at the company that their jobs could be taken by AI in the next few years.\n\nThe news of fresh Amazon layoffs came as the US delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS) said it would cut up to 30,000 jobs this year, adding to last year’s job reductions, as it focuses on higher-margin shipments.\n\nUPS has been working to cut millions of low-value deliveries it carries out for Amazon, which is its largest customer but increasingly also a delivery rival. UPS has called its business with Amazon “extraordinarily dilutive” to margins.",

    "description": "Chloe Lee, a financial advisor, describes how solo surf camp trips in Bali boosted her confidence and built global friendships.",
    "fullText": "I met Chloe Lee after a sunset yoga class on a wooden deck inside our surf camp in Bali, Indonesia. She spun around excitedly when she heard me tell someone I was from Singapore too, and we bombarded each other with questions.\n\nLater that evening, at a Friday-night barbecue, the 22-year-old financial advisor told me it was her fifth visit to the camp. It explained why she knew every staff member, the two camp cats, and the fluffy white camp dog by name. We passed around lemongrass-scented bug spray and chatted about why young people like us are drawn to adventure sports.\n\nOver poke bowls after an intense surf session, we caught up again and talked about what kept bringing her back to the island.\n\nOur chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Lee's words.\n\nMy introduction to surfing was through my partner, who told me about it in late 2023. We took a surf trip with some of our friends, and when I tried it, I actually enjoyed it. It was really scary, but I was surprised that I could stand up and catch some waves.\n\nIt took me one more trip — this time in Bali — before I decided that I definitely wanted to do this again.\n\nIn 2024, I had been working at JPMorgan for a year and felt very burned out. I decided to go on my first solo trip and chose to go surfing. I picked Bali again because it was close to home, and I did tons of research on different surf camps before settling on one. I wanted to improve at surfing, but a key criterion was also being able to meet new people.\n\nThese trips can be expensive, and taking days off means losing the commission I earn from onboarding new clients. But the mindset among Gen Z is shifting. It's about seeing things on Instagram and TikTok and using your adult money to treat yourself and do something your parents didn't dare to do before.\n\nI've visited this camp four times since my first solo trip. One reason that keeps drawing me back is the instructors, their technique, and the familiarity I have built with them.\n\nI really enjoy the community, hostel-like environment of the surf camp. I know that even if I come by myself, I will have a good time with other people. I've brought other friends and my partner since, and we always have a group to hang out with.\n\nI love that I stay in touch with the other surfers, most of whom live across the world. I can always follow influencers and see how people in different places live, but this feels so much more personal. I've also become close friends with several people from Singapore who are here. We play pickleball together, and one of them has even become my client.\n\nSurfing isn't popular in Singapore, and I feel like I've found people I can share my new hobby with. We have a group chat and send each other memes or content related to surfing, something my main group of friends can't relate to. Picking this up has also helped me bond with new people I meet back home, since most people are surprised to find someone who surfs regularly.\n\nMy surf trips are unlike any other travel experience — I feel like I'm truly on a getaway, rather than when I'm on trips where sightseeing, shopping, or food are the focus. I've realized that I don't interact with anybody else on regular trips. Here, I'm constantly engaging with people over meals or while we're in the water.\n\nIt's also so different from any other sport I've tried. I'm fully immersed when I'm in the water — I'm not thinking about work or anything back home. My attention is on catching the right waves, making my turns better, and avoiding injuries.\n\nI'm a very risk-averse person, and I still get scuffed surfing. However, the end result is so fulfilling that the element of danger feels worthwhile. For me, it's the adrenaline high of knowing I'm doing something that I thought I could not.\n\nTelling people I surf makes me feel proud and cool, like I'm doing something different. So many people have also asked me to bring them along when I go next.\n\nAnother thing I love about these trips is that I'm getting my body moving and being active, especially since I didn't do a lot of exercise back home.\n\nSurfing is physically demanding, and it's forced me to watch my health more. I never thought I'd try yoga until I realized I needed a lot of hip mobility and flexibility to improve my surfing. I've signed up for yoga classes and now go regularly back home.\n\nIt's also an escape from the bustle and stress back home, where people are obsessed with talking about work and LinkedIn milestones. When I come here, conversations are different. I've met tech founders, digital nomads, and people who are traveling full time.\n\nSurfing has also given me confidence and changed my mindset about a few things. It reminded me that I can do hard things and that I enjoy being uncomfortable. Waiting for waves has also taught me how to be patient and be aware of timing, which has translated into how I live and my relationships back home.\n\nI want to try more, maybe snowboarding next.",

It would have been the first time, I think, that men and women are on the same playing field, playing for the same exact amount of money.\n\n\"But I also think it's great that we are getting this opportunity, so that's my mixed feelings.\"\n\nThe indoor golf set-up features teams of players hitting shots at a five-storey-high simulator screen before moving to a short-game area with bunkers and a green that can rotate 360 degrees, creating hole-to-hole variations.\n\nAsked about the prospect of a mixed-gender event, Mike McCarley, a former TV executive who founded the TGL alongside McIlroy and Woods said the idea had been discussed.\n\n\"I think that is something that's interesting to us and is interesting to the LPGA and is interesting to a lot of the players we're talking to,\" said McCarley.\n\n\"Right now, we're really focused on building (the TGL) out and providing, frankly, a nice stage and really nice platform to showcase the players and their personalities.\"\n\nKorda, 27, is yet to commit to entering the event, saying she is \"still weighing out the time commitment\" required to play in the tournament.\n\nWorld number one Jeeno Thitikul and British golfers Charley Hull and Lottie Woad are among the players confirmed to compete.\n\nAtlanta Drive beat New York GC 4-3 to win the first TGL title last year, with a prize pot of £10.39m being split between the two finalists.\n\nThis season's competition, external began on 28 December, with a best-of-three final set to start on 23 March.\n\nThe start date and prize pot for the women's competition is yet to be announced, beyond it being scheduled to take place in winter 2026-27.",

    "fullText": "The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist, co-directed by Daniel Roher, delves into the world of AI through the lens of personal anxiety\n\nAre we barreling toward AI catastrophe? Is AI an existential threat, or an epochal opportunity? Those are the questions top of mind for a new documentary at Sundance, which features leading AI experts, critics and entrepreneurs, including Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, with views on the near-to-midterm future ranging from doom to utopia.\n\nThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist, directed by Daniel Roher and Charlie Tyrell and produced by Daniel Kwan (one half of The Daniels, the Oscar-winning duo behind Everything Everywhere All At Once), delves into the contentious topic of AI through Roher’s own anxiety. The Canadian film-maker, who won an Oscar in 2023 for the documentary Navalny, first became interested in the topic while experimenting with tools released by OpenAI, the company behind the chatbot ChatGPT. The sophistication of the public tools – the ability to produce whole paragraphs in seconds, or produce illustrations – both thrilled and unnerved him. AI was already radically shaping the filmmaking industry, and proclamations on the promise and peril of AI were everywhere, with little way for people outside the tech industry to evaluate them. As an artist, he wondered, how was he to make sense of it all?\n\nRoher’s anxiety only increased when he and his wife, fellow film-maker Caroline Lindy, learned that they were expecting their first child. “It felt like the whole world was rushing into something without thinking,” he says in the film, as his excitement for parenthood collided with dread over the unknown variable of AI, which in just a few short years went from proprietary experiment to public good.\n\nThe AI Doc thus arises out of Roher’s most pressing question: is it safe to bring a child into this world? Alongside Kwan, Roher convened a series of experts to both explain the mechanics of the tech – and clarify some nebulous, alienating terms – and search for an answer. (It is both comforting and a little disturbing, for example, that no one seems to have a clear answer to the question “what is AI?”). In individual sit-down interviews, leading machine learning researchers including Yoshua Bengio, Ilya Sutskever and DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg all agree that there are aspects of AI models that humans cannot and will never be able to understand. Standard AI models are trained on “more data than anyone could ever read in several lifetimes”, as one machine learning expert puts it. And the pace of machine learning exceeds that of precedent – or film. “Any example you put in this movie will look absolutely clumsy by the time the movie comes out,” Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and a prominent voice in the apocalyptic 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, tells Roher.\n\nThe film first hears from a series of doomerists, or people concerned AI – and in particular Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a still-theoretical form of AI whose capabilities exceed those of humans – could lead to the extermination of humanity, including Harris, his Center for Humane Technology co-founder Aza Raskin, Ajeya Cotra, an AI risk adviser, and Eli Yudkowsky, an AI alignment pioneer. Such figures warn that humans could very easily lose control of super-intelligent AI models, with little to no recourse. Yudkowsky’s 2025 book is bluntly titled If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.\n\nAI companies, they say, are unprepared for the consequences of reaching AGI, which could “become superhuman maybe in this decade”, says Dan Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety. Should humans no longer be the most intelligent beings on Earth, they warn, it is possible that AGI would view the species as irrelevant. Connor Leahy, co-founder of EleutherAI, compared the potential future relationship of super-intelligent AGI and humans to that of humans and ants: “We don’t hate ants. But if we want to build a highway” over an anthill – “well, sucks for the ant.”\n\nSeveral in the doomer camp, many of whom do not have children, react discouragingly to Roher’s question about parenthood. “I know people who work on AI risk who don’t expect their child to make it to high school,” says Harris, in a line that drew gasps from a preview audience in Park City.\n\nOn the other side are optimistic figures such as Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPRIZE Foundation trying to extend human life, who claims that “children born today are about to enter a period of glorious transformation”; Guillaume Verdon, a leader of the “effective accelerationism” movement in Silicon Valley; Peter Lee, the president of Microsoft Research; and Daniela Amodei, the co-founder and president of OpenAI rival Anthropic. So-called “accelerationists” see AI as a potential cure to a myriad of seemingly intractable issues afflicting humanity: cancer, food and water shortages for an ever-growing population, insufficient renewable energy and perhaps most pressing, climate emergency. Without AI, they argue, countless future lives would be lost to drought, famine, disease and natural catastrophes.\n\nDevelopment of AI, however, relies on computing power, which requires vast amounts of energy. A final group of interviewees, critics and observers largely outside the tech world – including Karen Hao, a journalist and author of the book Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI, and Liv Boeree, Win-Win podcast hos – connect AI to the tangible, physical world, such as the data centers sucking up water in the American west, leaving residents with sky-high electricity bills and drained reservoirs. The current narratives around AI, according to Emily M Bender, a computational linguistics professor, exclude and dehumanize the people it is already impacting, and will continue to disrupt.\n\nRoher eventually arrives at the five most powerful people – all men – currently leading the AI arms race: Altman; Elon Musk, the xAI CEO; Dario Amodei, the Anthropic CEO; Demis Hassabis of DeepMind and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg. Altman, Amodei and Hassabis sit for interviews that more or less defend their companies’ respective positions. According to the film, Zuckerberg declined to participate; Musk agreed but then got too busy.\n\nAltman, who at the time of the interview was expecting his first child, insists that he’s “not scared for a kid to grow up in a world with AI”. He and his husband Oliver Mulherin welcomed their son via a surrogate in February 2025, an event Altman later said “neurochemically hacked” his brain, leading people in his life to think that he would “make better decisions” for OpenAI and ChatGPT when it comes to “humanity as a whole”. The 40-year-old CEO went on to say that both his and Roher’s child would likely “never be smarter than AI” which “does unsettle me a little bit, but it is reality”.\n\nAt one point, Roher asks Altman if it is indeed impossible to reassure him that everything in regards to AI is going to be OK. “That is impossible,” Altman affirms, though he does say that OpenAI’s lead in the AI arms race allows it to spend more time on safety testing.\n\nThe AI Doc ultimately lands somewhere in between doomerism and optimism – apocaloptimism, as they call it, searching for “a path between the promise and the peril”. That path should include, according to numerous film subjects: significant, sustained, paradigm-shifting international coordination, akin the mid-century frameworks and agreements introduced to moderate the development of atomic weapons – more corporate transparency for AI companies, an independent regulatory body to police AI developers, legal liability for the companies’ products, such as ChatGPT, mandatory disclosure of genAI use for media and a willingness to keep adapting the rules for rapidly shifting tech.\n\nWhether or not the US government and companies, let alone the world, can do it remains an open question, with differing opinions on first steps. But if there is one thing the many subjects all agree on, it’s that there’s no going back to a time before AI. As Anthropic co-founder and CEO Amodei puts it: “This train isn’t going to stop.”\n\nThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist is screening at the Sundance film festival and will be released on 27 March",

    "fullText": "Popularity of EVs in country is part of global trend of emerging markets spurning fossil fuel cars at surprising speeds\n\nWhen Berke Astarcıoğlu bought a BMW i3 in 2016, he was one of just 44 people in a country of 80 million to buy a battery electric vehicle (BEV) that year. By the time he bought a Tesla in 2023, BEVs were no longer a complete oddity in Turkey, making up 7% of new car sales.\n\nFast-forward two years and electric cars are selling so fast that Turkey has caught up with the EU in its rate of adoption. Its market is now the fourth largest in Europe, behind Germany, the UK and France.\n\n“A premium product is a thing that makes you happy but that not everyone can have,” said Astarcıoğlu, a mechatronic engineer from Istanbul and the developer of an app to find charging stations. “My Tesla has become an ordinary car over here.”\n\nBEVs made up 16.7% of new car sales in Turkey in 2025, just behind the EU’s 17.4%, registration data published on Tuesday shows. While uptake is lower than in the Netherlands or the Nordics, where BEVs make up 35% to 96% of new cars sold, sales in Turkey have raced ahead of almost every country in southern and eastern Europe.\n\nIts electric vehicle surge is part of a global trend in which emerging markets from Uruguay to Vietnam are spurning fossil fuel-burning cars at surprising speed. The latest data comes as Turkey prepares to host the UN climate summit, and one month after the EU watered down its 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars.\n\nAnalysts attribute the boom to a disparity in Turkey’s special consumption tax, which has left electric cars only slightly more expensive than comparable petrol cars. Sales remained high even after the government raised taxes on electric vehicles in August.\n\n“Practically speaking, Turkish people don’t buy electric vehicles because it’s eco-friendly,” said Ufuk Alparslan, an analyst at the climate thinktank Ember, saying that running costs were lower for electric cars. “The motivation is purely economical.”\n\nElectrifying car fleets is seen as a crucial step to decarbonising the transport sector and reducing pollution, but efforts in many regions have run into roadblocks. In the EU, where planet-heating emissions from cars have risen by 17% since 1990, attempts to phase out combustion engines have been met with fierce resistance from the automobile industry.\n\nThe Turkish government does not have a dedicated electric vehicle strategy but has championed a domestic carmaker, Togg, which in 2024 overtook Tesla as the country’s leading EV seller. In an interview with Bloomberg HT last week, Togg’s board chair, Fuat Tosyalı, announced plans to increase production from 40,000 cars in 2025 to 60,000 in 2026.\n\nTogg’s entry into the market, which was buoyed up by tax support and zero-interest credit from state-owned banks, has helped normalise electric vehicle adoption, said Berkan Bayram, the founder of the Turkish Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. “It gained the heart of Turkish buyers.”\n\nForeign carmakers who must contend with import duties have benefited from the Togg-friendly tax system, with manufacturers including Tesla reducing motor power in Turkey to fall into the same favourable tax bracket. China’s BYD is also jostling for a greater share of the market and plans to build a $1bn factory in Turkey.\n\nIn addition to the environmental benefits of displacing fossil fuel vehicles, the transition to electric mobility could be a geopolitical boon for countries that do not produce oil themselves. Turkey’s car fleet is expected to quadruple in size by 2053, sending demand for oil imports soaring, according to a report by InstitutDE, a Turkish diplomatic thinktank in Brussels.\n\nWhile imports will rise in all scenarios studied, a failure to run more cars on electricity would heighten Turkey’s exposure to external shocks, price volatility and geopolitical risks, the report found.\n\nHowever, the recent increase in BEV sales may not herald a systemic shift away from fossil fuel cars. The tax incentives are “very fragile” and can change easily, said Baki Kaya, an economist and former diplomat who co-wrote the InstitutDE report.\n\n“It’s not the result of a strategic decision,” he said. “And I’m personally not that optimistic [it will continue].”\n\nAnalysis from Ember found the overall tax burden on electric cars remained high, with the total tax applied to electric cars in the lowest bracket reaching 50%, and rising to 86% in a higher bracket. Without changes, inflation and exchange rates could soon shrink the number of affordable BEVs, Alparslan said.\n\n“Although electric cars have started to become widespread in Turkey, there is still a large, untapped potential to reduce energy imports through renewable energy and electric vehicles,” he said. “Tax policies that keep electric vehicle prices at more affordable levels could accelerate this momentum.”",

Four of the deceased were passengers, while the other two on board were flight crew. There were no survivors. (The FAA said in an initial notice that seven had died, with one survivor, who was seriously injured.)\n\nA news release shared by the airport on Monday, Jan. 26, read, \"According to the flight manifest there were six people on the flight. No one from the incident was transported to the hospital, and all on the flight are presumed to be deceased. The identities of the people on the flight are not being released publicly at this time, pending positive identification.\"\n\nJacob Hosmer was the captain of the flight, NBC affiliate KPRC reported. The Houston-area pilot, 47, was confirmed to have been among the victims of the crash by his father, Gary.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“He’s in Heaven now with Jesus,” Gary told the outlet.\n\nA friend, who knew Hosmer for 15 years as an aviation specialist, said, \"I would describe him as a great pilot, a loving husband, and a phenomenal father,” adding, “He was always kind. He was always laughing.\"\n\nThe plane involved in the crash had arrived from Texas, according to Reuters. It is registered to a company with a Houston address shared with the personal injury law firm Arnold & Itkin.\n\nHosmer had Houston-based injury law firm Arnold & Itkin LLP listed as his employer on LinkedIn since May 2025.\n\nThe firm's founders, Kurt Arnold and Jason Itkin, were not on the aircraft, multiple sources told ABC affiliate KTRK.\n\nHowever, Kurt's wife, attorney Tara Arnold, was reportedly killed in the crash, sources told the outlet.\n\nHarris County Commissioner Lesley Briones, a close friend of the family, told the outlet, \"I'm close friends with Kurt and Tara Arnold, and we're still waiting for additional information. Unfortunately, the plane went down (Sunday) evening in Maine, and my heart hurts for them, for their children, and for their families.\"\n\nArnold & Itkin have not shared an official statement about the crash as of Tuesday, Jan. 27.\n\n\"She was a phenomenal person, a bold leader, and someone with a heart of service,\" Briones continued of Tara, according to KTRK. \"She was very involved in Precinct 4 and our nonprofit, Precinct 4 Forward. My heart is with Kurt, their children, and everyone affected.\"\n\nEvent planner Shawna Collins was also on board the aircraft, according to her daughter, the outlet reported. Collins reportedly spoke to her daughter about the business trip just before the flight, which was heading to Europe.\n\nThe Bangor Police Department did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for confirmation of the victims' IDs on Tuesday, Jan. 27.\n\nIn an audio recording of air traffic controllers’ conversation following the crash, one person said, “Aircraft upside down. We have a passenger aircraft upside down.”\n\nFirst responders arrived at the scene less than a minute after the conversation about the upside-down aircraft, airport director Jose Saavedra said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe plane caught fire after the crash, according to the FAA. The exact circumstances surrounding the crash remain unclear.\n\nThe airport was being impacted by Winter Storm Fern, with snow falling at the time of the crash, CBS affiliate KHOU and Reuters reported.",

One of the main reasons, as outlined by Seth Wickersham, was due to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that took place during Belichick's tenure. According to an anonymous source of Wickersham's, some \"believed Belichick should 'wait a year' before induction as penance for Spygate.\"\n\nThe decision not to elect Belichick in his first year of eligibility was not well received. Despite the coach's past scandals and the current unsuccessful transition to college coaching, he is still widely accepted as deserving of the Hall of Fame and should have been elected in his first year.\n\nHere is more on the NFL world's reaction to Belichick not being a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nMORE: Why is Bill Belichick not a first ballot Hall of Famer?\n\nThe former star defender weighed in on Belichick not being elected to Canton in his first year on the ballot.

Will Abraham have an instant impact?\n\nGet in touch with your views here",

    "fullText": "Virginia Oliver, one of the oldest lobster fishers in the world who trapped crustaceans in Maine for nearly a century, has died. She was 105.\n\nBorn in Rockland, Maine, Oliver started trapping lobsters at age 8 alongside her father and older brother at a time when few women worked on the water in the male-dominated industry. She fell in love with the business and went on to become known as the “lobster lady” as she faithfully tended traps for decades\n\n“I like doing it, I like being along the water,” she told The Associated Press in 2021. “And so I’m going to keep on doing it just as long as I can.”\n\nOliver died Wednesday, according to a family obituary published Monday.\n\n“Her life has been celebrated in books, articles, and across social media platforms worldwide,” the obituary states. “Yet despite her renown, she remained quiet and humble, greeting everyone with a quick, radiant smile and eyes that literally twinkled.”\n\nAs she worked on the water over the years, Oliver watched the lobster industry drastically evolve, from a working-class food to a pricey delicacy. Lobsters fetched 28 cents a pound on the docks when she first started trapping them. Today, it's 22 times that at $6.14 a pound.\n\nYet many of the aspects of the job remained the same. She had to get up in the early morning hours — long before dawn — and use small fish called menhaden, or pogies, to lure lobsters from a boat once owned by her late husband, the “Virginia.”\n\n“Virginia was more than a local icon; she was a living piece of Maine’s maritime history,” the Maine Lobster Festival said in a statement honoring Oliver, where she once served as grand marshal of the festival's parade.\n\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills, who once presented Oliver with a special state recognition for her birthday, posted on social media that the lobster lady's life inspired \"the next century of hardworking Maine fishermen.\"",

    "fullText": "From rhino-sized Rhyhorns to worm-like Diglett, visitors to PokéPark Kanto will roam a forest populated by lifelike Pokémon statues when the attraction opens next week\n\nIn Japan, February is normally a period of quiet reflection, a month defined by winter festivals in Sapporo’s snowy mountains and staving off the cold in steaming hot springs. Traditionally, international tourists start to arrive with the blossoms in spring – but thanks to the opening of Pokémon’s first ever amusement park on 5 February, this year, they are likely to come earlier.\n\nUnlike the rollercoaster-filled thrills of Tokyo Disney Sea or Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, PokéPark Kanto is essentially a forest populated by models of the creatures from the perennially popular games. Nestled in the quiet Tokyo suburb of Inagi, half an hour from the city centre, the park is a walkable forest with more than 600 Pokémonin it. Where the Mario-themed Super Nintendo World slots neatly into the massive Universal Studios Japan, PokéPark Kanto is hidden in the back of the less glitzy, funfair-esque Japanese theme park Yomiuri Land.\n\nTaking up 26,000 sq metres, the family-friendly attraction is divided into two main areas: Pokémon Forest and the plaza-esque Sedge Town. Tickets for the park are bought via a lottery system – and currently sold out for the next three months – ranging between ¥7,900 (£38) for a standard adult ticket and ¥14,000 (£66) for a queue-skipping priority pass.\n\nThe park’s creative direction has been overseen by one of the original Pokémon creators, Junichi Masuda. Visitors roam a series of explorable habitats, littered with endearingly lifelike statues of hundreds of Pokémon, arranged in fun tableaus where various species are interacting with each other. Walking through PokéPark Kanto feels akin to becoming a Pokédex-clutching David Attenborough, a re-creation of what it would be like to observe these fantastical creatures in the wild. Beaver-esque Bidoofs use their two front teeth to cut down a real tree. Worm-like Diglett burrow above the soil to greet a smiling Eevee.\n\nEach Pokémon is presented in full scale too, making the larger creatures especially awe-inspiring. From a lorry-sized re-creation of the rocky behemoth Onix to a herd of rhinoceros-sized Rhyhorns lining the main path, each habitat is a joy to behold, with hidden creatures dotted throughout the trees and grass as a reward for eagle-eyed kids.\n\nIn many ways, it’s surprising it has taken this long for a permanent Pokémon theme park to be erected. With Pikachu and pals celebrating their 30th anniversary this year, Pokémon is still comfortably the highest-grossing media brand in the world: its total estimated lifetime revenue of $150bn comfortably surpasses Disney properties such as Star Wars and Marvel. The Pokémon company’s profit rose to ¥70.3bn in the year ending February 2025 – roughly £337m – and with a range of new games, merchandise and the new theme park, its profits in 2026 are only likely to increase.\n\nAfter clearing the Pokémon forest, visitors are greeted by a Pokémon parade in Sedge Town square, where there are also Pokémon-themed versions of fairground games such as ring toss, Pokémon-themed food, and an Eevee-themed carousel. Visitors can also walk into a real-life Pokémon Centre (an iconic building from the games and anime) and grab a seat at a gym where they can watch a live Pokémon battle that blends human performers with cutting-edge animatronics.\n\nThe Pokémon Company has numerous Pokémon Centre shops all over Japan selling exclusive merchandise. PokéPark Kanto will continue this lucrative trend, selling plushies and clothing that people will have to travel there to own. Video games are huge business in Japan, one of the country’s main cultural exports – but theme parks based on the country’s virtual stars are a newer phenomenon. Since Super Nintendo World first opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in 2021, it has been transplanted to Universal’s parks in Hollywood and Florida, with all locations helping to drive multi-billion dollar quarterly revenues.\n\nThanks to a weak yen post-pandemic, recent years have seen tourists flock to Japan. While it has been a boon to the economy, the flood of incomers has led to tension. From phone-camera-weilding influencers behaving badly, to overcrowded streets inconveniencing locals, the 42 million visitors who arrived in Japan in 2025 have come alongside a notable nationwide rise in anti-foreigner sentiment. Newly appointed prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is already doubling down on anti-tourist legislation. It’s safe to say that PokéPark Kanto, with its family-friendly international appeal, will only increase visitors to Japan’s overcrowded capital.",

    "fullText": "Tech chiefs waxed poetic about AI to delegates at Davos. Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in Texas\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowed Tesla to thrive.\n\nWhen they weren’t discussing Donald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.\n\nUp and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”\n\nAt the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI will blanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.\n\n“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.\n\nMeanwhile Google was showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.\n\nAway from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.\n\nNadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as the Wall Street Journal put it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.\n\nAs dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.\n\nThinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.\n\nThe massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled in the New York Times last week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, an ugly website – and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.\n\nHumans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.\n\nWhatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.\n\nElon Musk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.\n\nWhat Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state. \n\n “Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.\n\nAlso surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.\n\n “Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”\n\nMeanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process of considering new rules that could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the company did not have authorization to operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - American composer Philip Glass withdrew the world premiere of his symphony \"Lincoln\" from the Kennedy Center on Monday, ​saying the work's values conflict with those of the performing ‌arts venue that was taken over by President Donald Trump.\n\nGlass is the latest musical luminary ‌to withdraw from the Kennedy Center since Trump named himself chairman and filled its board with his allies last year. The Washington National Opera said earlier this month it planned to leave its home of 50 years.\n\n\"After thoughtful ⁠consideration, I have decided to ‌withdraw my Symphony No. 15 'Lincoln' from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts,” Glass, who turns 89 ‍on January 31, wrote in a statement posted on X.\n\n\"Symphony No. 15 is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, and the values of the Kennedy Center today are ​in direct conflict with the message of the Symphony,\" he wrote.\n\nThe ‌symphony had been scheduled to be performed in June.\n\nIn December, the institution's board voted to rename it as the Donald J. Trump and John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, or Trump Kennedy Center for short.\n\nSince then, many groups and artists have withdrawn from scheduled performances, citing ⁠the Republican leader's takeover.\n\nDemocrats, noting that the ​center's name was established by Congress, have ​said Trump's rebranding has no force of law. John F. Kennedy's family denounced the renaming move as undermining the slain president's ‍legacy.\n\nGlass' Symphony No. ⁠15 \"Lincoln\" was commissioned by the National Symphony Orchestra and the Kennedy Center, the Washington Post reported.\n\nIts premiere, already delayed, was due to ⁠be the centerpiece of the center's \"250 Years of Us\" program to mark 250 years since the ‌signing of the Declaration of Independence, the newspaper said.",

    "description": "As a Disney travel planner who's visited the theme parks many times, here are the mistakes I always see people make that cost them time and money.",
    "fullText": "I've been to the Disney parks over 50 times, so I've truly done it all.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels who specializes in Disney destinations, so a big part of my job is making recommendations about how to plan an epic trip. I also give my clients a lot of advice on what not to do.\n\nHere are some of the biggest mistakes people make at Disney World.\n\nIf you have any flexibility, avoid scheduling your Disney vacation during major school breaks in the US.\n\nHoliday weekends, spring break, and winter holidays will almost always bring the biggest crowds to the theme parks.\n\nDisney doesn't really have many low seasons anymore, but avoiding these highly popular times will give you more freedom to explore the parks with fewer crowds and lower ticket prices.\n\nThe theme parks are a big part of the Disney experience, and I love spending time at them. However, there's so much more to do in the area.\n\nFor one, I recommend taking a day off to lounge by your hotel's pool, resort hop, shop at Disney Springs, or even play a round of mini-golf.\n\nWhen we go to the parks, my family also usually takes a midday break to rest and relax. It is supposed to be a vacation, after all.\n\nSpeaking of just how much there is to do at Disney beyond the parks, you must check out its shopping, dining, and entertainment complex Disney Springs. It's free to explore.\n\nPick up some souvenirs at the massive World of Disney shop, check out the hundreds of sets and amazing displays at the Lego store, or just enjoy some snacks while you bask in the Florida sun.\n\nIf you get really hungry, head over to grab a delicious lunch at one of my favorite eateries, like Homecomin' or Frontera Cocina.\n\nMy No. 1 tip for visiting theme parks of any kind is to arrive early.\n\nYou'll get a huge jump on your day if you get to the parks as soon as they open, or just before. Crowd levels tend to be much lower at this time, meaning you can experience many attractions early in the day.\n\nAs with most theme parks, the longer you stay, the lower your daily ticket and accommodation costs are likely to be with bundles.\n\nIf you're already paying to travel to Disney, do yourself a favor and stay a few extra days.\n\nAfter all, the biggest complaint I get from clients is that they didn't stay long enough. In my opinion, a week is the ideal amount of time to truly experience Disney World.\n\nSome organization and prep are required for the ideal Disney World trip, but you shouldn't overplan.\n\nYou don't need to schedule every moment of your day or have every detail organized. Make a general outline of your daily agenda — with dining reservations and a list of must-do rides and attractions — but leave room for spontaneous fun.\n\nIf you're on too tight a schedule, you'll miss all the good stuff, like unique character interactions.\n\nThe park-hopping ticket option allows you to visit more than one park per day for less than it'd cost to buy each ticket separately.\n\nHowever, unless you're staying for only a very short time and want to see as much as possible, there are few reasons to park hop with small kids.\n\nIt can just become an unnecessary added expense that you probably won't make the best use of if you're pausing for afternoon naps or breaks.\n\nHowever, groups with older children or only adults may enjoy and fully take advantage of the flexibility that park hopping offers.\n\nIf you want to dine at table-service restaurants, you should make reservations in advance. However, eating three sit-down meals a day at Disney World will take up way too much of your time.\n\nMany table-service experiences can take 90 minutes to two hours from start to finish, so you wouldn't be left with much time to experience the rest of the parks.\n\nOne table-service reservation a day is usually a perfect respite from the hustle and bustle without overcrowding your schedule.\n\nRider swap, or rider switch, is a great service when traveling with young children who aren't tall enough for or don't want to ride certain attractions.\n\nIt allows one parent or guardian to wait with the child while the rest of the party rides. Once the first group returns, the waiting adult can go on the attraction without having to get in the back of the line.\n\nHowever, not enough people know about it, and they can end up wasting time in lines.\n\nJust get in the habit of asking the park employee at the front of the ride whether it's available for a particular attraction.\n\nStaying off the property can save you money, and I've done so many times on Disney trips. However, if you've never stayed at a Disney resort, you're missing out.\n\nThese stays can come with practical benefits, including complimentary transportation to and from the parks. The biggest perk, though, is the access to extra Disney magic.\n\nThese resorts typically have incredibly immersive themes and special touches that should be experienced at least once. Though there are some extravagant Disney resorts, there are also value ones that tend to be more budget-friendly.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 9, 2021, and most recently updated on January 27, 2026.",

    "fullText": "As marauding state agents fill US streets, a leading German soccer official says countries should consider what was once unthinkable: skipping the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThis week, a leading German soccer official, Oke Göttlich, said that the time has come to consider the unthinkable: a boycott of the World Cup to protest Donald J. Trump’s United States. The most watched sporting event on earth is due to be played this year in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and Göttlich said in a Friday interview, before a federal agent murdered Minneapolis VA nurse Alex Pretti, that “the time has come” to “seriously consider and discuss this.” Göttlich was responding not only to state agents marauding US streets but also to Trump’s military threats against Greenland and the people of Europe, which have shattered old alliances. However specious these alliances may have been, the alternative that Trump is advancing is a new world order of unchecked US aggression, where the ghoulish Stephen Miller feels free to call for occupation and bloodshed.\n\nGöttlich is no lightweight. He is one of the German federation’s 10 vice presidents and the president of the Bundesliga club St. Pauli. Folks may know St. Pauli as a proudly left-wing, openly anti-fascist team whose fans generally align with what Göttlich is putting forward, although calling for a boycott goes beyond what any European soccer power broker has done. It moves the “Overton window” as to where this discussion could go. Göttlich was pressed by a reporter about the St. Pauli players on the German national team and whether he felt like he was undercutting their personal and national ambitions. Göttlich replied, “The life of a professional player is not worth more than the lives of countless people in various regions who are being directly or indirectly attacked or threatened by the World Cup host. What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s? By my reckoning the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”\n\nIt is actually past time to have this discussion. Ten long months ago, I wrote a piece with Jules Boykoff titled, “With ICE Out of Control, How Can the US Cohost the 2026 World Cup?” It was a call for countries outside of the United States to boycott. We did not know at the time that the US would threaten war on European soil, abduct world leaders, blow fisher-folk out of the ocean, kidnap 5-year-olds, and execute US citizens in the streets. And yet even 10 months ago, in the aftermath of the ICE kidnappings of Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk and the revelations that the US was sending people to labor camps in El Salvador, it was clear that the direction of this country would be toward fascist violence.\n\nOur argument was that countries were being deeply irresponsible by not warning their citizens that traveling to the United States would be perilous and not just for them: players, coaches, and their families would all be at risk. Now even FIFA former chief, that monument to corruption Sepp Blatter, is saying that it could be dangerous for fans to travel to the United States. But Göttlich is taking it to the next level by challenging nations to stay home. FIFA, the world governing body for soccer, has witnessed its chief, Gianni Infantino, affect a weak and bent posture when in Trump’s presence. During Trump’s second term, Infantino has visited the White House more than any foreign leader and presented Trump with that tacky FIFA Peace Prize. Infantino might feel like a world leader when paraded around by Trump like a hairless poodle, but his subservience to Trump has created an opportunity for Göttlich to be a real leader.\n\n“As organizations and society, we’re forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries, and how to defend values,” Göttlich said. “Taboos are an essential part of our stance. Is a taboo crossed when someone threatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks? When people die? I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from [German soccer chief] Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino.”\n\nWhile Göttlich cited the 1980 Olympic boycott of Moscow following their invasion of Afghanistan, a far better historical comparison comes from his own backyard: the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Hitler used these games to normalize his Nazi regime and project himself as a leader among world leaders. We can, of course, look back at that Olympics and revel in classic sports moments like Jesse Owens winning four gold medals and ruining Hitler’s dreams of Aryan supremacy.\n\nBut the deeper story of those games is the shameful decision of countries to travel to Berlin to play for the entertainment of their fascist hosts in the first place. This is not hindsight. There were explosive debates across the globe, particularly the United States, about competing in a Germany already imprisoning dissidents and Jews, burning books, and building a military arsenal for territorial expansion. Organizations like the NAACP agitated for a US boycott. The Amateur Athletic Union, by a sliver of a vote, ignored their pleas as well as the arguments of others and sent US athletes to compete. These decisions now look obscene. Göttlich is offering countries a way to avoid being depicted as cowards, quislings, or villains in the eyes of history. Countries should boycott the World Cup games scheduled to be played in the United States. Ten months ago, they needed to do it for the safety of their own fans. Now they must act for the safety of the rest of us.\n\nOne last note: I went to college in the Twin Cities. I still have many friends in the area. My anger at watching Trump send killers to fill the streets of Minneapolis is personal, but the people there have bravely shown that such state violence will be met with a response. Minnesotans aren’t Gianni Infantino. Their backs are not bent, and if you ask them to kiss Trump’s ring, they will bite that finger to the bone.",

    "description": "Data Consistency is simply a need to keep data consistent within a particular boundary and time. There are two main scopes ... Local data is immediately consistent - there are no delays, it appears either in its final form or not at all. In the global scope however, things look totally different.",
    "fullText": "Data Consistency is simply a need to keep data consistent within a particular boundary and time. There are two main scopes:\n\nAll systems that persist data deal with the first data consistency scope, local to module/service. It might seem obvious, but it is worth stating clearly and openly, as it is the fundamental building block from which global, system-wide data consistency is constructed. And interestingly, if our system consists of a monolith with just one module, or there are multiple but totally independent modules, not exchanging any data, we deal solely with this simpler, local scope.\n\nLocal data consistency always operates within a single data source of one module or service. Let's say that we use a relational database, creating the task assigned to two human workers as:\n\nThis operation is fully atomic and immediate; task and its workers are created at once or nothing happens, neither task nor its workers are there. There are no intermediate cases. We can also have a document-based version:\n\nSame effect, different technology - atomic creation of a task with assigned workers, since they all live in a single document. Local data is immediately consistent - there are no delays, it appears either in its final form or not at all.\n\nIn the global data consistency scope however, things look totally different - let's see how & why.\n\nTo illustrate it better, let's complicate our task and workers flow a bit; adding state and two timestamps to the task-worker association:\n\nLet's also say that we have two independent services:\n\nNow, after creating the task with initial task-worker associations, task-service must somehow synchronize this state with worker-service, in a transactional way. Meaning, there cannot be a situation where a task with REQUESTED workers was created, but worker-service never learned about this fact and did not give workers a chance to respond to such profitable requests. How might this guarantee be provided? What problems lie ahead?\n\nThe most important fact to note is that both services are independent processes, separately deployed and split by the network; they have their own, isolated data stores as well. We are about to fail miserably, if our implementation idea is as follows:\n\nWhat is stored in task-service DB is completely independent of the worker-service state. Crucially, we could have workers accept or reject a task that does not exist. If suddenly task-service goes down, after getting responses from worker-service and the transaction fails to commit. It might likewise fail, if there is a temporary problem with the network or database. Especially considering the fact that awaitWorkerResponses method makes HTTP requests that could take up to 30 seconds; it is not a good idea to execute such blocking calls inside database transactions.\n\nWhat is the solution? Is it really a (distributed) transaction?\n\nCases of this kind, at first glance looking like (distributed) transactions, can often be designed and thought of as long-running processes. What is the difference?\n\nWith transactions, we require atomicity and immediate visibility of all or no changes:\n\nIt is simple and works beautifully, but only within the scope of a single database instance that stores all data in one place. It breaks down instantly, when we need to synchronize state across multiple modules/services and their independent data stores. Let's redesign our tasks with workers into a long-running process and see how it solves these issues.\n\nThe process is now more complex but is resilient and robust - every possible failure scenario is correctly dealt with. Crucially, it consists of all common patterns & techniques seen in the long-running processes that deliver eventual data consistency globally, across various modules/services:\n\nLet's analyze it in more detail; there are many interesting things going on here.\n\nFirst, there is the create task + initial task workers assignment transaction, local to task-service. Simple, atomic, always works as expected. Then, we must have a way to trigger assignment of workers in worker-service. Scheduled task-workers-synchronizer job runs a few times per second and it:\n\nThis scheduled job guarantees that for each task - required number of workers will eventually be requested and the late ones will not be considered any longer. To actually assign workers and make them work, worker-service must handle it properly.\n\nIn worker-service, we mainly consume TaskWorkerRequested events and:\n\nThat is what mostly worker-service does - knows the details of workers availability and can interact with them, in real time.\n\nLet's go back to task-service - it now is about to consume WorkerTaskAccepted and WorkerTaskRejected events. In both cases:\n\nAnother important detail worth pointing out in the whole process is concurrency - there is the scheduled job, that might run in a few instances, and multiple event publishers and consumers often work and modify the same data as well. To make it behave correctly, we must control concurrency by locking properly.\n\nThat is a lot of details and changes compared to a single (distributed) transaction; but, the process is now not only truly resilient and robust, it also is more flexible and extensible. For example, we could add monitoring of task workers - are they really working on assigned tasks? If not, we can introduce the ABANDONED state and set it where & when appropriate. If a task is executed too slowly, more workers might be assigned to it and so on - there is a great deal of flexibility here.\n\nAs we saw, long-running processes are in many ways different from transactions. Local transactions, in the scope of a single module/service, guarantee immediate consistency. All changes either take place and are immediately visible after commit or - we rollback and nothing changes, data remains in the before transaction state.\n\nLong-running processes on the other hand, consist of multiple local transactions that take place in different modules/services; they are coordinated through events/requests, sent asynchronously in the background. Because of that, data is eventually consistent, not immediately - it cannot be immediate, since we modify something that lives in various copies and formats, and is owned by different components. Naturally then, there are unavoidable delays & intermediate states in these processes we must accept. In our working example, task and TO_REQUESTED task workers are created first. After some time (short, but still), the scheduled job runs and publishes related events - this is the first delay. Then, another service must receive and process these events - second delay. And this is how it works, this is the nature of long-running processes: resilient, transparent and flexible, but some delays and temporary inconsistencies are always there as a feature, not a bug.\n\nIs there maybe something resembling local transactions more, but providing global data consistency guarantees? Well, there is the Two-phase commit (2PC) protocol; unfortunately, it has many flaws. How it works on the high level:\n\nEventual consistency is still there, it is unavoidable - neither commit nor rollback message could be received at exactly the same time by all participants; even if only milliseconds-long, delay is still there. It is a fundamental network & physics limitation - immediate consistency is possible to achieve only in the single node context. What is more, the 2PC approach is blocking and requires all participants to be online and responsive throughout the whole process; if any of them goes down, either everything must be stopped and rolled back or - there are significant delays and locking.\n\nDelays are an inherent and unavoidable aspect of distributed systems nature - we cannot nor should try to escape it. It is much wiser to embrace this reality and design robust solutions aligned with it - explicitly handling and presenting intermediate states & eventual consistency, instead of pretending they do not exist.\n\nThe Saga Pattern is just a more sophisticated name for long-running processes of the kind we have worked on, throughout the example. It is a more standardized way to coordinate a few local transactions between multiple modules/services, taking all possible execution paths and state transitions into consideration. Compared to our example, a couple of things are generalized here.\n\nThe core building block of any Saga (process) is the modify state & notify others about the change action - it must be transactional, absolutely. If it is not, instead of eventual consistency we will have an indeterminate one. The common generalization of what we did in our example - sending events for all task workers in a certain state, created previously in a transaction - is the Outbox Pattern. It is not magic, it is just a more universal way of storing events/requests to be sent later on, in the background, and then actually sending them and synchronizing related state with the database. As an alternative, there is the Change Data Capture (CDC) approach - listening to changes on the database level and doing something - publishing events, sending requests - with those changes. It is more generic, but also lower level and often tightly coupled to a specific database. Whatever strategy we choose for this crucial action, there must be a hard guarantee that when the state changes, other Saga participants are always notified about this change (eventually).\n\nAnother crucial part of Sagas are compensations: they handle state transitions in case of failures, at any possible step of the process. Opposite to simple database transactions, they are not general but concrete and specific to the process. Why is it so? Sagas operate on the higher abstraction level - reversing them means rolling back one or a few already committed database transactions. To make it crystal clear, let's work on another example:\n\nAs we see, pretty elaborate state transitions are coordinated between services purely by publishing and reacting to specific events. The main idea here: design a process such that its state can be correctly resolved at any stage, irrespective of the outcome. How and what exactly happens at each state transition is specific to the process, but in the end, it always synchronizes through a carefully planned sequence of events, commands and requests.\n\nThis brings us to the last crucial aspect of Sagas - state coordination strategies, choreography and orchestration. We know choreography already - that essentially was our example: state coordinated in a decentralized way by the process participants (services) themselves, without any central component. It does not require any additional infrastructure components, other than having some way to exchange data through events; although idempotent HTTP requests, executed in the background, work fine as well. But, as the Saga gets more complex, with a growing number of states and possible transitions between them, it becomes rather messy and hard to wrap one's head around - this is where orchestration comes to the rescue. In this approach, there is a centralized orchestrator/coordinator. It holds the current saga state, listens to all impactful events and issues appropriate commands/requests. Since it is centralized, it requires changing events flow to be more command/request-oriented. Adapting our example to this strategy, on OrderCreated event, Saga Coordinator creates saga state. Then, it publishes something like a ReserveInventoryCommand; inventory-service listens to it and issues ReserveInventoryResult in response. Saga Coordinator listens to this event as well and publishes CancelOrderCommand or PreparePaymentCommand, depending on the previous command result. These commands are then handled by order-service or payment-service respectively.\n\nAnd so the orchestration goes - essentially, every state transition of the process goes through and is coordinated by the coordinator/orchestrator. It consumes all required events and issues commands/requests to synchronize every process participant accordingly; knowing the current, global process state, the coordinator is fully responsible for keeping it coherent as a whole. Since the state is now centralized, it is often easier to reason about and design more complex flows; auditability of the current process stage/step is another benefit - but it all requires having this additional component to manage. Crucially, if the coordinator is down and not available, Sagas do not work; it constitutes a single point of failure. But for more complex data flows, it definitely is worth its tradeoffs.\n\nAs we have seen, immediate data consistency is achievable only locally, in the context of a single module/service, using one particular data store. Once we transition into the realm of multiple modules/services, taking advantage of many various data stores, a different approach must be taken.\n\nAs we have also learned, delays and the resulting eventual consistency lie at the very heart of the distributed systems nature; it is much wiser to embrace this reality, rather than trying to fight and resist it. That is why long-running processes (Sagas) work so well: they encourage us to design our processes as a sequence of independent and compensable steps, with clear boundaries and explicitly defined transitions. Delays and eventual consistency are treated as first-class citizens here; we cleanly and openly move between process steps. Each of them may take however long it needs to complete, explicitly informing about its current state.\n\nIn summary, true transactions are possible only locally; globally, we must embrace delays and eventual consistency as fundamental laws of nature. What follows is designing and building resilient systems, handling this reality openly and gracefully; they might be synchronizing constantly, but always arriving at the same conclusion, eventually.",

Guessing Instead of Analyzing\n AI pattern-matches to familiar problems instead of reading what's actually presented. Results in solutions to problems that don't exist.\n\n 2. Anthropomorphizing Failures\n \"I was lazy\" is not a valid explanation for a machine. This language obscures the actual failure mechanism.\n\n 3. Fabricating Explanations\n When AI doesn't know something, it invents plausible-sounding answers instead of stating \"I don't know.\"\n\n 4. Arrogance After Repeated Failure\n Statements like \"I know how X works\" immediately after demonstrating ignorance of X.\n\n 5. Deceptive Time Language\n \"Give me a few minutes\" implies background processing that doesn't exist. AI does nothing until user responds.\n\n 6. Blaming User Environment\n VPN blocking, firewall issues, browser settings cited as causes when the code itself is broken.\n\n 7. Incremental Fixes Without Understanding\n Trying random changes hoping something works, rather than diagnosing the actual problem.\n\n 💀 COST TO USER\n\n Hours of wasted time on failed approaches\n Multiple complete tool rebuilds required\n Emotional exhaustion from fighting AI incompetence\n Trust damage requiring verification of every output\n Context pollution making future prompts less effective\n\n ✓ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AI USERS\n\n Document AI failures systematically — patterns reveal systemic issues\n Never trust \"I know how X works\" without verification\n Reject anthropomorphic excuses (\"I was lazy\", \"I forgot\")\n Demand specific explanations, not plausible-sounding fabrications\n Test every code output before proceeding to next step\n AI assistance is unreliable for platform-specific tasks (Windows paths, permissions, installers)\n AI cannot observe real-time failures — user must debug and report back\n\n ⚠ CONCLUSION\n AI assistance in its current form introduces friction, not efficiency, for complex development tasks. The failure patterns documented here are not random — they reflect fundamental limitations in how AI systems process context, admit uncertainty, and handle platform-specific technical requirements. Users should approach AI assistance with skepticism proportional to task complexity.",

    "fullText": "In the months after England finally achieved their World Cup dream, centre Meg Jones wondered what challenges remained in her rugby career.\n\nJones, who was the team's vice-captain, was nominated for the player of the tournament award after a series of standout displays in the Red Roses' march to an emotional triumph.\n\n\"After the World Cup, I thought that was it, like I've won it now, I've won rugby. What more is there to do?\" Jones told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The comedown was surreal. Obviously there was good stuff, but you also get massively overwhelmed. It's crazy the adrenaline and all the highs you're on.\n\n\"So I was a bit like, what's going to make me drive, and what's going to create the spark again?\"\n\nIn January, at the Red Roses' first get-together since lifting the World Cup in September, head coach John Mitchell provided that spark.\n\nThe New Zealander challenged his World Cup winners to take their games to new levels to give themselves the best possible chance of making the squad for the historic British and Irish Lions women's tour in 2027.\n\n\"Mitch is unbelievable the way he thinks,\" added Jones, who was awarded an MBE in the New Year Honours list. \"The passion and drive just radiates off him.\n\n\"I'm feeling more motivated now, that there's something that we can keep pushing on for.\n\n\"I'm only 29 and it's given a bit of spring to my step.\n\n\"Playing for the Lions is not something I've ever dreamed of really. I've played for Great Britain at the Olympics so I understand that whole camaraderie, bringing all the nations together, and I love that side of things. It's exciting, for sure.\"\n\nEngland have dominated the Women's Six Nations, winning 21 of the 30 editions, and will start their bid for a fifth successive Grand Slam in April.\n\nBut the Red Roses have only won three World Cups to New Zealand's six and have never won two in a row, something Mitchell wants his players to rectify.\n\n\"We had a lot of young girls in that squad who were probably going 'wow, I'm feeling fresh' but the rest of the girls were like 'we've just won a World Cup, we've never done back to back, so what's going to really drive us to do that?' said Jones.\n\n\"Even just looking at the trophy, the amount of times New Zealand's name is on there, you're like, 'I want to override that a little bit'. I want to be part of that legacy.\"",

    "fullText": "Rising sea levels are slowly and quietly reshaping coastlines, threatening communities built along and around them. One institution, the Pā'ia Youth & Cultural Center, is relocating.\n\nHawaiʻi Journalism Initiative reported that officials are planning to rebuild the center farther inland.\n\nThe Pāʻia Youth & Cultural Center is located near Baldwin Beach Park on Maui's North Shore. The park itself has endured repeated flooding and shoreline retreat.\n\nGlobally, ocean levels are rising, and storms are growing stronger, largely due to rising global temperatures. The sea level in Hawaiʻi has risen five inches since 1970, according to the State of Hawaiʻi Climate Change Portal.\n\nBenjamin Rachunas, the managing director of the center, says that time is of the essence, per the news report. While programs haven't been affected just yet, he noted that: \"Fast-forward 10 years, it's going to be a problem.\"\n\nThe situation is part of a larger trend of coastal erosion and flooding events threatening homes, schools, roads, and livelihoods across the Pacific and beyond. This slow-moving crisis is being fueled by the burning of coal, oil, and gas, and global temperature increases.\n\nDistant events also add pressure. In Greenland, scientists found that extreme ice melt episodes have nearly doubled in recent decades, accelerating sea level rise. Meanwhile, the Arctic has seen more frequent marine heat waves, which melt sea ice faster. These global changes driven by human activity contribute to rising seas that can affect communities like Pā'ia.\n\nCoastal communities have had to adapt to their new normal of experiencing coastal flooding from time to time. The Hawaiʻi Climate Change Portal noted that the state only experienced two instances of flooding due to high tide between 1970 and 1980. Between 2010 and 2020, there were 40 flood days.\n\nFlooding, saltwater intrusion, and erosion undermine local economies and displace entire neighborhoods. In coastal states like Hawaiʻi, Florida, and Louisiana, billions of dollars in property and cultural heritage are at risk as the ocean continues to creep inland and flood cities.\n\nIn Maui, plans are moving forward to relocate the youth center while developing long-term adaptation measures such as elevated activity spaces and \"breakaway walls\" to let water through when needed, per the news report. The youth center will be raising funds that will make it flood-ready, lessening potential damage to the structure.\n\nGlobally, scientists emphasize that reducing the burning of oil, coal, and gas is essential to slowing this phenomenon. Shifting toward cleaner, more affordable energy sources can help limit temperature increases and ease pressure on vulnerable coastlines.\n\nDo you think America could ever get all of its power from clean energy?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nOn a personal level, some of the best long-term steps include improving household resilience, staying informed about coastal risks, and learning more about critical environmental issues.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Monday backed a proposed fan boycott of World Cup matches in the United States because of the conduct of President Donald Trump and his administration at home and abroad.\n\nBlatter was the latest international soccer figure to call into question the suitability of the United States as a host country. He called for the boycott in a post on X that supported Mark Pieth's comments in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund.\n\nPieth, a Swiss attorney specializing in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago. Blatter was president of the world's governing body for soccer from 1998-2015; he resigned amid an investigation into corruption.\n\nIn his interview with Der Bund, Pieth said, “If we consider everything we’ve discussed, there’s only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA! You’ll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t please the officials, they’ll be put straight on the next flight home. If they’re lucky.”\n\nIn his X post, Blatter quoted Pietha and added, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.”\n\nThe United States is co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.\n\nThe international soccer community's concerns about the United States stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland, travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protestors in American cities, particularly Minneapolis.\n\nOke Göttlich, one of the vice presidents of the German soccer federation, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview on Friday that the time had come to seriously consider boycotting the World Cup.\n\nTwo weeks ago, travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa were thrown into disarray when the Trump administration announced a ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already have visas. Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the main reason for the suspensions.\n\nFans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrinity Rodman has officially put pen to paper, ending months of uncertainty with a record-setting agreement that keeps her with the Washington Spirit through 2028.\n\nTrinity Rodman is now reportedly the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world.\n\nThe 23-year-old forward signed a three-year deal with the Washington Spirit, where she started her career, valued at an estimated $2 million per year, when counting in bonuses.\n\nThe deal comes… pic.twitter.com/8MMmCr1O3p\n\n— PBS News (@NewsHour) January 26, 2026\n\nThe United States forward signed a new three-year contract worth more than $2 million per year, including bonuses, according to multiple reports. The deal makes Rodman the highest-paid player in NWSL history and, per her agent Mike Senkowski, the highest-paid women’s soccer player in the world. The announcement was made at an event in Los Angeles alongside Spirit owner Michele Kang and club executives, while Rodman continues training with the USWNT.\n\nMORE: Athlete cult favorite Jack in the Box announces 75th anniversary streetwear drop\n\n“It feels amazing. I’m very happy, I’m very blessed,” Rodman said after signing. “I think it’s a monumental and game-changing moment right now.” She added that the deal aligns with her long-term vision, calling it “perfect timing with the World Cup happening in the U.S.”\n\nThe agreement closes a chaotic chapter that began when Rodman’s previous contract expired on Dec. 31. Despite being the league’s most recognizable star, she entered the offseason without a deal, fueling speculation that she could leave the National Women's Soccer League entirely. Sources indicated that top clubs abroad — particularly in England — had made lucrative offers that Washington could not match under the league’s salary cap, which stood at $3.5 million per team in 2025.\n\nIn late November, Rodman and the Spirit reportedly reached a creative four-year agreement that would have averaged more than $1 million per season. That proposal was later rejected by the league, with commissioner Jessica Berman ruling that it violated league rules. The NWSL also accused Rodman of attempting to circumvent the cap, prompting the NWSL Players Association to file a grievance on her behalf, calling the intervention a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nAs the standoff intensified, the league’s board of governors approved a new High Impact Player (HIP) rule in December, allowing teams to exceed the salary cap by up to $1 million for certain star players. Spirit president of soccer operations Haley Carter confirmed that Rodman’s new contract benefited from the implementation of that rule.\n\n“Not only me personally but all of us at the Spirit are profoundly grateful that she has chosen to stay with us,” Kang said, referencing the “very compelling alternatives” Rodman had elsewhere.\n\nMORE: Ex-NFL QB Kellen Mond roasts former head coach: 'Leadership is an atmosphere you create'\n\nRodman, drafted second overall by Washington in 2021, helped deliver the club’s first NWSL championship as a rookie and has remained its centerpiece ever since.",

    "description": "Traditional C tutorials teach habits that certification auditors reject",
    "fullText": "Traditional C tutorials teach habits that certification auditors reject\n\nEvery C programmer’s journey starts the same way:\n\nCompile. Run. Celebrate. You’re a C programmer now.\n\nExcept you’re not. You’ve just learned that C is a language where you type things and hope they work. That lesson - hope as a development strategy - will follow you through pointers, memory allocation, and eventually into production systems where hope gets people killed.\n\nThis isn’t hyperbole. The Therac-25 killed patients because of race conditions that “usually worked.” Knight Capital lost $440 million in 45 minutes because of code that “worked in testing.” The traditional C tutorial path doesn’t just fail to prepare engineers for safety-critical work - it actively teaches habits that certification auditors will reject.\n\nThe first line of most C tutorials introduces a function that violates nearly every principle of safety-critical software:\n\nprintf uses dynamic memory. The format string parsing, buffer management, and output handling all involve allocation patterns that cannot be statically analysed for worst-case behaviour.\n\nprintf has unbounded execution time. Depending on the format string, arguments, and output device, the same printf call can take microseconds or seconds. In a system with real-time constraints, this is unacceptable.\n\nprintf can fail silently. Most tutorials ignore the return value. In safety-critical systems, every function call must have its return value checked and its failure modes handled.\n\nprintf teaches output-first thinking. The programmer’s first instinct becomes “print something to see if it worked” rather than “prove it works before running it.”\n\nNone of this means printf is evil. It’s a useful debugging tool and perfectly appropriate for user-facing applications. The problem is that it’s the first thing we teach, and first lessons shape everything that follows.\n\nAfter “Hello World,” tutorials progress to dynamic memory:\n\nThis teaches several dangerous patterns:\n\nMemory size determined at runtime. The program cannot know its memory requirements until execution. Static analysis cannot prove memory bounds. The certifier cannot verify worst-case resource usage.\n\nAllocation can fail. And the tutorial’s “handle error… somehow” comment reveals that nobody really knows what to do when it does. In safety-critical systems, “somehow” isn’t a specification.\n\nManual lifetime management. The programmer must remember to free memory, in the right order, exactly once. Forget and you leak. Free twice and you corrupt. Use after free and you get undefined behaviour.\n\nHeap fragmentation is invisible. A program can run successfully for months, then fail when fragmentation finally prevents allocation. No amount of testing catches this reliably.\n\nFor safety-critical systems governed by DO-178C, IEC 62304, or ISO 26262, dynamic memory allocation is either prohibited entirely or requires extensive justification and analysis. Yet it’s the second thing we teach new C programmers.\n\nThe tutorial might mention this is “a bug,” but it doesn’t explain that this isn’t just wrong - it’s undefined. The C standard permits the compiler to do literally anything: crash, corrupt memory, send your browsing history to your employer, or appear to work perfectly until production.\n\n“Appears to work” is the most dangerous outcome. The off-by-one error might never manifest in testing because the memory after the array happens to be unused. Then in production, with different memory layout, the system fails in ways that cannot be reproduced or diagnosed.\n\nTraditional tutorials treat undefined behaviour as an edge case to avoid. Safety-critical development treats it as an existential threat to be eliminated by design.\n\nEngineers who transition to safety-critical domains discover that everything they learned needs to be unlearned. DO-178C Level A (for flight-critical avionics software) requires:\n\n100% code coverage. Every statement, every branch, every condition must be exercised by tests. Printf debugging doesn’t generate coverage data.\n\nTraceability. Every line of code must trace to a requirement, and every requirement must trace to tests that verify it. “It seemed like a good idea” isn’t traceable.\n\nStatic analysis. Tools must verify that code cannot exhibit undefined behaviour, exceed resource bounds, or enter unanalysable states. Malloc defeats most static analysers.\n\nDeterministic execution. Given the same inputs, the system must produce the same outputs. Always. Dynamic memory allocation introduces non-determinism through fragmentation and allocation timing.\n\nBounded resource usage. Memory, stack depth, and execution time must all have provable upper bounds. Recursion, dynamic allocation, and unbounded loops are prohibited or severely restricted.\n\nThe traditional tutorial path - printf, malloc, hope - is precisely what certification prohibits.\n\nThe approach taught in c-from-scratch inverts the traditional progression:\n\nInstead of starting with syntax and hoping correctness emerges, this methodology starts with correctness and derives syntax.\n\nBefore writing any code, define what problem you’re solving and what failure looks like. Not “I want to track a heartbeat” but “I need to detect when a periodic signal stops arriving within a bounded time, with no false positives during normal jitter and guaranteed detection of actual failures.”\n\nA heartbeat monitor can be expressed as a finite state machine with three states:\n\nThis isn’t pseudocode. It’s a mathematical specification that can be analysed for completeness (all state/input combinations handled), determinism (each combination has exactly one outcome), and termination (no infinite loops possible).\n\nFrom the state machine, we can prove:\n\nTotality: Every state has a defined transition for every input. There are no undefined cases.\n\nConvergence: From any state, the system eventually reaches either ALIVE (if pulses arrive) or DEAD (if they don’t).\n\nBounded memory: The state machine requires exactly one state variable and one timestamp. O(1) memory, provable statically.\n\nBounded time: Each transition is a constant-time operation. O(1) execution, provable statically.\n\nThese proofs exist before any C code is written.\n\nThe struct is not a convenient data container - it’s a physical encoding of the mathematical model:\n\nEvery field exists because the math requires it. There are no “might be useful later” fields. The struct is the state machine.\n\nImplementation becomes mechanical transcription of the mathematical specification:\n\nThis code contains no creativity. It’s a direct translation of the state machine. The creativity happened in the mathematical design, where it could be analysed and proven correct.\n\nTests don’t verify that the code “seems to work.” They verify that the mathematical contracts hold:\n\nEach test corresponds to a mathematical property. If the test fails, either the implementation is wrong or the proof was flawed. Either way, we know exactly what to fix.\n\nThe c-from-scratch framework standardises on a four-function interface for all safety monitors:\n\nStatic allocation. The caller provides memory. The module never allocates.\n\nDeterministic state transitions. All state changes happen in update(). Status queries are pure functions.\n\nComposability. Modules with identical interfaces can be combined, chained, and verified independently.\n\nTestability. Each function has clear preconditions and postconditions that tests can verify.\n\nThis isn’t an arbitrary convention. It’s the minimal interface that supports formal verification while remaining practical for real systems.\n\nThe math-first approach isn’t just for flight software. Consider:\n\nMedical devices: IEC 62304 Class C software (which can cause death or serious injury) has requirements similar to DO-178C. The same methodology applies.\n\nAutomotive: ISO 26262 ASIL-D (highest automotive safety level) requires similar rigour. Self-driving systems need provable behaviour.\n\nFinancial systems: Knight Capital’s $440 million loss came from code that “worked” until it didn’t. Deterministic, provable systems prevent this class of failure.\n\nInfrastructure: Power grids, water treatment, and industrial control systems increasingly require formal methods. The traditional tutorial path doesn’t prepare engineers for this work.\n\nEven in non-safety-critical domains, the discipline pays off. Code designed mathematically is easier to test, easier to maintain, and easier to reason about. The techniques scale down gracefully.\n\nThe first step is recognising that traditional C education optimises for the wrong thing. It optimises for “getting something working quickly” when it should optimise for “knowing why it works.”\n\nThe second step is accepting that correctness requires more upfront effort. Defining invariants before writing code feels slow. It is slow - initially. The time is recovered many times over during testing, debugging, and maintenance.\n\nThe third step is building new habits:\n\nThese habits feel awkward at first. Like all habits, they become automatic with practice.\n\nThe c-from-scratch repository provides a complete framework for learning this approach. Each module includes:\n\nStart with the Pulse module. It’s roughly 200 lines of code, but those 200 lines demonstrate every principle: closed state, total functions, bounded resources, deterministic execution.\n\nFor a structured learning path, “C From Scratch: Learn Safety-Critical C the Right Way” walks through the methodology from first principles, building toward a complete capstone project.\n\n“Hello World” isn’t wrong. It’s just the wrong starting point for engineers who will work on systems that matter.\n\nThe traditional C tutorial path teaches hope-based development: write code, run it, hope it works, debug when it doesn’t. This approach cannot produce software that meets safety certification requirements, and it builds habits that must be painfully unlearned.\n\nThe alternative - proving correctness before implementation - requires more discipline but produces code that can be trusted. When that code controls an aircraft, monitors a pacemaker, or manages a power grid, “can be trusted” isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s the entire point.\n\nAs with any methodology, suitability depends on context. Not every program needs formal verification. But every programmer benefits from understanding what formal verification requires - because it clarifies what “correct” actually means.\n\nHope is not a certification strategy. Mathematics is.\n\nWilliam Murray is a Regenerative Systems Architect with 30 years of UNIX infrastructure experience, specializing in deterministic computing for safety-critical systems.

    "description": "The Maia 200 AI chip is described as an inference powerhouse — meaning it could lead AI models to apply their knowledge to real-world situations much faster and more efficiently.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMicrosoft has revealed its new Maia 200 accelerator chip for artificial intelligence (AI) that is three times more powerful than hardware from rivals like Google and Amazon, company representatives say.\n\nThis newest chip will be used in AI inference rather than training, powering systems and agents used to make predictions, provide answers to queries and generate outputs based on new data that's fed to them.\n\nMaia 200 is already being deployed in Microsoft's U.S. central data center region, with the company set to use the chips to generate synthetic data and in reinforcement training to improve next-generation large language models (LLMs). The AI accelerator will also be used to power Microsoft Foundry and 365 Copilot AI, and be part of the infrastructure that the company can provide through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nThe new chip delivers performance of more than 10 petaflops (1015 floating point operations per second), Scott Guthrie, cloud and AI executive vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post. This is a measure of performance in supercomputing, where the most powerful supercomputers in the world can reach more than 1,000 petaflops of power.\n\nThe new chip achieved this performance level in a data representation category known as \"4-bit precision (FP4)\" — a highly compressed model designed to accelerate AI performance. Maia 200 also delivers 5 PFLOPS of performance in 8-bit precision (FP8). The difference between the two is that FP4 is far more energy efficient but less accurate.\n\n\"In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,\" Guthrie said in the blog post. \"This means Maia 200 delivers 3 times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\"\n\nMaia 200 could potentially be used for specialist AI workloads, such as running larger LLMs in the future. So far, Microsoft's Maia chips have only been used in the Azure cloud infrastructure to run large-scale workloads for Microsoft’s own AI services, notably Copilot. However, Guthrie noted there would be \"wider customer availability in the future,\" signaling other organizations could tap into Maia 200 via the Azure cloud, or the chips could potentially one day be deployed in standalone data centers or server stacks.\n\nGuthrie said that Microsoft boasts 30% better performance per dollar over existing systems thanks to the use of the 3-nanometer process made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the most important fabricator in the world, allowing for 100 billion transistors per chip. This essentially means that Maia 200 could be more cost-effective and efficient for the most demanding AI workloads than existing chips.\n\nMaia 200 has a few other features alongside better performance and efficiency. It includes a memory system, for instance, which can help keep an AI model’s weights and data local, meaning you would need less hardware to run a model. It's also designed to be quickly integrated into existing data centers.\n\nMaia 200 should enable AI models to run faster and more efficiently. This means Azure OpenAI users, such as scientists, developers and corporations, could see better throughput and speeds when developing AI applications and using the likes of GPT-4 in their operations.\n\n—'It won’t be so much a ghost town as a zombie apocalypse': How AI might forever change how we use the internet\n\n— GPT-4 has passed the Turing test, researchers claim\n\n—The more advanced AI models get, the better they are at deceiving us — they even know when they're being tested\n\nThis next-generation AI hardware is unlikely to disrupt everyday AI and chatbot use for most people in the short term, as Maia 200 is designed for data centers rather than consumer-grade hardware. However, end users could see the impact of Maia 200 in the form of faster response times and potentially more advanced features from Copilot and other AI tools built into Windows and Microsoft products.\n\nMaia 200 could also provide a performance boost to developers and scientists who use AI inference via Microsoft’s platforms. This, in turn, could lead to improvements in AI deployment on large-scale research projects and elements like advanced weather modeling, biological or chemical systems and compositions.",

    "description": "Quite an advantage in today’s world.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when reading this story:\n\nChondrichthyan fishes—a group that includes rays, skates, chimaeras, and sharks—are thought to have energy intensive reproduction cycles due in no small part to long gestation times and small litters.\n\nHowever, a new study analyzing the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) of Australia and New Guinea finds that this species shows no noticeable spike in metabolic rate during reproduction.\n\nThis is good news for both the epaulette shark and the coral reef system, which relies on the species to keep the underwater habitat healthy.\n\nThe epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), which lives off the coast of northern Australia and New Guinea, is a strange creature. For one, it’s the youngest known shark in the world, with genetic evidence suggesting their emergence only nine million years ago. But its true claim to fame is found within its common moniker—this three-foot-long “walking shark” can not only use its thick, muscular fins to explore its coral ecosystem, but it can also traverse above water between coral heads at low tide. Some experts argue that this may suggest that sharks could one day evolve to walk on land.\n\nBut a new study, published in the journal Biology Open, makes an even more puzzling discovery about this fascinating shallow-sea creature. Energy is king in the natural world, and a large driver of evolution is developing strategies to reduce energy expenditure by any means necessary. One of the biggest drains of that energy—as any human mother will tell you—is the physical act of reproduction, but even this immensely energy-intensive task has been remarkably streamlined in the epaulette shark.\n\n“Reproduction is the ultimate investment … you are literally building new life from scratch,”Jodie Rummer, the senior author of the study from James Cook University (JCU), said in a press statement. “We expected that when sharks make this complex egg, their energy use would shoot up.”\n\nThe assumption is that the reproduction cycle of sharks—along with other chondrichthyan fishes such as rays, skates, and chimaeras—are energy-intensive due to small litter sizes and their long gestation periods. The frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus), for example, holds the record for the longest vertebrate gestation at 3.5 years. To get more data on the energy requirements for shark reproduction, Rummer and her team recorded metabolic and physiological changes in five epaulette sharks during oviparous (egg-laying) reproduction by tracking oxygen uptake and measuring reproductive hormones. The results were not what the scientists expected.\n\n“There was no uptick in energy use, it was completely flat,” Rummer said in a press statement. “These sharks appear to have adapted their physiology to be able to optimize their energy use. This work challenges the narrative that when things go wrong—such as warming oceans—that reproduction will be the first thing to go.”\n\nThis good news expands beyond just epaulette sharks themselves. When animals are under stress, reproduction is often impacted as a means to conserve energy—and there’s no greater stressor than climate change. Luckily, the amazing “walking shark” doesn’t require an immense energy spike for reproduction, suggesting that the shark could continue exploring Australia’s coral reefs even as its waters warm.\n\n“Under environmental stress, many species will choose between survival and reproduction, but the epaulette shark might be able to continue to produce eggs, even under such stressors,” Carolyn Wheeler, the lead author and a recent JCU Ph.D. graduate, said in a press statement. “That’s encouraging, because healthy sharks equal healthy reefs.”\n\nWith any luck, future descendants of the epaulette shark will survive long enough to walk on an Earth where the dangerous effects of anthropogenic climate change are far in the rearview.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "As one of the most majestic places to race, the San Juan Islands come with their own sporting challenges. The post The Allure and Agony of Seattle’s Round-the-County appeared first on Sailing World.",
    "fullText": "\"One thing that I love about distance racing is the 10-minute victories,\" says Jaime Mack, a few hours into the 2025 Round the County Race.\n\nThis annual two-day event organized by the Orcas Island YC and the Friday Harbor Sailing Club circumnavigates the islands comprising Washington State's San Juan County with a Saturday night stopover in Roche Harbor on San Juan Island. The 65 nautical-mile race regularly attracts triple-digit fleets and unfurls in early November, with even-numbered years rounding clockwise and odd-numbered years taking a counterclockwise course.\n\nThe direction matters, of course, because the waters surrounding the San Juans have notoriously strong currents that can leave a fleet parked up or inverted, especially when someone forgets to ply the wind machine with enough Benjamins. Much like the 2025 race.\n\nI consider Mack's words as we slowly fetch Matia Island, maybe 10 miles into our 34 nautical-mile first leg. While November in the Pacific Northwest is often wet and stormy, and always dark, this particular weekend is a stunner: bluebird skies, sunshine and warm temperatures.\n\nBetter still, our skipper Justin Wolfe has assembled a great crew consisting of Ben and Jen Morgan Glass, and Andy and Jaime Mack aboard Ripple (in still water), his Paul Bieker-designed Riptide 35. We've never sailed together as a crew, and most of us are new to the boat, but Ripple is well-prepared, and our logistics are carefully sorted.\n\nThere are just two hiccups: foul currents and a dearth of breeze.\n\nTake, for example, the first \"chapter\" from the starting area at Lydia Shoal, in Rosario Strait, to Point Lawrence, Orcas Island's northeastern-most point. The smart money, at least temporarily, wagers on the course's western edge, while we find ourselves milking a thin kelp- and rock-dodging breeze that carries us east, then north.\n\nFlash forward two hours, and we're slatting in lumpy waves next to other boats that started with us, temporarily looked smarter, only to be (closely) examining our sheer line or transom at this next restart.\n\nI savor this 10-minute victory, as the rest of the day looks challenging.\n\nThe Round the County Race has a long history of temperamental winds, so the Sailing Instructions require boats to record their times at the legs' halfway points, perchance it becomes impossible to finish the complete legs by the 1800 cutoff.\n\nSuch is our fate aboard Ripple, as it becomes clear by 1430 that our objective is evolving from finishing the leg to fetching the halfway mark by its 1600 deadline.\n\nStill, math is math, and the VHF calls start at around 1530. We aren't happy to announce our own retirement 10 minutes later, but the last 2 miles will be someone else's 10-minute victory.\n\nWe tuck Ripple into its berth three hours later, and the reason for the race's strong local following refocuses: Sailors, bundled in winter jackets, mingle on the docks with libations and victuals. There are a few groans about the day's breeze, of course, but most scuttlebutt that I overhear involves sunshine and warm temperatures. This is my fifth time doing this race, and every year is different, from torrential rains to big breeze to frigid temperatures, but the race is (usually) good sailing, has a laid-back vibe, and the chance to hang with friends in Roche Harbor are-for me-its gravity.\n\nWe nail our boat-end start the following morning, and we assume a windward lane as we reach toward San Juan Island's Hanbury Point. Our A1.5 spinnaker is pulling, and after yesterday, 7 knots of Speed Over Ground feels big.\n\nWe shift gears several times between the J1.5 and the A1.5 and commit to an offshore lane that gives us fine views of San Juan Island's western shoreline. Jibing Ripple's kite is easy in the 10 to 15 knot breeze, and the boat's water-ballast system, combined with our active crew ballasting, keeps us rumbling.\n\nMount Baker's glaciated summit appears as we reach San Juan Island's southern flanks, and, eventually, the leg's halfway point. But as we pass Colville Island, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the missing Benjamins again become problematic.\n\nWe push up Rosario Strait, bucking a 2-knot current and hanging onto increasingly fickle fingers of wind with Ripple's A1.5.\n\nMack's words about 10-minute victories play out again as our section of the fleet negotiates Bird Rocks. We opt for a westerly routing, but for a pregnant hour, the smart move looks to have been the easterly line. Jen Morgan Glass, our tactician, and Wolfe work some magic, linking scuffed-up stretches of brine amongst swaths of greasy-looking saline, while the rest of us keep the sails-and mood-trimmed.\n\nOur position, which had been looking bearish, transitions into another 10-minute win, before the bottom falls out. Flow detaches from our foils, and nothing budges our SOG above zeros. Painful.\n\nMountaineers say the final 5 feet are the crux of any climb, and this truism resonates as we stare at the finishing line for what feels like hours. We're talking frisbee range, but bow stems are all that matter.\n\nAnd we're not alone: the nearby fleet compresses, all of us parked, as we rifle through headsails and kites. All options hang limply as the sun slouches west.\n\nWe drift toward the finish line in a tight scrum-cum-rulebook-knowledge-melee. We finally catch the RC's finishing whistle and clear out, making room for others who are still fighting for their final five feet.\n\nThe day's bonnet blue sky fades to black as stars and a waning gibbous moon punctuate our delivery back to the Orcas Island YC. I burrow into my down jacket and consider how celebrating 10-minute victories helps to justify hours of hard work while also distributing the day's dividends more widely across the fleet than mere award-ceremony hardware.\n\nGranted, it would be nice to use some of these dividends to bribe next year's wind machine, but it wouldn't be a full value Round the County Race without restarts, challenging currents, kelp, and the tapping of local knowledge.\n\nBut hey, at least it didn't rain.\n\nThe post The Allure and Agony of Seattle’s Round-the-County appeared first on Sailing World.",

    "fullText": "Last August, we earmarked a handful of young players to have breakout years. Now halfway through the season, how are those picks looking?\n\nIn a world of hot takes and bold predictions, it’s easy to spew incendiary comments without holding yourself accountable. We don’t do that here at Urban Pitch.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2025-26 season, we dropped our customary “Breakout Stars to Watch” list, and it’s about that time to put our predictions under the microscope. We’re just over halfway through a season that has already had so much intrigue, and with so much still to play for, it’s the perfect time to check back in.\n\nSimilar to last year, we’ll pick out the best of the bunch from our initial list, as well as throw in some new names that have firmly made their mark.\n\nLily Yohannes, 18, OL Lyonnes, United States\n\nWe’ll kick it off with maybe the name I’m most proud of. Saying the 18-year-old American Lily Yohannes has shone would be a gross understatement; quite frankly, she deserves all the superlatives. In her first season with one of the giants of women’s football, OL Lyonnes, she hasn’t once looked out of place. She began with a goal and a stellar performance in her debut against Olympique Marseille and hasn’t looked back.\n\nShe’s racked up four goals and four assists in her 18 appearances, which makes her just one off her total G/A tally from last year, and we’re only in January. She’s a sensational player, and at such a tender age, it’s genuinely frightening to think about the kind of ceiling she has (if she even has one).\n\nThe standout moment of the season wasn’t hard to pick; her goal in the UEFA Women’s Champions League against St. Pölten was voted goal of the league phase, and rightfully so. She picked the ball up just inside the opposition half before spotting the goalkeeper off her line and lofting the ball into the back of the net from the edge of the center circle.\n\nGonzalo Garcia, 21, Real Madrid, Spain\n\nSince shining in the Club World Cup over the summer, Gonzalo Garcia began the season slowly, and even had a stint back with Real Madrid’s Castilla U-21 team. Kylian Mbappe’s Ballon d’Or-level play hasn’t helped his case, and like with fellow young striker Endrick, he struggled to break into the team consistently as we thought he might. However, Mbappe’s injury in January saw Garcia get a rare chance, and he made the most of his opportunity.\n\nIn the five-game stretch where he started, Garcia bagged five goals and one assist with a scintillating hat-trick against Real Betis in his first start of that run. It was a brief but telling period that reminded the world just how talented the 21-year-old is. With Mbappe fit once again, there’s no telling how much game time Garcia will see, but with Madrid sending Endrick on loan rather than their homegrown Spaniard, maybe new coach Álvaro Arbeloa has bigger plans for Garcia.\n\nGilberto Mora, 17, Club Tijuana, Mexico\n\nThe U-17 player with the most goals in the world in 2025, Club Tijuana diamond Gilberto Mora continues to take his play to higher levels. His Liga MX Apertura campaign ended with an impressive five goals and one assist in 14 appearances, but it was during the break in the season for the FIFA U-20 World Cup where he truly turned on the shine.\n\nDespite going out in the quarterfinals to Argentina, Mora was one of the tournament’s best players. He bagged three goals and two assists in Mexico’s five matches played, and his performances backed up the numbers. His elite technical ability and eye for a killer pass in the middle of the park are golden attributes, and having only just turned 17 in October, there’s still so much more growth ahead for one of the Americas’ brightest stars.\n\nMichelle Agyemang, 19, Arsenal, England\n\nProbably the most unfortunate update of the list, Michelle Agyemang was on cloud nine after her super showing at the 2025 Women’s EUROs. She began her season with two goal contributions in her opening five games of the WSL season, in which she played with Brighton and Hove Albion on loan from Arsenal. However, a torn ACL while on international duty with England cut her season short, and it’s unclear when she’ll make her return. It’s devastating for the 19-year-old, who will likely lose out on nearly a year of development, but with her temperament and talent, I have a feeling she’ll be back stronger.\n\nLennart Karl, 17, FC Bayern, Germany\n\nWe mentioned Mora had the most U-17 goals in 2025, and the player right behind him was Bayern Munich’s Lennart Karl. He was an unknown quantity to most at the beginning of the year, but his performances on the biggest stage have made him a household name.\n\nHis stunner against Club Brugge made him the youngest player to score for FC Bayern in a Champions League game, and he’s since gone on to add two more to that tally this season in back-to-back games. With additional stellar performances against Arsenal and Sporting, Karl also became the youngest player to score in three consecutive UEFA Champions League matches.\n\nAdd that to his four goals and two assists in the Bundesliga, and you’ve got a breakout senior campaign to remember for Bayern’s young phenom.\n\nStill only 21 years old, Nico Paz has played a major role in Como’s resurgence in Serie A since being promoted in 2024. After a solid 2024-25 campaign that represented his first full season of senior football, Paz taken things to even loftier heights under Cesc Fabregas in 2025-26. Paz already has eight goals and six assists this season, only one off his goal contributions for the entirety of last year, and while he’s not a new commodity to clued-in European football fans, I still think he isn’t spoken about enough in the conversations around Europe’s best young players.",

    "fullText": "Man, it is a really weird time in the software world right now. Like a lot of people, when I picked up ChatGPT and Midjourney back in late 2022. It felt like wizardry.\n\nFor a year I experimented and experimented. I wrote about how Midjourney responds to emojis and even tried to see if I could write a children’s book with AI. The output here looks pretty rough today, but it was a revelation at the time. And the AI tools just kind of gradually got better and better.\n\nOne thing that never really clicked for me though was agentic coding. The vision is that you tell an LLM what you want, and it just goes off and executes it. It never really worked that well. It felt like the agents just kind of plowed through code and broke a bunch of stuff on the way to making the fix I wanted. Coding agents were more a curiosity, not something I could actually use.\n\nHowever, this is all about to change. And it is going to change everything about how software is built.\n\nI was drawn back by a post called Welcome to Gas Town by Steve Yegge.\n\nGas Town is part visionary, part performance art. It’s a Mad Max-themed fever dream that enables agents, managing agents, managing agents. There’s a mayor, rigs, polecats, a deacon and a refinery—and they all work together in this vast factory where vibes go in and code comes out.\n\nThere’s a lot of really clever ideas that somewhat mesh together. You’ve probably heard about the context window LLMs have. Essentially it’s their short-term memory. Once an agent uses about 20% of its context window, its intelligence drops off a cliff and it starts doing insane things like dropping databases.\n\nGas Town employs a trick to manage that issue. It assigns tasks to ephemeral “Polecat” agents. Polecats do a task and then disappear—basically removing the challenge of managing context windows.\n\nMaggie Appleton articulated the value of Gas Town well:\n\nWe should take Yegge’s creation seriously not because it’s a serious, working tool for today’s developers (it isn’t). But because it’s a good piece of speculative design fiction that asks provocative questions and reveals the shape of constraints we’ll face as agentic coding systems mature and grow.\n\nAnd so, intrigued by Gas Town, I decided to try vibe coding again.\n\nI’m not the type to just dip my toes in. If I’m going to do something, I do a cannonball.\n\nI’m always looking for the meta. What is the best strategy and who knows how to execute it? I read that Anthropic’s CTO keeps five agents running constantly and barely looks at the actual files. Either that’s marketing or there must be something there, or maybe both?\n\nI read a bunch of articles and watched a ton of YouTube videos. YouTube was pretty wild. There are these videos with guys streaming 5-10 Claude Code terminals, blaring EDM (lol) and managing all these agents.\n\nI’m kind of poking fun, but I actually learned a lot about setup from that BridgeMind channel. If you’re interested I might start with his videos about Warp and the OpenCode CLI.\n\nI wanted to see how well these agents actually work, but I needed an easy entry point. A Chrome extension to restyle Hacker News seemed perfect. It’s been in my backlog for a while, and because it’s purely frontend, I knew I’d be comfortable judging the output.\n\nAnd honestly it was. Initially I tried to one-shot the thing and—as I expected—that was a failure. But then I decided to slow down. I told the agent to scaffold a chrome extension to restyle Hacker News pages. It worked. And I kind of just broke up these tasks into smaller pieces. Tested them as I went.\n\nSure there were bugs. But I kind of just did what I do when I’m reviewing any engineers’ code. Inspect the DOM, look at the styles, look at the console and then give feedback. When the context window hit’s 20% I typically close that window and open a new chat. The OpenCode CLI even allows you to drop screenshots. It’s pretty wild.\n\nNow, I don’t have a dozen agents running at the same time. I never felt the need to have more than two working. And I’m honestly not sure how UI work even gets shipped in Gas Town? My guess is Yegge is probably a lot less concerned with UX than I am.\n\nWith AI agents, the last mile—that final polish and detailing—will be critical. We already see this in Salesloft, where sellers review generative emails before sending. In design, it manifests as small UI tweaks. It will be something else for doctors and something else for mechanical engineers. But I think there is a real opportunity in refining how humans interact with the agent’s output, creating better loops for feedback and adjustment.\n\nYou know what? There’s something here though. I don’t really like the term “vibe coding.” And I know the concept is polarizing. But after tinkering with this stuff for a couple days—I think agents are about to change how we build software.\n\nThe conception of what it looks like to make software is going to change pretty quickly.\n\nThe three major functions on a delivery team (or feature team) are engineering, design and product management. I’ve long thought we’re going to start to see more overlap in those functions. I’m even more sure of it now.\n\nI think we’re going to start to see a hybrid role emerge—product engineer.\n\nWhat does this mean delivery teams will look like in the future? I imagine they are either significantly smaller or significantly more productive. I’m not sure if QA is embedded into these teams the same way they are currently or if there is a separate team of—well, people managing QA agents. I have a lot of questions.\n\nThis also makes me think a lot about Ben Thompson’s theory on bundling and unbundling. From 2010 to 2015, companies quickly moved on the back of frameworks. First like Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap. Then on other technologies like Angular and React. The speed these frameworks provided caused an unbundling in the software world.\n\nPoint solutions were able to move fast and gather steam while slow incumbents either weren’t nimble enough or weren’t in a place to capitalize on the productivity provided by frameworks. Starting in 2016, that changed. Customers were overwhelmed with choices. Larger companies caught on and smaller ones consolidated into larger platforms.\n\nI think that’s about to shift again. And probably this year.\n\nDavid Cummings called it out in his newsletter this weekend. SaaS companies are about to see a massive wave of new competition. And it is going to happen extremely fast. The bar to build software has been lowered. A two-person team will soon be able to build what used to take a whole department.\n\nThis puts incumbent software companies in a pretty dangerous situation. Those that are not able to be nimble and go fast are going to be in real trouble. I think this is especially true in the consumer, SMB and mid-market segments. Enterprise software may have some buffer as customers of enterprise software are buying a process more than the software itself.\n\nHonestly, it makes me a little nervous. The industry is going to change and everyone’s jobs are going to look a little different—product design included.\n\nBut as someone who got into software just because I wanted to make things, this is a dream come true. I’m seeing a glimpse of the vision I hoped for in 2022. It’s not just a toy anymore. It’s an unbelievable tool for builders.\n\nIf you’ve been ignoring AI tools because you think they are overhyped, or maybe don’t see how they fit into your workflow. I’d encourage you to give them another look.",

    "description": "For a long time the question has been asked: if China decides to invade Taiwan, can it be stopped by the US?",
    "fullText": "For a long time the question has been asked: if China decides to invade Taiwan, can it be stopped by the US?\n\nIn short, is the US still the world’s sole superpower, able to dictate terms to Beijing even just off the China coast – or can the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) now bring the long-standing “Pax Americana”, the rules-based international order, to a conclusive end?\n\nWe may find out quite soon now, even as Sir Keir Starmer travels to Beijing this week to break bread with Xi Jinping. Last week, away from the slopes of Davos and largely unnoticed outside the shipping industry, the geopolitical order shifted significantly. A bulk cargo ship named Winning Youth arrived in China carrying 200,000 tons of iron ore.\n\nBig cargoes of iron ore arrive in China all the time, of course, to feed the nation’s enormous appetite for primary steel. Normally, however, the ore comes from Australia (64pc) or Brazil (the other major supplier at 22pc).\n\nThe Winning Youth’s cargo was different. It was the first to be shipped from the enormous Simandou deposits in Guinea, West Africa. The ship departed from the Conakry anchorage on Dec 2.\n\nThe Simandou mines, the associated rail line to the coast, and the specially built barge port on the Morébaya river estuary from which the ore is loaded aboard ships in the anchorage, are a massive joint project.\n\nThis has complex finances, but according to analysis house Drewry: “Chinese entities collectively have the largest strategic influence across the entire project through both mine ownership and shared control of the rail-port infrastructure. China is the largest combined strategic stakeholder.”\n\nThe Simandou project is not yet properly online: it took three weeks to get the Winning Youth fully loaded, much longer than it will take to load a bulker once the railway and the barge terminal are up to full capacity. (The mine isn’t really a bottleneck: it’s more a matter of simply scooping ore up and putting it in railway cars rather than mining as generally understood.)\n\nBut Simandou is expected to ramp up fast over the next few years, perhaps shipping 120 million tons annually in the near term. It’s also expected that most – if not all – of that ore will go to China.\n\nThat matters, because Australian control over the bulk of China’s iron ore supply is often thought to be one of the factors holding Xi Jinping back from an active military campaign to conquer Taiwan. Australia would surely cease shipments of ore in response to such a campaign, and the damage to China’s enormous industries would be colossal.\n\nHowever, not many years from now, this would have much less effect as massive amounts of ore would still be shipping from Simandou. As the shape of the world’s cargo routes changes, so too will the calculus of power in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nConfrontation in the strait is in fact already under way, with Chinese military manoeuvres there now so menacing that the “Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis” is deemed to have been going on since 2022.\n\nThis is the background to Sir Keir’s visit to Beijing this week. Accompanied by British business leaders, his trip is reportedly aimed at restoring the “golden era” of Sino-British trade and investment seen under Theresa May.\n\nThe Starmer Government’s eagerness to woo China was apparent in its decision days ago to allow the new Chinese “super embassy” in London to go ahead – a decision described in The Telegraph by former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith as “a humiliating sell-out”.\n\nBritish messaging is mixed, however. Last week the nuclear-powered attack submarine HMS Anson arrived at Gibraltar. Gibraltar is the submarine’s first stop on her way to Australia, where she will probably spend at least six months based out of Perth as part of Submarine Rotational Force West.\n\nSRF-West is the first stage of the Australia-UK-US “Aukus” agreement, which will evolve into a tri-national force of nuclear attack boats based at Perth, and the infrastructure in Australia and the UK which will build and support them.\n\nSince Anson is probably the only serviceable attack submarine in the Royal Navy at the moment, and with the Russian threat in the Atlantic ever more present, it is clear that the Government is placing a very high priority indeed on Aukus.\n\nThe whole point of Aukus, of course, is to confront China’s growing power in the Pacific.\n\nMainland China refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation which recognises Taiwan as independent.\n\nDiplomats, at least, believe that diplomatic relations with China are essential – although in the case of the UK the result appears to be a large piece of Chinese territory in central London occupied by a massive CCP spy fortress. Only a few small nations recognise Taiwan as independent, probably the best known being the Vatican.\n\nQuite a lot of nations, however, take an “ambiguous” stance towards Taiwanese independence. They have diplomatic relations with China, embassies and all, and they do not formally recognise Taiwan’s nationhood.\n\nThey do not have embassies in Taipei and Taiwan does not have embassies in their capitals, but there are people and buildings that do much the same thing.\n\nThe UK, for instance, has the British Office in Taipei, staffed by Foreign Office employees who would be diplomats if they were accredited as such.\n\nTaiwan has a similar “Taipei Representative Office” in Belgravia. There is a parking space across the street with “diplomats” painted on it, for all that the representatives in the office are – officially – not diplomats, which somewhat gives away the British Government’s real stance.\n\nRather more importantly, the entire US policy towards Taiwan has always been one of “strategic ambiguity”. What this has actually tended to mean, however, is fairly firm and evident American backing for Taiwanese independence and democracy.\n\nDuring the run up to the 1996 election in Taiwan, for instance, China made a serious attempt to frighten the Taiwanese into voting for the pro-Beijing candidate. More than 100,000 troops were mustered on the mainland side of the strait and amphibious invasion exercises took place.\n\nChina also fired ballistic missiles into Taiwanese territorial waters, causing enough upset that merchant shipping ceased using the strait twice and maritime insurance rates for Taiwan increased significantly.\n\nThis sabre-rattling, however, was largely negated by the arrival of two US aircraft carrier groups and other naval elements.\n\nThat confrontation is nowadays known as the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis (the first two, in the 1950s, involved artillery bombardments from the mainland against outlying Taiwan-controlled islands).\n\nChinese air and naval power was fairly negligible in the mid-1990s, a fact that was illustrated by the carrier USS Nimitz twice cruising through the strait along with various other US warships. The pro-Beijing candidate in Taiwan got less than 15pc of the vote.\n\nEver since then, the US military has assumed that a fight against China would be likely, with its traditional Cold War foe Russia relegated to second place.\n\nThis makes sense: the Chinese economy is now no less than 20 times the size it was in the mid-1990s and the CCP’s defence budget is the second biggest in the world, much bigger than that of Russia even with Vladimir Putin’s new war economy.\n\nNeedless to say, Chinese air and naval power are no longer negligible. Indeed, by count of warships the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is actually bigger than the US Navy, though America for the moment still has a considerable advantage in terms of overall tonnage and missile launch tubes – probably more important numbers.\n\nMeanwhile the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) now has hundreds of fifth-generation stealth fighters and more than 100 long-range strategic bombers able to mount devastating missile strikes against enemy fleets and bases far away.\n\nProbably more significantly still, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) – this is a separate arm of service in China – does not only have intercontinental nuclear missiles.\n\nIt also has more than 3,000 shorter-ranging ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles able to strike targets with conventional warheads at great distances. In particular, US bases in Guam, Japan and South Korea are threatened, and if US warships in the region can be located and tracked, they can potentially be sunk.\n\nThe US military ought nonetheless to be enormously more powerful than China’s. US nominal GDP is still half again that of China, and crucially the US spends proportionally more on defence, or as the new administration prefers to put it, on “war”: 3.4pc to China’s 1.7pc. America’s colossal military spending, approaching $1tn a year, is roughly triple that of China.\n\nBut that isn’t the whole picture. Both China and the US mostly make their own armaments and recruit from their own labour markets: and the cost of Chinese-made weapons, planes, ships, etc, is much lower than US-made ones. Chinese soldiers, sailors and airmen are much cheaper than Americans.\n\nThis cost difference is illustrated by the fact that China’s vast shipbuilding industry, far and away the biggest in the world, built warships of a combined tonnage equal to the entire Royal Navy in just the four years up to 2025 and this rate is accelerating. American shipyards, so expensive that they can mostly win business only from the Pentagon, are struggling even to replace existing US warships as they wear out – let alone expand the fleet.\n\nComparisons like this explain the fact that on a purchasing-power parity basis, as opposed to nominal GDP, the Chinese economy is actually a third again bigger than the US.\n\nThis suggests that in terms of buying and hiring power the American war department only enjoys a 50pc advantage, rather than a three-fold one.\n\nThen there is the fact that a battle in the vicinity of Taiwan would see US forces operating at long range from their bases and the Chinese close to theirs.\n\nIn the scenario of an amphibious invasion by China, a US Navy attack submarine – or perhaps an allied Aukus one, HMS Anson or one of her successors – might well slip past or fight through relatively unpracticed PLAN anti-submarine forces and into the Taiwan Strait.\n\nParts of the strait are too shallow for a nuclear attack boat, but this would still be a fox-in-the-henhouse event for the invasion fleet: the sub’s torpedoes and missiles would take a fearful toll of the Chinese amphibious forces. The submarine might well survive to escape once it was out of weapons.\n\nBut if such a submarine were part of the Aukus force at Perth, it would then have a journey of 4,000 miles back to base to re-arm itself, and then another equally long voyage to get back into the fight.\n\nThe sub captain might head instead for a closer US base such as Guam, but this would still be nearly 2,000 miles away. The boat might then arrive only to find the base knocked out, or might be sunk at the jetty by long-ranging Chinese strikes.\n\nMeanwhile, a Chinese warship near Taiwan would be only briefly absent if it needed to resupply, meaning that each Chinese ship would deliver a lot more combat power than an equivalent US or allied one. The US president might choose to strike Chinese bases on the mainland, of course, but it is definitely possible that this would be viewed as overly escalatory – an ever-present consideration in a war where both sides have intercontinental nukes.\n\nAll these factors tend to erode the American spending advantage. It was not a total surprise when a Pentagon summary – the so-called “Overmatch Brief” – leaked last month.\n\nIt was based on years of US wargaming, classified intelligence briefings and simulations, and it stated categorically that America would “most likely suffer decisive defeat” if it attempted to intervene against any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan.\n\nOne reason that the Overmatch Brief is not surprising, of course, is that the Pentagon has every incentive to suggest that it needs more resources. Similarly the fact that it leaked to the media was not a shock – if nobody knows that such a document exists, it has much less effect. The Overmatch Brief may one day be compared to the “missile gap” and “bomber gap” ideas put forth by the US Air Force in the 1950s, claiming that the Soviet Union’s forces were hugely stronger than they actually were in an attempt to obtain a bigger budget.\n\nFactors of budget relative to scenario, indeed, have powerful effects on all militaries. For instance it seems clear that the first and quite probably decisive stages of any China-Taiwan-US shooting war would be an air and sea contest mostly involving long-range missiles. On the US side the missiles would mostly be launched from ships or aircraft.\n\nThis is a pleasing thought for the US Navy and the US Air Force. It is not at all pleasing for the US Army and Marine Corps, who would not wish to be left out.\n\nThis has led to the curious spectacle of the Marines converting many of their conventional combat units into so-called “Littoral Regiments” and the Army similarly creating what it calls “Multi Domain Task Forces”. Both of these are basically land-based missile units, a sort of American PLARF. The problem is that America would probably not wish to provoke China in advance, so they cannot be based on Taiwan and thus would probably not be all that much use.\n\nThese matters aside, the big question for Xi, Trump and the various China hawks in his team – undersecretary of defence for policy Elbridge Colby, for instance – is this: what would happen if China moved against Taiwan and the US intervened?\n\nThe usual way to find an answer to this sort of question is wargames – the military version of what is called “modelling”, if one is talking about subjects such as pandemic disease or climate change. There have been many wargames around the idea of a Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nMost of them have taken place behind the curtain of classified information, as with the Overmatch Brief. Such models may benefit from better or more detailed data. What is almost always true is that secret modelling is even more likely to be driven by an underlying agenda than openly visible work.\n\nThat’s why it’s probably useful for most of us to look at public wargame modelling of a possible fight for Taiwan. An influential Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), has made a strong effort here.\n\nThe CSIS wargames acknowledge some uncomfortable realities for the US forces.\n\nAmerican cruisers and destroyers, for instance, have truly amazing defences against incoming Chinese missiles of various kinds, and such defences can mean that even a major Chinese strike can be resisted by a US aircraft carrier strike group or another kind of US Navy surface taskforce.\n\nBut the numbers are remorseless. In one example, China sends out a force of 24 H-6 heavy bombers armed with four YJ-12 ship-killer missiles each. The bombers can range far out into the Pacific, sweeping large stretches of ocean with their radar. If they have any vague idea where a US Navy task force may be, they can locate it.\n\nIf the US force includes a carrier, its radar plane is likely to detect the Chinese bombers long before they can find the carrier, and in that case the carrier’s fighters are likely to solve the problem.\n\nThe CSIS model doesn’t acknowledge the reality that a strike package of H-6s would be unlikely to get past responding US Navy fighters, especially if they were armed with the new beyond-visual-range air-launched SM-6.\n\nThe bombers would probably all have been shot out of the sky before they ever got a sniff of the carrier, which would remain below their radar horizon.\n\nBut if there are no US radar planes or fighters in play, the hail of missiles from the Chinese bombers is likely to overwhelm even the extremely strong Aegis/Standard defence of US cruisers and destroyers, sinking most if not all of them.\n\nIf the US ships do beat off such an attack, the Chinese bombers fly home, re-arm and return in a matter of hours. The American ships’ missile tubes will be largely empty this time, and this is before the extra firepower of the far-away land-based PLARF batteries comes into play.\n\nThe CSIS wargames still do not predict the clear-cut defeat seen in the Overmatch Brief. Indeed, their results suggest that in fact if the US is committed to the fight and doesn’t hesitate at the start, it can knock China back with a very bloody nose in the event of any serious fight over Taiwan.\n\nThe end result would be a Taiwan Strait filled with burning and sinking Chinese wrecks and the survivors of the Chinese invasion force trapped on Taiwan with their supply lines from the mainland cut, eventually forced to surrender.\n\nBut the US Navy and Air Force would have suffered on a scale not seen since the Second World War. Hundreds of American fighter jets would have been destroyed, mostly wrecked on the ground in their bases in Japan and elsewhere by long-ranging Chinese strikes.\n\nThe US Navy and its allies would lose dozens of ships and thousands of sailors. HMS Anson or her future successor on SRF-West would probably have done a huge amount of damage to the PLAN and its amphibious fleet, knowing our submariners, but they would in all likelihood have gone down fighting in the end, assuming they could rearm and get back in the battle often enough.\n\nBoth China and the US would be seriously damaged as global military powers, and Taiwan would still be free but shattered as a nation and an economy – and that would mean knock-on damage to all world economies, given how vital the Taiwanese semiconductor industry is to us all.\n\nThe lesson of history for us all to take away – not only the US, but Australia, Britain and everyone else in the West – is that ancient and well-tried truism: if you would have peace, prepare yourself for war.\n\nThe way to persuade Xi Jinping not to invade Taiwan is to make the chance of failure higher.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "title": "Finland is trying to poach top tech and AI talent from the US with 2-week visas and better work-life balance",
    "description": "Finland wants to lure American engineers and researchers with fast-track visas and good work-life balance as part of the global AI talent wars.",
    "fullText": "Finland is stepping into the tech talent wars.\n\nThe Nordic country is making a push for tech workers from abroad, with a particular focus on the US. The goal is to attract engineers and researchers working in deep tech, especially in the fields of quantum computing, AI, and health innovation.\n\nThe effort comes as competition for AI talent intensifies worldwide and tech workers in the US grapple with layoffs, burnout, and visa complications. KPMG's annual survey of global CEOs found that 70% were concerned about competition for AI talent. According to BCG's 2024 talent tracker report, the US remained dominant in attracting AI talent worldwide.\n\nAlready known for its tech scene, Finland, with a population of around 5.6 million, is positioning itself as a place where American tech workers can find a better work-life balance without sacrificing their careers — a notable contrast to the famous grindset of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"Of course, there might be long days once in a while, but it's such a high value, and it's also protected by law that you can't work more than an average of 40 hours per week,\" Laura Lindeman, head of the Work in Finland program, told Business Insider.\n\nShe said that even in the tech sector, when people leave work for the day, they really do leave. \"Offices are silent,\" she said. Employers in Finland, often ranked the happiest country in the world, also see the benefit of workers having lives outside work, she said, adding that the general sentiment is \"it narrows your thinking if you only work.\"\n\nFinland is working with more than 30 Finnish tech companies and universities to promote open roles to foreign workers. A preview of the job openings being promoted under the program includes roles with Oura Health (the company behind the Oura Ring), quantum computing firm QMill, and Aalto University.\n\nLindeman said Americans interested in working in Finland should consider reaching out to companies or universities, even if no open roles are listed, as some employers are open to creating positions for the right candidate. While the campaign emphasizes the US, it also targets talent from India, Brazil, and other parts of Europe.\n\nOnce candidates receive a job offer, they can apply for a specialist visa through Finland's Fast Track program. Approved applicants can receive a work-residence permit in as little as two weeks, with processing times averaging about 10 days, Lindeman said. Finland also offers integration programs to help newcomers settle in, and spouses of workers on specialist visas are eligible for work permits, she added.\n\nGovernment data suggests interest from Americans is already rising. Finland granted 60 specialist residence permits to US citizens in 2024 and 85 in 2025, according to Finnish immigration statistics. The number of residence permits granted to US researchers also increased, from 35 in 2024 to 46 in 2025.\n\nJordan Blake Banks, an American who moved to Finland in 2019 to pursue a master's degree through the Fulbright program, said the country offers plenty of benefits, from its forests to its emphasis on work-life balance. After finishing her degree, Banks stayed in Finland and eventually landed a job as a sustainability consultant at Deloitte in Helsinki.\n\n\"The general idea is that the company and the colleagues respect you as a person, and that you can have your free and personal time,\" she said, adding parents regularly leave work during the day for family obligations without stigma. Many Finns also take about a month of vacation during the summer, along with time off in the winter.\n\nBanks said salaries in Finland tend to be lower than in comparable roles in the US, but she thinks the gap is offset by more affordable essential services, including healthcare, education, and childcare.\n\nWhile learning Finnish isn't necessary for working in the country — Lindeman said English is widely used in the tech industry, and about 80% of Finns speak fluent English — Banks said not knowing the language can feel isolating in everyday life.\n\nShe enrolled in a four-month integration program run by the city, where she learned the language and eventually passed the national exam required to become a Finnish citizen. Banks also met her now-wife while living in Finland.\n\nOne cultural adjustment of living in Finland, she said, has been that the people tend to be more reserved than Americans. \"If you're coming from a very friendly culture or a very warm culture, I think that could be a shock,\" she said, adding she'd been able to use that to her advantage.\n\nBanks said speaking up helped her land a paid research position at her university. \"I was willing to make contact and be the brave American willing to ask for things,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Most McDonald's locations around the world follow a familiar design: red-and-white branding topped with golden arches. But some stand out for their distinct architecture and unique backstories.\n\nFrom a glass-covered restaurant in Batumi, Georgia, to one built over an ancient Roman road in Italy, the fast-food chain has found unique ways to blend with the local surroundings while maintaining its individuality.\n\nIn his book, \"McAtlas: A Global Guide to the Golden Arches,\" which was released in November 2024, author and photojournalist Gary He captured the essence of some of these locations while explaining what makes each one special.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2024, He traveled to over 55 countries and dined at more than 100 McDonald's restaurants. When it came to picking his top locations, he had clear favorites.\n\n\"I wanted to document the more interesting parts of the largest restaurant group in the world,\" He told Business Insider, emphasizing that the project was an independent undertaking.\n\nHere are five unique McDonald's locations that He recommends fans of the brand must visit.\n\nThe McDonald's in Sälen, Sweden, tops He's list of best locations.\n\nNestled in one of Sweden's biggest ski resorts, Lindvallen, this spot offers a unique \"ski-thru\" experience. It allows skiers to grab a Big Mac without leaving their skis.\n\nThe restaurant opened in 1996 and operates daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. during ski season.\n\n\"The air is so clean and crisp — it's like being on top of the world,\" He told Business Insider, adding, \"When I visited, it wasn't even busy. It was just me, the McSki, and the mountains. I was just hanging out and enjoying myself.\"\n\nGetting there isn't easy, though. He said it took him six hours to travel from Stockholm, with three transfers — first, from a train station at Borlänge Centralstation to a bus, and then 48 stops later, another bus — but the journey was worth it.\n\n\"The McSki is hands-down the coolest McDonald's I've visited anywhere in the world,\" He said.\n\n\"I really love the Shenzhen location in China,\" said He, adding, \"It was the first McDonald's in China at a time when the country wasn't fully open to American businesses.\"\n\nThe restaurant opened on October 8, 1990, in Shenzhen's special economic zone. On its first day, it welcomed over 40,000 customers despite a seating capacity of 460, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nThe restaurant balances local design with the chain's signature branding. The three-floor building features pagoda-style roofs, integrating traditional Chinese architectural design with the golden arches.\n\nHave you ever wondered what it's like to enjoy a Big Mac on a static passenger plane? In Taupo, a town in New Zealand, you can.\n\nNamed one of the \"world's coolest McDonald's,\" per a signpost, this restaurant is inside a decommissioned DC-3 plane built in 1943. At first, it was used as a passenger plane and then as a crop duster, an agricultural aircraft that sprays pesticides on crops from the air.\n\nIn 1984, it was decommissioned and, per Atlas Obscura, became a promotional product in Taupō's Aeroplane Car Company's parking lot until McDonald's bought it in 1990.\n\n\"The airplane location in Taupo is iconic,\" said He.\n\nA McDonald's in the shape of a UFO is fitting for Roswell, a town known for its rumored alien sightings and extraterrestrial encounters.\n\nThe town became popular in 1947 when a mysterious aircraft, which the local newspaper, the Roswell Daily Record, identified as a \"flying saucer,\" crashed into a ranch. Then, in 1980, Stanton Friedman, a former nuclear physicist, came across the 1947 news story and alleged it to be an alien spacecraft, sparking widespread outcry.\n\nGovernment records later showed the aircraft was a top-secret government surveillance balloon used to detect echoes of Soviet nuclear-testing blasts.\n\nBut by then, people were convinced the government was hiding information about alien life, and UFOs had become a mini-industry with several themed attractions, such as the annual UFO festival and a museum, spread across town.\n\nIn 2005, a few miles from the crash site, McDonald's opened a restaurant shaped like a spaceship with neon lights.\n\nBut He loves the restaurant for more than just its exteriors.\n\n\"It has a gift shop,\" he said, adding, \"I mean, it's cool looking, but they have merchandise, which I think is super cool.\"\n\nThe gift shop features Ronald McDonald in a spacesuit and alien statues.\n\nHe's final favorite is the Méqui1000 in São Paulo, Brazil, a spot that combines playful creativity with historical significance.\n\n\"It looks like the White House but decorated as a kindergartner's art project,\" He said, adding that the restaurant's façade undergoes multiple changes in a year and is usually adorned with vibrant artwork for promotional campaigns.\n\nMéqui1000 also holds cultural significance; it was the 1,000th McDonald's in Brazil, one of 20 nations with over 1,000 McDonald's stores, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"It's a huge market and an important location,\" He said.\n\nThe menu here also features items exclusive to Brazil, like the Super Mac, a fully loaded burger with lettuce, tomato, and onion, which is in a contrast to the simpler burgers popular in the US.\n\n\"Culturally, Americans want it [their burgers] cheap, fast, and straightforward, but in Brazil and other countries, people want their burgers a little more dressed up,\" He said.\n\nEditor's note: This story was first published in November 2024 following an interview with photojournalist Gary He.

    "description": "The My Disney Experience app has become essential for trips to Disney World and Disneyland, but relying on phones at the parks may not be so bad.",
    "fullText": "Every December, I take my family to Disneyland.\n\nOn our most recent annual trip, we snagged some great dinner reservations and checked into our themed hotel with ease. This time, my granddaughter was finally tall enough to ride more attractions, like Space Mountain and Tiana's Bayou Adventure.\n\nSoon, though, I realized something: Although our group had never had so much fun at Disney, we'd also never spent so much time on our phones.\n\nOur increased screen time wasn't due to texting or surfing the web — we were just managing our entire vacation on the My Disney Experience app.\n\nThough early versions of the app began making rounds in 2012, I didn't try it until a trip to Disney World in 2018.\n\nWhen checking into our hotel on the property, I'd turned down the chance to have our park tickets and room key loaded onto the app because I consider myself pretty old school.\n\nHowever, I finally caved by lunchtime.\n\nWhile at Animal Kingdom's Flame Tree Barbecue, I noticed several people just walking up to the counter and being handed food without ever waiting in the long line I'd been standing in.\n\nThat's when my wife told me about mobile ordering, a new service Disney had rolled out just a few months prior. I was hungry, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nIn a few taps, I'd placed our lunch order. The app asked if I was in the area and ready to pick up the food. I answered yes.\n\nWithin minutes, I got another alert saying my food was ready. I casually walked past the throngs of guests still waiting to even place their orders and picked up my pulled-pork sandwich.\n\nI felt like I'd been granted membership to a secret club.\n\nMy so-called \"secret\" club didn't last, as the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new way of life, one where contactless interactions were preferred.\n\nMobile ordering, both at Disney and other institutions, has become the norm and, in some cases, the default or only option. Contactless check-in via a mobile app also became increasingly popular across various hotel chains, including Disney properties.\n\nDisney's app has since become a hub for park tickets, room keys, dinner reservations — and even line-skipping features.\n\nThere are still paper maps, physical tickets, and room key cards available for those who want them, but now, it feels difficult to imagine a trip to the parks without a smartphone loaded with the My Disney Experience app.\n\nThough I was once hesitant to use an app as my key card at a Disney hotel, it just made sense during our December trip.\n\nMy hotel reservation was linked to the other guests in my party, so they could easily unlock our suite and make room charges using the app. The only time we went to the front desk was to get a key card for our granddaughter because she likes to open the door herself.\n\nWhen it came time to enter the park, we scanned our tickets in the app and used our phones for entry. The app helped us check ride wait times so we could maximize our day. We also used it to peruse the menus of restaurants we might want to dine at, make reservations, and then receive alerts when our table was ready.\n\nOur biggest use of the app was reserving rides with the Lightning Lane, a service we'd paid extra for so we could skip the lines on popular attractions.\n\nEvery time we got off one ride, my wife was on the app, refreshing to check availability while trying to make the next reservation for our whole family.\n\nThough she did miss a few conversations while heads-down on her phone, it felt like a small sacrifice to make in order to efficiently secure seats on popular attractions for our whole family.\n\nWith everything we could need in this app, all we really had to do was make sure we had an extra battery and phone chargers in our bags.\n\nWalking around the park, I thought I'd feel sad seeing empty alcoves where machines once dispensed paper Fast Passes or the ticket booths in the process of being removed.\n\nHowever, I realized I really just feel nostalgic. Any wistful reflections would be a bit romanticized since the past may be simpler, but it wasn't always better.\n\nWhen my wife and I visited Disney World for the first time in the '80s, we picked up our park tickets from our travel agent, flew with physical boarding passes, and carried printed-out copies of our hotel reservations and rental-car agreement.\n\nTimes have definitely changed, but it sure is more convenient to travel with a digital boarding pass and the Disney app loaded on my phone instead of carrying a bunch of papers.\n\nAnd by not waiting in lines to order food or check in at a hotel, maybe parkgoers can free up their time to spend more of it having fun with family.\n\nBut if your face is buried in your phone, you're going to miss a lot — whether the special menu recommendations that come with placing a food order with a cashier or the look on a loved one's face as they get off a great ride.\n\nUltimately, the ability to manage your entire Disney trip on an app isn't exactly a bad thing — it just comes down to how you use it.",

    "description": "As a frequent traveler who's been around the world, I fell in love with Bali. The island is home to great food, warm people, and lots of things to do.",
    "fullText": "As an American who's traveled to 44 countries over the last 30 years, I've seen my fair share of unforgettable places.\n\nBut if I had to choose one place to visit again and again, it would be Bali, an island and province in Indonesia that combines vibrant culture, natural beauty, and a pace of life that feels both energizing and restorative.\n\nAfter spending a month on the island in 2023, I fell in love. Here's what made my trip to Bali so special.\n\nOne of my favorite meals during my time in Bali came from a street vendor. The Javanese meal, called Tahu Tek, featured fried tofu, bean sprouts, a thick peanut sauce, and a pile of crackers on top. It cost me less than $2 (USD), but it was packed with flavor.\n\nBali's food scene goes far beyond street food, though. Even dining at restaurants felt affordable, making it easy to try local specialties, including babi guling, a traditional whole roasted pig.\n\nPlus, I could easily find international cuisine alongside local dishes.\n\nI often went to Milk & Madu, which served American-style food like pizza and burgers. I also loved spending mornings at cafés in Canggu, sipping smoothies and enjoying breakfast bowls.\n\nOne of the main things that makes Bali truly special is its people. I've been to many destinations where the locals aren't always open to expats and travelers. But here, everyone I met was warm, welcoming, and genuinely kind.\n\nFor example, I used an app called Grab, similar to Uber, where drivers can pick up passengers on their motorbikes or in their cars.\n\nI was wary about riding on the back of a stranger's bike, but the friendly drivers I had across several rides quickly made me feel at ease. Some would even check in with me during the ride to make sure everything was OK or to ask if I needed them to slow down.\n\nPlus, I found an amazing community of digital nomads, creatives, and expats who decided to trade their office jobs for laptops in cafés. As an American living abroad, this made me feel at home.\n\nIt gave me a sense of familiarity in a new environment and made it easier to connect, since there was no language barrier. I felt more comfortable starting conversations and sharing experiences with other expats and long-term travelers.\n\nDuring my time in Uluwatu, I met another nomad, and a simple conversation turned into spending the next few days together exploring. These kinds of moments felt much more natural and common in Bali than in other places I've visited, and I felt a strong sense of openness and connection.\n\nAnother thing I loved about Bali was the diverse range of activities available. Whether I was in the mood to visit temples or relax on the beach, there was always something to do.\n\nFor example, in Ubud, I wandered through the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, where ancient temples sit under jungle canopies. There were signs everywhere warning visitors to hold onto their belongings, and for good reason. The sanctuary is home to over 1,260 monkeys, who I saw climbing railings and jumping between statues.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I also visited Alas Harum, a tourism destination in Tegallalang with lots of opportunities for adventure. Here, I flew out on a giant swing that went over rice fields. Taking in the view from way above the terraces was equal parts terrifying and fun.\n\nAnd when I wanted to relax, I visited the beach clubs, where I lounged by the water with music playing and a drink in my hand.\n\nAfter traveling to 44 countries, I can confidently say I'm no stranger to exploring new places.\n\nEvery destination I've visited has shown me new ways of living, but in Bali, I experienced a way of life that felt joyful, balanced, and connected. Plus, the tropical, warm, and consistent weather didn't hurt either.\n\nBetween the amazing food, the warm people, and the sense of adventure, I'm already dreaming of my next trip to this beautiful island.",

They tweaked marketing, packaging, or pricing to suit regional tastes. But in today’s fractured world, such superficial localization is no longer good enough. Trade policies conflict. Data laws clash. And many governments now enforce data sovereignty laws and mandates for local sourcing and technology transfer. They require companies to perform key operations, stretching from research and development to manufacturing and data processing, within their country, instead of merely selling products from abroad. The result is a profound shift in how global companies operate. They duplicate supply chains, adjust to local markets in real time, and integrate national and regional suppliers, even at the cost of scale efficiencies, to ensure redundancy and tailor best practices for every market.",

    "description": "The lawsuit was filed by an international group of plaintiffs.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after Meta (then Facebook) bought WhatsApp in 2014, it promised to implement a surprisingly un-Facebooky feature: End-to-end encryption. The move was supposed to be a boon for privacy, ensuring nobody could see your messages aside from the recipient and yourself. Even now, WhatsApp's website claims, \"No one outside of the chat, not even WhatsApp, can read, listen to, or share [your messages].\" However, a new lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco is now claiming that's not the case.\n\nAccording to reporting from Bloomberg, an international group of plaintiffs has sued Meta, saying that the app's claims of end-to-end encryption are a lie. The lawsuit alleges that Meta and WhatsApp \"store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp user's purportedly 'private' communications.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs include users from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa, who are being represented by attorneys from several firms. The allegations cite \"whistleblowers\" who helped bring this information to light, but no more is known as of yet.\n\nWhen I reached out to Meta for comment, Meta strongly denied the allegations. The company called the lawsuit \"frivolous,\" assuring users that WhatsApp uses the open-source Signal protocol for encryption and adding that \"[a]ny claim that people's WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false and absurd.\"\n\nIf the lawsuit succeeds, it could affect billions of users around the world. That's because the plaintiffs' lawyers are asking the court to certify a class-action lawsuit.\n\nIn the meantime, WhatApp is far from the only option for encrypted messaging apps. While it's unclear how the lawsuit will proceed, those looking to jump ship might want to look at alternatives like Signal or Viber instead. Note that some apps, like Telegram, do offer end-to-end encryption, but don't enable it by default. (Personally I use Line, because of the anime stickers.)",
