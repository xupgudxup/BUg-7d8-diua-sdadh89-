Whether you’re surviving harsh environments, building sprawling systems, or just chilling and catching fish, the online co-op games on this list will keep you and all your friends hooked and coming back for more. If you're looking for a cozier setup, check out our best couch co-op games list.\n\nPlayed online with friends, Divinity: Original Sin 2 becomes less about obsessively optimizing builds and more about reacting together to a world that’s constantly responding to your choices. It sounds cheesy, but if you want a game where you can create actual shared stories and feel like your actions impact an entire world, get your mates downloading Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\nThe game’s strength lies in how much freedom it gives you all. Quests rarely have a single solution, and disagreements about what to do next are only a sign that you're properly invested. Whatever you do, the game adapts, and the group adapts with it. Combat is turn-based, which gives everyone time to think and discuss/argue over the best plan. Outside of combat, exploration also feels pretty communal if you lean into it, with players splitting up to investigate different areas and then regrouping with new ideas. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a long game, but one that rewards groups willing to commit to a shared adventure--one of you can even be the Game Master if you'd like. There's a new Divinity game coming out at some point, too, so keep your eyes peeled and dig deep into the lore so you don't get left behind.\n\nValheim is one of those games that is almost always better in co-op than played alone. Fans make a lot of noise about the deep exploration and survival mechanics (rightly so), but its base building is another example of where online co-op really shines. Building a settlement together turns the game into a long-term group project, where everyone contributes in their own way. Watching a base slowly grow from a rough shelter into a functioning village is deeply satisfying, and who doesn't want to build a massive Viking longhouse?\n\nThere’s also a comforting rhythm to games like Valheim. Log in, check what needs fixing, expand a wall, add a roof, and then head out together for the next goal. The game supports both focused teamwork and casual hanging out, making it ideal for groups that want something flexible but meaningful. Why not grab some Valheim mods while you're at it?\n\nPhasmophobia is half co-op, half creepy chaos, and by far one of the best horror games on Xbox. It’s a game where communication isn’t just helpful, it might just save your life. Playing with friends transforms what could be a terrifying solo experience into a tense but often hilarious group effort. Just seeing how your nearest and dearest react to jumpscares in real-time is always a treat.\n\nThe aim of the game is to investigate paranormal activity using a selection of tools and finding evidence. Each investigation in Phasmophobia becomes a shared puzzle between four minds, as you split tasks, compare evidence, and constantly relay information over voice chat. Successes and failures feel communal, and the stakes only get higher as the hauntings get more intense. On the up side, shared responsibility makes it easier to laugh about afterward, even if you were shrieking with very real fear in the moment.\n\nGreen Hell is the survival game you recommend to both your novice and veteran friends. Accessible and challenging all at once, the more support you have, the more manageable the challenges become. Green Hell's online co-op turns the jungle from an overwhelming threat into a shared challenge.\n\nSure, you can go out with weapons and stake a claim to the ground, focusing on combat and conquest, or you can raise animals in wooden holding pens, nurture crops, and build--dare we say, cozy--shelters for you and your comrades. Despite including a number of real-world survival techniques and some genuinely challenging hostile encounters, Green Hell isn't too punishing when you've got a group around you to scout, scavenge, defend, and farm your new home.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWebfishing is a little different than most games on this list, but a worthy addition nonetheless. It's a low-key, low-stakes, low-poly chill out zone, where you and your friends can customize animal avatars, go fishing, chat about life, and explore. It's a space for conversation and de-stressing, a great alternative to a group chat, especially if you don't mind periods of silence and relaxation.\n\nOver time you acquire better equipment, new threads, and the ability to catch better fish. Show off your catches, sell them, or merely explore. There are a few secrets hidden in the game that might cause a spark of excitement, but we'll not spoil too much here.\n\nDon’t Starve Together is the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, a game full of harsh wildernesses, strange creatures, and deep mysteries. The game’s uncompromising world is much easier to navigate when mistakes are made--and learned from--together, either with friends in a private server, or with strangers online.\n\nThis one should be an easy sell to friends who aren't sure about survival horror, as Don't Starve is also a game like Minecraft in that you can mine, craft, explore, and gather resources to make a communal base. Just don't mention what happens in the dark.\n\nFactorio is co-op at its most collaborative. It’s a game about building systems, and playing online turns those systems into group efforts that constantly evolve--it's like getting a job in a factory, except you don't get paid and it's actually fun.\n\nEach player can take ownership of part of the factory, but nothing exists in isolation. Changes ripple outward, encouraging constant communication and coordination. Planning becomes a shared activity, often involving diagrams, discussions, and occasional redesigns. Only enlist your smartest, most strategic friends.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic is a great gateway horror game for when you don't want something too scary, easing you and your friends into a slightly spooky experience that requires focus and commitment to survive. Missions are designed so that players naturally rely on each other’s strengths, making co-op feel purposeful and fun, despite the horrors that persist.\n\nEach class contributes something unique, encouraging loose communication without forcing strict coordination. Deep Rock Galactic strikes a balance between structure and flexibility, letting groups play casually or strategically, and employs its light-hearted tone to keep things flowing even when the going gets tough.\n\nTerraria in co-op feels like a shared sandbox adventure, a story only you and your friends could have written. Online play turns simple exploration and building into group projects that evolve organically, battles that require backup, and bases worthy of Terraria's most elaborate decor.\n\nYou'll naturally split tasks--some of you can explore, some can build, some can fight--and then regroup to share the spoils with everyone. The procedurally generated world feels more alive the more people live in it, reflecting the collective efforts of everyone involved and growing at a pace alongside you. Depending on your ability and playstyle, you can choose to go the offensive route, battling your way through the wilds, or become a homebody, creating a comforting environment for everyone to come back to once they're done fighting. There's a role for everyone. If you're needing some inspiration, check out our extensive Terraria guidesto get you started.\n\nAstroneer turns the realities of brutal and isolated space exploration into a cooperative, rewarding process, which is why it's one of the best survival games you can play online. Online co-op encourages players to plan, experiment, and adapt together as they reshape alien worlds and make it through another night. The tactile feel of the game's crafting system and potential for laid-back exploration and terraforming means you can (as long as you're willing to carry some of the survival responsibility) play it with just about anyone.\n\nWhen your oxygen level is on the line, tasks feel lighter when shared. It's not a punishing survival game, but it expects you to keep an eye on many moving parts at once for your colonization efforts to be effective. For creative groups who enjoy a bit of focus and tranquility, Astroneer might just hit the spot\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a light-hearted and silly online co-op game where every action requires coordination, and success depends on players communicating constantly, despite being in stitches.\n\nRunning a spaceship together (especially when you're just lil' guys) means juggling roles on the fly. Shields, weapons, navigation--it all requires cooperation, often under pressure and with heavy doses of chaos. It's an easy game to pick up and a fun party game for breaking the ice, we've even rated it one of the best couch co-op games to play together.",

    "description": "The NFL is expecting each team to compete in an international game on a rotational basis. The Dallas Cowboys are due to appear in one, and it could come much sooner than later.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have not appeared in an international game since 2014, which is the longest active streak among any NFL franchise.\n\nWith the league now proposing that each team take part in a game on foreign soil at least once every eight years, the Cowboys are next in line to book a trip out of the country for a game. The new rule came about in 2022, so no agreements have been broken yet, but the Cowboys' worldwide fame is a bit surprising that no international exposure has been scheduled yet.\n\nIn 2014, it was Tony Romo and Dez Bryant who led a Cowboys team to a 31-17 win in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the franchise's first and only game played outside of the United States.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones not only thinks Dallas' next international game is approaching, but that it could be south of the border as soon as next season. The NFL is already planning to host a game next season at Estadio Azeteca in Mexico City in 2026.\n\n“I think probably in the near time,” Jones said about the idea, “with near being next year.”\n\nWe've already looked at the Cowboys' potential 2026 schedule based on them being locked into the No. 2 placing in the NFC East. Dallas is scheduled to host nine games at AT&T Stadium and travel to eight road games.\n\nOne of those home contests would have to be sacrificed for an international game. If it comes in Mexico City, we figure that'd be as close to a home-like crowd as you can find outside of Arlington.\n\nWhether it's in North America or Europe, the general expectation is for Dallas to be the home team in this one because they've been voided of the opportunity as a visitor in the past. Home teams in these games get to choose their opponent, and many are smart not to pick a team with such a large fanbase and global brand like the Cowboys with the risk of losing merchandising sales or in-stadium support.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints, Jones says that Dallas being the home team in order to score a game is \"unavoidable under the current framework,\" because it's also they will have to rotationally give up a home game and compete internationally anyway.\n\nWith this in mind, don't be surprised if \"America's Team\" takes on foreign soil in the near future.",

    "title": "Copper prices are soaring. Here's what that often signals for the economy.",
    "description": "Copper prices have rallied over 35% so far this year amid supply shortages, surging global demand, and tariff uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMetals have had a record year with recent surges in gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) prices, but there’s a third metal hitting its own record highs. Copper prices have rallied by more than 35% this year, poised for the biggest annual gain since 2009, driven higher by rising tech demand, supply constraints, and tariff uncertainty.\n\nGlobal copper (HG=F) prices officially surpassed $12,000 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday for the first time ever and continued to march higher on Wednesday.\n\nEach type of metal reacts slightly differently to economic conditions, and copper is no exception. However, unlike gold and silver, copper isn’t so directly influenced by investor sentiment or economic expectations. Its price movements can typically be attributed to physical growth and expansion.\n\nCopper is often viewed as a barometer for the economy. It plays a central role in power grids, construction, industrial machinery, and more. When there’s a demand for those types of goods or services, it’s typically a good sign that the economy has a clean bill of health — giving copper its nickname: Doctor Copper.\n\nRising copper prices often signal strong industrial demand and a rapidly growing economy, while falling prices may indicate an economic slowdown, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Copper is “a major beneficiary of investments in grid and power infrastructure globally, as AI and defence heighten the need for robust and secure energy networks,” wrote Goldman Sachs Research analyst Eoin Dinsmore in a note.\n\nGold is seen as more of a “safe-haven” asset and a hedge against inflation. Silver straddles the line between gold and copper and has both investment and industrial purposes. Copper, however, is predominantly industrial. It’s not typically purchased to be stored like gold or silver but meant to be used, which is why it’s usually the strongest indicator, of the three metals, that the economy is moving in the right direction.\n\nThere are a few key reasons that copper is experiencing a surge right now. Major copper-producing regions such as Chile and Indonesia have faced supply challenges and environmental disasters that have contributed to a global copper shortage and a tighter market.\n\n“After essentially flat mine supply growth expected this year, our 2026 mine supply growth estimates have fallen to only around +1.4%, or about 500 kmt lower than our estimates at the beginning of the year,” said Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, in a statement.\n\nA dip in supply isn’t the only factor that’s pushing prices higher. In July, the Trump administration issued tariffs on several categories of copper imports, putting additional pressure on the market. At the same time, heavy investment in the AI sector is significantly boosting demand because of its reliance on copper for data centers.\n\nOne source estimates that hyperscale AI data centers can use up to 50,000 tons of copper per facility.\n\nAs far as where prices are headed, JPMorgan Global Research expects copper prices to reach $12,500 a ton in the second quarter of 2026, ultimately averaging around $12,075 a ton for the full year.\n\nWhile researchers are optimistic that copper prices will continue on an upward trend, experts say the long-term implications of recent price surges remain uncertain.\n\n“The intersection of tariffs and copper prices in July 2025 highlights the complex dynamics of global trade and commodity markets,” said David Koch, CFP and director of portfolio management at Halbert Hargrove. “While the immediate effect has been a sharp rise in copper prices, the long-term consequences will depend on how markets, governments, and industries adapt to this new trade environment.”\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nGold and silver prices have been on a tear, with silver prices increasing by more than 100% year to date.

    "description": "The USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, participated in scientific and military operations around the world.",
    "fullText": "On January 17, 1955, the USS Nautilus transmitted a historic message: \"Underway on nuclear power.\"\n\nAs the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, Nautilus could remain submerged for two weeks at a time and travel at speeds of over 20 knots, or about 23 miles per hour.\n\nPreviously, World War II submarines powered by diesel engines and electric batteries could stay underwater for just 12 to 48 hours at a time. Since their batteries only charged while surfaced, diesel-electric US Navy vessels like the USS Cobia had to move at around 2 or 3 miles per hour to conserve power and hit maximum speeds of 9 knots, or about 10 miles per hour.\n\nNautilus is now part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut. Visitors can walk through the historic nuclear submarine and see how its crew members lived and worked while submerged up to 700 feet below the surface.\n\nI visited the museum in March to tour Nautilus. Take a look inside.\n\nNautilus, which was commissioned in 1954, hosted the first-ever underwater legislative meeting when 13 members of Congress rode Nautilus in 1955.\n\nIts nuclear power allowed Nautilus to sail under the polar ice cap and become the first ship to traverse the North Pole in 1958 in an expedition known as Operation Sunshine.\n\nNautilus also participated in the naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\n\nAfter 26 years of service, Nautilus was decommissioned in 1980 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1982. It opened to the public as part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut, in 1986.\n\nIn 2021, Nautilus underwent $36 million of preservation work and reopened in 2022.\n\nThe Submarine Force Museum is open Wednesday through Monday and is free to visit.\n\nI was amazed by the size of the submarine. As I climbed aboard, the deck provided gorgeous views of the Thames River.\n\nHere, crew members loaded torpedoes for firing.\n\nAfter the torpedoes were loaded, the tubes were flooded with water. When the command to fire was issued, high-pressure air from the submarine's ejection pump then forced the water and the torpedoes out of the tubes.\n\nSigns on the sink and mirror indicated that they were part of the submarine's original equipment.\n\nNautilus had a crew of 11 officers and 105 enlisted service members.\n\nA panel of instruments along the wardroom's wall indicated Nautilus' depth and speed.\n\nOfficers ate the same meals as the rest of the crew members, but their food was brought up to the officers' pantry via a dumbwaiter to be reheated and served on Navy china.\n\nThe walls of the narrow hallway were covered in wood paneling.\n\nThe book was gifted to Nautilus' commanding officer, Commander William R. Anderson, in 1957 by the French Navy's chief of staff, Adm. Henri Nomy. The fictional submarine in the book is also named Nautilus.\n\nFewer beds in a room indicated a higher rank.\n\nThe executive officer, also known as the \"XO,\" was the ship's second-in-command.\n\nThe commanding officer used the stateroom as a workspace and living quarters.\n\nThe yeoman managed the ship's correspondence and personnel records.\n\nThe attack center contained periscopes to spot enemy ships and the controls to aim and fire torpedoes.\n\nOn the diagram, Nautilus is represented by the bottom ship, and the top ship represents the target.\n\nThe torpedo firing key, which was used to deploy the torpedoes, was indicated with a blue sign on the firing panel.\n\nThe guns were used for security while the submarine was in port.\n\nSonar stands for \"sound navigation and ranging.\" Active sonar emitted sound pulses to locate targets, while passive sonar listened for underwater activity.\n\nBefore that, ladders were used to climb from one level to another.\n\nCommands were issued in the control room by a crew member known as the diving officer of the watch, who received orders from the attack center.\n\nWhen the main ballast tanks filled with water, the submarine would submerge. When filled with air, the submarine would surface.\n\nThe ESM bay's instruments could detect other ships' radars.\n\nThe radio room was located just off the control room on the right.\n\nHere, crew members ate meals, worked, and spent their recreational time.\n\nDamage control personnel used OBAs if fires broke out on board while submerged. The hoses on the masks could be attached to the submarine's reserve air supply.\n\nSince there was no Navy chaplain on board the submarine, crew member volunteers conducted services for various faiths with items from the lay services box.\n\nNautilus was mainly powered by its nuclear reactor, but the battery served as an auxiliary source of power in case of an emergency.\n\nA window connected the galley to the scullery, where crew members washed dishes.\n\nNautilus had two crew quarters, one at the front of the submarine and one at the back.\n\nI swiveled the periscope until I could see my car sitting in the museum's parking lot, which was pretty cool.\n\nJust over 70 years after Nautilus was commissioned as the first nuclear-powered submarine in the world, all of the US Navy's submarines are now nuclear-powered, according to the Department of Defense.",

    "fullText": "Spanish women's soccer is at the top of the world, bearing the star of world champions. However, the ambition of this generation is insatiable, and its new leader is no stranger to the mix of success and frustration.\n\nSonia Bermúdez, a legend of Spanish soccer and newly appointed head coach in 2025, knows the weight of history and the bittersweet taste of defeat. Her appointment, following a brilliant stint in the lower categories of the RFEF, came right after the National Team fell short of European glory, losing in the final of the Women's EURO in the fateful penalty shootout.\n\nWith an eye on 2026, a crucial year to establish the project and qualify for the next World Cup, Bermúdez sets aside tactics and scouting reports to write a very special letter. From her coach's heart, this is her wish list for Santa Claus, filled with hope and with the sole aim of ensuring that Spanish dominance has no end.\n\nI know this wish list is not written by a child, but by a woman who, after more than two decades in soccer, has taken on the greatest challenge of her career: being the Head Coach of the Spanish Women's National Team.\n\nMy first months have been intense. We conquered the Nations League and felt the support of more than 55,000 voices at the Metropolitano, reaffirming our leadership. But we also suffered the setback of being just one step —one penalty— away from European glory.\n\nThat defeat in the Women's EURO Final hurt us, but it has injected us with a voracious hunger. Therefore, my wishes for 2026 are requests aimed at consolidating our hegemony and building an unbeatable future:\n\nMy first and most urgent wish is that 2026 be the year in which, without speculations or unnecessary anxieties, we secure direct qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe goal is clear: to arrive at the World Cup in full condition to defend our star and demonstrate that we are a power that not only wins but remains at the top. I ask that the team maintains ambition and that the pressure of being the current world champions propels us, rather than paralyzes us.\n\nSanta Claus, you well know that my heart is also in the grassroots, as I spent years watching these generations grow in the lower categories. Therefore, I wish that Spanish formative soccer continues to shine brightly on the international stage.\n\nWe cannot rest. I ask that investment continues in infrastructure, qualified personnel, and talent detection, so that the RFEF's player factory remains the most envied in the world. We need future \"golden generations\" to continue winning European and world titles in their categories, ensuring a quality succession that guarantees the National Team is always well-nourished.\n\nWe are world champions due to the strength of the collective, but that collective is full of talents that deserve the highest recognition. My last great wish is for Spanish players to once again be the undisputed protagonists in achieving individual titles like the Ballon d'Or and the The Best award.\n\nThis is more than a whim; it is the thermometer of the level of our league and the individual quality of our players. I ask that this recognition be the norm, not the exception, and that the mark of Spanish soccer is imprinted on all global awards.\n\nThe table is set, and the excitement is at its peak. We only need health, a bit of your magic for those moments of fortune, and the certainty that Spanish women's soccer will continue to grow without limits.\n\nWith gratitude and determination,\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇪🇸 here.\n\n📸 Mateo Villalba Sanchez - 2025 Getty Images",

    "fullText": "Fighting Drought and Heat: The Science of Growing Climate-Resilient Christmas Trees\n\nAs Christmas trees face mounting challenges from climate change, researchers explore solutions to help ensure that a beloved holiday tradition endures in a warming world.\n\nKendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American’s Science Quickly, I’m Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.\n\nThe Christmas tree feels like a tradition from time immemorial—and in some ways it is. Historians trace the use of evergreens in winter festivals as far back as ancient Egypt and Rome. But the modern American custom has more recent roots: to the 1800s and German immigrants in Pennsylvania. These immigrants are believed to have brought the practice to their new home in the U.S.\n\nThe tree custom gained even more traction when it appeared in an adapted sketch of Queen Victoria and her German-born husband and their children that was published in a U.S. women’s magazine. Many credit it with kicking off a trend that has endured to today.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nAnd while a number of people in recent years have opted for lower-maintenance synthetic trees, many revelers still prefer the look and smell of real trees. But because of climate change natural Christmas trees and their fans are facing new threats.\n\nToday we talk to Priya Rajarapu, an assistant professor and Christmas tree extension specialist at Oregon State University, about the risks tree growers are weathering and what, if anything, can be done.\n\nSo, Priya, what exactly do you do?\n\nPriya Rajarapu: [The] most simplest way I could explain is: when you are sick you call a doctor, and when Christmas trees are sick growers usually reach out to me.\n\nPierre-Louis: What kinds of trees are Christmas trees, and how are they typically grown?\n\nRajarapu: So Christmas trees are all usually fir trees or evergreens, and there’s a history behind it. Evergreens tend to keep their needles throughout the season. So it’s a symbolism of hope, so Christmas is usually celebrated around that. It’s also looking forward to the spring and harvest season.\n\nAnd Christmas trees, although they are evergreens that you see mostly in forests, they are an important agricultural commodity in the U.S. We sell [roughly] 14 million Christmas trees, as of 2022 survey in the U.S. ...\n\nRajarapu: And the four major Christmas-tree-producing states include Oregon, North Carolina, Washington and Michigan.\n\nPierre-Louis: So we really are talking about a farmed product, and I don’t think most people typically picture Christmas trees the same way that we think of, say, corn or potatoes. What makes a farmed tree different from the trees that I see in the forest?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, I’m glad you mentioned the corn and potato analogy because that’s the best way to view Christmas trees, too, is that they are grown similar to corn and potatoes or any other vegetable crops. It’s just that it’s a specialty crop—it’s a tree, so it has a longer rotation. So corn, you can get a crop in an ear ...\n\nRajarapu: But Christmas tree, you’re harvesting the tree. Then you have to wait anywhere, depending on the species, from five to 10 years to harvest a tree.\n\nAnd the difference between the trees that are grown on farm and the trees that grow in the forest is that the trees that are grown [in] the farm are cultured ...\n\nRajarapu: Meaning they are pruned to give you that perfect Christmas tree shape, the typical triangle shape that you see. So growers invest a lot of time in culturing and pruning the trees so the trees can become bushier and fuller for people to hang more ornaments and not see the stem or branch.\n\nPierre-Louis: To kind of avoid the sad Charlie Brown Christmas tree.\n\nRajarapu: But there are—there is a customer base who still likes Charlie Brown Christmas trees, so there is a pretty decent-sized consumer base for natural trees or natural-looking trees.\n\nPierre-Louis: One of the parts of the work that you do is sort of looking at the pressures of climate change on tree production. And so what kinds of pressures are you seeing?\n\nRajarapu: So I would say the changing temperatures and lesser precipitation. So we are getting more and more days with less precipitation, so there are years where there is no precipitation for 100 days in Pacific Northwest, which does pose a lot of challenge for keeping trees healthy and also seedlings alive.\n\nSo for every Christmas tree that’s cut there is at least another two seedlings that are going back in the ground. So it, it’s a [roughly] 10-year rotation, so grower has to keep his crop going, so he or she plants trees every year in the ground, and that first year of growth or seedling establishment after transplanting them into the field or farm is very crucial. So when there is drought or when there is higher temperatures and lesser precipitation, it’s hard for that particular seedling to stay alive and establish itself. So that is one of the key challenges that growers are seeing with the changing weather patterns.\n\nAnd also, another change that I’ve noticed is [the] type of site that you choose for your species can also stress the trees and can attract insects such as bark beetles or twig weevils that were occasional pests—now their frequency is increasing.\n\nPierre-Louis: Because the climate is getting warmer?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, because of the warmer climate and also lesser precipitation or no precipitation in Pacific Northwest. I’ve been in North Carolina, and it rains a lot. There, flooding is an issue. But in Pacific Northwest in summer, it’s dry.\n\nPierre-Louis: And that’s not normal, right? Like, in the past you wouldn’t get 100 days without rain.\n\nRajarapu: Correct. What I hear from growers is that it would rain until July Fourth ...\n\nRajarapu: It would, like, constantly rain, without any break. So the only time that they go without any precipitation is August and September, and then October it starts raining again. So it’s just the two months, which, typically, soil would hold enough moisture during that time.\n\nPierre-Louis: But now it’s extended to, like, 100 days, and the soil just can’t hold moisture for that long.\n\nRajarapu: Exactly, that’s what we are seeing. And right now I have an experiment that’s going in the field where I am trying to monitor the moisture present in the soil throughout the growing season and try different mulch covering the seedling so that I could improve that moisture retention in the soil by mulching the seedling, protecting that moisture in the soil from evaporating.\n\nPierre-Louis: And I know it’s still early, but are you seeing any sort of promising results, any suggestions of things that might help reduce the impact of those pressures on the seedlings?\n\nRajarapu: Yeah, sure, so the mulching practice or experiments to improve seedling survival; it’s not something new ...\n\nSo seedling survival—that first year of establishment is very crucial. It has just become so that, with the weather patterns, it has become more challenging. So some of the things that my predecessor and other professors at Michigan State University have tried is different root dips, so these are polymers, these are inert polymers that cover the root surface and are commercial products that are available and are claimed to hold moisture and also any nutrition.\n\nSo all these trials have been done in the past, and what came out or emerged as a hero or a savior is mulch. Just typical wood mulch would help seedlings survive and also significantly reduce the temperature—that is, soil temperature—under the mulch. But one of the concerns that growers have is that the wood mulch, depending on the source where they’re getting from, might carry some diseases that might infect their soil. But we don’t have any evidence, scientifically, for that. That’s one of the concerns they have.\n\nAnd it’s also the price. Like, if wood mulch is expensive, is there something that we are getting for free? For example, this year three or four different mulch covers that I’m trying is sawdust, compost, and I’ve tried hazelnut shells. Hazelnut is another big industry in Oregon, and all the hazelnut growers are wondering what to do with their shells after they harvest the nuts. So they are trying to find ways that they could reuse or repurpose these shells, so I’m testing that, also, as a mulch in this field trial.\n\nAnd right now my results show any kind of mulch would help the seedling survive better than having no mulch. But I’m studying more deeper into this, so I’m measuring needle chemistry to see if there is any difference in nutrition from these different mulch. That’s another concern for growers, too, that these raw, uncomposted mulch might steal nutrient from the soil and, also, a seedling might not be getting enough. So that’s another concern that I’m trying to address with this research.\n\nPierre-Louis: One of the ways tree farmers are coping with increasing pressures around climate change is by planting some different species of trees. I understand they’re maybe planting some trees that came originally came from Europe?\n\nRajarapu: Yep, so we, at OSU Extension, and also North Carolina State has a very strong Christmas-tree-genetics program. So back in 2010 researchers from Oregon State University and North Carolina State University and Washington State and Michigan State got together and went to Republic of Georgia and Turkey to find different species that can hold their needles well, can make other great Christmas trees ...\n\nRajarapu: And looked for these trees. So they collected seeds from trees that have great traits or that can make great Christmas trees. They brought in those seeds, and they grew all those seeds, two seedlings in the U.S. ...\n\nRajarapu: And planted in different regions within the U.S. So we have those trials, or test plots, in Washington, Oregon, North Carolina, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania. So all the same seedlings were planted in different regions to see if certain seedlings would emerge as perfect for that geographic condition.\n\nSo we found some that perform best in Oregon and Washington, and we have established seed orchards for the seedlings, or particular genetics, for Nordmann and Turkish fir. Those are the two firs that we identified or were brought into the U.S. as seeds, and we are growing them so that they can mature and produce seeds. And yes, these seem to do better than our natives, like noble fir, particularly, which is very sensitive to temperature changes and lesser precipitation, whereas these Nordmann and Turkish fir have been more resilient, and also, they do not attract a lot of pests that [are] typically [attracted to] the native trees. And also, they have high tolerance for different types of soil. So those traits are making them popular.\n\nPierre-Louis: So for the person who loves a live Christmas tree how concerned should they be that, at some point, it might not be accessible?\n\nRajarapu: So far growers are working really hard to keep the supply going. There is definitely a decrease in the number of acres in production of Christmas trees.\n\nWe are seeing that it might be price that might be driving some people to, like, change their mind. So artificial Christmas tree, it’s convenience and also the price. It’s, like, you’re paying $400 for 10 years. I think it all comes to that.\n\nWe are trying really hard to keep the number of trees, the live trees, accessible to all consumers. We usually have more trees than we have consumers, so I don’t think so ...\n\nRajarapu: Having a shortage would be a problem, as long as consumers are willing to buy the trees.\n\nPierre-Louis: That’s really cool. It’s been lovely learning so much about Christmas trees with you. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today.\n\nPierre-Louis: That’s all for today!

    "description": "Stories shape how your child thinks, feels, and understands the world.",
    "fullText": "Stories shape how your child thinks, feels, and understands the world. They connect language, emotion, memory, and meaning in a way few activities can. When storytelling becomes part of daily life, these connections strengthen and quietly influence learning, curiosity, and behavior.\n\nAt a cognitive level, stories train the brain to understand structure. A beginning leads to a middle. Actions lead to outcomes. This mirrors how children learn cause and effect. Research influenced by thinkers like Jean Piaget shows that children grasp ideas more deeply when they are embedded in meaningful narratives rather than abstract instruction.\n\nLanguage development accelerates inside stories. Words arrive with context, emotion, and repetition, which makes them easier to retain and reuse. When stories are read or heard regularly, children pick up sentence patterns, tone, and rhythm. Over time, this shows up as clearer expression and stronger listening skills.\n\nImagination plays a central role in emotional development. When your child steps into the world of a character, they practice seeing life from another point of view. This builds empathy and emotional awareness. Stories allow children to explore fear, joy, and frustration in a safe space, without real-world consequences.\n\nCreative storytelling also supports decision-making. Characters face problems, make choices, fail, and try again. Children absorb these patterns naturally. They learn that effort matters and that actions have outcomes. These lessons shape patience, self-control, and thoughtful behavior in everyday situations.\n\nStorytelling works best when it invites participation. Reading together or listening to a story and then talking about it turns passive consumption into active thinking. Simple moments help:\n\nDigital storytelling can support this process when it is designed with care. Calm visuals, clear language, and room for imagination matter more than constant interaction. This is where platforms like StoryBee fit naturally into a child’s routine.\n\nStoryBee allows parents and educators to create personalized stories based on a child’s age, interests, and learning needs. A story can be read, illustrated, or listened to as audio, which supports different learning styles. StoryBee focuses on creativity and imagination rather than overstimulation, helping children stay engaged without losing the reflective nature of storytelling.\n\nFor busy parents, StoryBee also lowers the barrier to consistency. Instead of searching for the right book every day, StoryBee helps generate fresh stories that still encourage thinking, curiosity, and conversation. The experience stays flexible and child-led.\n\nYou do not need long sessions to see impact. One short story a day, whether from a physical book or through StoryBee, is enough. What matters is presence and repetition. Stories are not about teaching facts. They shape how your child understands themselves and the world around them.\n\nYou do not need long sessions.\nConsistency matters more than duration.\n\nYou are not teaching content.\nYou are shaping how your child thinks.\n\nStories are quiet builders. When you choose thoughtful storytelling experiences and tools like StoryBee, you give your child skills that last well beyond childhood.",

    "description": "Gold's next rally won't need a crisis — the world's dysfunction is the catalyst.",
    "fullText": "Gold is finishing 2025 at all-time highs, and the momentum is set to extend into 2026.\n\nThe spot gold price surged past $4,500 per troy ounce for the first time on Wednesday in Asia trading and is trading around $4,490 per ounce. The yellow metal is up more than 70% so far in its best year since 1979.\n\nGold could stay strong because the rally drivers are structural, not purely reactive, according to analysts.\n\n\"Gold doesn't need a crisis to rise in 2026. It simply needs the world to behave the way it has been: elevated debt, policy uncertainty, fragile alliances, and a dollar that no longer dominates as it once did,\" wrote Farah Mourad, a market analyst at IG, a trading platform.\n\n\"In that environment, gold doesn't chase fear — it absorbs it,\" Mourad added.\n\nIG did not provide a price forecast but noted that major banks expect gold to trade in the $4,500 to $4,700 per ounce range next year, with potential upside toward $5,000 if macro conditions persist.\n\nMonetary policy could provide additional support. With inflation proving sticky and growth uneven, markets increasingly expect interest rates to drift lower over time.\n\nThat matters for gold, which tends to perform best when real yields fall, and the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets declines.\n\nThere are, of course, risks. A stronger-than-expected rebound in the US dollar or a sustained shift back toward risk-on sentiment could slow gold's advance.\n\nBut investor positioning in gold remains relatively balanced compared with previous peaks, suggesting the trade is not yet overcrowded, Mourad wrote.\n\nThat perspective aligns with forecasts from major banks.\n\n\"We see gold prices hitting more record highs in 2026,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, earlier this month.\n\nFactors that could extend gold's bull run include President Donald Trump's likely choice of a next Fed chair inclined to push for lower interest rates, she wrote.\n\nShe added that gold is likely to find support on pullbacks.\n\n\"We expect the downside to be limited as any weakness will likely attract renewed interest from both retail and institutional buyers,\" Manthey added.\n\nWall Street giant Goldman Sachs predicts that gold prices will climb to $4,900 per ounce by December 2026.\n\nGold's surge this year has contributed to gains in other precious metals as well.\n\nSpot silver prices have also hit record highs this year and are trading about 147% higher year-to-date at around $72 per ounce.\n\nMeanwhile, spot platinum has also hit an all-time high and is up about 159% this year, trading around $2,342 per ounce.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Global investors are increasing their wagers on Chinese artificial intelligence companies, betting on the next DeepSeek and seeking to diversify, with concerns growing about a speculative bubble in the sector on Wall Street.\n\nDemand for China's AI companies is also being stimulated by ​Beijing's push for tech independence. China has fast-tracked blockbuster listings of chipmakers, notably Moore Threads (688795.SS), dubbed \"China's Nvidia\", and MetaX (688802.SS), which both debuted this month.\n\nForeigners see China closing ‌the tech gap with the U.S. as Beijing steps up support for AI chipmakers, spurring bets on Chinese companies just as worries grow over lofty valuations on U.S.-listed AI stocks.\n\nU.K.-based asset manager Ruffer, for example, said it has \"deliberately limited ‌exposure\" to the Magnificent Seven - the U.S. tech giants - and is looking to add positions in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) for a bigger exposure to China's AI theme.\n\n\"While the U.S. remains the leader in frontier AI, China is rapidly narrowing the gap,\" said Gemma Cairns-Smith, Investment Specialist at Ruffer. \"The moat may not be as wide, or as deep, as many think ... The competitive landscape is shifting.\"\n\nRuffer is gaining exposure to the AI theme through Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, which operates an AI chip unit, owns large language model Qwen, and is ploughing money into cloud infrastructure.\n\nGlobal asset managers are increasingly eyeing Chinese AI firms ⁠as a wave of startups lists on the mainland and in ‌Hong Kong, seeking to tap into surging investor appetite following the meteoric rise of DeepSeek, China’s answer to ChatGPT.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management in a report this month rated China tech as \"most attractive\", citing investors' search for geographical diversification and China's \"strong policy backing, technological self-reliance, and rapid ‍AI monetization\".\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) currently trades at 31 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 24 for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech (HSTECH.HK), which enables AI bets via stocks including Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK), Baidu (BIDU, 9888.HK), Tencent (0700.HK, TCEHY) and chip foundry SMIC (0981.HK).\n\nRiding the momentum, U.S. investment adviser Rayliant helped launch a Nasdaq-listed fund in September that gives investors access to \"China's versions of stocks like Google, Meta, Tesla, Apple, and OpenAI\".\n\nKraneShares Chief Investment Officer Brendan Ahern said the ​rapid ascent of Chinese AI chipmakers such as Cambricon speaks to the scale and speed of innovation across China's AI and semiconductor industries.",

    "fullText": "Speaking after Everton’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, Toffees boss David Moyes told the media he believed his team were up against the best midfielder in the world on the night in Declan Rice.\n\n“[Tim Iroegbunam] was up against probably the best midfield player in the world in some ways,” Moyes said. “Declan developed himself, it’s not down to me, Declan was always going to be a great player. Mikel’s made him into a real top player.\n\n“He’s a great boy, more than anything, he’s a terrific boy, and because of that it’ll give him a great chance. [But he’s] a great player as well. Lots of top attributes.”\n\nMoyes and Rice obviously worked together during their respective spells with West Ham United, and the now-Everton boss has never denied how highly he rates the England international.\n\nEven before Saturday’s game, Moyes reiterated that he thinks Rice was worth much more than the £100m plus £5m bonuses that Arsenal paid.\n\n“I genuinely meant it at the time, I thought Declan was £150m,” Moyes said. “I thought we didn’t get enough at West Ham. We had offered Declan huge contracts but we couldn’t get him to stay. So the club had to do what they had to do.\n\n“I’m still in touch with him. I am going to abuse him today maybe!”\n\nRice certainly put in a good performance against Everton, with Alan Shearer even selecting him for his Premier League Team of the Week.\n\nThe midfielder completed 90% of his passes in Arsenal’s 1-0 win, creating two chances including one big chance and making 10 defensive contributions. The midfielder also won seven of his nine individual duels.\n\nAs frustrating as it must have been to come up against his old player on Saturday, Moyes must privately feel proud of his part in Rice’s rise.",

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated.

The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025.

The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "description": "Europe still wants and needs to work with Trump. But this year’s made it clear they’re increasingly on their own.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s first year back in office shattered any remaining illusions among European leaders that he can be managed or controlled.\n\nHis open hostility toward the European Union has strained a transatlantic alliance that’s endured since World War II and deepened rifts between Europe’s national leaders and within the bloc, imperiling its ability to respond to Trump’s threats and taunts with the kind of unity and strength he respects.\n\nThat’s left Ukraine’s fate hanging in the balance heading into 2026, not to mention unanswered existential questions about European security at a moment when many fear Russian President Vladimir Putin’s territorial aims extend further westward beyond Ukraine.\n\nBut in many ways, Europe has survived the roller coaster — for now.\n\n“The Europeans cannot afford to cut ties and to hand in the divorce papers because they are still too dependent, especially when it comes to security and an American military commitment to defending Europe,” said Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBut, she continued, the efforts by leaders to maintain solid ties with the U.S. based on short- term interests do not mean the past year hasn’t clarified that the long-term interests are, for the moment, no longer aligned.\n\n“We need to be pretty clear-eyed,” she said. “In the old days, there was a clear mainstream understanding of the old transatlantic relationship enshrined by the Western values and norms and principles, the rules based international order. And now I think we see a competing project emerging.”\n\nThe administration is clear-eyed, too, heading into the new year.\n\nIt sees a continent losing its values and identity, beholden to liberal ideals that are doing far more to imperil European security than any missive from the White House. The act of a friend, the White House argues — as it pushes Europe to spend more on its own defense, restrict immigration and end the war in Ukraine — is to set it straight.\n\n“President Trump has great relationships with many European leaders, but he never shies away from delivering hard truths,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said. \"The devastating impacts of unchecked migration, and those migrants’ inability to assimilate, are not just a concern for President Trump, but for Europeans themselves, who have increasingly noted immigration as one of their top concerns. These open border policies have led to widespread examples of violence, spikes in crime, and more, with detrimental impacts on the fiscal sustainability of social safety net programs.”\n\nAfter a blistering start to the year with Vice President JD Vance lecturing Europe over free speech in Munich and then tag-teaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alongside Trump in the Oval Office, Europeans have adjusted to Trump’s worldview — a shift, as Romania’s Nicușor Dan described it, from a “moral way of doing things to a very pragmatic and economical way of doing things” — and succeeded at bringing the White House back into the fold on several fronts.\n\nThe EU’s submission on trade, accepting a new tariff of 15 percent, limited the short-term economic damage. NATO appeased Trump with its pledge to boost defense spending by 5 percent over the next decade, cemented at its June summit — thanks largely to allowing existing, non-defense spending to count for 1.5 percent of that new total.\n\nInstead of abandoning Ukraine, Trump agreed in July to provide additional defense aid for its war with Russia as long as Europe pays for it. And Europeans have been able to withstand Trump’s August meeting with Putin in Alaska and the administration’s announcement of a 28-point peace plan crafted in secret with the Kremlin, which they have worked with the U.S. and Ukraine to revise.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO earlier this month, Trump blasted European leaders as “weak,” asserting that they “don’t know what to do” about immigration in particular. He questioned whether European leaders should continue to be allies, saying that “it depends” on their policies and that he wouldn’t hesitate to intervene in European elections to back far-right parties challenging the very coalitions and leaders he’s currently working with.\n\nThat coincided with the issuing of a new National Security Strategy that called for “cultivating resistance” to European centrism that’s committing “civilizational suicide” and expressed disdain for the European Union, which the administration labeled as “adverse” to U.S. economic interests.”\n\nConstanze Stelzenmüller, a senior fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, called the Europe sections of the new NSS a “game changer” for leaders across the Atlantic that has “permanently changed” long-term strategy with the U.S.\n\n“It shouldn't be underestimated how much of a shock it was for European leaders and publics to read the Europe chapter of the National Security Strategy and to see put in writing that this administration thinks of Europe, or European political centrists, as unreliable allies and is taking such an adversarial one against them,” she said. “For 2026, we need to buckle up and plan for the worst on all counts. We have obvious vulnerabilities, and those are going to be exploited.”\n\nTrump is also ending the year by reminding Europe of his brazen desire, outlined in his first term and again shortly before his second inauguration, to seize control of Greenland from Denmark, a reliable NATO ally whose per capita defense spending is among the highest of all member nations. On Saturday, he appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, a job that Landry said would focus on efforts to “make Greenland a part of the U.S.”\n\n“This is shattering for a lot of the countries who thought that there was nothing safer than their bilateral relationship with the United States,” Stelzenmüller said.\n\nWhile openly threatening Denmark, the administration has worked to drive a wedge into the European Union by suggesting that countries would get better trade deals by splitting from the 27-nation bloc and engaging with the White House bilaterally.\n\n“At the end of the year, the fundamental question facing the Europeans is whether they think tactical victories are enough to win the strategic war, which is to maintain the transatlantic alliance that’s stood for eight decades,” said Ivo Daalder, a U.S. ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who earlier this month declared the “Pax Americana” to be dead, seemed open to the possibility, saying last week that it’s become “quite obvious” that Trump “cannot relate” to the EU and that “at least there are individual member states, including Germany first and foremost, of course, with which such cooperation can continue.”\n\nMerz led a failed push in Brussels last week for the EU to repurpose $200 billion in seized Russian assets in a loan to Ukraine when Belgium, Italy and others balked. But he ultimately succeeded with a back-up plan of sorts, as the EU approved a $90 billion loan for Ukraine aimed at sustaining its military on the battlefield for two more years. Three Trump-aligned leaders in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic opted out of the loan but did not block its passage.\n\nWhile Trump quietly opposed the EU effort to shore up Ukraine’s war chest, Europeans have mostly supported his diplomatic efforts to end the war, pushing for stronger security guarantees to ensure Ukraine survives long-term. Finnish President Alexander Stubb appeared Sunday on Fox News to declare that Trump’s efforts have helped advance the talks “closer [to a peace deal] than at any time of this war,” a comment seemingly aimed at the proverbial audience of one and only loosely grounded in what most European leaders actually believe.",

    "description": "When the 1930 tournament was staged in Uruguay, some nations could not afford the trip, players did not take it seriously and fights were common. What has changed since then.",
    "fullText": "Next summer’s World Cup will be the largest, most complex and most lucrative sporting event in history, with 48 teams playing 104 games in three countries. The tournament is expected to draw a global TV audience of nearly 5 billion and FIFA, the event’s organizer, is hoping for revenues of between $10 billion-$14 billion — which is why lower-bowl tickets for Iran-New Zealand at SoFi Stadium cost nearly $700.\n\nAll that seemed unlikely after the first tournament in 1930, when the idea of a soccer World Cup was nearly killed in the cradle, the victim from lack of planning, lack of money and lack of interest. That the competition survived, much less thrived, is nothing short of a miracle, says English writer and podcaster Jonathan Wilson, author of the deeply researched “The Power and Glory: The History of the World Cup.”\n\n“1930, it’s incredibly amateurish in many ways,” Wilson said. “It’s got that sort of almost like a school sports day feel to it.”\n\nOnly 13 countries took part in the first tournament; it was supposed to be 16 but the Egyptian team missed its boat to Uruguay while Japan and Siam (now Thailand) couldn’t afford the travel costs and pulled out. England, meanwhile, not only refused to play, but the British press ignored the event, as did much of Europe.\n\nThat seemed like a wise decision at the time since the first two matches of the inaugural tournament were affected by snow, with one of the opening games drawing just 4,444 fans. The smallest crowd in World Cup history, estimated at about 300, showed up for another first-round game between Romania and Peru and the TV audience … well, there was none since TV had yet to be invented.\n\nThe officiating was beyond suspect — Romania’s manager, Constantin Radulescu, also worked two games as a linesman — and the U.S. trainer, Jack Coll, had to be stretchered off the field during his team’s semifinal — yes, the U.S. made the semifinals! — with Argentina when he lost consciousness after inhaling the fumes from a bottle of chloroform that shattered in his pocket.\n\nIn another game, the penalty spots were mistakenly marked 16 yards from goal instead of the regulation 12 — and nobody noticed.\n\n“Some of the details don’t make sense,” Wilson said. “The whole thing is so sort of low grade compared to today.”\n\nWhen Argentine captain Nolo Ferreira left the tournament and returned home to take his law exams his replacement, Guillermo Stábile, scored a tournament-high eight goals in four games — then never played for the national team again (although he did coach it, leading the La Albiceleste to six South American titles and the 1958 World Cup).\n\nGiven the farcical nature of the 1930 World Cup, the tournament probably should have ended right there. Instead, 1930 has become the foundation on which next year’s competition was built.\n\nThe origins of the tournament, however, actually make sense. Before 1930, FIFA recognized the winner of the Olympic competition as the world champion. But that event was for amateurs, a point on which the International Olympic Committee would not budge.\n\nWith professional soccer growing in popularity, FIFA decided to stage its own breakaway event and play it in Uruguay, the country that had won the last two Olympic titles.\n\nThat quickly proved to be a big mistake. The growing effects of the Great Depression left many countries unable to afford the long, slow steamship trip to South America. The first tournament was open to any country that wanted to play, yet two months before the first game no European teams had agreed to come.\n\n“It was taken very seriously by Uruguay and Argentina,” Wilson said, but not by many others.\n\nThat changed shortly after Romania’s King Carol II, who ascended to the throne in a coup that deposed his son, personally selected his country’s World Cup roster and sent it on its way. France quickly agreed to go too, entering a makeshift team under pressure from FIFA president Jules Rimet, a Frenchman. Belgium also buckled under FIFA pressure and all three teams boarded the same ship for the trip to Uruguay, working out together on the 15-day voyage aboard the SS Conte Verde, an Italian ocean liner.\n\n“Even the four European nations who go it’s not entirely clear how seriously they took it,” Wilson said. “The French and Romanians, they kept diaries. They seem to have regarded this as a laugh. We’ll try to win but it doesn’t really matter.”\n\nThings didn’t really get loony until the tournament began. The Bolivian team, for example, played in berets, as did an Argentine midfielder, while the 15 referees who worked the games, some of whom had traveled and socialized with the players on the long boat ride from Europe, dressed formally in knickers, long-sleeve shirts, blazers and ties.\n\nThe well-dressed officials spent much of the tournament working with police to break up fights; play was so violent at least two players sustained broken legs and the U.S.-Argentina semifinal descended into a full-out brawl, with one American having four teeth knocked out and another hospitalized with injuries to his stomach.\n\nThe tournament finally finished with the hosts beating Argentina 4-2, after which the Argentines broke off diplomatic relations with their neighbor and an angry mob in Buenos Aires stoned the Uruguayan embassy.\n\n“It ended,” Wilson said of the tournament, “with everybody sort of fighting each other.”\n\nFew disagreed with the Argentine magazine El Gráfico, which seemed to predict there was little future for the fledgling event. “The World Cup is over,” it wrote. “The development of this competition brought not only an unpleasant atmosphere, but also an ungrateful one.”\n\nYet nearly a century later, the World Cup is still here. And that, too, was foretold in 1930 in the story of Romanian midfielder Alfred Eisenbeisser (who was also known as Fredi Fieraru because, why not?).\n\nOn the journey home from the first World Cup, Eisenbeisser contracted pneumonia and a priest was called to administer the last rites. The ship eventually docked in Genoa and he was taken to a sanatorium while the rest of the team continued on to Romania.\n\nAssuming her son had perished in Italy, Eisenbeisser’s mother arranged a wake — only to have her son stroll into the ceremony very much alive, causing the woman to faint. Eisenbeisser would play 12 more years of professional soccer and compete in figure skating in the 1936 Winter Olympics, where he finished 13th in the pairs competition.\n\nTurns out the reports of Eisenbeisser’s demise, like those of the World Cup, were greatly exaggerated.\n\n⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

    "description": "Miss Universe 2025 was plagued with controversy from the start. We spoke to over a dozen contestants to learn how the pageant fell apart.",
    "fullText": "The energy in the room couldn't have been more tense. Some women were yelling, telling their new friends to stand up and leave. Others were glued to their seats, crying in red-carpet-worthy gowns. Contestant Andromeda Peters was in the middle of it all.\n\nA licensed therapist since 2017, Peters felt compelled to help. She instructed the women to close their eyes and feel their backs against the chairs, to feel their feet planted firmly to the ground, some in their 6-inch stilettos. Then she began to lead the group through a breathwork exercise: Breathe in for four seconds, hold for four seconds, she said, and now exhale.\n\nIt was the very first day of Miss Universe.\n\n\"We were all distraught,\" Peters, who was Miss Ghana 2025, told Business Insider about her fellow contestants. \"I was going to walk out, but then I realized, there's a girl crying next to me and she's holding my hand. There's a girl behind me crying. So I helped my sisters ground themselves.\"\n\nChaos had erupted among the pageant queens after Miss Universe director Nawat Itsaragrisil yelled at Miss Mexico Fátima Bosch. Their confrontation was captured on livestream, kicking off what would become one of the messiest competitions in the pageant's 74-year history. When Bosch was ultimately named the new Miss Universe on November 21, many contestants wondered if they had ever really stood a chance at the crown.\n\nOver the weeks that followed, contestants that Business Insider spoke with would accuse the organization of grueling conditions, favoritism, inconsistent rules, and an ever-changing judging process. Interviews with more than a dozen contestants reveal how a pageant marketed as a women's empowerment platform had fallen apart as the world watched.\n\nNow, some believe that only a dramatic leadership change can fix Miss Universe.\n\n\"I could give you the pageant answer, or I could just be real: Everyone has to go, absolutely everyone,\" Miss Haiti Melissa Sapini said.\n\nThe Miss Universe Organization did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nAs November neared, 120 women packed their bags and began the journey to Thailand, where they'd spend a month attending events across Bangkok, Phuket, and Pattaya.\n\nFor many contestants, walking the Miss Universe stage was a childhood dream finally coming true. Some were seasoned pageant queens with multiple crowns and sashes glittering on their shelves. Others were first-timers. Miss Bonaire Nicole Peiliker-Visser was inspired to compete after her daughter won Mini Miss Universe, while Miss Hungary Kincső Dezsény was searching for a purpose beyond modeling.\n\n\"If you get beauty from … God, you need to use it for good,\" Dezsény told Business Insider.\n\nWhatever their motivation, the women thought they knew what to expect. The three-week competition would kick off with sponsorship events and media opportunities as they traveled throughout Thailand. Then, contestants would return to the capital to compete in the evening gown, swimsuit, national costume, and interview competitions. A panel of judges would determine the results, though one woman would be able to earn a spot in the top 30 by winning the \"People's Choice\" category in Miss Universe's official fan-voting app.\n\nMeanwhile, trouble was already brewing within the pageant's leadership.\n\nThis year's event was organized by Itsaragrisil, a controversial figure in the pageant world known as \"Papa Nawat.\" The Thai businessman, who took over the Miss Thailand pageant in February, has repeatedly come under fire for shaming beauty queens at Miss Grand International, a separate competition he founded in 2013. The flashy and over-the-top production is built around Itsaragrisil's \"4B Framework:\" beauty, body, brains, and business.\n\nTo kick off the Miss Universe pageant, the Miss Thailand Organization announced it would host a \"special dinner and talk show\" with Itsaragrisil, Miss Universe 2024 Victoria Kjær Theilvig, and a select group of 2025 contestants. This exclusive dinner, which had been a fixture of Miss Grand International, had never been done at Miss Universe. Fan voting would determine the 10 contestants who would be allowed to attend.\n\nThough some Miss Universe contestants promoted the dinner, they weren't all on board. Some women worried that scoring a seat at the table could influence final judging during the actual pageant. Miss Canada Jaime VandenBerg told Business Insider that she didn't \"condone what feels like women being auctioned off for dinner with a man.\"\n\nThe dinner was eventually canceled after Miss Universe called it an \"unauthorized activity.\" The organization's president, Raul Rocha, reiterated in a November 3 letter that only the four traditional categories of competition would be considered in the judging.\n\nA spokesperson for Itsaragrisil told Business Insider that the dinner had been \"a sponsor campaign designed to help contestants express their personalities.\" Following Rocha's letter, the spokesperson said many contestants believed all other activities were optional, and more than 30 contestants refused to participate in sponsorship events.\n\n\"Sponsor-related activities are a necessary and standard component of any international pageant production,\" the spokesperson added. \"Sponsors rightfully expect visibility and engagement in return for their contributions.\"\n\nThe rising tensions came to a head on November 4, the first official day of the pageant, during the confrontation between Itsaragrisil and Bosch. All the pageant queens had been gathered to receive their official Miss Universe sashes, a tradition one contestant compared to the opening ceremony at the Olympics, but the event didn't begin as planned.\n\n\"We're going in excited for this big moment that everyone lives for,\" Peters said. \"This was supposed to be our moment to shine at Miss Universe, and then we're all being yelled at.\"\n\nContestants told Business Insider that Itsaragrisil said he had a list of 20 countries refusing to do sponsorship posts on social media and repeatedly asked the women to \"own up to it\" before he started calling out specific countries.\n\n\"It got to the point where no one even moved because you felt like if you flinched, he would just call you up,\" Sapini said. \"All I'm thinking is, 'Oh my God, please don't say Haiti.'\"\n\nWhen Itsaragrisil turned his attention to Bosch, a heated back-and-forth began. She told the director, \"You are not respecting me as a woman,\" and he called for security to remove her from the room. Bosch walked out instead, with dozens of contestants following behind her.\n\n\"She was shaking,\" VandenBerg said of Bosch. \"She had tears in her eyes. Victoria popped in and said, 'Girls, you don't have to put up with this,' and I was one of the first to walk out.\"\n\n\"I was so shocked and angered by the lack of respect that I just did not want to be in that room anymore,\" said Miss Armenia Peggy Garabekian, who was among the first to leave. \"Then a few of my delegate sisters messaged me and said, 'Peggy, he's not letting us out.'\"\n\nThe women had been seated in alphabetical order for the sashing ceremony, so contestants at the back of the room didn't have a chance to leave before the Miss Universe staff shut the doors.\n\n\"You're at a loss because you're uncertain and trying to stay calm,\" Miss Malaysia Chloe Lim, who was unable to exit the room, said. \"At that moment, we were wondering, 'Is the competition still going to happen?'\"\n\n\"It got me really anxious about the legitimacy of the whole event,\" Miss Hong Kong Lizzie Li said.\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson said staff temporarily closed the door because \"a large number of press and media were gathered directly outside the room, creating a volatile environment.\"\n\nThe online backlash was swift, but it wasn't just directed at Itsaragrisil. Some contestants who didn't leave the room were \"being bullied really badly\" by fans on social media, Peters said.\n\n\"I feel like nobody in the organization did enough; they didn't care about our mental state and what everyone went through,\" Peiliker-Visser, who said she faced online harassment, told Business Insider.\n\nOn the day of the confrontation, Rocha said Itsaragrisil's participation would be limited or eliminated entirely. Yet contestants said he only missed a few events, and Itsaragrisil was quickly and quietly reintroduced.\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson told Business Insider that Rocha's promise to limit the director's presence was never \"operationally realistic.\" The spokesperson added, \"Nawat continued attending activities because he was the only individual with the authority and understanding to ensure the pageant could continue.\"\n\nItsaragrisil tearfully apologized the day after the incident, telling reporters, \"I am human. I didn't want to do anything like that.\"\n\nTurn on a Miss Universe competition, and you'll see the three-hour culmination of a weekslong whirlwind experience. While the sea of shimmering sashes and sparkling gowns may look glamorous, there's a lot of sacrifice off-screen.\n\nFor many women, the pressure of the competition was sky-high. After all, these pageant queens weren't just representing themselves — they were each representing an entire nation. Some women came from countries that had sent them abroad to train with top runway coaches or create couture costumes with the most in-demand designers. Contestants from smaller countries, which typically don't have many sponsors, had paid thousands of dollars out of pocket for their gowns alone.\n\nOnce they arrived in Thailand, contestants had to travel to multiple events each day, sometimes taking flights in the middle of the night before they were expected to participate in various activities, fulfill a daily checklist of social media sponsorship posts, and fight off crowds of passionate bloggers and fans — all while looking picture-perfect.\n\nContestants said they were forbidden from using hairstylists and makeup artists to help them prepare for each day's events, so they would regularly wake up at 3 a.m. to get competition-ready. Some simply slept with their makeup on.\n\nWhen food poisoning or an illness hit, as it frequently did throughout the weeks of competition, many women had to decide whether to rest or miss an important rehearsal. Sometimes, they didn't have a choice. Dezsényi said her bout with food poisoning was so bad that she spent four days in the hospital — but still made it to the final show.\n\nAfter these long days, the women were greeted at the hotel lobby by hordes of fans or pageant bloggers seeking an interview. Contestants told Business Insider that, unlike past Miss Universe competitions, they hadn't been given chaperones to help manage the crowds.\n\n\"They said, 'We're not going to have chaperones because you're grown women,' but at the same time, you're putting us in the public spotlight,\" VandenBerg said. \"To not have security, to me, is kind of crazy.\"\n\nSteve Byrne, the onstage host of this year's competition, told Business Insider that he was shocked by how the Miss Universe Organization treated the women.\n\n\"These girls are cooped up for almost 30 days,\" he said. \"Every day, they have to go to a sponsored dinner. They have to go to this resort and pretend they're having fun at the pool. To me, it seemed everyone was losing sight of what's important here. Is anybody thinking about these women? That's what bothered me.\"\n\nSome contestants enjoyed the action-packed itinerary, which included everything from Muay Thai lessons to gala dinners. Miss India Manika Vishwakarma said she appreciated the \"incredible focus on fan interactions.\"\n\nOthers were dismayed by the daily sponsorship events and noticed a lack of philanthropy in the line-up. Miss Universe's former president, Paula Shugart, told Business Insider that contestants previously participated in an average of three philanthropy events. This year had none.\n\n\"I'm a representative of my country, and you're telling me, 'Hey, hold this dietary protein powder or take photos with this luggage,'\" Garabekian said. \"Throughout the month, we could have been taken to a hospital, orphanage, school, anywhere where we could have helped people in need.\"\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson said the Miss Universe Organization did not request any philanthropy events in Thailand, instead focusing on its digital advocacy platform, \"Beyond the Crown,\" which required contestants to film a video explaining how they used their title to uplift social causes.\n\n\"Sash factor\" is a well-known term in the pageant community, bestowed upon the countries that treat Miss Universe like their own Super Bowl. These fan bases dissect the contestants' every move with the rigor of a fantasy line-up. Their national queen, the star quarterback, is typically rewarded with millions of social media followers.\n\nMiss Universe is designed to be a fair competition, but even the contestants recognize that the playing field isn't exactly equal. Countries with significant \"sash factor\" tend to have more sponsors to cover the costs of the gowns and training, and typically receive far more fan attention outside their country. Contestants said that favoritism was also apparent among this year's official sponsors for the pageant, who were selecting queens from \"sash factor\" countries for more photo shoots and media appearances.\n\n\"They really are looking for women who are popular and have lots of followers,\" said Peiliker-Visser. \"And if you don't, you just don't count.\"\n\nAppealing to sponsors has always been necessary to help fund the pageant, but Shugart said in years past it typically wasn't the main focus of the contestants' activities. This year, though, multiple women said they were brought into a room and asked to explain any missing sponsorship posts for each brand that had partnered with Miss Universe during the competition.\n\n\"I found this extremely unusual and uncomfortable,\" Garabekian said. \"It made me feel more like a tool for sponsorship obligations, rather than someone there to contribute meaningfully.\"\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson said the sponsor checklist was a \"standard operational requirement, not an unusual demand,\" and no contestant was \"forced or penalized\" for a lack of posts.\n\n\"It is important to emphasize: MUO is not a charitable organization,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs the competition progressed, multiple contestants said it became apparent that some women were secretly using makeup artists and hairstylists to get them competition-ready every morning. This hurt morale, particularly among the pageant queens from smaller countries.\n\n\"They scared us so much about the hairstylists and makeup artists, we didn't even try to think about it,\" said Peiliker-Visser. \"But these girls were allowed. I said, 'Oh, they must be special because they're allowed everything.'\"\n\nAfter several contestants complained, a staff member from Miss Universe held a meeting.\n\n\"They said, 'Girls, we understand there's a lot of favoritism, and maybe you're feeling down about it. We just want you to know that it's the sponsors and has nothing to do with the results of Miss Universe. We're looking for small countries with big hearts, too,'\" Sapini said.\n\nContestants said the organization promised to take disciplinary action against those who brought makeup artists and stylists, but women continued to break the rules and still placed in the top 30 or better.\n\nWhile contestants attended events, fans were logging into the Miss Universe app to vote — after watching ads or purchasing votes in bundles — in categories ranging from best skin and evening gown to \"Aura of the Day\" and \"People's Choice.\"\n\nThe \"People's Choice\" winner would automatically earn a spot in the top 30 — a prize that has become popular across various pageant systems in recent years — but contestants told Business Insider they were unsure whether fan votes would impact anything else.\n\nConflicting messages made it worse. Rocha's November 3 statement said contestants were judged only in the four traditional categories — evening, swimsuit, national costume, and interview. Yet the app said votes contributed \"10% to the final score of the top 30 placement.\"\n\nPeiliker-Viser said the Miss Universe Organization told her national director before the competition that fan votes wouldn't count. \"My director was really concerned because we're a population of 26,000 people,\" she added. \"How are they going to measure a small island like Bonaire with other countries?\"\n\nFor Sapini, it was upsetting to watch people in Haiti work hard to vote for her when there was so much ambiguity around their worth.\n\n\"Haiti is a poverty-stricken country, and people in these villages collected their money to send to the Miss Universe Organization because they held onto hope that this would be something good for our country,\" she said. \"But the voting system was all over the place. It made no sense.\"\n\nMiss Universe hurtled toward its final days just as it began — with more confusion.\n\nSpeculation surrounding who was judging this year's competition began circulating online as judges started dropping out. Behind the scenes, contestants said they were just as unsure about who was deciding their fate.\n\nThree days before the November 21 final, composer Omar Harfouch dropped out as a judge, accusing the Miss Universe Organization of carrying out a \"secret vote\" to select the top 30 without the official judging panel. Former soccer star Claude Makélélé exited the same day due to \"unforeseen personal reasons.\"\n\nHarfouch also said Princess Camilla di Borbone delle Due Sicilie resigned that week, but VandenBerg said her exit had been misconstrued and that \"she dropped out so far in advance.\" The princess never publicly explained why.\n\nIn a statement, Miss Universe said Harfouch was confused by its announcement of an eight-person selection committee for the pageant's new \"Beyond the Crown\" program, which they said operated \"entirely independently\" to select a winner that had no bearing on the final results. Contestants told Business Insider it was unclear what the winner of the \"Beyond the Crown\" title would receive.\n\nThat statement added more fuel to the rumors, as pageant fans said on social media that James Irvin Healy, one of the \"Beyond the Crown\" judges, was in a relationship with Miss Paraguay, Yanina Gómez, and began circulating pictures of them together.\n\nGómez, who went on to win \"Beyond the Crown\" and \"People's Choice,\" never publicly addressed the allegations that she was in a relationship with one of the judges, which fans considered a significant conflict of interest. Meanwhile, the Miss Universe Organization removed Healy's picture from its November 17 Instagram post announcing the eight-person panel.\n\nGómez and Healy didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nTo maintain transparency, Miss Universe previously relied on a separate preliminary selection committee, which it'd announce on Instagram, to decide which contestants advanced to the top 30 ahead of the televised finals. No such distinction or announcement was made this year.\n\nSome contestants said they were surprised when they walked into their closed-door interview and saw an eight-person panel that included Theilvig, then-Miss Universe CEO Mario Búcaro — who stepped down on December 12, less than two months after taking over the role — a past Miss Thailand, and some Miss Universe staff members.\n\n\"I've never done a pageant where the staff was judging you,\" said Peters, who has competed since 2014. \"You typically want a panel of judges with different experiences, backgrounds, and opinions.\"\n\nAs confusion swirled around the judges, a terrible accident occurred during the preliminary evening gown competition. Contestants were devastated after Miss Jamaica Gabrielle Henry fell off the stage. She remains hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\n\"I'll be honest, there was a dark cloud hovering over the set the whole time,\" said Byrne, the onstage host. \"I didn't think it could get worse. Then it got worse than worse.\"\n\nThe Miss Universe final began at 8 a.m. local time so that it could air live during the US primetime. Contestants arrived at 1 a.m. for their call time. \"We were making jokes with each other backstage, trying to keep our energy up,\" Peters said. \"It literally felt like we were in survivor mode.\"\n\nThe final two came down to Bosch and Miss Thailand Praveenar Singh. When the host called Miss Mexico's name, he said the stadium filled with boos. It could've been locals rooting for Miss Thailand, passionate supporters of fan favorite Miss Côte d'Ivoire Olivia Yacé — who placed fourth runner-up — or the shock of Bosch winning after her dramatic start to the pageant. Whatever the reason, Byrne said he knew it would be bad for Bosch.\n\n\"I thought, 'Boy, this woman is going to be put through the wringer,\" he said.\n\nAs fans started to doubt the legitimacy of the results online, Miss Universe 2005 Natalie Glebova — who joined the judging panel after Harfouch resigned — posted a picture of Singh, the runner-up, on Instagram with the caption \"My winner!\"\n\nGlebova also noted that, unlike past Miss Universe competitions, there had been no accounting firm to audit the results. \"Until then, I don't think I will be participating as a judge again,\" she added.\n\nIn the hours following the announcement of the winner, questions about the integrity of the judging process intensified. Harfouch said on Instagram that the organization's president, Rocha, had told him to vote for Bosch before he resigned as a judge. Fans also alleged that Bosch's father had done business with one of Rocha's companies, a claim the pageant queen denied.\n\nRocha said one of his companies had a 2023 contract with Pemex, where Bosch's father works, but it was \"impossible\" that there was any connection between that and Bosch's win. Her father added in a November 25 statement that his role at Pemex had nothing to do with awarding contracts and that he'd only met Rocha for the first time at the Miss Mexico 2025 pageant in September.\n\nIn a separate statement, the president told pageant fans that there were \"countless situations\" during the three weeks of Miss Universe that went into deciding the winner, appearing to contradict his previous statement that only the four categories of competition would be used during the judging process.\n\nDuring a November 24 interview on Mexican journalist Adela Micha's news show, Rocha seemed to indicate that one of those factors was the strength of a contestant's passport. He told Micha that a Côte d'Ivoire passport, which requires visas for 175 countries, would have made it difficult for Yacé to travel as Miss Universe if she had won the crown.\n\n\"She's going to be the Miss Universe who spent a whole year in an apartment because of the cost of visa processes, of lawyers,\" he said.\n\nThat same day, Yacé announced that she was resigning as Miss Universe Africa and Oceania — a title she received after placing fourth runner-up — because her values no longer aligned with the organization.\n\nContestants defended Yacé and questioned whether women from smaller countries ever stood a chance. In fact, multiple contestants that Business Insider spoke with said similar comments were made about their own passports during the competition.\n\n\"We need to be valued by our work and what we did onstage, not on the strength of our passport,\" Miss Turks and Caicos Bereniece Dickenson said.\n\nMiss Universe's leadership has weathered several controversies since it changed hands in October 2022. During his interview with Micha, Rocha said he was \"fed up\" with owning Miss Universe and was looking to sell his 50% stake. What he didn't mention was the organization's growing list of legal issues.\n\nThe other half of the organization is owned by JKN Global Group, whose founder, former Miss Universe CEO Anne Jakrajutatip, stepped down in June after the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that she had included false or misleading information in the financial statements. On November 26, the Associated Press reported that a Bangkok court had issued an arrest warrant for Jakrajutatip in an ongoing fraud case. Jakrajutatip hasn't commented.\n\nThat same day, news broke that an arrest warrant had also been issued for Rocha in an investigation involving alleged weapons and drugs trafficking, fuel theft, and organized criminal activity. A Mexican official later said that there was no evidence of organized crime money within Miss Universe. By December 5, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit had frozen Rocha's bank accounts.\n\nAmid the flurry of legal action, Miss Universe addressed rumors that a Thailand-based cryptocurrency company, TCG Social Media Group, had purchased the pageant. In a December 3 statement, the organization said it was aware of TCG's interest but was not in the midst of any sale or negotiation. TCG Social Media Group could not be reached for comment.\n\nSome contestants believe that new leadership would help Miss Universe regain its sparkle.\n\n\"I genuinely hope the Miss Universe Organization focuses on transparency,\" Miss Bulgaria Gaby Guha said. \"Clearer rules, consistent communication, and a visible decision-making process all help build trust, not just for contestants, but for fans who invest their passion into the competition.\"\n\n\"No matter who wins or who owns the pageant, the power is in the dream and what you do with it,\" VandenBerg said. \"You can still believe in the dream, the sisterhood, and the impact Miss Universe has made over decades.\"\n\nFor others, though, the drama at this year's pageant is too much to overcome.\n\n\"This is just despicable behavior to me,\" Sapini, who also competed at Miss USA in 2024, told Business Insider. \"I can't preach to the next generation of girls that this should be your dream.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad I saw what it's like because this world is insane,\" Peiliker-Visser said. \"It's my daughter's dream to go to Miss Universe, but my kids are not doing this.\"",

    "fullText": "I missed Hanukkah, and I'm cutting it close on Christmas, but I've finally got my holiday wish list in order.\n\nI'm not looking for new sneakers or some cool electronics. This year's requests focus on the business world. (Santa Claus is a BI Today subscriber, obviously.)\n\nROI for AI. I'm legally required to start every 2025 recap or 2026 look-ahead by mentioning artificial intelligence. This isn't about bashing or praising AI, though. I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects. I'm not screaming about an AI bubble, but my palms get a little sweaty thinking about the ever-growing tech budgets. So, give us all some relief by showing that these AI tools are going to generate revenue.\n\nA solution to Wall Street's recruiting cycle. The worst thing that could happen to a junior banker is finding out their favorite Murray Hill brunch spot has shut down. The second-worst thing happened this year when big banks fought back against PE's early recruitment of them. The result upended a Wall Street tradition aspiring financiers had spent years preparing for. I was never a fan of the process, but the change left us in a weird no-man's land where none of the rules are apparent.\n\nPrediction markets predict their future. With a string of recent media partnerships, we're going to see a lot more data from prediction markets in 2026. Meanwhile, some state regulators aren't so pleased with their rise. So let's settle the debate. I'd like prediction markets to set a market speculating on their own future. Let the people decide!\n\nNo more media blackouts, please. I can't go through another two weeks of no sports because of carriage disputes. I know how this story ends (the customer paying more), and I also know there's nothing I can do about it. So just rip the bandage off, and let's avoid the grandstanding going forward.\n\nProtein, chill out. No food group is on a hotter run than the muscle-building nutrient. But it's flying too close to the sun. We've got protein in hot cocoa now?? I'm a self-admitted gym bro, and I know my whey around a protein shake (I hate myself for that joke), but even I need to put my foot down. Besides, overconsumption of protein could have a painful conclusion for some of us: kidney stones.\n\nThe New York Knicks to reach the NBA finals. I'm not even asking for a title!\n\nThe New York Jets to play a meaningful game in December. Even Santa has his limits",

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "description": "Telemarketing calls are an unyielding annoyance of the modern world- constantly irritating you and refusing to ever stop, no matter how hard you wish they would.

    "fullText": "Telemarketing calls are an unyielding annoyance of the modern world- constantly irritating you and refusing to ever stop, no matter how hard you wish they would. They'll even call on you birthday, holidays, and everything in between. Although telemarketers are only doing their job, the calls can be more than just a nuisance—they can interrupt your daily life and breach your privacy.\n\nTelemarketing has existed since the 1950s, proving that telemarketers have perfected the art of being disruptive and persistent enough to make a sale. Ignoring them isn't always the most effective solution; you will still see and hear your phone ringing. Be kind, even as you try to filter the calls aimed at getting a sale from you; there's usually a real human on the other end of the line who's just trying to make a living.\n\nFortunately for you, there are several effective strategies you can take advantage of to minimize these intrusive interruptions. Here are 12 ways to get rid of pesky telemarketers and reclaim your peace of mind.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to reduce telemarketing calls is to request that they stop calling directly. When you receive a call, inform the telemarketer that you do not wish to receive further calls from their company. According to FTC regulations, legitimate telemarketing companies are required to honor such requests.\n\nWhile this method may not eliminate all calls, it can significantly reduce the amount you receive from specific companies. It’s a straightforward approach that can provide immediate relief, especially from the most persistent callers.\n\nMany telemarketers use anonymous or withheld numbers to bypass your phone's caller ID feature. By blocking anonymous callers, you can prevent them from reaching you in the first place. Most modern smartphones have built-in features or settings that allow you to block calls from unknown or private numbers.\n\nThis method is particularly effective because it stops the calls before they even ring on your end. However, some legitimate callers such as doctors or businesses might also use anonymous numbers, so weigh the pros and cons before enabling this feature.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers a National Do Not Call Registry where you can list your phone number to opt out of telemarketing calls. This free service is available to all consumers in the United States and can significantly reduce the number of unsolicited calls you receive.\n\nTo register, visit the FTC’s website and follow the instructions. Once your number is listed, it can take up to 31 days for telemarketers to register and update their records without your number.\n\nIf you are registered with the Do Not Call List and still receive telemarketing calls, it is important to report these numbers to the FTC. Reporting helps the commission track down violators and potentially take action against them.\n\nYou can file a complaint on the FTC’s website, providing details about the call and the number that contacted you. This helps protect you and aids in the broader effort to crack down on illegal telemarketing practices.\n\nMost smartphones and phone carriers offer features that allow you to block specific numbers. You can add that number to your block list whenever you receive an unwanted call. Over time, this can build up a robust defense against repeat offenders.\n\nWhile this approach requires some effort and diligence, it can effectively reduce the frequency of calls from persistent telemarketers. Remember, consistency pays off, and your block list will eventually prevent many unwanted calls.\n\nMany phone carriers offer call screening services to help identify and block telemarketing calls before reaching you. These services often include features such as automatic spam detection, caller ID, and call blocking based on known spam databases.\n\nContact your carrier to learn more about the call screening options that are available to you. Incorporating these services can add an extra layer of protection, saving you time and frustration.\n\nNumerous apps specialize in blocking spam and telemarketing calls. Apps like Truecaller use advanced algorithms and community reports to identify and block unwanted calls.\n\nInstalling one or more of these apps can provide real-time protection and updates, adapting to new telemarketing tactics and numbers as they arise. These apps often come with additional features like identifying unknown callers and managing your block list more efficiently.\n\nWhen you realize you’re on the line with a telemarketer, don’t waste time engaging—simply hang up immediately. Many telemarketers rely on your engagement to keep you on the call and potentially gather more information from you.\n\nIf you’re in a playful mood and want to have a bit of fun at the telemarketer’s expense, hand the phone over to your kids. Letting children engage with the caller can quickly discourage them from continuing the conversation.\n\nWhile this may not be a conventional method, it’s a lighthearted way to deal with an otherwise frustrating situation. Plus, it can provide a few moments of amusement for both you and your children.\n\nAnother tactic is to answer the call but remain silent. Many telemarketing systems use automated dialing and rely on voice recognition to determine if someone has answered. By staying silent, you can confuse the system and cause the call to disconnect.\n\nOver time, this method can reduce the number of calls you receive from automated systems, as they may flag your number as unresponsive. It’s a passive yet effective way to handle unwanted calls.\n\nOne proactive approach to preventing telemarketing calls is to be cautious about sharing your phone number. Only provide your number to trusted sources and consider using alternatives like email for less essential communications.\n\nBe wary of entering your phone number on websites, online forms, or when signing up for services. Reducing the number of people and entities that have your phone number can decrease the likelihood of it ending up on telemarketers' call lists.\n\nA virtual phone number is another strategy for keeping your primary phone number private. You can use a virtual number for online registrations, business interactions, or subscriptions, and redirect any calls to your main line or screen them separately.\n\nMany services offer virtual phone numbers for a small fee. This way, your primary number remains private while the virtual number can handle potential telemarketing calls. If the virtual number receives too many unwanted calls, you can easily change or dispose of it without affecting your primary contact number.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is reportedly a strong admirer of a ‘utility’ England international who can become a leader.\n\nI’d say that Chelsea still lack some leaders and maturity in their squad, despite some of them finally stepping up a bit now in that department as they get that little bit older.\n\nSo when I see a report of Chelsea potentially adding a ‘leader’ type player to the squad then it will always catch my attenion.\n\nAnd also, Elliot Anderson is one of the best midfielders around right now on current form, and when you are thinking about a player who can literally do it all, he is your guy.\n\nI rate Anderson highly, and Chelsea have now been linked with him a few times recently, but then so is pretty much every big club around. He has become a hugely sought after talent.\n\nElliot Anderson in action for Nottingham Forest.(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nCaught Offside put out a report around Chelsea’s interest in signing new midfielders, and Anderson was mentioned.\n\nThe report says Maresca is a strong admirer of the Nottingham Forest midfielder, valuing his versatility and ability to become the leader of the midfield.\n\nAnderson’s ability to play multiple roles across midfield makes him an appealing “utility” option.\n\nLet’s see if anything comes of that then.\n\nCheck in on our full match report from Chelsea’s 2-2 draw away at Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon where it is safe to say this was very much a game of two halves that could have gone either way come the end.\n\nMeanwhile, it looks like Nicolas Jackson will not be signed permanently by Bayern Munich in the summer but there are a host of other clubs lining up to sign him, as he will not be staying at Chelsea.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"  “They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.  According to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"\n\n“They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nAccording to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.\n\nThe announcement comes just a month after the Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says will be aboard the new ship.\n\nThe Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021.\n\nLaser technology has seen more success in making its way onto Navy ships in recent years, but its employment is still limited. One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development.\n\nDeveloping nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships may also violate non-proliferation treaties that the U.S. has signed with Russia.\n\nA U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, told The Associated Press that design efforts are now underway for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s.\n\nBoth Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.\n\nThis type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons. But after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nAccording to a newly created website for the “Golden Fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships but only weigh about half as much, around 35,000 tons, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors.\n\nIts primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy’s fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy’s newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy’s destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump \"has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o’clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n“I looked at it, I said, ‘That’s a terrible-looking ship, let’s make it beautiful,’” Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I’m a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.\n\nPhelan said the new USS Defiant “will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.\"",

    "description": "Americans won’t be able to buy new models from DJI, the Chinese maker of most of the world’s drones. But U.S. pilots can keep the drones they have.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Monday that all foreign-made drones and their components posed “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States” and would be put on a federal blacklist of equipment makers prohibited from selling their goods freely in the country.\n\nA fact sheet released by the Federal Communications Commission left some room for exceptions. The Pentagon or the Department of Homeland Security can clear a drone or component for use. But it heralded a new reality that American drone pilots have been dreading for months: New models produced by DJI, the Chinese manufacturer that makes most of the world’s drones, will no longer be sold in the United States. The statement did not mention DJI by name.\n\n“The F.C.C. will work closely with U.S. drone makers to unleash American drone dominance,” Brendan Carr, the commission’s chairman, said in a statement.\n\nMany of the nearly half a million registered drone pilots in the United States have built small businesses with DJI equipment. The drones perform a variety of jobs, such as spraying farmers’ fields with fertilizer, surveying land, monitoring construction projects and inspecting roofs and utility lines.\n\n“People are pissed — incredibly, incredibly pissed — about the whole thing,” said Vic Moss, the volunteer director of the Drone Advocacy Alliance, which represents pilots who want to continue to buy DJI drones.\n\nOne reason the administration did not try to ban the use of drones that Americans already possess, he said, was that doing so would impede emergency workers. Law enforcement agencies across the country use fleets of DJI drones to track down fleeing suspects, lost hikers and the bodies of children who have washed away in floods.\n\nThe seeds of the decision were planted in Congress a year ago, when the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a determination by Dec. 23, 2025, about whether video surveillance equipment produced by DJI or Autel Robotics, another Chinese manufacturer, posed a security threat. The language came from a bill written by Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, who vowed to “ensure Chinese drones are banned from American skies.”\n\nMany in the drone industry expected a comprehensive examination of the technology to see if DJI drones contained secret back doors that shared information with entities in China. Instead, the decision appears to have been based on a simple review of what government agencies already knew.\n\nFor months, DJI has written letters to U.S. officials asking for a rigorous audit.\n\n“We stand ready to work with you, to be open and transparent, and provide you with the necessary information to complete a thorough review,” Adam Welsh, head of global policy for DJI, wrote in a letter this month to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others.\n\nThe decision, while not unexpected, deeply disappointed drone pilots around the country, most of whom own and operate DJI equipment.\n\nDaCoda Bartels, chief operating officer of FlyGuys, a company that connects commercial drone pilots with freelance work around the country, said he owned the first DJI drone — the Phantom V-1 — and every updated version since then. Now, he faces the prospect of being cut off from the improvements that the company releases each year.\n\n“DJI as a company will still be innovating and offering their products in other countries,” Mr. Bartels said. “We just won’t have access to them. That’s unfortunate.”\n\nAmerican-made versions are four times as expensive, he said, and “half as good.”\n\nBut the announcement was cause for celebration for the fledgling American drone companies that pushed for such an opening.\n\n“This was a historic decision that will change everything for U.S. drone manufacturers,” said a statement from BRINC, a Seattle-based manufacturer that makes drones for public safety. “BRINC and our peer companies are ready to meet the call for service to rebuild the American drone industry.”\n\nAnother company that hopes to fill the void left by DJI is Skydio, a U.S. drone company that hired Joe Bartlett, Ms. Stefanik’s former national security adviser, as its director of federal policy. Mr. Bartlett is now the deputy under secretary in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which played a role in determining DJI’s fate. Skydio declined to comment.\n\nUnusual Machines, a Florida manufacturer of drone components, also stands to benefit from the decision. In a statement to The New York Times on Monday, its chief executive, Allan Evans, said the decision meant domestic manufacturers “have both an opportunity and a responsibility to build and deliver world-class products as quickly as possible.” Donald Trump Jr. sits on his advisory board.\n\nThe F.C.C. statement made clear that the decision does not affect drone pilots’ ability to fly the drones they already have or previously approved models.\n\n“There will be a window for American companies to catch up,” Mr. Bartels said. “I sure hope that they do.”",

    "description": "Once worth millions, these abandoned mansions and castles around the world fell into ruin after fires, wars, and financial collapse.",
    "fullText": "When they were built, these lavish homes bore ornate examples of their owners' wealth, from towering turrets to marble archways.\n\nEach of these properties — once worth millions — has faced misfortune, such as the financial ruin of their owners or failed preservation efforts.\n\nWhile some have been restored to resemble their former glory or have opened to visitors, others have been deemed too dangerous to visit and too costly to repair.\n\nHere are eight abandoned mansions around the world — and what happened to them.\n\nKatie Warren, Libertina Brandt, and Taylor Ardrey contributed to earlier versions of this story.\n\nBuilt in 1912 by railroad magnate James H. Dooley, the Swannanoa mansion in Lyndhurst, Virginia, is an Italian Renaissance-style villa overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nDooley built the mansion as a summer house for his wife. The villa was converted into a country club for a few years after the couple's deaths, but it was abandoned by 1932 as the Great Depression reached its peak, per the mansion's website.\n\nThe mansion was purchased by a couple and converted into a museum while they resided there. Since their deaths in 1988, the mansion has sat vacant.\n\nToday, the mansion is a local attraction and wedding venue, offering public tours once a month from May to November.\n\nLocal residents have raised concerns over the conditions of the estate, local News Leader newspaper reported in 2015. In 2024, Andy Florance, CEO of CoStar, purchased the nearby Swannanoa Golf and Country Club, with plans for preservation.\n\nThe Cambusnethan House in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, is one of the last remaining Gothic mansions in Scotland.\n\nBuilt in 1819, the mansion belonged to the Lockhart family of Castlehill and was built to replace an early 17th-century house that burned down in 1810, per Scotland's Buildings at Risk Register.\n\nIn the 1970s, the house was used for mock medieval banquets, but it was further damaged by fire in the 1980s.\n\nA group called \"Friends of Cambusnethan Priory\" was established in 2014 to try to save the building, which is categorized at a \"critical\" risk level by Scotland's Buildings at Risk Register, from any further deterioration.\n\nLynnewood Hall, a 110-room, century-old Gilded Age mansion located just outside Philadelphia, was designed by Horace Trumbauer in the late 1890s.\n\nWhen he built the mansion, industrialist Peter A. B. Widener intended to reside there alongside his two sons and their families.\n\nHowever, his son George Dunton Widener, alongside his wife, Eleanor Elkins, and their son, Harry, were passengers on the Titanic when it sank. Only Eleanor survived.\n\nThe mansion was inherited by Peter's surviving son, Joseph, who died in 1943. Various owners acquired the property after that, including the First Korean Church of New York, which listed the property for sale in 2014.\n\nThe mansion remained vacant for years after.\n\nThe mansion, which cost about $325 million in today's currency when it was built in 1897, was documented as being in a dilapidated state, and repairs were estimated to cost up to $40 million in 2012.\n\nIn June 2023, the mansion was purchased for $9 million (or about $9.6 million in 2025 currency, adjusted for inflation) by the Lynnewood Hall Preservation Foundation, which aims to restore it to its former glory.\n\nPidhirtsi Castle in the Lviv region of Ukraine was built as a leisure home for a high-ranking Polish military commander between 1635 and 1640 by Italian architect Andrea dell'Aqua, per the World Monuments Fund.\n\nThe mansion prospered for years, but in the 19th century, new owners took over and neglected the castle, so that by the end of World War II, it had significantly deteriorated.\n\nPidhirtsi Castle has been damaged by fire and flooding over the years.\n\nPreservation efforts have enabled the restoration of part of the mansion, which has also hosted events such as exhibitions and concerts in recent years.\n\nThe McNeal mansion, situated along the Delaware River in New Jersey, was constructed by industrialist Andrew McNeal in 1890, following his establishment of a pipe plant and foundry.\n\nUS Pipe bought the property in 1899 and used it as its headquarters until 1953. In the subsequent decades, it was abandoned.\n\nToday, the mansion is collapsing in on itself, posing a danger to the urban explorers who visit.\n\nThe Villa de Vecchi, known as the \"Ghost Mansion\" of Italy, was built between 1854 and 1857. It was meant to be the summer home of a Count named Felix De Vecchi, who was head of the Italian National Guard. The home had all the modern amenities of the time, including indoor heating pipes and a large pressurized fountain.\n\nA 2002 landslide destroyed nearby homes, but the once-lavish and now-battered \"Ghost Mansion\" remained standing.\n\nSitting just outside Camdenton, Missouri, the ruins of Ha Ha Tonka resemble an ancient European castle. The mansion was built by Kansas City businessman Robert Snyder at the turn of the century.\n\nSnyder started building in 1905, but he never saw the house finished as he died in a car crash the following year. His sons took over the construction and lived there until the family ran out of money due to the several lawsuits surrounding the castle's property.\n\nIn 1942, parts of the castle burned down and sat abandoned until the state of Missouri bought the property for use as a state park in 1978.\n\nBuilt by Scottish entrepreneur Francis Bannerman VI in 1901, the Bannerman Castle sits on Pollepel Island in New York's Hudson River.\n\nRather than living in the castle, Bannerman used it as storage for his business's military weapons arsenal.\n\nAfter the powder house exploded in 1920, the upkeep of the castle dwindled. It was eventually acquired by the Hudson Highlands State Park Reserve.\n\nIn 1992, the Bannerman Castle Trust was established to repair the ruins. Since then, it has raised over $1 million to refurbish the castle, which is now open to the public for tours.\n\nDuring her 2019 visit, Business Insider's Joey Hadden said visitors were told to stay at least 100 feet away from the castle due to its deterioration. Still, it was worth the visit.\n\n\"The combination of medieval architecture and overgrown trees and foliage makes Bannerman Castle a sight worth visiting up close,\" she wrote.",

    "fullText": "BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia will use drones to resume spraying of coca crops with a weed killer, the government announced on Monday as authorities grapple with record levels of cocaine production that have fueled tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nThe South American country banned aerial fumigation of coca crops in 2015, after the World Health Organization put glyphosate — the weed killer used by spray planes — on a list of carcinogens.\n\nJustice Minister Andrés Idárraga told a news conference that the new action involving high-tech drones was approved by the government and would begin on Thursday.\n\nHe said the drones would be sent to areas where gangs and rebel groups are forcing peasants to grow coca, the primary source of cocaine. “Our security forces will be safer” that way, Idárraga added.\n\nEnvironmental activists had long warned that small airplanes spraying coca fields — often flown by U.S. contractors — were also dumping their chemicals on legal crops and into streams, polluting vulnerable ecosystems and exposing villagers to contaminated water.\n\nAfter suspending aerial fumigation, Colombia stepped up manual eradication campaigns, carried out by soldiers.\n\nBut the cultivation of coca expanded without aerial spraying as it became harder for the military to eradicate coca crops in remote areas, where plantations are defended by drug gangs and rebel groups, and are sometimes surrounded by land mines.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2024, as much as 261,000 hectares (about 645,000 acres) in Colombia were planted with coca, almost double what was planted in 2016.\n\nAccording to Idárraga, the drones will fly no further than 1.5 meters (5 feet) from their targets to ensure that water sources and legal crops are not sprayed. A single drone will be able to eradicate about a hectare of coca crops every 30 minutes.\n\n“This is a controlled and efficient” way, Idárraga said, adding that \"it mitigates environmental risks.”\n\nThe idea of using drones to eradicate coca fields was first floated in 2018 by right-wing President Ivan Duque's administration. But plans were delayed due to the lack of a consensus in government agencies and in Colombia's parliament\n\nColombia’s current government, led by left-wing President Gustavo Petro, initially dismissed aerial fumigation and other forced eradication campaigns, saying it didn't want to target impoverished peasants growing coca for drug dealers because they lacked legal alternatives.\n\nPetro's administration became more aggressive on the issue of coca crops this year as it tries to defeat rebel groups funded by the illegal drug trade that have refused to sign peace agreements with the government and that have recently stepped up attacks in Colombian cities.\n\nThe United States has long criticized Colombia’s decision to halt the aerial fumigations. The Trump administration, which has accused Petro’s government of not doing enough to halt cocaine production, added Colombia in September to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, jeopardizing millions of dollars in military and economic cooperation.\n\nIn October, the U.S. also imposed sanctions on Petro, accusing him of allowing “drug cartels to flourish” in the country. More recently, Washington threatened to authorize land strikes against drug traffickers in Colombia.\n\nPetro has vehemently denied the U.S. accusations of not doing enough to target drug traffickers and says Colombian security forces are intercepting record numbers of cocaine shipments, even if the nation is also producing record amounts of the drug.",

    "title": "Hoosier Hysteria, Wildcat Wavering: How Indiana’s rise the top serves as a blueprint for Northwestern football",
    "description": "It might feel like the ‘Cats are worlds away from the top of the CFB world, but Indiana is concrete proof otherwise.",
    "fullText": "If you told a college football fan three seasons ago that powerhouse Indiana, the No. 1 team in the country and sole undefeated team left would be taking under underdog Alabama in the 12-team College Football Playoff, they might pass out.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Hoosiers were on the heels of a hard-to-watch 3-9 season and with little hope for the future of their football team. IU was historically one of the worst high-major programs in the entire sport, and had experienced losing seasons in eight of the previous ten seasons to that point.\n\nAs head coach Tom Allen’s tenure was coming to an unsavory close, the program simply wasn’t going anywhere exciting. But, hey: Indiana is a basketball school anyways, right? Who cares if the football team isn’t all that good?\n\nA little-known head coach who had been working his way up for decades through the ranks of the football world finally got to the highest stage of the sport — even if it was for one of the most laughable programs in the nation. After his impressive success with FBS newbie James Madison, he was hand-plucked over to Bloomington, Ind., in a cautiously hopeful attempt to get Indiana back into the Top 25 again, perhaps.\n\nCig had higher hopes than that, though. Just days after being officially hired, he went on Big Ten Network’s preview of the 2023 B1G Championship and precariously claimed that his Hoosiers would be in that very game in one year’s time. Everyone laughed it off, but Cignetti got his conference title game and more, winning the Big Ten and competing for a national title.\n\nCurt Cignetti just told us that Indiana will be playing in the Big Ten championship game next year 👀 https://t.co/woobXFgYjK\n\n— Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) December 1, 2023\n\nAnd as the Hoosiers reached a historic 11-0 with a 31-7 win over Wisconsin, they absolved themselves of a moniker that had kept them in the cellar of the college football world up until that point. No longer was Indiana the losingest team in the country.\n\nAlongside fellow Big Ten foe Indiana, the Wildcats’ football program has had its fair share of tough times. Northwestern hasn’t cracked the Top 25 since its miraculous 6-1 season in 2020. Although it hasn’t been quite as hopeless as IU once was, with Friday’s matchup versus Central Michigan marking its sixth bowl appearance in the last 10 years, NU has remained locked out of the upper echelon of the ferocious Big Ten.\n\nBut if Indiana is any model for the ‘Cats, there is a path to be followed. And with David Braun looking like a potential coach of the future after leading his teams to two bowl games in his first three years in Evanston, he could be the man to lead that charge.\n\nWell, firstly, there’s the culture aspect. Since his arrival at Indiana, Cignetti’s operation has been directed by a singular phrase: “Google me.” Wherever he’s gone, he has won. And he knows it.\n\n“It’s pretty simple, I win. Google me.”\n\nAging as one of the best quotes ever from Curt Cignetti? \n\n pic.twitter.com/oFFD9CpRb1\n\n— John Kurkjian (@JohnKurkjian_) December 7, 2025\n\nThat quiet confidence and assurance has been embodied not just by the coach himself, but has trickled down onto the play of his team on and off the field. Despite being disrespected by other teams, fanbases and media outlets as a “fraudulent” team that couldn’t really win big games, Cignetti and Indiana have done everything possible to disprove that. They currently sit at 13-0, the only undefeated team left in the FBS, and already have marquee wins over No. 5 Oregon and No. 2 Ohio State.\n\nNorthwestern currently sits in a very similar position. The ‘Cats are rarely given a seat at the table in discussions for contenders in the conference or the country, and any wins over those in that upper level of the 18-team conference are seen as “complete failures” on their end, rather than an impressive win for Northwestern. Changing that starts with building a culture that blocks out that noise and aims for the top, even if it seems unlikely. And Braun has already begun to express that sentiment.\n\n“None of us want to hear, ‘Hey, good effort guys,’” Braun said postgame following a heartbreaking 24-22 loss to then-No. 18 Michigan back in November. “This program isn’t like, ‘Hey, we’re gonna give it out best and see what happens.’ The expectation is to go win a Big Ten Championship.”\n\nThe next obvious question is then: well, how do you actually get there? A strong fighter’s mentality can go a long way, no doubt, but talent will always prevail in one way or another. Northwestern won’t just suddenly be competing with IU, Oregon and Ohio State by “wanting it more.”\n\nFor Indiana, the key has lied in development. Cignetti might be in just his second year with the program, but he has done a heck of a job getting the most of the guys he’s got; and more importantly, retaining the talent which he develops. Take Elijah Sarratt, for example. Two years ago, Cignetti brought the wide receiver over from JMU, and has since turned him into a No. 1 option and one of the pass-catchers in the country.\n\nIndiana has yet to compete with the “big boys” in the high school recruiting battle. It isn’t getting top-10 classes littered with five-star recruits year in and year out as the Buckeyes and Ducks do; instead, Cignetti has managed to find the hidden gems and bring them to a stage where they can shine brightest. Fernando Mendoza might be the poster boy for that — coming from 6-6 Cal, he took off from the get-go this season, playing himself into a Heisman Trophy and potentially the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nFor Northwestern’s purposes, that talent development is easier said than done. Firstly, Braun is going to need to do a great job of recruiting in the Midwest and lure recruits in with a culture and coaching staff that they’ll want to truly play for. And when that talent eventually rises, NU will need to be a program that successfully keeps its stars, rather than becoming nothing more than a jumping-off point to get to a higher-profile program.\n\nOf course, talent development and culture can only take you so far. After all, we’re in the NIL era. Luckily for Cignetti and Co., donors at IU took notice of his early success and promised significant contributions to the program to help support and sustain long-term success. Their financial commitment to the program was enough to convince Cignetti to ink an eight-year extension with the school when he would have otherwise been the most highly-coveted name in the coaching market.\n\nThat same NIL money hasn’t been so easy to come by for Northwestern. We’d all love to say that money isn’t everything and sports and that success and wins can still be found through hard work and great coaching. But the reality of this new era is that money talks; and Northwestern is going to need to listen. Getting investment from potential donors and building a true backing for the program will go a long way in getting it to truly compete. Time will tell, but the new Ryan Field, an estimated $850 million project set to be completed by next fall, could do a lot to make that vision a reality.\n\nUltimately, Cignetti is a great success story, not just for sports but for the world. An overlooked coach never truly given the mass respect that his resume had shown he deserved, he has ascended the heights he knew he was capable of once given the chance.\n\nCignetti could have easily folded under the decades upon decades of disappointment from the program he took over. He could have let all those who negated his early achievements in Bloomington get to his head and struggle to focus on what really matters — winning. And he could have jumped at the first opportunity to use IU as a springboard for an even better coaching job, where he might make more money or garner more fame. Instead, he chose to stick to his guns.\n\nIndiana and Northwestern both remain two of the most historically overlooked programs in the sport. Both are quick to become the laughingstock when they struggle, and have had tremendous trouble garnering respect from the public when they do legitimately succeed because of the logo on their helmets. But Cignetti and IU aren’t letting that get to them; they’re controlling their own narrative and winning in the same way they always have. For Braun and Northwestern, that’s truly the next step in becoming a real contender.",

    "description": "Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft AI's CEO, has described using AI for guidance on life decisions as \"something that the world needs.\"",
    "fullText": "The CEO of Microsoft AI says chatbots are a good way to offload emotions and \"detoxify ourselves.\"\n\nAppearing on an episode of Mayim Bialik's \"Breakdown\" podcast, which was released on December 16, Mustafa Suleyman said companionship and support have become some of AI's most popular use cases.\n\nPeople are using AI chatbots for everything from navigating breakups to solving disagreements with family members, he said.\n\n\"That's not therapy,\" Suleyman said. \"But because these models were designed to be nonjudgmental, nondirectional, and with nonviolent communication as their primary method, which is to be even-handed, have reflective listening, to be empathetic, to be respectful, it turned out to be something that the world needs.\"\n\nThe upside of this, he said, is \"this is a way to spread kindness and love and to detoxify ourselves so that we can show up in the best way that we possible can in the real world, with the humans that we love.\"\n\nSuleyman cofounded DeepMind in 2010. The company was acquired by Google in 2014.\n\nOn the podcast, he said people need a space to \"ask a stupid question, repeatedly, in a private way, without feeling embarrassed.\"\n\nOver time, he said, chatbots can make people \"feel seen and understood\" in a way that many other humans can't, outside of partners or close friends.\n\nNot everyone in tech, however, is enthusiastic about chatbots being used as therapy stand-ins. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is one of those voices. In August 2025, he expressed his discomfort over people relying on chatbots to make major life choices.\n\n\"I can imagine a future where a lot of people really trust ChatGPT's advice for their most important decisions,\" Altman wrote on X. \"Although that could be great, it makes me uneasy.\"\n\nIn July 2025, while appearing on \"This Past Weekend with Theo Von,\" Altman also flagged the potential legal risks of offloading onto a robot. He said that OpenAI may be required to produce its users' therapy-style chats in a lawsuit.\n\nMental health professionals have voiced concerns over the rise of ChatGPT therapy, too. Speaking to Business Insider senior health reporter Julia Pugachevsky in March 2025, two therapists said that relying on AI chatbots for emotional support could exacerbate loneliness and make people dependent on seeking reassurance.\n\nSuleyman acknowledged some of those downsides on the podcast, saying there is \"definitely a dependency risk,\" and that chatbots can sometimes be overly flattering or \"sycophantic.\"\n\nSuleyman is not the sole tech voice who sees AI's therapeutic potential. In a May 2025 interview with the Stratechery newsletter, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he believed everyone should have a therapist.\n\n\"For people who don't have a person who's a therapist,\" Zuckerberg said, \"I think everyone will have an AI.\"",

    "description": "At 8-6, the Colts are on the outside looking in at the playoff picture, but 44-year-old Philip Rivers coming in off the couch is one of the great stories of this NFL season.",
    "fullText": "Just think, for a moment, how you’d look in a pair of form-fitting football pants and a tight-around-the-belly jersey. Would you look like a honed specimen of humanity, lean and taut and ready to explode? Or would you look like 10 pounds of sausage in a five-pound casing, busting the seams?\n\nIf you’re being honest, you, me, and pretty much everyone both of us knows would look a whole lot more like a sausage than a specimen. A whole lot like Philip Rivers does, honestly.\n\nBut the difference between Philip Rivers and us, of course, is that we aren’t starting at quarterback on Monday Night Football.\n\nRivers and the briefly-mighty, now-floundering Indianapolis Colts take on the San Francisco 49ers in a matchup that, from a sheer talent standpoint, looked a whole lot more attractive back in September than it does now. Ball-knowers will scoff at Rivers and wonder who in the world would want to watch a 44-year-old grandfather run around for three hours.\n\nTo which I would say: Everyone. Everyone would love to see that. Because what Rivers is doing is both awesome and ridiculous.\n\nIn any other career, Rivers would be hitting his prime at age 44, old enough to have learned the ropes but young enough to have the energy and desire to do more. In sports, though, he’s impossibly ancient, a relic who could burst into a pile of dust with one good sack. Hopefully he won’t, but that’s the line on most aged pro athletes.\n\nPlayers like Tom Brady and LeBron James have redefined the possible parameters of a late-career athlete, but then again, Tom Brady and LeBron James are arguably the GOATs of their respective sports. They played for such a high level for so long that their age-related decline merely brought them down to star level.\n\nRivers wasn’t ever in that stratosphere, though he had a few years in the mid-2000s — you know, about two decades ago — when he garnered some Pro Bowl nods and MVP votes. He ran with all the speed of the changing seasons, yes, but he also possessed two valuable attributes — an orbital-launch arm and a surpassing knowledge of potential defensive schemes.\n\nThat’s how he was able to come back and mesh with the Colts so quickly last week against Seattle. He played within himself, tossing a nifty 18 of 27 completions for 160 yards, with a long of just 17 yards. He had an adjusted yards gained per pass attempt of 3.52 — quite the falloff from the 8- to 9-yard average of his best days. Against San Francisco, he could fare even better; the 49ers trail Seattle in every major defensive category.\n\nBut stats are for nerds. What Grandpa Rivers did last week was ball, plain and simple. And now he’s getting a chance to take Indy on a last-ditch playoff run? Come on, how can you not love this?\n\nAt 8-6, Indianapolis sits in the dreaded first-team-out spot, well behind 10-5 division rival Houston for the final spot in the AFC playoffs. After this week, the Colts have games against the Texans and Jaguars, both teams they’re staring up at in the playoff bracket. The Athletic gives Indianapolis just a 3 percent chance of making the playoffs, which is a rough prognosis given the Colts’ 7-1 start to 2025.\n\nThat’s tough news for the franchise and the city, but on a micro level, a great story is unfolding. Rivers is the embodiment of every former football player — whether high school, college or just two-hand touch Turkey Bowl — who would love to get one more turn in the arena, one more play with the ball in their hands, one more chance to rear back and throw it deep. He’s living the dream that if you keep in shape, if you keep your edge — if not your waistline — then maybe, just maybe, they’ll call your number one more time. Father Time is undefeated, yes, but you can always move the ball against him if you want it badly enough.\n\nRivers’ return is a hell of a story, however it ends. But it’d be nice if he went out with at least one more victory. Why not a prime-time one?",

    "fullText": "annas-archive.li/blog, 2025-12-20, Discuss on Hacker News\n\nWe backed up Spotify (metadata and music files). It’s distributed in bulk torrents (~300TB), grouped by popularity.\n\nThis release includes the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks and 186 million unique ISRCs.\n\nIt’s the world’s first “preservation archive” for music which is fully open (meaning it can easily be mirrored by anyone with enough disk space), with 86 million music files, representing around 99.6% of listens.\n\nAnna’s Archive normally focuses on text (e.g. books and papers). We explained in “The critical window of shadow libraries” that we do this because text has the highest information density. But our mission (preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture) doesn’t distinguish among media types. Sometimes an opportunity comes along outside of text. This is such a case.\n\nA while ago, we discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale. We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation.\n\nGenerally speaking, music is already fairly well preserved. There are many music enthusiasts in the world who digitized their CD and LP collections, shared them through torrents or other digital means, and meticulously catalogued them.\n\nHowever, these existing efforts have some major issues:\n\nThis Spotify scrape is our humble attempt to start such a “preservation archive” for music. Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start.\n\nBefore we dive into the details of this collection, here is a quick overview:\n\nThe data will be released in different stages on our Torrents page:\n\nFor now this is a torrents-only archive aimed at preservation, but if there is enough interest, we could add downloading of individual files to Anna’s Archive. Please let us know if you’d like this.\n\nPlease help preserve these files:\n\nWith your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes.\n\nIn this blog we will analyze the data and look at details of the release. We hope you enjoy.\n\n— Volunteer “ez” of Anna’s Archive team\n\nLet’s dive into the data! Here's some high-level statistics pulled from the metadata:\n\nSpotify has around 256 million tracks.\n\nThe most convenient available way to sort songs on Spotify is using the popularity metric, defined as follows:\n\nThe popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.\n\nGenerally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity.\n\nIf we group songs by popularity, we see that there is an extremely large tail end:\n\n≥70% of songs are ones almost no one ever listens to (stream count < 1000). To see some detail, we can plot this on a logarithmic scale:\n\nThe top 10,000 songs span popularities 70-100. You can view them all in this HTML file (13.8MB gzipped).\n\nAdditionally, we can estimate the number of listens per track and total number per popularity. The stream count data is estimated since it is difficult to fetch at scale, so we sampled it randomly.\n\nAs we can see, most of the listens come from songs with a popularity between 50 and 80, even though there's only 210.000 songs with popularity ≥50, around 0.1% of songs. Note the huge (subjectively estimated) error bar on pop=0 — the reason for this is that Spotify does not publish stream counts for songs with < 1000 streams.\n\nWe can also estimate that the top three songs (as of writing) have a higher total stream count than the bottom 20-100 million songs combined:\n\nNote that the popularity is very time-dependent and not directly translatable into stream counts, so these top songs are basically arbitrary.\n\nWe have archived around 86 million songs from Spotify, ordering by popularity descending. While this only represents 37% of songs, it represents around 99.6% of listens:\n\nPut another way, for any random song a person listens to, there is a 99.6% likelihood that it is part of the archive. We expect this number to be higher if you filter to only human-created songs. Do remember though that the error bar on listens for popularity 0 is large.\n\nFor popularity=0, we ordered tracks by a secondary importance metric based on artist followers and album popularity, and fetched in descending order.\n\nWe have stopped here due to the long tail end with diminishing returns (700TB+ additional storage for minor benefit), as well as the bad quality of songs with popularity=0 (many AI generated, hard to filter).\n\nBefore diving into more fun stats, let’s look at how the collection itself is structured. It’s in two parts: metadata and music files, both of which are distributed through torrents.\n\nThe metadata torrents contain, based on statistical analysis, around 99.9% of artists, albums, tracks. The metadata is published as compact queryable SQLite databases. Care was taken, by doing API response reconstruction, that there is (almost) no data loss in the conversion from the API JSON.\n\nThe metadata for artists, albums, tracks is less than 200 GB compressed. The secondary metadata of audio analysis is 4TB compressed.\n\nWe look at more detail at the structure of the metadata at the end of this blog post.\n\nThe data itself is distributed in the Anna’s Archive Containers (AAC) format. This is a standard which we created a few years ago for distributing files across multiple torrents. It is not to be confused with the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoding format.\n\nSince the original files contain zero metadata, as much metadata as possible was added to the OGG files, including title, url, ISRC, UPC, album art, replaygain information, etc. The invalid OGG data packet Spotify prepends to every track file was stripped — it is present in the track_files db.\n\nFor popularity>0, the quality is the original OGG Vorbis at 160kbit/s. Metadata was added without reencoding the audio (and an archive of diff files is available to reconstruct the original files from Spotify).\n\nFor popularity=0, the audio is reencoded to OGG Opus at 75kbit/s — sounding the same to most people, but noticeable to an expert.\n\nThere is a known bug where the REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK vorbiscomment tag value is a copy-paste of REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN instead of the correct value for many files.\n\nMany people complain about how Spotify shuffles tracks. Since we have metadata for 99.9+% of tracks on Spotify, we can create a true shuffle across all songs on Spotify!\n\nWe're curious about the peaks at whole minutes (particularly 2:00, 3:00, 4:00). If you know why this is, please let us know!\n\nSome songs, especially popular songs, have 2, 3, or even 20 different versions. We can quantify this by counting number of songs per ISRC:\n\nEach song on Spotify is only available on a specific set of markets. Most songs are available on most markets, but if we filter to popular songs, you can see a difference in availability (without filtering, the graph is almost flat):\n\nSpotify provides a list of genres per artist (not per song). If we count the artists for each genre, we get this result:\n\nSince each genre is very specific, we can also group genres and count the results:\n\nWe can also group artists by popularity. The resulting graph looks very similar to the tracks popularity graph:\n\nThe same graph for albums also looks the same.\n\nIf we group albums by release year, we see that more and more new music is added to Spotify, a lot of it likely automatically generated:\n\nThe amount of procedurally and AI generated content makes it hard to find what is actually valuable.\n\nYou can see that most songs on Spotify are singles, not part of an album.\n\nWe also scraped audio features generated by Spotify. They can be analyzed to find interesting trends.\n\nThis chart contains a lot of information. You can for example see that loudness correlates with energy and that BPM is normally distributed with a mean around 120.\n\nA scrape of the three main APIs of Spotify: artists, albums, tracks. Each track exists in exactly one album, but each track and each album can have multiple artists.\n\nThe tables are an almost lossless representation of Spotify API JSON responses, care was taken during creation by always reconstructing the original JSON based on each inserted row, with minor exceptions.\n\nA scrape of AudioFeatures objects from the Spotify API. One row per track.\n\nA scrape of Playlist objects from the Spotify API. Requires the spotify_clean.sqlite3 database to map track_rowid to track_id.\n\nMost playlists with < 1000 followers were excluded. Completeness unknown.\n\nRow count: 6.6 million playlists with 1.7 billion playlist tracks.\n\nThis is an almost lossless representation of the original Spotify API response. JSON reconstruction was tested during creation of all tables, with minor exceptions. For example, the original response JSON for playlists can be reconstructed with code similar to the following:\n\nThe link between the tracks table in spotify_clean and the actual files we have.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audiobooks on Spotify. Contains around 700 thousand rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audiobook chapters on Spotify. Contains around 20 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for shows (podcasts) on Spotify. Contains around 5 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for (podcast) episodes on Spotify. Contains around 54 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRedirect responses for the artist endpoint.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audio analysis on Spotify.\n Contains around 40 million rows, fetched in descending priority order. Many songs do not have an audio analysis (404). Incomplete.\n\nAlbum art files. Correspond to last part of url from album_images. Indexed into directories with filename prefixes (after stripping the first 16 chars from the filename).",

    "description": "Alex Yang details founding an AI startup with other high schoolers worldwide to improve Alzheimer's diagnostics.",
    "fullText": "My typical morning starts around 3 a.m. I'm instantly met with Messenger notifications from web developers in California, GitHub pings from Florida, and a running document of research papers to read sent from Michigan. By 7:50 a.m. I'm off to class to live my life as an 18-year-old high school senior in Seoul.\n\nThis solitary ritual has become my strange normal after I founded an AI research and development startup with people all around the world, whom I've never met in person. My ambition was to improve Alzheimer's diagnostics, but I had no network, so I built one online.\n\nGrowing up, I heard stories about various family members battling Alzheimer's. I viewed the disease as something truly terrifying, which leaves behind only the shell of who someone once was.\n\nI'd grown up knowing that someday, someone I love might disappear while still standing in front of me. In high school, this fear crystallized into something beyond passive acceptance.\n\nI came across this competition, looking to fund ideas that can make health more accessible, and decided to apply.\n\nI knew I couldn't do the work alone. I had to find people beyond my network with diverse perspectives and skills capable of building something real together.\n\nI started searching for partners by spending my time on internet forums and pitching my vision. I posted detailed research proposals on Discord servers and created GitHub repositories with preliminary code.\n\nAfter a month of \"nos,\" I got one \"yes\" from California. Then Florida. Then Michigan. Until there were six of us. We named ourselves Reteena (pronounced like \"retina\"), a deliberate wordplay symbolizing our mission to bring new vision to Alzheimer's diagnostics.\n\nWe became something none of us expected: a team of high schoolers from around the world who genuinely believed we could fix Alzheimer's.\n\nI didn't set out to target only high schoolers, but I was on servers mainly for students, and those were the people who responded.\n\nWe've been self-funded and started by conducting research on enhancing the image resolution of low-field MRI, which is a portable and more economically accessible MRI machine. We applied machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance the quality of low-field MRI scans.\n\nOur goal was radical — to make Alzheimer's diagnostics accessible and affordable for underserved communities by making low-field MRI more reliable. Conducting research together, I realized that my abstract dream had become reality, but reality proved far more demanding than any dream.\n\nI staggered under the crushing weight of the time and dedication that my team was giving. The time zone difference was not an excuse for me to make them wait for responses. Lying awake at night, my stomach knotted with anxiety about \"what should I do next,\" I recognized that my wrong decision could waste months of work from people who believed in me.\n\nDuring those suffocating moments, when doubt was a physical pain in my chest, I'd question everything: my abilities, our direction, and whether I was worthy of the faith my team placed in me.\n\nGradually, my leadership improved, and doubts faded when I stopped seeing our differences as obstacles and started viewing them as strengths. I created a \"follow-the-sun\" workflow where I completed tasks before people in the states woke up, with detailed handoff documents in shared Notion workspaces. We were asynchronous, yet somehow more connected.\n\nWhen our first piece of research was published in the IEEE BigData 2024 Conference, a prestigious annual conference for artificial intelligence research, I felt exhilarated. It was proof that we were onto something and justification for every late night. Yet it was only the beginning.\n\nWe expanded from a six-person group chat into an unconventional startup with 12 members. Over the next nine months, we conducted additional Alzheimer's research and presented our findings on how changes in speech patterns and genetic markers could aid in detecting the disease earlier than traditional methods.\n\nAs people who met on the internet, we've also made our growth transparent on the internet, sharing our journey on LinkedIn. By posting our product-building journey and sharing the authentic rationale behind our research and products, we connected with mentors who believed in what we were doing — Y Combinator founders, Pear VC partners, and researchers who took us seriously despite our age.\n\nWe even started receiving messages from students across different countries asking for advice on starting their own health tech projects.\n\nMost recently, we launched our first consumer product, Remembrance, an AI therapeutic service to try to help Alzheimer's patients reconnect with their past. It works by asking gentle questions designed to trigger old memories through reminiscence therapy.\n\nEach recalled memory is automatically organized in knowledge graph databases, making it easy to revisit and build a personal memory repository. Over time, it can suggest related memories on demand, building a personalized memory archive.\n\nThe healthcare market is impenetrable in many ways. When we attempted to approach a local hospital to test our product using actual patient data, we were immediately halted by compliance requirements and institutional review boards.\n\nWe've spent two years discovering that building something in healthcare is harder than we thought. But I wouldn't change it because we learned that at 17 and 18, not at 25 when the stakes feel higher and the fear feels heavier.\n\nReteena might not end up as we imagined, but that's OK. The point was never the destination; it was about learning how to build, understanding that authentic problems matter more than viral success, and realizing you can inspire people by simply trying.\n\nThat's the real experiment. And it's worth every sleepless night.",

    "description": "\"There is larger uncertainty.\"",
    "fullText": "Researchers have introduced a new temperature dataset that incorporates nearly seven more decades of climate data. Scientists said this more complete picture of our world's climate could reshape how we understand the total human impact on our planet's climate system.\n\n\"It changes our perception of how far we have already pushed the climate system in important ways,\" Peter Thorne, a Maynooth University professor and ICARUS Climate Research Centre director, told CNN.\n\nThe groundbreaking temperature dataset was recently released by a team of scientists based in the United Kingdom. It incorporates climate data dating back to 1781, further into the past than most conventional datasets. Scientists usually measure modern climate change using datasets that begin in 1850, the benchmark behind estimates of nearly 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming.\n\nThe new dataset, referred to as GloSAT, indicates that heat-trapping gases rose by 2.5% between 1750 and 1850, possibly responsible for more warming than previously thought. GloSAT suggests humans are responsible for 0.09 degrees Celsius of warming over the 100-year period.\n\nA second study published last month in the Institute of Physics journal Environmental Research Letters estimates that an additional 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius of warming was caused by early increases in carbon dioxide.\n\n\"Climate simulations of the industrial era typically start in 1850, using the first 50 years as a baseline for 'preindustrial' climate,\" according to the authors of the study. \"However, the period immediately prior to 1850 is of particular interest due to early human influence and heightened volcanic activity, the latter of which led to cooler global temperatures than those observed in the subsequent historical period.\"\n\n\"As the authors themselves make clear, there is larger uncertainty prior to 1850,\" commented Thorne. \"But it is cooler; it's undoubtedly cooler.\" The climate scientist cautions that we need to carefully consider the implications of these findings.\n\nGloSAT indicates the planet was far cooler from the late 1700s through 1849 than during the 1850-1900 preindustrial baseline, in part due to cooling from two major early-1800s volcanic eruptions.\n\nWhile the data shows more warming than once thought, scientists said it doesn't alter climate targets or hasten expected impacts.\n\n\"It does mean we warmed the Earth more, but it doesn't mean the impacts are suddenly going to occur sooner,\" Thorne added, per CNN. \"They are where they are. And they've almost invariably been calculated relative to a much more recent reference period.\"\n\nIn Thorne's view, the research fits into a broader picture that points to rising concern over worsening impacts. \"It changes our perception of how far we have already pushed the climate system in important ways,\" he explained.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's global climate report uses the conventional 176-year record that begins in 1850. The agency's global climate report for November revealed that with an average temperature of 1.18 degrees Celsius (2.12 Fahrenheit) above average for the first 11 months of this year, there is a 99.9% chance that 2025 will rank among the five warmest years on record.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Japanese authorities have approved a decision to restart the world’s biggest nuclear power plant, which has sat dormant for more than a decade following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, in a pivotal moment as the country looks to looks to shift its energy supply away from fossil fuels.\n\nDespite nerves from many local residents, the Niigata prefectural assembly, home to the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, approved a bill on Monday that clears the way for utility company Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) to restart one of the plant’s seven reactors.\n\nThe company plans to bring the No. 6 reactor back online around January 20, Japan’s public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nJapan has taken a cautious approach to nuclear energy since a massive 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami in 2011 triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. It was the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\nFollowing the disaster, Japan shut down all 54 of its nuclear power stations including Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, which sits in the coastal and port region of Niigata about 320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Tokyo on Japan’s main island of Honshu.\n\nJapan has since restarted 14 of the 33 nuclear reactors that remain operable, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n\nThe Niigata plant will be the first to reopen under the operation of TEPCO, the company that ran the Fukushima Daiichi power station. It has been trying to reassure residents of the restart plan is safe.\n\n“We remain firmly committed to never repeating such an accident and ensuring Niigata residents never experience anything similar,” said TEPCO spokesperson Masakatsu Takata, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nBefore the Fukushima disaster, Japan’s nuclear reactors had provided around 30% of the country’s electricity. Since then, Japan has increased its reliance on costly imported fossil fuels, including coal and gas, to power the country and keep the lights on.\n\nAbout 60–70% of Japan’s power generation comes from imported fossil fuels, which cost the country about 10.7 trillion yen ($68 billion) last year alone.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office two months ago, is a strong proponent of nuclear power and has pushed to revive the crippled industry to drive down costs, and tackle inflation and a stagnant economy.\n\nJapan is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, after China, the United States, India and Russia, according to the International Energy Agency. But it has committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and renewable energy was at the center of its latest energy plan published earlier this year, with a push for greater investments in solar and wind.\n\nThe country’s energy demands are also expected to increase in the coming years due to a boom in energy-hungry data centers that power AI infrastructure.\n\nTo achieve its energy and climate goals, Japan aims to double the share of nuclear power in its electricity mix to 20% by 2040.\n\nBut the memory of the Fukushima disaster endures, and some local residents are wary of reviving nuclear power due to safety concerns.\n\n“We know firsthand the risk of a nuclear accident and cannot dismiss it,” Ayako Oga, 52, told Reuters. Oga had settled in Niigata after fleeing the Fukushima disaster. She told the news agency that her old home was inside the exclusion zone and she still struggles with post-traumatic stress-like symptoms.\n\nA survey published by the Niigata prefecture in October found 60% of residents did not think conditions for the restart had been met. Nearly 70% were worried about TEPCO operating the plant, Reuters reported.\n\nOn its website, TEPCO said Kashiwazaki-Kariwa had undergone multiple inspections and upgrades and that the company had learned “the lessons of Fukushima.”\n\nThe company said new seawalls and watertight doors would provide “stronger protection against tsunamis” and that mobile generators and more fire trucks would be on hand for “cooling support” in an emergency. It also said the plant now had “upgraded filtering systems designed to control the spread of radioactive materials.”\n\nIn late October, TEPCO conducted “a full round of integrity checks” at Unit 6 and declared the reactor fit for startup.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - A revamp of China's electricity market is boosting the economics of storing power just as international demand surges, sparking a boom for the Chinese energy storage manufacturers that already dominate globally.\n\nChinese firms are on track for a 75% jump this year in global shipments of lithium-ion battery cells for energy storage, ​according to one estimate.\n\nThey have exported more than $65 billion worth of storage and electric-vehicle batteries this year, cementing their dominance in a sector vital to backing up wind and solar ‌and keeping power coursing through artificial-intelligence data centres.\n\nThe surge in sales is driven by data centres and renewables domestically, as well as by Chinese reforms and subsidies that are boosting general demand for energy storage. International demand is rising in tandem with the ‌surging growth in data centres, a need to back up Europe's ageing grid and China's burgeoning renewable energy business in the Middle East, analysts say.\n\n\"These leading energy storage cell makers, they have full orders. Many of them are basically working double shifts now to try and meet demand,\" said analyst Cosimo Ries at policy research firm Trivium China. The boom \"is one of the biggest surprises of the year, I think, in China's energy space.\"\n\nUBS last month raised its 2026 forecast for global battery-energy storage installations by 25%.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts global investment in battery storage facilities will rise 16% this year to $66 billion. Much of that is ⁠set to be captured by Chinese firms because while Tesla is number ‌one in energy storage systems, China dominates production of the tiny cells inside them.\n\nAll of the six top global cell suppliers - Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), HiTHIUM, EVE Energy, BYD, CALB and REPT BATTERO - are Chinese, according to a January-to-September ranking by consultancy Infolink. Of the top 10, only Japan's AESC is not from China.\n\nEVE's ‍energy storage sales volumes rose 35.51% in the first three quarters from the same period last year. REPT BATTERO's third-quarter shipments of all batteries set a record high. Top EV players CATL and BYD did not break out energy storage shipments through the third quarter. Storage has historically made up less of their revenue than automotive batteries and EVs, although the proportion is growing.\n\n\"Pairing solar with storage has effectively become the only solution for meeting U.S. AI ​data-centre power needs,\" UBS analyst Yishu Yan told a media briefing. \"U.S. AI data centre power demand is very robust, but power is the biggest bottleneck, and U.S. baseload power - gas, nuclear, thermal - they ‌won't grow much in the next five years.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has fueled new speculation about his health after an awkward descent on Air Force One’s stairs.\n\nA video of the 79-year-old president exiting the plane at Palm Beach International Airport on Saturday morning, posted by MAGA influencer Paul Villarreal, has drawn attention online for Trump’s odd hand movement and slow, careful descent.\n\nIn the video, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs. He cautiously navigates the steps while gripping tightly onto the railing, taking about 18 seconds to reach the bottom of the short staircase.\n\nPresident Trump exited Air Force One tonight in West Palm Beach. He is headed to Mar-a-Lago.\n. pic.twitter.com/Z4vBY8qobw\n\n— Paul Villarreal (AKA Vince Manfeld) (@AureliusStoic1) December 20, 2025\n\nHe then plops into “The Beast,” the heavily armored presidential car, where he is seen drinking what appears to be a Diet Coke. Trump is spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nCritics online were quick to note the president’s apparent frailty and peculiar leg-slapping.\n\n“Tapping that leg to make sure it works going down,” one X user commented.\n\nAnother wrote, “I wish he concentrated on the economy like he concentrated on going down those stairs.”\n\nOne person hypothesized about his hand motions, “It is not his leg he is touching, but he is trying to get life back into his hand.”\n\nThe elderly president’s supporters defended him, however, with many pointing out that Trump had just wrapped up a long day, including a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n\nTrump—who was filmed stumbling on Air Force One’s stairs during a visit to New Jersey in June this year—has frequently spoken about being “very careful” about walking down stairs to avoid the perils of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n“I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs like these stairs—I walk very slowly,“ Trump said while addressing the nation’s top generals in September.\n\nA few days later, he brought up the subject again while taking shots at Biden during a speech to Navy sailors.\n\n“We had a horrible, horrible president who had no clue what the hell was happening. The chances of him walking down those stairs successfully were not good,” he said. “And I have to be careful because one day I’m gonna probably fall.”\n\nThe commander-in-chief then revealed what he apparently tells himself while walking down stairs: “I always say, ‘Walk down the steps nice and slowly.’ You ever notice? I don’t have to bop down the stairs. ‘Walk nice and slowly.’”\n\nQuestions around Trump’s health have dogged him in his second term, particularly after he let slip that he had undergone an MRI scan in October.\n\nThe White House eventually said it was a “preventative” look at his heart and abdomen, a claim met with skepticism from medical experts who stressed that there was “nothing standard” about the scan.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "Researchers warn generative tools are helping militant groups from neo-Nazis to the Islamic State spread ideology\n\nWhile the artificial intelligence boom is upending sections of the music industry, voice generating bots are also becoming a boon to another unlikely corner of the internet: extremist movements that are using them to recreate the voices and speeches of major figures in their milieu, and experts say it is helping them grow.\n\n“The adoption of AI-enabled translation by terrorists and extremists marks a significant evolution in digital propaganda strategies,” said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. Webber specializes in monitoring the online tools of terrorist groups and extremists around the world.\n\n“Earlier methods relied on human translators or rudimentary machine translation, often limited by language fidelity and stylistic nuance,” he said. “Now, with the rise of advanced generative AI tools, these groups are able to produce seamless, contextually accurate translations that preserve tone, emotion, and ideological intensity across multiple languages.”\n\nOn the neo-Nazi far-right, adoption of AI-voice cloning software has already become particularly prolific, with several English-language versions of Adolf Hitler’s speeches garnering tens of millions of streams across X, Instagram, TikTok, and other apps.\n\nAccording to a recent research post by the Global Network on Extremism and Technology (GNet), extremist content creators have turned to voice cloning services, specifically ElevenLabs, and feed them archival speeches from the era of the Third Reich, which are then processed into mimicking Hitler in English.\n\nNeo-Nazi accelerationists, the kinds who plot acts of terrorism against western governments to provoke a societal collapse, have also turned to these tools to spread more updated versions of their hyper-violent messaging. For example, Siege, an insurgency manual written by American neo-Nazi and proscribed terrorist James Mason that became the veritable bible to organizations like the Base and the now-defunct Atomwaffen Division, was transformed into an audiobook in late November.\n\n“For the last several months I have been involved in making an audiobook of Siege by James Mason,” said a prominent neo-Nazi influencer with a heavy presence on X and Telegram, who stitched together the audiobook with the help of AI tools.\n\n“Using a custom voice model of Mason, I re-created every newsletter and most of the attached newspaper clippings as in the original published newsletters.”\n\nThe influencer lauded the power of having Mason’s writing from “pre-internet America” and turning it into a modern-day voice.\n\n“But to hear the startling accuracy of predictions made through the early eighties really puts a milestone on the road and it changed my view of our shared cause on a fundamental level,” he said.\n\nAt its height in 2020, the Base held a book club on Siege, which was an instrumental influence on several members who discussed its benefits in a hypothetical war against the US government. A nationwide FBI counterterrorism probe eventually swept up over a dozen of its members on various terrorism related charges in the same year.\n\n“The creator of the audiobook has previously released similar AI content; however, Siege has a more notorious history,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, “due to its cultlike status among some in the online extreme right, promotion of lone actor violence, and being required reading by several neo-Nazi groups that openly endorse terrorism and whose members have committed violent criminal acts”.\n\nWebber says pro-Islamic State media outlets on encrypted networks are currently and actively “using AI to create text-to-speech renditions of ideological content from official publications”, to supercharge the spread of their messaging by transforming “text-based propaganda into engaging multimedia narratives”.\n\nJihadist terrorist groups have found utility in AI for translations of extremist teachings from Arabic into easily digestible, multilingual content. In the past, American-imam turned al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki, would personally have to voice English lectures for recruitment propaganda in the anglosphere. The CIA and FBI have repeatedly cited the influence of al-Awlaki’s voice as a key contagion in the spread of al-Qaeda’s message.\n\nOn Rocket.Chat – the preferred communications platform of the Islamic State, which it uses to communicate with its followers and recruits – a user posted a video clip in October with slick graphics and Japanese subtitling, remarking on the difficulties of doing that without the advent of AI.\n\n“Japanese would be an extremely hard language to translate from its original state to English while keeping its eloquence,” said the pro-Islamic State user. “It should be known that I do not use artificial intelligence for any related media, with some exceptions regarding audio.”\n\nSo far, not just the Islamic State, but groups across the ideological spectrum, have begun using free AI applications, namely OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to amplify their overall activities. The Base and adjacent groups have used it for the creation of imagery, while also acknowledging, as far back as 2023, the use of these tools to streamline planning and researching.\n\nCounterterrorism authorities have always viewed the internet and technological advancements as a persistent game of catch-up when it comes to keeping pace with the terror groups who exploit them. Already the Base, the Islamic State and other extremists have leveraged emergent technologies like crypto to anonymously fundraise and share files for 3D printed firearms.",

    "description": "Cameron Kirkconnell went from spearfishing and guiding for the wealthy to buying and selling yachts for them.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Cameron Kirkconnell, a world-record spearfisher who works as a yacht broker with Ikonic Yachts, based in Miami. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was really young, somebody asked me what I wanted to do for a living, and I said, \"I want to fish and hunt.\" My father was a lawyer, and my whole extended family is lawyers. Before that, everybody had been ship captains.\n\nAfter I got out of the Maritime Academy, I started working on the ships. I have the absolute highest license you can get, so I can captain anything in the world. I worked on oil tankers, oil drilling, break bulk, cargo ships, container ships, and some military contracts.\n\nI love spearfishing, so I got very good at that and was traveling a lot during my time off. In the early 2000s, we had forums, so we'd meet people around the world and travel and spearfish together. I ended up working for one of the biggest spearfishing companies in the world, designing gear. It created this incredible network around the world. My aunt told me when I was in my teens that if I could ever figure out how to make money by networking, I'd do very well.\n\nI had an opportunity to start guiding spearfishing about 13 or 14 years ago, and that just took off. My initial niche was the finance world. Everybody that I work with is very successful and at the absolute pinnacle of whatever business it is. The allure of spearfishing is that when you're doing it, there's nothing else you can think about.\n\nThe way we do spearfishing is breath-hold diving. So we hold our breath, and we go down, and we try to shoot fish, and then we bring them back to the surface. The base of the partnership with a dive buddy is that trust with them. Because if you and I are in the water together, you're there to make sure nothing happens to me, and I'm there to make sure nothing happens to you.\n\nMy clients told me they wanted me to start buying and selling their boats. They said I know more about boats than anyone they've ever met, and that they literally trust me with their lives. I can't tell you how many of the boats that I buy, the clients never step foot on until it's bought, because they trust me that much.\n\nI'm very decisive, and I'm very confident in my abilities because of all of the years leading up to it and understanding the personalities and the people that I'm working with. Being able to mesh that with picking the right boat and seeing the right deal out of a hundred is pretty unique.\n\nThere are surprising similarities between spearfishing and yacht brokerage. The ultimate satisfaction from guiding spearfishing is at the end of the day, you get a high five or a hug from the client and your buddy. With brokerage, when you finally get the right boat, and they say, \"You were right, this is amazing, thank you.\" I'm also not trying to act any differently or change who I am. When I first got into this, I bought two suits, and I have not worn either of them once.\n\nPeople ask how to become a yacht broker. I could never have planned the path that I have taken. But I would say get as much experience as possible across the board. Start at the bottom, scrubbing decks. It's all about relationships.\n\nThe relationships are the most valuable asset that I have, and you're not just going to cold call people and get that. Life's too short not to do cool stuff and to be surrounded by good people. Treat people fairly, keep it simple, stay transparent, and genuinely look out for others, not just yourself.",

In fact, we'll have much more,\" Galli told Italian news agency Ansa.\n\n\"It was necessary to replace a valve, but it was done within the timeframe, and all the snow guns have been operating for a few evenings.\n\n\"We're doing well, for Livigno and for Italy. And in the next few days, temperatures will drop further, even to 20 below zero, so I'm not at all worried.\"",

    "description": "President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. But it has come at a steep cost: as he enters the New Year and midterm elections loom, his once unshakeable hold on Republicans is slipping, say historians ​and analysts.\n\nBack in January, as Trump triumphantly returned to the White House for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much ‌of U.S. cultural life. He delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.\n\nLike all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the inevitable waning of power in his second ‌year. But he also begins the New Year with an erosion in political support.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are rebelling, and opinion polls show a growing number of voters are unhappy with the high cost of living, an aggressive immigration crackdown and a sense that Trump has pushed the boundaries of presidential power too far.\n\nTrump's approval rating slipped to 39% in recent days to nearly its lowest level of his current term as Republican voters soured on his handling of the economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nNow, Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, threatening Trump's domestic agenda and raising the ⁠specter of a third impeachment by Democrats if they win control ‌of the House of Representatives.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said lowering inflation - which he blamed on former Democratic President Joe Biden - has been a priority for Trump since his first day back in office.\n\n\"Much work remains,\" Desai said, adding that Trump and his administration will continue to focus on the issue.\n\nMOST ‍POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s\n\nIn his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce, dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.\n\nHe has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies, canceled or restricted access to some ​vaccines, and attacked universities, law firms and media outlets.\n\nDespite promising to end the Ukraine war on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace ‌deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.\n\nAll modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.\n\nThe conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.\n\n\"Donald Trump has wielded power with fewer restraints in the last 11 months than any president since Franklin Roosevelt,\" said presidential historian Timothy Naftali.\n\nIn ⁠the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, ​which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support ​for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.\n\nAnalysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with rising living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.\n\nTrump hit the road this month ‍to promote his economic agenda and kick off ⁠what aides say will be multiple speeches next year to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.\n\nBut his meandering 90-minute address to supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month - in which he riffed on a range of subjects unrelated to the economy and derided the issue ⁠of \"affordability\" as a Democratic \"hoax\" - alarmed some Republican strategists.\n\nA Republican with close ties to the White House conceded that Trump faces headwinds on the economy heading into the New Year and the public mood on the rising cost of living has \"become ‌a persistent drag.\"\n\n\"We have to remind voters they need to give the president a full four years,\" said the Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity to more ‌freely discuss internal discussions.",

    "fullText": "When you grow up Jewish, Santa Claus seems a bit absurd.\n\nI mean, religion requires faith, but believing that a magical old man brought toys to all the Christian kids in the world, riding a flying sleigh, seemed like something most kids would be skeptical of.\n\nIn reality, however, many kids believe until a certain age, and others go along with the ritual because it involves getting presents on Christmas morning.\n\nPart of the Santa Claus ritual has always been getting pictures taken with Jolly Old Saint Nick, sitting on his lap, and telling him what you want for Christmas.\n\nSome kids do that in privately booked photo shoots, while many others head for the mall.\n\nI think most kids know that the mall Santa is more an emissary of the big man than the actual man himself. Still, parents take their kids to meet him, the kids either cry hysterically, or get their pictures taken and gift choices noted before moving on.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nFor about 80 years, for people living in San Francisco, that tradition meant taking their children to Macy's Union Square. It was a time-honored tradition that has lasted for generations, but this year, it won't be happening.\n\nSanta Claus, at least for San Franciscans who enjoy visiting him at Macy's Union Square, won't be coming to town, it seems.\n\nMacy's has quietly ended its tradition of having Santa Claus head from its Thanksgiving Day Parade to its store in Union Square, San Francisco.\n\nThe chain explained that decision in a way that suggests it did not have the option of hiring multiple Santas to visit different stores.\n\n“This year, Macy’s Santa will not be available at our Union Square location. Instead, he will be going on a national tour to visit stores and communities he hasn’t had a chance to appear in before, following his national arrival at the (New York) Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade,” Macy’s officials said in a statement reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nMacy's added that the holiday season magic will continue in Union Square with its SF SPCA Holiday Windows and Macy's Great Tree presented by Ripple.\n\n\"It seems weird without Santa Claus,\" Yvonne Fletcher and her husband, Adrian, told Yahoo News. \"I can't bring my grandkids, and that's what we were waiting for.\"\n\nAbout an 80-year tradition: Santa appeared annually at Macy’s Union Square store, dating back to the store’s opening in the late 1940s and continuing nearly every year until 2025 (excluding the pandemic year), according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nLocal cultural touchstone: Families lined up for visits and photos with Santa each holiday season, making it a cherished Bay Area tradition, the San Francisco Chronicle added.\n\nSame Santa for decades: From roughly 1990 to 2010, the role was played by the beloved “Santa John,” whose appearance became iconic in local family photos, reported Hoodline.\n\nNo Santa in 2025: For the first time in nearly 80 years, Macy’s confirmed Santa won’t be at Union Square this holiday season as he embarks on a national tour after the Thanksgiving parade, shared ABC7 San Francisco.",

    "fullText": "World War II Navy veteran Ira “Ike” Schab, one of the dwindling number of survivors of the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 105.\n\nDaughter Kimberlee Heinrichs told The Associated Press that Schab died at home early Saturday in the presence of her and her husband.\n\nWith his passing, there remain only about a dozen survivors of the surprise attack, which killed just over 2,400 troops and propelled the United States into the war.\n\nSchab was a sailor of just 21 at the time of the attack, and for decades he rarely spoke about the experience.\n\nBut in recent years, aware that the corps of survivors was dwindling, the centenarian made a point of traveling from his home in Beaverton, Oregon, to the annual observance at the Hawaii military base.\n\n“To pay honor to the guys that didn’t make it,” he said in 2023.\n\nFor last year's commemoration, Schab spent weeks building up the strength to be able to stand and salute.\n\nBut this year he did not feel well enough to attend, and less than three weeks later, he passed away.\n\nBorn on Independence Day in 1920 in Chicago, Schab was the eldest of three brothers.\n\nHe joined the Navy at 18, following in the footsteps of his father, he said in a February interview for Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nOn what began as a peaceful Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, Schab, who played the tuba in the USS Dobbin’s band, was expecting a visit from his brother, a fellow service member assigned to a nearby naval radio station. Schab had just showered and donned a clean uniform when he heard a call for fire rescue.\n\nHe went topside and saw another ship, the USS Utah, capsizing. Japanese planes roared through the air.\n\n“We were pretty startled. Startled and scared to death,” Schab recalled in 2023. “We didn’t know what to expect, and we knew that if anything happened to us, that would be it.”\n\nHe scurried back below deck to grab boxes of ammunition and joined a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun above.\n\nHis ship lost three sailors, according to Navy records. One was killed in action, and two died later of fragment wounds from a bomb that struck the stern. All had been manning an anti-aircraft gun.\n\nSchab spent most of the war with the Navy in the Pacific, going to the New Hebrides, now known as Vanuatu, and then the Mariana Islands and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nAfter the war he studied aerospace engineering and worked on the Apollo spaceflight program as an electrical engineer for General Dynamics, helping send astronauts to the moon.\n\nSchab's son also joined the Navy and is a retired commander.\n\nSpeaking at a 2022 ceremony, Schab asked people to honor those who served at Pearl Harbor.\n\n“Remember what they’re here for. Remember and honor those that are left. They did a hell of a job,” he said. “Those who are still here, dead or alive.”",

    "fullText": "American Lindsey Vonn claimed a podium spot for the third time in four World Cup races by finishing third in the downhill in Val d'Isere on Saturday.\n\nThe 41-year-old, who last week became the oldest downhill World Cup winner, clinched her 141st World Cup podium finish.\n\nVonn, who had not raced at the French Alps resort in eight years, crossed the line in one minute 41.89 seconds - 0.35secs behind winner Cornelia Huetter of Austria, with Kira Weidle-Winkelmann of Germany in second.\n\n\"I thought it was actually not bad,\" Vonn said. \"I skied well in the middle and then on the bottom I was carrying a lot of speed.\n\n\"With the light, I didn't quite see the terrain and I lost my balance. It cost me probably half a second or more, so I'm disappointed in myself for that mistake.\"\n\nVonn retired from the sport in February 2019 because of injury and made her competitive return in December 2024 following a partial knee replacement.\n\nWith 48 days to go until the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, which run from 6-22 February, Vonn will be hoping to add to the four World Cup titles she has gathered over a career that has spanned 20 years.\n\n\"I'm just happy that I hung on to the podium and the red [leader's] bib,\" added Vonn, who is now 69 points clear at the top of the overall downhill standings.\n\nShe already has one gold and two bronze Olympic medals to her name and is on track to represent the United States at the 2026 Games.\n\nSaturday's event was part of this season's World Cup campaign, with a total of nine races taking place before the Finals at Kvitfjell in Norway on 21 March 2026. The Val d'Isere leg concludes on Sunday with a super-G.",
